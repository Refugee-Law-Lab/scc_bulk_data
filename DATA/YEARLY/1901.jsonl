(2), c. 11, s. 27 (Ont.)\u2014Constitutional question \u2014 Indian lands \u2014 Legislative jurisdiction\u2014Costs.\nUnder the provisions of section 26, sub-sec. 3 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, leave to appeal direct from the final judgment of a divisional court of the High Court of Justice for Ontario may be granted in cases where there is a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and the fact that an important question of constitutional law is involved and that neither party would be satisfied with the judgment of the Court of Appeal, is sufficient ground for granting such leave.\nMotion on behalf of the plaintiff for leave to appeal direct from the judgment of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice for Ontario affirming the decision of the Chancellor dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThis action was commenced in the High Court of Justice for Ontario, and was tried before the Chancellor who delivered judgment dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs. Plaintiff thereupon appealed to the Queen's Bench Divisional Court where the appeal was dismissed with costs.\nOn the 11th of January, 1901, a motion was made before the Registrar on behalf of the plaintiffs for leave to appeal direct from the judgment of the Divisional Court to the Supreme Court of Canada upon the ground that the appeal involved questions of constitutional law between the Dominion of Canada and the province in regard to indian reserves which had been selected and laid aside under treaties entered into between the government of Canada and the indian tribes subsequent to the British North America Act (1867) and that any decision by the Court of Appeal (in the event of special leave being granted under 62 Vict. (2), ch. 11, sec. 27) would be unsatisfactory to either one or the other of the parties.\nThe motion was referred by the Registrar to a Judge in Chambers, and came on to be heard before His Lordship Mr. Justice Girouard on the 18th January, 1901.\nTravers Lewis for the motion.\nChrysler Q. C and Burbidge contra.\nAfter hearing the parties, the following judgment was pronounced by:\nGIROUARD J. (oral).\u2014It is clear from the material filed that a very important constitutional question is involved in the present appeal, namely, a question of jurisdiction between the Federal and Provincial Governments over certain Indian lands in the northwest part of Ontario. It is objected by the respondents that leave should not be granted inasmuch as the matters in dispute are determined by certain judgments of the Privy Council, particularly St. Catharines Milling Co. v. The Queen[1]. At this stage, it is impossible to tell, without knowing the particular facts of the case, how far the decisions of the Privy Council are applicable, but if the contention of the respondents be correct, they will suffer no prejudice by leave being granted, as this court is bound to follow the decisions of the Privy Council. It is deposed to, and not denied on the present application, that neither party would be satisfied with the judgment of the Court of Appeal in this matter.\nIn the report of Farquharson v. Imperial Oil Co.[2], which I saw for the first time when this application was made, I am said to have concurred in the dismissal of the appeal from the order made in Chambers. I presume that this means that I would not interfere with the discretion exercised by the learned judge who granted leave to appeal. I am supposed to have expressed no views upon the question of jurisdiction of the court to hear the appeal. But as I concurred in the judgment disposing of the merits of the case, I must be taken to have concurred with the view of the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Gwynne that there was jurisdiction in the Supreme Court to grant an appeal per saltum to this court from the Divisional Court of Ontario, notwithstanding the limitations placed by the Legislature of Ontario upon appeals from the Divisional Court, where the party desiring a further appeal had failed both in the Divisional Court and in the court below.\nLeave to appeal per saltum is therefore granted. The costs to be costs in the cause to the successful party.\nMotion allowed with costs.\n[1] 13 S. C. R. 577; 14 App. Cas. 46.\n[2] 30 S. C. R. 188.\n"}

The plaintiff brought an action for damages caused by this interference with his property. The trial judge gave judgment for the defendant, which was reversed by the Court of Appeal. The latter judgment decided that defendant had no right to trespass on plaintiff\u2019s water lots for the purpose of getting their ice to shore, and also, on an issue raised by defendant, that the bay at Jackson\u2019s Point was not a public harbour, and the patent to the plaintiff was, therefore, valid.\nMcPherson and Campbell for the appellant.\nMcDonald Q.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs for the reasons given in the judgment of Mr. Justice Moss in the Court of Appeal.\nTASCHEREAU J. was also of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I express no opinion whether the place in question consisting of twelve acres of land covered with the waters of Lake Simcoe was or was not a public harbour. But assuming the Letters Patent granted by the government of the province to be good, and concurring in the judgment of my brother King, I am of opinion that the acts of the defendants which are complained of by the plaintiff as constituting his cause of action were within the true intent and meaning of the special reservation in the Letters Patent \u201cof the free use, passage and enjoyment of the waters of the lake.\u201d It seems to be impossible to hold that under those Letters Patent the plaintiff has as he claims to have, and as the judgment appealed from, if it should be left to stand, would give him, the right to exclude save at his will and pleasure all commercial intercourse between other places across and along the lake and the Grand Trunk Railway terminus at the place in question during at least three months of the year when the waters of the lake are covered with ice and when commercial intercourse with the railway is carried on with greatest ease and convenience upon the ice in the lake while the waters of the lake so frozen over and rendered most conveniently travelled over in winter, are by force of the reservation in the Letters Patent kept open for the free use, passage and enjoyment of every person.\nThe appeal must therefore, in my opinion, be allowed with costs and the action dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed for the reasons stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice King.\nKING J.\u2014The question raised is one of considerable importance as affecting a growing business.\nThe facts shortly stated, are as follows:\nThe respondent claims to be owner, under a patent from the Government of Ontario, of certain water lots situate in a bay at Jackson\u2019s Point, in Lake Simcoe. The appellants in harvesting their ice on the navigable portion of the lake outside the bay, cut channels to float it to the shore where their ice-houses were. Respondents claimed to own the ice cut out for these channels and to have a right to cut it for their own profit.\nThe appellants, as a defence to the action for damages brought against them, alleged: First, that the bay in question was a public harbour and the property therein being in the Dominion Government the patent under which plaintiffs claimed was ultra vires. Secondly, if this was not so, that they had a right to use any reasonable means of getting their ice to shore. If the last contention should prevail consideration of the other point becomes unnecessary.\nThe judgment appealed from reversed the decision of the trial judge in favour of the appellants, holding that they had no right to cut the ice on the water lots, the bed of which belonged to the respondents under the patent, and that the bay was not a public harbour. Water turned into ice is, for the time being, changed in its nature by losing its fluidity, but the water underneath the frozen surface remains unaffected in its legal as in its physical character. By analogy, the solid ice becomes the property of the person owning the soil below it, and any one cutting or removing it without leave or a superior right is a trespasser.\nHere, the act of cutting is sought to be justified upon the ground that it was done in the exercise of the public right of navigation.\nNow as to this right, where it exists it is not extinguished by the operations of nature in converting the fluid into a solid, but the exercise of the right is rendered precarious. Reference, if necessary, might be made to the not uncommon cases in some latitudes where navigation is regularly carried on by the breaking or crushing of the ice, or by cutting a passage through it, or to the case of polar navigation. There is also, it is conceived, the clear right to use the frozen surface as incidental to the carrying on of an act of navigation. Thus a vessel prevented from access to the shore by the formation of ice might well be unladen at the outer margin of the ice, and cargo or passengers be transferred over the surface of the ice, or the ice might be broken or cut to admit of the vessel\u2019s passage. In such case it would probably be a question as to which mode was the more beneficial for the ship.\nThe right of the vessel owners so to seek access to the shore would apply equally to the owner of other floatable goods, as for instance, a raft or lot of logs or lumber in course of transportation.\nThe question then is: How is it with regard to the floating of ice severed from the mass for transportation shoreward?\nSupposing no claim on behalf of the Crown, ice cut in water, the bed of which is in the Crown, would become the property of him who had gathered it, and reduced it into possession as an article of personal property. After being cut it would be floating property, and might be transported to the shore by flotation if the means existed, and being transported by flotation for a commercial purpose, it is difficult to see why it is not in course of navigation as much as floating logs would be. There seems no valid reason why there should be a discrimination between different classes of personal property where the mode of transportation is the same.\nIt would not, indeed, be for the public interest to create a distinction whereby a useful (and as population increases an increasingly useful) commodity should be forced to become wholly lost through lack of facility for getting it to a place where it could be stored and preserved, which is open to other kinds of personal property dependent upon like means of transportation.\nThe material fact is that the ice when cut is floating property as much as logs floating in the same water.\nAt the same time the right of passing floating ice through a body of field ice is to be exercised, as all other rights, with due regard to the rights of others. The frost that created the ice seeking transportation also created the obstruction, and in so doing brought into existence other rights of property which equally with the first are entitled to consideration.\nThe pathway is therefore to be as direct as practicable and of no greater width than is reasonably necessary. It is manifest that, if properly done, the cutting of the inshore ice for a passage would ordinarily be advantageous to the owner of it in case he desired to make beneficial use of it as a commodity, as enabling him at a less expense to gather his own crop of ice.\nUpon the facts, it does not appear that more damage was occasioned by the plaintiff\u2019s operation than was reasonably incidental to it.\nThe case, as said at the beginning, is important as affecting an industry of considerable importance, and because of its presenting a new class of circumstances. It is satisfactory that it is capable of solution by the application of principles which, although framed in contemplation of different classes of facts, are wide enough to cover the new circumstances here presented. It is also satisfactory that the result advances the interests of trade, one of the main purposes of law.\nIt becomes unnecessary, in the view taken, to pass upon the question raised as to whether the locality in question was part of a public harbour or not.\nIf the above view is to be maintained the appeal is to be allowed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McPherson, Clark, Campbell & Jarvis.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Kerr, MacDonald, Davidson & Patterson.\n[1] 26 Ont.

App. R. 232) that the principal sum of $20,000 becoming due for non-payment under the first of the above provisos was not an instalment in arrear under the second on which the mortgagee was entitled to interest at the rate of nine per cent per annum.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe action in this case was brought for an account from the defendant company of the rents and profits received from mortgaged lands of which the company had taken possession as mortgagee and finally sold for an amount sufficient to pay all the mortgage monies. The mortgagor claimed that there would be a balance coming to him unless the mortgagee was entitled to charge nine per cent interest on the principal after default in payment under the provisos set out in the above head-note. The right to this rate of interest was what the court had to decide on this appeal.\nBicknell for the appellant referred to People\u2019s Loan Co. v. Grant[2].\nArmour Q.C. and Bethune for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed, the judgment of the Court of Appeal discharged, and a judgment entered declaring that the appellant is only liable for interest at six per cent per annum from and after the date fixed by the mortgage deed for the payment of the principal money for the reasons given in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne in which all concur. The appellant to have his costs in this court and both courts below.\nTASCHEREAU J. concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The only question upon this appeal is as to the construction of certain mortgages.\nUpon the 29th day of December, 1882, the plaintiff executed and gave to the defendants a mortgage upon certain lands therein mentioned situate in the Province of Manitoba for securing the repayment to the defendants upon the 2nd day of January, 1885, of the sum of $20,000, then advanced to the plaintiff, together with interest thereon payable half yearly. There were two other mortgages upon the same lands subsequently executed by the plaintiff for securing two other principal sums with interest. The principal sums secured by these two mortgages are made payable on the 14th June, 1891. In all other respects the terms of these mortgages are precisely the same as those of the mortgage dated 29th December, 1882. At some time not stated on the record the defendants entered into possession of the mortgaged lands and took and received the rents issuing thereout as mortgagees in possession for some default and continued in such possession and receipt of rents until the 20th of June, 1889, when they sold the whole of the mortgaged premises for an amount admitted by themselves to have been sufficient to pay and discharge all monies claimed by them to have been due upon the security of all three mortgages. The plaintiff however insists that the amount so realised was sufficient to leave a balance payable to him, and this suit was instituted to procure the taking of an account of all the monies received by the defendants on account of the mortgaged debts and to ascertain and determine whether any, and if any, what amount of the purchase money realised upon the sale remained after satisfaction of the monies secured by and chargeable upon the mortgaged premises. The sole question before us is as to the amount of interest chargeable on the taking of such account and upon the said principal sum of $20,000 after the 2nd day of January, 1885, when the said sum was by the mortgage made payable, that is to say, whether or not there is any stipulation by the mortgagor contained in the mortgage of the 29th December, 1882, for the payment of interest at the rate of nine per cent upon the said principal sum after the said 2nd day of January, 1885, or whether from that date interest can only be allowed at the statutory rate of six per cent, as damages for breach of the covenant to pay contained in the mortgage. The whole difficulty arises by reason of a printed form containing clauses in use by building and loan societies and required by sec. 3 of ch. 127 C.S.C. when principal money and interest are blended and made payable by instalments, having been used and adapted to this mortgage whereby the principal sum advanced is made payable in one sum at a prescribed date.\nBy the mortgage under consideration it is witnessed that in consideration of the sum of $20,000 therein acknowledged to have been advanced to the plaintiff, he did give and mortgage the lands therein mentioned to the defendant company, their successors and assigns forever. Then follows, in the printed form, a clause which is required by the statute to be inserted in every mortgage wherein the principal and the interest secured by the mortgage are blended together and made payable by instalments. It is as follows:\nThe amount of principal money secured by this mortgage is twenty thousand dollars and the rate of interest chargeable thereon is nine per centum per annum payable half yearly not in advance. Provided this mortgage to be void on payment at the office of the company in the City of Toronto of twenty thousand dollars in gold coin if demanded.\nThen follows a clause which is inserted in the mortgage in writing for the purpose of adapting the printed form used to a loan like the present where the principal sum is made payable in one sum at a prescribed date and the interest thereon in the meantime. The clause so written is as follows:\nThe said principal sum of twenty thousand dollars to become due and be paid at the expiration of two years from the date thereof, that is to say on the second January, A.D. 1885, together with interest thereon in the meantime at the rate aforesaid half yearly on the second days of July and January in each and every year, the first of such payments of interest to be made on the second day of July next, A.D. 1883, together with taxes and performance of statute labour.\nThe mortgage then contains two provisos in the printed form upon the construction of which the question before us turns. They are as follows: Provided that on default of payment for two months, of any portion of the money hereby secured, the whole of the instalments hereby secured shall become payable.\nProvided that on default of payment of any of the instalments hereby secured or insurance or any part thereof at the times provided, interest at the rate above mentioned shall be paid on all sums so in arrear, and also on the interest by this proviso secured at the end of every half year that the same shall be unpaid.\nThe language of these provisos has very intelligible application to the case of the loan where the principal sum advanced and interest thereon at a rate agreed upon are blended together and the sum of the amounts so blended is made payable by instalments until the whole blended sum is repaid, and the effect of the first of these provisos in such mortgage plainly is, that upon any one of those instalments becoming in arrear and continuing so for two months after the day prescribed in the mortgage for payment thereof, then the whole of the subsequent instalments shall become immediately payable in advance, whereupon the mortgagee may exercise all the powers contained in the mortgage for the recovery of the whole amount remaining on the security of the mortgage in anticipation of the day specified in the mortgage for payment of the last instalment.\nThe natural construction of such a clause when applied to a mortgage wherein the principal sum advanced is made payable in one sum at a prescribed date and the interest thereon half yearly in the meantime, is, as it appears to me, very plainly to be, that upon default being made and continuing for two months in payment of any of the sums, which, by the immediately preceding clause (to which this proviso must be construed as having special reference) are made payable as half yearly interest, then the principal sum shall become payable in advance of the day appointed in the mortgage for the payment thereof. Thus effect is given to an imperfect clause as applied to a loan not payable by instalments but in one sum at a prescribed date ut res magis valeat quam pereat. The object of the second of the above provisos in a mortgage where the principal sum and interest thereon are blended together and made payable by instalments is to make interest, and that compound interest, become payable at the rate named upon all instalments coming due every half year, and also upon all sums, if any should be advanced by the mortgagees, by way of premiums of insurance. And the effect of that clause in a mortgage like the present, where the principal is made payable in one sum at a prescribed date and interest thereon in the meantime half yearly, is simply, as it appears to me, to make interest, and that compound interest, become payable upon all sums of the half yearly interest not paid at the days prescribed in the mortgage; this is the construction which can naturally and reasonably be put upon the words \u201cany of the instalments hereby secured\u201d as used in a mortgage like the present one. The provision as to interest upon insurance moneys has relation to a covenant in the mortgage whereby the mortgagor covenanted to insure and keep insured the mortgaged premises in the sum of six thousand dollars, and that in default thereof the mortgagee might insure the premises and charge the premiums to the mortgagor.\nAs to these insurance monies a very different provision is made in the next clause whereby it is agreed between the parties that interest at the rate of one per centum per month upon all moneys paid by the mortgagees for insurance and for taxes, and for incumbrances, if any, on the said lands, and for costs incurred by the mortgagees in recovering and keeping possession of the mortgaged premises shall be a charge on the lands. The only remaining clause is that which empowers the mortgagees, in case of any default aforesaid, by sale of the mortgaged premises to realise payment of the principal money and interest and all other moneys charged on the mortgaged premises. This clause in short substance provides that if default should be committed in payment of any of the sums becoming due half-yearly for interest or in payment of insurance moneys, or in payment of the principal sum, and that such default should continue for three months then the mortgagees\nmay sell any of the said lands, &c., &c., and that upon such sale should any surplus remain in the hands of the company after payment of all their claims for principal, interest and all other sums secured by the mortgage the mortgagor shall be entitled to such surplus.\nNow in none of these clauses is interest upon the principal sum of $20,000 stipulated for at the rate of nine per centum per annum, or indeed at any rate of interest after the 2nd day of January, 1885; interest in the meantime, that is to say up to that day, is stipulated for payable half yearly, and as the mortgagees were given power to sell the mortgaged premises in case of any default, to reimburse themselves before the expiration of another half year, it may have been deemed quite unnecessary to make any stipulation for interest on principal after the day prescribed for the payment thereof; but whether the not expressly providing for the payment of interest upon the principal sum after that day is attributable to inadvertence or design is of no importance, for none being stipulated for no more than six per cent (the amount by law allowable in the absence of stipulation) can be allowed. Take the case of the mortgaged lands proving insufficient to pay the whole of the mortgage security, and that after sale a large part of the principal should remain unsatisfied, it surely cannot be held that nine per centum per annum would still be recoverable under the covenant or any stipulation contained in the mortgage.\nThe sole contention of the respondents has been that the principal sum of $20,000 is comprehended in the words \u201cany of the instalments\u201d &c., &c., in the two provisos above mentioned. To this contention the Court of Appeal at Toronto have assented. One of the learned judges was of opinion that this construction might be inferred from certain words in column No. 2 of schedule B of the Act respecting short forms of indentures set opposite No. 13 of the Act of the Province of Manitoba, but as already shewn an express clause is inserted in the mortgage specifying all the powers given for sale of the mortgaged premises upon any default; and moreover a rate of interest in excess of the rate of interest allowed by law in the absence of stipulation cannot be inferred.\nIn fine the contention of the respondents cannot be maintained. The appeal therefore must be allowed with costs, and an order made for the allowance only of six per centum on the principal sum of $20,000 after the second day of January, 1885, as the only sum allowable by law in the absence of a stipulation for a greater amount.\nSEDGEWICK and KING JJ. also concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Laidlaw, Kappele & Bicknell.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Reid & Wood.\n[1] 26 Ont.

The policy of insurance sued upon is printed and is in the statutory form prescribed by ch. 167 R.S.O. 1887, and is one only of indemnity, expressed, I think, in very plain terms, whereby the defendant agreed\nto indemnify and make good unto the said assured, his heirs or assigns, all such direct loss or damage (not exceeding in amount $2,000, nor the interests of the insured in the property herein described).\nAt the trial the interest of the assured at the time of the policy being made, although then represented by him to be his own property, was in fact that of a vendor with a lien thereon for unpaid purchase money, amounting then to the sum of $1,200. Now that this policy so entered into operated solely as an insurance against loss of the insured\u2019s direct beneficial interest as such unpaid vendor cannot, I think, admit of a doubt. The suggestion that the words \u201cheirs or assigns\u201d and \u201cinterests\u201d (in the plural) as used in the above contract, which is in a printed form, show that the assured intended to insure the interest of his vendee as well as his own, has been fully answered by the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and nothing can in my opinion be usefully added thereto. As to the assured having had the intention suggested (assuming him to have entertained it), all that need be said is that such intention is not expressed in the contract and it cannot be argued that a secret intention of the assured can be appealed to for the purpose of changing the terms of the contract, contrary to the intention of both parties to the contract as expressed therein. But this point also is fully dealt with by the judgment appealed against. The appeal, therefore, must in my opinion be dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The appellant Keefer, on the 25th July, 1893, being the owner of certain lands and premises in the town of Thorold, upon which the buildings covered by the policy in question were erected, entered into an agreement with one George C. Cloy to sell the property to him for $2,000, payable as follows: $300 in cash; $500 in four months, and the balance, $1,200 in twelve months. At the same time Keefer verbally agreed with Cloy to keep the buildings insured to the extent of $2,000 until the purchase money should be fully paid. There was, at the date of the agreement, a policy in force covering the property for that amount, and this policy was allowed to remain until the 23rd February, 1894, when the policy sued on was substituted for it, and issued to the appellant Keefer. Cloy at this time had paid Keefer $800 on account of the purchase money, and subsequently paid him $500. The policy was renewed from time to time, and on the 11th December, 1896, the frame building mentioned in the policy was destroyed by fire, and another building damaged to the extent of $40, making a loss of $1,740, the amount claimed in this action. At this date the purchase money payable to Keefer had been reduced by payments made by Cloy to $700. The interest which Cloy had, or claimed to have, under the policy was assigned to The Quebec Bank, and this action was brought by Keefer and The Quebec Bank to recover the total amount of loss, the bank claiming the interest of Cloy under its assignment, as well as that of Keefer.\nThe case was tried before Mr. Justice Ferguson, and judgment given in favour of the appellant. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Maclennan dissenting.\nAt the time of the fire, the appellant was the owner in fee of the whole property, but having only a beneficial interest to the extent of $1,200, and Cloy having a beneficial interest to the extent of $800, and the question in dispute here is whether an unpaid vendor can recover not only his beneficial interest, but the beneficial interest of his vendee as well as under the circumstances of the present case.\nI am clearly of opinion that he can. The learned Chief Justice of this court in Caldwell v. Stadacona Fire & Life Ins. Co.[8] thus clearly lays down what I understand to be the law:\nWhatever doubts may be raised by text writers, it is clear, from the language of judges used in delivering judgments in cases of authority, that provided the assured had an interest at the time of the execution of the policy, and at the date of the loss, he is entitled to recover upon a fire policy the full value of the property destroyed, provided the whole interest in the property was insured, although his interest may have been a limited one merely.\nHe cites, among other cases, Simpson v. Scottish Union Ins. Co.[9], where Vice Chancellor Wood says: I agree that a tenant from year to year, having insured, would have a right to say that the premises should be rebuilt for him to occupy, and that his insurable interest is not limited to the value of his tenancy from year to year.\nAnd Waters v. Monarch Assur. Co.[10], where Lord Campbell says:\nThe last point that arises is: To what extent does the policy protect those goods? The defendants say that it was only the plaintiffs\u2019 personal interest. But the policies are in terms contracts to make good \u201call such damage and loss as may happen by fire to the property hereinbefore mentioned.\u201d That is a valid contract, and as the property is wholly destroyed, the value of the whole must be made good, not merely the particular interest of the plaintiffs. They will be entitled to apply so much to cover their own interest and will be trustees for the owners as to the rest The authorities are clear that an assurance made without orders may be ratified by the owners of the property, and then the assurers become trustees for them.\nMy brother Gwynne, at page 260, in the same case, expressed similar views.\nCastellain v. Preston[11], (a case very largely relied on by the majority of the court below) strongly supports the view just stated Lord Bowen says:\nIt is well known in marine and in fire insurances that a person who has a limited interest may insure nevertheless on the total value of the subject matter of the insurance, and he may recover the whole value, subject to these two provisions; first of all, the form of his policy must be such as to enable him to recover the total value, because the assured may so limit himself by the way in which he insures as not really to insure the whole value of the subject-matter; and secondly, he must intend to insure the whole value at the time. When the insurance is effected he cannot recover the entire value unless he has intended to insure the entire value. A person with a limited interest may insure either for himself and to cover his own interest only, or he may insure so as to cover not merely his own limited interest, but the interest of all others who are interested in the property. It is a question of fact what is his intention when he obtains the policy. But he can only hold for so much as he has intended to insure. * * * Then to take a case which perhaps illustrates more exactly the argument, let us turn to the case of a mortgagee. If he has the legal ownership, he is entitled to insure for the whole value, but even supposing he is not entitled to the legal ownership, he is entitled to insure prim\u00e2 facie for all. If he intends to cover only his mortgage and is only insuring his own interest, he can only in the event of a loss hold the amount to which he has been damnified. If he has intended to cover other persons beside himself, he can hold the surplus for those whom he has intended to cover.\nA case which I cite, not as authority, but as clearly stating what I conceive to be the law, is that of Insurance Co. v. Updegraff[12].\nAlthough the vendor (the court says), is not bound to insure, or even to continue an insurance already made, he may, like any other trustee having the legal title, insure if he thinks proper, to the full value of the property. It is true that in the case of a mortgagee of a ship he can only recover to the extent of his mortgage debt, unless it appears that in effecting the insurance he intended to cover, not his own interest only, but that of the mortgagor also. If he intended to cover the whole interest, both legal and equitable, he may recover the whole amount of the insurance, under a trust, as to the surplus, to hold it for the mortgagor. The same rule applies to the case of an insurance by a vendor. There is this difference, however, that as the whole estate is at law in the vendor, and the vendee has only a title to go into equity, the insurance company cannot assert the rights of the latter, or go into equity in respect to them, except upon principles of equity and good conscience. An insurance upon a house, effected by the vendor, is prim\u00e2 facie an insurance upon the whole legal and equitable estate, and not upon the balance of the purchase money. Where the form of the policy shows it to be upon the house, and not upon the debt secured by it, the burthen of showing that the insurance was upon the latter, and not upon the former, rests upon the underwriters. There is no hardship in this. The premium paid, as compared with that usually charged where the insurance is upon houses, and not upon debts secured by them, is generally decisive of the question, and the rates of insurance are peculiarly within the knowledge of the insurance company. If the insurance was upon the whole estate the premium would be according to the usual rates for houses of that description and location; if it was only upon the debt due to the vendor, there would be a large reduction on account of the responsibility of the vendee, and the value of the lot of ground included in the sale, because both of these would, in that case, stand as indemnities to the underwriters. They would be entitled to a cession of the vendor\u2019s claims, from which an ample indemnity might be recovered. There cannot, I think, be any question, but that in the present case the appellant intended to insure the whole property, and not merely his beneficial interest therein. The agreement between him and Cloy is clear evidence of this as well as the terms of the policy itself. Nor in my view is there any doubt but that the company thought that it was insuring the whole property. The premium is for an insurance not upon a partial but upon an absolute interest. The terms of the policy show that the building itself was insured. The company agreed to make good all such direct loss or damage not exceeding in amount the interests of the assured in the property described, and that word \u201cinterests,\u201d I think clearly includes interests of all kinds, if insurable; legal interests equitable interests, and all other interests arising from any relationship between the assured and any one claiming under the assurance.\nSome of the learned judges below seem to have thought the fact that Cloy\u2019s interest was not disclosed at the time of the insurance vitated the policy. The authorities are conclusively the other way. Bowen L.J. in Castellain v. Preston[13] says two conditions only are necessary in order to entitle the assured to recover, \u201cfirst, the form of his policy must be such as to enable him to recover the total value; and secondly, he must intend to insure the whole value at the time.\u201d\nIt is nowhere a condition of his recovering the whole amount that he must disclose all the parties interested. The law, I think, is well laid down in Wood on Fire Insurance, sec. 151:\nUnless the policy requires that the interest of the insured shall be disclosed, a failure to disclose the nature of his interest or of the existence of a lien or encumbrance thereon, is not a fraudulent con- cealment, and the policy is operative if the assured in fact has an insurable interest therein.\nLord Tenterden in Crowley v. Cohen[14], says:\nAlthough the subject matter of the insurance must be properly described, the nature of the interest may in general be left at large.\nAnd see Arnold on Marine Ins., 6th ed. p. 51.\nIn arriving at the conclusion which I have done, I have been much influenced by the statement of the law in Castellain v. Preston[15]. There is nothing inconsistent with our present judgment in that case. There, it was practically admitted that the vendor insured only in his own interest, and the case proceeding upon that assumption merely held that the vendor having received the full amount of the purchase money the insurance company became subrogated to his rights against the vendee, and could recover from him, the vendor, any excess which he received beyond a proper indemnity. On the whole I think this appeal must be allowed, and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nKING J.\u2014I agree with Osler J. that the case mainly turns upon the question:\nWhat is the proper construction of the policy of insurance? Is it limited by its terms to the plaintiff\u2019s interest which, though not disclosed to the company, was that of an unpaid vendor, or is it an insurance not only for himself but for others interested, as for example, the vendee, to the extent of the value insured?\nAnd again:\nThe question is whether the policy is apt for the purpose?\nThe learned judge came to the conclusion that the words are not apt for such latter purpose, and that therefore the plaintiff\u2019s interest as unpaid vendor to the extent of the $700 remaining due at the time of the loss was alone at risk at that time. The policy declares in the first place that the company\nin consideration of the stipulations herein named and of $40 premium does insure H.F. Keefer for the term of one year from the 23rd day of February, 1894, at noon, to the 23rd day of February, 1895, at noon, against all direct loss or damage by fire except as hereinafter provided to an amount not exceeding $2,000, to the following described property, while located and contained as described herein and not elsewhere, to wit: $1,700 on the frame building (describing it) and $300 on his frame storehouse (describing it).\nIt subsequently goes on as follows:\nAnd the said Ph\u0153nix Insurance Company hereby agrees to indemnify and make good unto the assured, his heirs and assigns, all such direct loss or damage (not exceeding in amount the sum or sums insured as above specified, nor the interests of the assured in the property herein described), the amount of loss or damage to be estimated according to the actual cash value of the property with proper deduction for depreciation however caused.\nI must admit to having been for some time of the opinion that by the terms of the indemnity clause the insurer\u2019s liability was limited to an amount (within the sum assured) not exceeding the assured\u2019s own interest at risk and liable to be prejudiced by a loss. Such seemed to me the fair meaning and scope of the indemnity clause; and it appeared to be quite unnecessary to guard therein against non-insurable claims or interests, as these would be excluded by the implied terms of an insurance contract. On fuller consideration, however, I think that the policy has a different meaning. By its opening clause, already recited, the plaintiff is insured generally in respect of the property mentioned to the amount specified, that is to say, he is insured generally in respect of his insurable interests in the property, whatsoever they may be. Then in the indemnifying clause, the company undertakes in terms to indemnify and make good unto the assured all such direct loss or damage; but that this may not appear to be a covenant to pay $2,000 in any event in case of loss, the words are added: \u201cnot exceeding in amount the sum or sums insured as above specified;\u201d and further, that it may not appear to be a covenant to pay the amount irrespective of the existence or continuance of the insurable interest of the assured, the further words are added: \u201cnor the interests (i.e. the insurable interests) of the assured in the property herein described,\u201d and then the clause goes on to provide for the mode in which the amount of loss or damage shall be estimated. Strictly, the saving clauses, both as to the sums specified as insured and as to the insured\u2019s interests in the property, were not necessary; nor were they more necessary in the one case than in the other, and in both cases appear to have been inserted by way of greater caution. The object of the clause of indemnity, so called, was not to limit or define the subject of insurance in any way. That had been sufficiently designated or described in the opening clause of the policy. As to the use of apt words to cover beneficial interests intended to be insured, it seems to me that these need not be specially descriptive of such other interests in the subject of the insurance. All that is meant is that the words shall be large enough to cover all that was in fact intended. If they are so, the insurer\u2019s concurrence in what the assured intended to be embraced in them is implied, and so the difficulty involved in his supposed non-concurrence is removed.\nThe next question is whether it is competent for an unpaid vendor retaining the legal title and having the right so to retain it, to insure and recover for the whole value of the property which he has bargained to sell, there being no question of his intention so to insure and no question of the use of apt words therefor in the policy.\nIt is not easy to see how such a case can be put lower than that of a mortgagee as instanced by Bowen L.J. at p. 398 of Castellain v. Preston[16] where he says: If he has the legal ownership he is entitled to insure for the whole value. * * If he intends to cover only his mortgage, and is only insuring his own interest, he can only, in the event of a loss, hold the amount to which he has been damnified. If he has intended to cover other persons besides himself, he can hold the surplus for those whom he has intended to cover. But one thing he cannot do, that is, having intended only to cover himself, and being a person whose interest is only limited, he cannot hold anything beyond the amount of the loss caused to his own particular interest.\nI cannot concur with Mr. Justice Maclennan in regarding what was said by Bowen L.J. as \u201can authoritative statement of the law by the Court of Appeal in England.\u201d The other members of that court had preceded him in the delivery of separate opinions in which the several matters arising in the case were fully considered, and we are not to suppose that they adopted all the views and statements of law expressed by Bowen L.J. in his somewhat wide incursion into the field of insurance law. To me it appears that, in respect of what is said by him as bearing on this appeal, his views mark a departure to some extent from prior authority; still we have in them the considered opinion of a very high authority which so far as I am able to discover appears also to have been adopted and established as part of the law and practice of insurance, and which, as limited by him, appears to be consistent with good sense.\nThe remaining and alternative part of the case relates to the effect of the alleged agreement with the vendee for the keeping alive of insurance on the premises. If that agreement were a valid one, I think that there could be no doubt that under this policy the plaintiff could recover in respect of the whole value of the property to the extent of the insurance, for in such case the plaintiff, in addition to the amount of his interest as unpaid vendor, would in case of loss be prejudiced to the further amount to which he had bound himself to keep up the insurance.\nThe result is that I concur in allowing the appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Collier & Yale.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Smith, Rae & Greer.\n[1] 26 Ont.

G., the owner of lot 33 (except the part owned by the railway company) for a number of years used the passage under the trestle bridge to reach a lane on the south half of lot 34 over which he could pass to a village on the west side, his predecessor in title, who owned all these lots, having used the same route for the purpose. The company having filled up the ravine, G. applied for an injunction to have it re-opened.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal (27 Ont. App. R. 64) that such user could never ripen into a title by prescription of the right of way nor entitle G. to a farm crossing on lot 34. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe question raised on the appeal is sufficiently indicated by the above note of the judgment thereon.

In re Metropolitan Railway Co. and Cosh[9].\nShepley Q.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The plaintiffs claim, as owners of the north half of lot No. 33, in the 8th concession of the Township of North Dumfries, in the County of Water- loo, in the Province of Ontario, a prescriptive right of way under the Credit Valley Railway (now vested in and operated by the C.P. Railway Company) where it crosses the north half of lot No. 34, in the said 8th concession so as thereby to obtain access to a piece of land called Dickson\u2019s Lane, situate wholly on the south half of said lot No. 34, and by that lane to the Town of Ayr. The Court of Appeal for Ontario, from whose judgment this appeal has been taken, affirmed a judgment of the Chancellor of Ontario by whom the prescriptive right so claimed was adjudged in favour of the plaintiffs; and have also held that independently of such prescriptive right the plaintiffs in right of their ownership of the north half of the said lot No. 33 are entitled to the way claimed by them under the railway where it crosses the north half of the said lot No. 34 as an ordinary farm crossing in virtue of the Act relating to railways, C.S.C. ch. 66.\nWe expressed at the hearing our unanimous opinion that the appeal must be allowed, and it only remains now for us to express the grounds upon which that opinion rested.\nOne Charles McGeorge some time in the year 1854 acquired a fee simple estate in the north halves of lots Nos. 32, 33 and 34 in the said Township of North Dumfries by title derived from one James Colquhoun, and by a deed dated the 25th day of February, 1854, and executed by the said James Colquhoun, the said Charles McGeorge became seized in fee simple of a part of the south half of the said lot No. 34, containing 3 acres, 2 roods and 38 perches, described as follows:\nCommencing at the centre of the said 8th concession of Dumfries in the line between lots Nos. 33 and 34; thence along the south boundary of the north half of the said lot No. 34 south 76\u00b0 30\u00b4 west 25 chains more or less to the western limit of the said lot No. 34, then along said limit south 15\u00b0 40\u00b4 east 17 chains more or less to the said road leading from the store heretofore occupied by James Forbes to the distillery belonging to John Hall; thence north 76\u00b0 30\u00b4 east 91 links; thence north 15\u00b0 40\u00b4 west 16 chains 9 links more or less to within 91 links of the centre of the concession; thence north 76\u00b0 30\u00b4 east 24 chains and 9 links more or less to the line between lots 33 and 34; thence north 15\u00b0 40\u00b4 west 91 links to the place of beginning.\nIt may be admitted that thereafter until his death in the year 1862 the said Charles McGeorge and his tenants had communication at their pleasure along the north half of the said lot No. 34 to the said above described piece of land on the south of the same lot which was known as Dickson\u2019s Lane, as affording a shorter access to the Town of Ayr, than round by the highway at the northern extremity of the said lots upon which the said lots fronted.\nThe said Charles McGeorge by his last will and testament devised the whole of his estate to the executors named in his will, three in number, in trust for the support and education of his children with directions that his executors upon his youngest child coming of age, or before that time, if judged necessary, should sell and dispose of the whole of his estate and divide it equally among the children or the survivors of them.\nOn the 1st of July in the year 1874 the Credit Valley Railway Company, a company incorporated by an Act of the Legislature of the Province of Ontario, passed in 1871, entered into an agreement with two of the said executors of the will of the said Charles McGeorge for acquiring the land required for the construction of their railway across the north halves of the said lots Nos. 32, 33 and 34 whereby the said executors in consideration of $1 and a further sum of $50 per acre to be paid on execution of a conveyance as therein mentioned, did for themselves, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, covenant and agree to sell, grant and convey from time to time to the Credit Valley Railway Company, their successors and assigns so much of lots Nos. 32, 33 and 34, in the 8th concession of North Dumfries being part of the estate of Dr. McGeorge, as might be selected from time to time for the purposes of their railway, 4 rods in width, and also such other widths as might be required for the roadbed and slopes, berms, spoil banks and materials for embankments or ballasting across and upon said lands and premises, and to make a good title to the same in fee simple, with all dowers barred, and free from incumbrances to the said railway company, and they did thereby grant to the said railway company the right to enter upon the said lands and premises, and to lay out and construct the said railway as might be required. It was thereby further agreed that the price above mentioned should be paid within two months from the date of the agreement, or should bear interest thereafter, and further, that the said price should be in full compensation for land and all damages of whatsoever nature or kind caused by the taking of lands as above mentioned.\nThereupon the company proceeded with the construction of their railway across the said lots in conformity with the provisions of the Acts of the legislature in that behalf, and there being upon the said north half of lot No. 34 a gully of about 19 feet in depth, the company erected, as they did in all similar places on the line of railway throughout, a trestle bridge instead of an embankment, deferring as is usual in such cases the making of embankments until later on and by degrees from year to year. The railway was not opened for traffic until the spring of 1880, and in the year 1881 the fee simple estate in the said lands was duly conveyed to the said railway company in accordance with the terms of the said agreement of the 1st of July, 1874.\nNow that agreement although executed by two only of the trustee executors of the will of Charles McGeorge, became by force of the terms of the Railway Act, ch. 66 of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada which were incorporated with the Credit Valley Railway Act, absolutely binding as to the terms of compensation for price of land and for damages upon all three, the trustee executors of the said will, &c., &c., and absolutely conclusive as to all matters expressed therein although the legal estate in the said lands may have only become vested in the said company in 1881.\nThe railway across the said lots was completed save as to the laying of the rails early in the year 1875, or in the latter end of the year 1874, and upon such completion the effect was that whatever right, title or interest which the trustee executors of the will of Charles McGeorge had in connection with the user of any part of the north half of lot No. 34 for access to the said piece of land on the south half thereof known as Dickson\u2019s Lane, became absolutely and for ever determined and extinguished. And in so far as the land taken for the railway was concerned, no right or title whatever remained in the said trustee executors to create any new right of way across the said railway lands or any part thereof. Their right even to acquire against the will of the company either a level or an under crossing if not wholly divested by the unlimited terms of the said agreement was limited to their statutory right to such farm crossings as might reasonably be required for access between the lands on either side of the railway which were severed by the railway, and such farm crossings were provided by the company upon each of the said lots upon the level.\nBy an indenture dated the 20th January, 1876, and made between Alexander McGeorge, C.J. Muir and John Robson, the executors of Charles McGeorge of the first part, and Elizabeth, Mary, Annie and Charles McGeorge, children of the said Charles McGeorge, deceased, of the second part, the parties of the first part did grant to the said parties of the second part, their heirs and assigns for ever the north halves of said lots Nos. 32, 33 and 34 in the 8th concession of North Dumfries excepting and reserving therefrom all of such lots theretofore sold and conveyed or agreed to be sold and conveyed by the parties of the first part. This reservation excepted from the said grant so much of the said lots as had been taken under the statutes in that behalf for the purposes of the railway. This deed contains a singular clause, the intent and purpose of which it is difficult to see, but it seems to have been inserted by the person who drafted the deed as proper to be inserted as part of the estate of the deceased vested in the trustee executors to which for whatever benefit such estate might confer upon them the children of the deceased were entitled; but in transferring such estate the draftsman seems to have been under the impression that there was vested in the trustee executors only a right of way over the land called the Dickson Lane and not an estate in fee. The executors could of course only convey to the children the estate in the said piece of land which was vested in them which was an estate in fee subject it may be to the right of many persons to a right of way thereon and thereover, but the transfer to the children as tenants in common in fee of the land known as the Dickson Lane as the north halves of the lots 32, 33 and 34 had been trasferred would have transferred all that was vested in the trustee executors and all that they could by any form of expression have conferred. This clause is as follows:\nThe said parties of the first part grant to the said party of the second part and to the tenants and occupiers of the said lands hereby granted a right at all times to use in common with the owners, tenants and occupiers of the land of the said late Charles McGeorge the land described in the deed from William Dickson to James Colquhoun dated 20th November, 1855.\nThe estate by that deed conveyed was an estate in fee simple. Now as to what may be the value of this clause, and with the question whether or not, it has any value we are not at present concerned, for it is obvious that it is wholly irrelevant in the present case inasmuch as it does not confer and indeed does not assume to confer any right whatever to cross the railway upon the said north half of lot No. 34 or anywhere else; on the contrary it in express terms excepts and reserves the lands taken for the railway from the operation of the deed, as land over which the grantees in the deed had no control whatever.\nNow by a deed dated the 17th November, 1877, and made between the grantees in the said last mentioned deed namely, Elizabeth, Mary, Annie and Charles McGeorge of the first part and David Guthrie of the second part, the said parties of the first part granted to the second party of the second part the north halves of said lots 32 and 33, in the 8th concession of North Dumfries,\nreserving however all lands sold or agreed to be sold by the executors of the late Dr. McGeorge, of the Village of Ayr, also reserving out of the above lands the lands sold or agreed to be sold to the Credit Valley Railway Company.\nThis deed contained a clause as to use of the Dickson Lane similar in terms to the language used in the deed of January 20th, 1876. By a deed dated the same 17th of November, 1877, between the same parties of the first part as in the above mentioned deed and one David Smith of the second part, the said parties of the first part granted to the said David Smith his heirs and assigns the north half of the said lot No. 34, excepting and reserving thereout\nthe lands sold or agreed to be sold to the Credit Valley Railroad Company.\nThis deed also contained a clause as to the user of the Dickson Lane in the precise terms used in the deed of the same date conveying the north halves of lots 32 and 33 to Guthrie.\nNow it is to be observed that the former of these deeds does not profess to transfer to Guthrie any estate or interest whatever in the said north half of lot No. 34. If it had expressly affected to do so it would have been simply void quoad any such right in so far as it might have purported to affect the railway land for the grantors in the deed had no interest or estate whatever in such lands; neither does the latter of the said deeds subject the estate in the land by that deed conveyed to Smith to any right of way whatever in favour of Guthrie or of any other person. This latter circumstance is referred to in the judgment of the Court of Appeal but was deemed unimportant because of the fact that Smith had not objected to Guthrie crossing his land on lot 34, but if Guthrie could only reach the railway upon lot 34 by the permission or sufferance of the owner of the land upon that lot adjoining to the railway how can it be said that Guthrie could in virtue of his ownership of lot 33 as is claimed in the declaration, cross the land of the railway company upon the said lot No. 34 by any other authority than the sufferance or permission of the railway company? And so no prescriptive right as claimed could have ever come into existence. It would operate as a complete miscarriage of justice if the mere non-interference by a railway company with the owner of land severed by a railway across it, in passing from his land on one side of the railway to that on the other side so severed, under a trestle bridge constructed on the line of the railway (which user of the railway company\u2019s land could not in any the slightest degree prejudice the company in the use of the railway) could mature into an indefeasible right in the land owner of such a character as to divest the company of the right to improve their railway, and make it better suited for the transport of traffic increased in quantity and weight, by substituting an embankment for the trestle unless they should purchase the permission of the land owner who had been so suffered to enjoy a convenience, without any cost to him, in the company\u2019s property.\nThe cases of The Canada Southern Railway Co. v. Clowes[10]; and The Canada Southern Railway Co. v. Erwin[11]; in this court, are cases in which it was held in circumstances somewhat resembling the present that no such right existed. In the present case there is this difference from those cases, that they were instituted at the suit of the owners of the lands whereon the trestle bridge in the railway which severed their lands respectively had been constructed; but in the present case Guthrie had no claim whatever, as owner of lot 33, nor any pretence to a claim for a farm crossing upon lot No. 34; there is therefore no foundation whatever for the claim of the plaintiffs as made in their declaration nor for a farm crossing as held by the Court of Appeal.\nThe substitution of an embankment for a trestle bridge on a railway is a work which is not to be regarded as a work merely in the interest of the railway company, but also as a work to be executed in dis- charge of a duty imposed upon the company by statute, in the interest of, and for the safety of the public, and no user for any length of time under circumstances similar to those appearing in the present case could ever mature into a prescriptive right as claimed by the plaintiffs and allowed by the judgment now in appeal.\nThe form of the judgment will be to allow appeal with costs. Dissolve injunction and dismiss action with all costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Wells & Macmurchy.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Guthrie, Watt & Guthrie.\n[1] 27 Ont.

P. Q.\nThe provisions of articles 1020 and 1209 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the Province of Quebec, limiting the time for inscription and prosecution of appeals to the Court of Queen's Bench, are not conditions precedent to the jurisdiction of the court to hear the appeal and they may therefore be waived by the respondent. Cimon v. The Queen (23 Can. S. C. R. 62) referred to ([1]).\nArt. 1220 C. P. Q. applies to appeals in cases of Petition of Right. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, Province of Quebec (appeal side), whereby the court, ex mero mot\u00fb, dismissed the petitioner's appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Quebec by which his Petition of Right had been dismissed with costs.\nIn a suit of Marchand v. The Attorney-General of Quebec, alleged to be identical with that of the present appellant, the Petition of Right had been dismissed by the Superior Court, prior to the dismissal of appellant's petition, and, at that time, an appeal in the case of Marchand v. The Attorney-General of Quebec was pending in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench at Quebec. It was accordingly agreed between the Government of Quebec and the petitioner that they should await the decision on the appeal in Marchand v. The Attorney-General of Quebec, and that, in the meantime, proceedings should he stayed in the present cause. Subsequently judgment was rendered upon the appeal in Marchand v. The Attorney-General of Quebec, reversing the Superior Court judgment, but not until after the expiration of the delay limited for the prosecution of appeals by articles 1020 and 1209 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nAn order of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council was passed, reciting the facts above mentioned and that, inconsequence, the petitioner had abstained from the prosecution of an appeal in his suit and that, owing to legal questions involved, the most expedient manner to-obtain a proper decision was to permit the petitioner to take an appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court and to waive the delay expired for instituting said appeal and that, in thus renouncing said delay, it was expressly understood that Her Majesty, represented by the Government of the Province of Quebec did not in any manner admit that the said Petition of Right was well founded or petitioner entitled to recover any sum from Her Majesty, or that his action was identical with that of Marchand against the Government, or that the evidence in the two cases was identical, or that the judgment of the Superior Court was in any way erroneous.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench, ex mero mot\u00fb held this order-in-council to be ultra vires and that as the delay for proceeding with the appeal had expired prior to the inscription in appeal the court was without jurisdiction to entertain it and could not acquire any such jurisdiction m consequence of consent of the parties.\nRobitaille Q.C. for the appellant.\nFitzpatrick Q.C. and Cannon Q C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014 This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench dismissing an appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court for want of jurisdiction.\nOn the 3rd of June, 1890, judgment was rendered by the Superior Court in a Petition of Right against the Crown in which the appellant was petitioner.\nThere had previously and on the 20th March 1886 been rendered a judgment of the Superior Court in a . case also instituted by Petition of Right of Marchand v. The Attorney General, dismissing the petition in that case. In this cause of Marchand v. The Attorney General an appeal was taken to the Court of Queen's Bench which was allowed in part. Whilst the appeal in Marchand v. The Attorney General was pending it was agreed between the present appellant and the Crown that an appeal which the appellant proposed to take from the judgment of the Superior Court should be suspended pending the appeal in Marchand v. The Attorney General. The appellant some time afterwards applied to the Lieutenant Governor in Council for redress for the grievances of which he had complained in his Petition of Right. Thereupon an order in council was passed whereby, after reciting the proceedings in the case of Marchand v. The Attorney General, as well as those in the appellant's own Petition of Right, the Crown waived the appellants delay in instituting an appeal in the present cause and consented that the appellant should be permitted to appeal from the judgment of the Superior Court against him and that so far as Her Majesty was concerned the appellant should be permitted to institute an appeal from the judgment against him with the same effect as if he had done so within the delay allowed by law.\nThereupon the appellant did forthwith institute an appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench. On this appeal coming on to be heard the Crown, abiding by the order in council did not insist on the forfeiture of the right of appeal by reason of the delays and took no objection to the jurisdiction of the court. The court however ex mero motu raised the point of jurisdiction and holding that it was not competent to entertain an appeal after the expiration of the delays prescribed by law, dismissed the appeal for want of jurisdiction.\nThe judgment of the court is in these words:\nConsid\u00e9rant que l'appel n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pris dans les d\u00e9lais fixes par la loi;\nConsid\u00e9rant partant que cette cour est sans juridiction. En cons\u00e9quence elle se d\u00e9clare incomp\u00e9tente et renvoie l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nThis judgment was accompanied by notes prepared by the learned Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench in which it was explained that this court did not consider it was competent for the Crown to renounce to the delays as it had done by the order in council since the articles of the Code of Procedure were enactments of public order, and pointing out that this decision was founded on the jurisprudence now prevailing in the French Court of Cassation.\nThe articles of the Code of Procedure bearing on the question in this appeal are the following:\nArticle 1020. The inscription in appeal from the judgment of the court of original jurisdiction or from that of the Court of Review, cannot be filed except within thirty days from the rendering of the judgment appealed against.\nArticle 1209. Proceedings in appeal must be brought within six months from the date of the judgment, saving the cases provided for by articles 924, 1006, 1010 and 1020. This delay is binding even upon minors, women under martial authority, persons interdicted or of unsound mind, and upon persons absent from the province when those have been duly brought into the suit\nArticle 1220 Unless the court otherwise orders the respondent may, within eight days next after the period allowed to appear, set up by motion any exception resulting from:\n3\u00b0. Non-existence or forfeiture of the right of appeal.\nThe articles of the French Code of Procedure providing for delays in appealing are as follows:\nArticle 443 G. P. francais. Le d\u00e9lai pour interjeter appel sera de deux mois.\nArticle 444 Ces d\u00e9lais emporteront d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance; ils courront contre toutes parties sauf le recours contre qui de droit; mais ils courront contre le mineur non \u00e9mancip\u00e9 que de jour o\u00f9 le jugement aura \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 tant au tuteur, qu'au subrog\u00e9 tuteur, encore que ce dernier n'ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en cause.\nThere can I think be no doubt but that article 1220 applies to appeals in Petitions of Right as well as to appeals in actions between ordinary suitors.\nHad there been no authority on the question presented I should have thought it clear that there was no want of jurisdiction in the Court of Queen's Bench to entertain this appeal. The delay imposed is like all other delays in procedure, imposed principally for the benefit of the party, though in a sense it may be said that public policy, which requires the prompt despatch of causes, has also influenced the legislature. However this may be it has always been considered competent to the parties conventionally to enlarge the delays for appearing, pleading, the hearing of causes and such like proceedings though these are prescribed for the same purpose as the limit of the time for appealing. Indeed public policy which favours the compromise of litigation requires that this should be so. But beyond this, in matters of much greater importance than procedure and in which the rights of the parties are involved, they are permitted to enlarge the delays fixed by the law. Thus prescription, even acquired, can be renounced. Again the defence of res judicata may be waived by agreement of the parties\u00bb And in many other cases it is competent to the parties to renounce their strict rights. I am at a loss, therefore, to see why any difference should be made as regards the time for appealing.\nThe Court of Queen's Bench appear from the notes of the learned Chief Justice to have been influenced by a decision of the Court of Cassation pronounced in 1849 which is said now to be followed in France. Up to the date of this decision the Court of Cassation itself and the highest authorities amongst the authors, especially Merlin, who discusses the question fully, were the other way.\nShould we then be bound by this single decision of the French Court of Cassation?\nNotwithstanding the very high authority of the court and the great learning of its judges, the decision is not even binding on the court itself but may be repudiated as an authority at any time. I need not say it has no direct authority as regards Canadian courts. Moreover the wording of Article 444 of the French Code of Procedure is expressed in stronger terms than is the article of the Quebec Code. Further it appears to me that Article 1220 of the Quebec Code, requiring exceptions to the right to appeal, founded, on forfeiture to be taken within eight days after the time to appear, has an important bearing on the question involved.\nTherefore on the authorities preceding the arr\u00e9t of 1849 referred to in the judgment of Chief Justice Lacoste, I would, if there was nothing more in the case, have come to the conclusion that it was competent to the Crown to waive the delay.\nThere is however an authority in this court which is binding on us. I refer to the case of Cimon v. The Queen ([2]) cited in the appellant's factum. In that case the objection was taken that the appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, which had there admitted the appeal, was taken to late. The Queen's Bench had there largely increased the amount awarded to the respondent by the Superior Court, and this court by a majority allowed the appeal and restored the first judgment. Mr. Justice Fournier, one of the minority here, in his judgment fully discusses the point and decides it adversely to the objection to the competence of the Queen's Bench, and this opinion was acquiesced in by the majority.\nI should have said that the Crown appeared by counsel on the hearing of this appeal and declined to take any part in the argument.\nThe appeal must be allowed and the case remitted to the Court of Queen's Bench to be there heard on the merits.\nAppeal. allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for appellant: Robitaille & Roy.\nSolicitor for respondent: L. J. Cannon.\n[1] Compare Park Iron Gate Co. v. Coates (L. R. 5 C. P. 634). REPORTER.\n[2] 23 Can. S. C. R. 62.\n"}

N. A, Act, 1867, s. 101\u2014Illegal consideration of contract\u2014Lottery\u2014Co-relative agreements.\nThe power of the Parliament of Canada under sec. 101 of the British North America Act, 1867, respecting a general court of appeal for Canada is not restricted to the establishment of a court for the administration of laws of Canada and, consequently, there was constitutional authority to enact the provisions of the third section of the Dominion Statute, 54 & 56 Vict. ch: 25, authorising appeals from the Superior Court, sitting in review, in the Province of Quebec.\nOn the merits, this appeal was allowed with costs, Girouard J. dissenting, the decision in L' Association St. Jean-Baptiste de Montreal v. Brault (30 Can. S. C. R. 598) being followed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at Montreal, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, which maintained the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe questions at issue in this case arose out of the transactions that gave rise to the former appeal by the present appellant against the respondent ([1]), the action having been brought by the respondent to recover $3 114.99 for a second instalment of interest on the $30,0000 mentioned in the statement of that case, under the deed of 19th March 1892. Plaintiff recovered judgment in the trial court and this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Review, on 5th May, 1900, Doherty J. dissenting. The defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada on the same grounds as were asserted in the former appeal. On the appeal coming on for hearing, it was admitted by counsel that the questions at issue, upon the merits, were precisely similar to those raised on the former appeal except that the successful ground of defence there urged for the first time on appeal to the Supreme Court had been taken in the courts below, and there was therefore no argument made on the merits on behalf of either party.\nThe respondent, however, moved to quash the appeal on the ground that the provisions of the Dominion Statute, 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 25, sec. 3, which authorised the appeal from the judgement of the Court of Review were unconstitutional and ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada.\nBelcourt K.C., for the motion, cited Danjou v. Marquis ([2]); Macdonald v. Abbott ([3]) Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. The Credit Valley Railway Co. ([4]) on the proposition that, as the provincial legislature had declared the judgment of the Court of Review where it has affirmed the judgement of the trial court final and conclusive between the parties there could be no power in the Parliament of Canada to permit an appeal.\nB\u00e9\u00efque K.C, contra, referred to Clarkson v. Ryan ([5]).\nThe judgement of the court was delivered by TASCHEREAU J \u2014This is an appeal from the Court of Review. The respondent moves to quash it on the ground that the enactment of the Dominion Parliament passed in 1891, giving the right to appeal from that court is unconstitutional and ultra vires. This motion cannot prevail.\nWe have entertained a number of such appeals during the ten years that the enactment has been in force without any objection having been taken to our jurisdiction and it is too late now to ask us to decree that in all those cases our judgments are complete nullities.\nSection 101 of the British North America Act 1867, enacts that notwithstanding the exclusive jurisdiction given to the provincial legislatures over civil rights, the Parliament of Canada has the power to provide for the constitution, maintenance and organisation of a general court of appeal for Canada, without restricting the power as it does for additional courts of first instance to the administration of laws of Canada.\nThe respondent would contend that all the appeals heard in this from all over the Dominion since its creation in 1875, in cases not governed by the federal laws, were determined without jurisdiction. For, if parliament had not the power to authorise an appeal in such cases from the Court of Review, in Quebec, it had not the power to authorise it from the courts of final jurisdiction in the other provinces. Then we have often held that the Provencal legislatures have-not power to restrict in any way the jurisdiction of this court or to add to it. The Quebec Legislature had not the power to authorise an appeal to this court from the Court of Review, or from any of its courts. That being so it follows that the Dominion parliament must have that power. The motion is dismissed with, costs and the appeal is allowed with costs.\nGIROUARD J. dissented from the judgment of the majority of the court upon the merits for reasons already stated by him in his judgement in the former case of L'Asssociation St. Jean-Bapliste de Montr\u00e9al v. Brault (1)\nMotion to quash dismissed with costs appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: B\u00e9\u00efque, Lafontaine, Turgeon & Robertson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lamothe & Trudel\n[1] 30 Can.

This is a motion by the plaintiff to allow his security for appeal to this court. His action concluded for reddition de compte or in default thereof for one thousand dollars. The defendants, admitting their obligating to render the account, filed one amounting to over eight thousand dollars, claiming two hundred and forty-two dollars as the balance thereof in their favour. The plaintiff by a contestation of that account claimed to be entitled to an amount which though not specified, yet, by his allegations, clearly amounted to a sum exceeding two thousand dollars, withdrawing expressly the alternative conclusion of his declaration for one thousand dollars. The defendants joined issue on that contestation, not objecting to the withdrawal by the plaintiff of his alternative conclusion for the one thousand dollars. On that issue, the Superior Court rendered a judgment in favour of the plaintiff for two thousand one hundred and ninety-one dollars. The Court of .Appeal reversed that judgment and dismissed his action and his contestation of the defendants' account.\nThe defendants' objections to the plaintiff's right of appeal are unfounded.

Miller (Plaintiff)\nRespondent\n1901: Feb. 25, 26; 1901: Mar. 18.\nPresent:\u2014Taschereau, Gwynne, Sedgewick, King and Girouard JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nLibel\u2014Privileged communication\u2014Malice\u2014Charge to jury\u2014Evidence.\nOn the trial of an action claiming damages for a libel alleged to be contained in a privileged communication the judge charged the jury as to privilege and added \"if the defendant made the communication bon\u00e2 fide, believing it to be true, and the privilege existed that I have endeavoured to explain, then there would be no action against him.\"\nHeld, that plaintiff was entitled to a more explicit statement of the law on a point directly affecting the proof of an issue the burden of which was upon him.\nOne portion of the communication containing the alleged libel might be read as importing a grave charge against the plaintiff or as an innocuous statement of fact.\nHeld, that as to prove malice the writer's knowledge of the falsity of the fact was the material point the sense in which he may have used the words was the governing consideration.\nThe judge's charge was not open to objection for want of an explicit reference to pre-existing unfriendliness between the parties as proof of malice where the only evidence of unfriendliness consisted of hard things said of the defendant by the plaintiff.\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia (32 N. S. Rep. 129) affirmed, Gwynne and Sedgewick JJ. dissenting.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1] setting aside a verdict for the defendant and ordering a new trial.\nThe letter containing the alleged libel of the plaintiff by the defendant, and other facts bearing on the questions raised on the appeal are set out in the judgment of the court. W. B. A. Ritchie K.C. for the appellant. The letter written was upon a privileged occasion; Toogood v. Spyring[2]; Somerville v. Hawkins[3]; Harrison v. Bush[4]; Jenoure v. Delmege[5]; Nevill v. Fine Art and General Insurance Company[6]. The jury could not have found that the statement of Green that he \"relieved\" Miller of the agency was false. There is no evidence of malice; on this point see Spill v. Maule[7]; Dewe v. Waterbury[8]. Even assuming untrue statements were made in the letter, there was no evidence of their falsity in the sense they were understood by the defendant, and instruction as suggested would have been inappropriate and misleading. English v. Lamb[9]; Attorney-General v. Good[10]. The jury were correctly instructed as to malice with the particularity necessary and also as to the meaning of the word \"report\" as used. Any remarks that might have been out of place were corrected when the jury was recalled, and further instructions given and the construction that might have been put on that reference as imputing misconduct. It was competent for the judge to correct his charge by this re-direction. These were mere comments on questions of fact and there was no suggestion in the letter of any fraudulent conversion or omission to account. See Giblin v. McMullen[11]; Metropolitan Railway Co v. Jackson[12].\nThe evidence shews that the alleged libel was true in fact as to all material statements. A new trial should not be granted when the verdict is right and there is not sufficient error or omission in the charge to justify it. Deerly v. Duchess of Mazarine[13]; Cox v. Kitchin[14]; Ford v. Lacy[15]; Great Western Railway Co. v. Braid[16]; Edmonson v. Mitchell[17]; Wickes v. Clutterbuck[18]; Lordly v. McRae[19]; Herrington v. McBay[20]; Jenkins v. Morris[21]; Wells v. Lindop[22]; Bray v. Ford[23].\nWrong observations in a charge as to facts are not material; Taylor v. Ashton[24]; Darby v. Ouseley[25]; Hawkins v. Snow[26]; nor misdirection on points unnecessary to be considered. Peters v. Silver[27]. There is no onus on the party holding the verdict to negative any substantial wrong or miscarriage; Shapcott v. Chappell[28]. The full court had full power to dispose of the case; Allcock v. Hall[29]; Peers v. Elliott[30]; Rowan v. Toronto Railway Company[31]; Roach v. Ware[32].\nRoscoe K.C. for the respondent. The grounds for setting aside the verdict are mis-direction, non-direction, and that it is against weight of evidence. The libel is conspicuous in three places in the letter; that plaintiff had been discharged for inattention to business; that reports of collections were not made, and that he allowed the interests of the company to suffer. Starkie on Libel and Slander, p. 167; O'Brien v. Clement[33]; Odger on Slander and Libel (3 ed.) p. 2; Capital and Counties Bank v. Henty[34]. Direction should have been given that Green made statements he knew to be false, that malice could be inferred from this, and that proof of falsehood in part was evidence for the jury to renew the presumption of malice which the privilege of the occasion might otherwise rebut. Nevill v. Fine Art etc. Ins. Co.[35]; Robinson v. Dun[36]; Blagg v. Sturt[37]; Royal Aquarium Society v. Parkinson[38]; Odger on Libel (3 ed.) 318; Newell on Slander and Libel (2 ed.) at pp. 325, 771; Smith v. Crocker[39].\nWhat the jury might have regarded in the light of a quarrel might be taken as evidence of malice; the judge declined to state this as the law. He practically told the jury that there was nothing to shew that malice could exist. There was misdirection as to what was necessary in order to find for plaintiff and as to the privilege of the occasion. The improper motive shewed malice; Stuart v. Bell[40]; Hawkins v. Snow[41]. When the jury once found that the letter implied misconduct it should not have been left open to their mere pleasure or caprice to find it libellous; Weston v. Barnicoat[42].\nThe direction as to the word \"report\" being considered in the light of defendant's construction of its meaning was improper. The question is how the person to whom the letter was addressed understood it. Odgers on Libel and Slander (3 ed.) 100. All the misdirections were of the most substantial character; Anthony v. Halstead[43]; Ashmore v. Borthwick[44]; Nyburg v. Ullman[45]; Dunbar v. Cardiff Phil Music Hall Co.[46]. There was a publication of the libel to the defendant's stenographer; Pullman v. Hill & Co.[47], and no privilege attached to this publication, nor is justification proved. The case of Boxius v. Goblet Fr\u00e8res[48] in no sense interferes with the doctrine of Pullman v. Hill & Co. (1). The Bosxius Case (2) was one as to solicitors who might be required to write defamatory matter in the course of their business. It is not the business of the insurance companies more than of merchants to write anything defamatory.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nKING J.\u2014This is an action of libel by a former agent at Bridgetown, N.S., of the Confederation Life Assurance Society, against the appellant, who was the general manager of the company at Halifax.\nThe plaintiff ceased to be agent of the company at Bridgetown on the twenty-seventh day of April, 1897, and the defendant on the seventh of July, 1897, wrote the following letter, which contains the libel sued in respect of, to one Mrs. Freeman, who had a policy in the company and was supposed to be desirous of continuing it:\nDear Mrs. Freeman,\u2014I think you know that at the time of my recent visit to Bridgetown, I relieved Mr. O. S. Miller of our local agency. As you and your husband have evidently taken a kindly interest in Mr. Miller, I might say to you without entering into details as to the causes which compelled me to take this action, an explanation of which would hardly be appropriate here, that we have tried for a considerable time past to get Mr. Miller to attend properly to our business, and that it was only because it was clearly necessary that the change was made. In order to give Mr. Miller an opportunity to get the benefit of commissions on as much outstanding business as I could, I left the attention of certain matters in Mr. Miller's hands, on the understanding that he would attend to them and remit to me as our representative. I now find that he has collected money which, up to the present time, we have been unable to get him to report, and I am told that he is doing and saying all that he can against myself and the company. The receipt for your premium fell due May 30th, days of grace, June 30th. If you have made settlement of the premium with Mr. Miller your policy will of course be maintained in force, but I have thought that it would be part of the plan Mr. Miller at one time declared to me he would follow, in order to cease as much of our business as possible, that he would allow your policy to lapse through inattention. As I have thought that you would not like to have it so, I am prompted to write you this letter, and shall be glad if you will advise us whether or not you have made settlement with Mr. Miller. If not, what is your wish in regard to continuing the policy? Yours truly,\nF. W. GREEN,\nManager,\nThis letter is clearly capable of a libellous construction, but it is claimed that it was a privileged communication, and it cannot be denied that the occasion was privileged. The only question arises as to the existence of malice which would deprive the communication of its otherwise privileged character, and as to the learned judge's direction or misdirection in respect thereof.\nThe existence of malice rebutting the qualified privilege is an issue the affirmative of which is on the plaintiff in the action.\nThe case was tried before Chief Justice Macdonald, and the jury found in favour of the defendant. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia directed a new trial on the ground of the insufficiency of the direction as to malice, (per Weatherbe, Ritchie and Graham JJ., Townshend J. dissenting), and this appeal is against the judgment for a new trial.\nIt is not to be expected that a judge in trying an action of libel shall attempt to define or specify all instances and tests of malice. To attempt to do so would be likely to confuse the jury. It is sufficient that he should explain the law to the extent required in dealing with the facts arising in the case.\nOne of the circumstances relied on by the plaintiff to prove malice was the alleged falsity, to the defendant's own knowledge, of certain of the statements contained in the letter. It is clear that if a party speaking or writing on a privileged occasion states what is untrue to his knowledge, this is evidence of malice sufficient to destroy the privilege of the communication. Clark v. Molyneux[49].; Fountain v. Boodle[50].\nNow the letter in its opening sentences speaks of the plaintiff as having been relieved of his agency by the defendant and of the defendant having been compelled to take this action, by reason of having tried for a considerable time, without success, to get the plaintiff to attend properly to the business. The fact, however, appears to be, that the defendant was willing that the plaintiff should continue the agency, but that the latter was not willing to continue it on the terms as to compensation offered him. And the facts, (such as they were,) were within the knowledge of the defendant.\nThe plaintiff's counsel ask the learned judge to direct the jury, that if the defendant stated what he knew to be false it would be evidence of malice. The learned judge declined to do so because he considered that he had already covered the ground in his charge.\nThe only references to the point that I can find are at page 93 of the \"Case\" lines 5 to 10, where, in dealing with the matter of privileged communications, the learned Chief Justice says:\nI tell you as a matter law, that the relation was sufficient to constitute privilege in relation to the communication made in that letter by the defendant to Mrs. Freeman, provided the communication (was) made bon\u00e2 fide, believing it to be true, although in fact it was untrue and defamatory. If the defendant made the communication bon\u00e2 fide, believing it to be true, and the privilege existed that I have endeavoured to explain then there would be no action against him.\nAll this is very true and upon analysis the point in question may be involved, but with all respect to the very learned Chief Justice, who may very naturally have supposed that by this he had covered the ground, it seems to fall short of an instruction to the jury as to the effect of falsity within the knowledge of the defendant as constituting a test of malice, and I think that the plaintiff was entitled, (if he so requested), to have the more explicit statement of the law on a point directly affecting the proof of an issue, the burden of which was upon him.\nConsiderable argument took place respecting the statements in the letter as to the plaintiffs failure to report as to moneys left for his collection On the one hand it is said that the charge was that of a failure to inform his principal of the receipt of the money. On the other, that it merely meant a failure to make the form of report required of an insurance agent by the company. If the inquiry were as to the bare meaning of the words, as for instance whether the words were susceptible of a defamatory construction, I should think that the ordinary and natural sense would govern, as being the sense in which the words would be understood by the person receiving the letter; but, if the question upon the statement related to the question of malice or not, then, inasmuch as the knowledge of the defendant of the falsity of the facts alleged is the material fact, the sense in which the defendant may have used the word becomes the governing consideration; and, notwithstanding that the receiver might suppose that a grave charge was made, the person using the language cannot be said to have knowingly stated a falsehood, if he honestly meant to use the word in any innocent sense.\nAs to the learned Chief Justice not charging more explicitly in reference to malice, evidenced by a preexisting unfriendliness, if indeed there were evidence of such on defendant's part, or of any quarrel shared in by him, the charge would probably be inadequate; but looking at the facts, what is adduced was at most a scintilla of proof, consisting of hard things said by the plaintiff to and concerning the defendant, and not by the defendant to and concerning the plaintiff.\nIt is too strained and refined to argue that because plaintiffs conduct towards the defendant was improper and quarrelsome, therefore the defendant must have shared the feeling.\nOn the whole I think the only material ground of complaint adduced against the charge is that first alluded to.\nIt is not possible, I think, to say that the jury could not have been influenced by the non-direction and that no different verdict could reasonably or properly have been rendered had the charge been free from all objection.\nI think that the case is still one for a jury suitably assisted and it would be improper to add a word which might affect the finding of another jury.\nThe appeal should, therefore, in my opinion, be dismissed, and chiefly for the reasons relied upon by Mr. Justice Ritchie, concurred in as it was by Mr. Justice Graham.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: H.

In a suit upon the contract in the Superior Court at Quebec, the defendant, who was served substitution-ally, opposed a judgment entered against him by default by petition in revocation of judgment, first by preliminary objection taking exception to the jurisdiction of the court over the cause of action and then constituting himself incidental plaintiff, making a cross-demand for damages to be set off against plaintiffs' claim.\nHeld, that in the Province of Quebec, as in the rest of Canada, in negotiations carried on by, correspondence, it is not necessary for the completion of the contract that the letter accepting an offer should have actually reached the party making it, but it is complete on the mailing of such letter in the general post-office. Underwood v. Maguire (Q. R. 6 Q. B. 237) overruled.\nArticle 85 of the Civil Code, as amended by 52 Vict. ch. 48, (Que.) providing that the indication of a place -of payment in any note or writing should be equivalent to election of domicile at the place so indicated, requires that such place should be actually designated in the contract.\nIn forming an opposition or petition in revocation of judgment the defendant in order to comply with art. 1164 C. P. Q. is obliged to include therein any cross-demand he may have by way of setoff or in compensation of the plaintiff's claim and, unless he does so he cannot afterwards file it as of right.\nA cross-demand so filed with a petition for revision of judgment is not a waiver of a declinatory exception previously pleaded therein, nor an acceptance of the jurisdiction of the court.\nIn order to take advantage of waiver of a preliminary exception to the competence of the tribunal over the cause of action on account of subsequent incompatible pleadings, the plaintiff must invoke the alleged waiver of the objection in his answers.\nThe judgment appealed from, affirming the decision of the Superior Court, District of Quebec (Q. R. 16 S. C. 22), was reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court District of Quebec ([1]), dismissing the defendant's declinatory exception and, on the merits, maintaining the plaintiffs' action with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case and questions at issue upon this appeal are sufficiently stated in the headnote and in the judgment of the court delivered by His Lordship Mr. Justice Taschereau.\nFitzpatrick K.C (Solicitor-General) and Brodeur K.C., for the appellant. The trial court had no jurisdiction as the contract was made in Toronto and the whole cause of action did not arise in Quebec; art. 94 C.P.Q. The terms of arts. 1164 and 1176 C.P.Q. compelled defendant to set up full defence on the merits and his cross-demand by way of set-off or compensation at the same time and in the pleading by which he opposed the default judgment entered against him. Therefore by defending on the merits defendant did not abandon the preliminary objection nor accept the jurisdiction of the incompetent tribunal. See Goulet v. McGraw ([2]). The plaintiff did not plead waiver of the exception d\u00e9clinatoire and, in any case, the withdrawal by defendant of his pleas to the merits replaces him in the same position as if his cross-demand had never been made; art. 277 C.P.Q\nUnder English law, contracts by correspondence are completed where the letter of acceptance is delivered, and our Post Office Act enacts that a mailed letter becomes the property of the person to whom it is addressed as soon as it is put in the post office (R.S.C. ch. 35 sec. 43) The mail carrier is then acting as agent of the person to whom the letter is addressed. Underwood v. Maguire ([3]) is evidently a misinterpretation of the law. The letter of acceptance having been mailed in Ontario it was there that the parties became agreed there their minds first met, and the law of that province must govern. Art. 8 C.C.\nWe claim that by the law in force in the Province of Quebec the contract is made where the letter of acceptance is mailed. Cloutier v. Lapierre ([4]); Mc Fee v. Gendron ([5]); Warren v. Kay ([6]); Wurtele v. Lenghan ([7]). Masse, Droit Commercial vol. 3, p. 31, No. 1451. The authors who have written under the laws of France contending that the contract is made at the place where the letter is received have not considered the dispositions of our Post Office Act. Delivery or indication of a place of payment in Quebec makes no difference. Tourigny v. Wheler ([8]); Lapierre v. Gau-vreau ([9]). See also Connolly v. Brannen ([10]); Rousseau v. Hughes ([11]) Henthorn v. Fraser ([12]); Turcotte v. Dansereau ([13]); Dawsou v. McDonald ([14]); Dawson v. Ogden ([15]); Trevor v. Wood ([16]); Cowan v. O' Connor ([17]); Borthick v.

A cross-demand is not a plea, but a new claim arising out of either the same or other causes to allow compensation to be declared. It is the most explicit acceptance of the jurisdiction of the court. He was not compelled to adopt that procedure to claim his right he could have sued in any other court he thought competent. Having chosen the procedure, he acquiesced in having his claim decided by the Quebec court. As to the subsequent withdrawal, art. 277 C. P. Q. refers only to procedure, not to the right itself of jurisdiction granted by the defendant, an assent on which plaintiff can rely and which he cannot retract Moreover, the declinatory exception must be pleaded within a fixed delay. By instituting a cross-demand, defendant's right of pleading to the jurisdiction ceased; and when he withdrew his cross-demand the delay had expired. The declinatory exception ought to have been pleaded in limine litis; and the right to plead it was extinguished by filing a cross-demand. Art. 99 C. P. Q.\nOn the merits, we refer to the judgment of Andrews J. in the Superior Court, unanimously adopted by the Court of Queen's Bench.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014The judgment of the Superior Court, confirmed by the Court of Appeal for the same reasons, as appears by the printed case, dismissed the appellant's s exception to the jurisdiction on the sole ground that by constituting himself incidental plaintiff he had submitted to the jurisdiction of the court, and waived his said exception. We think that judgment untenable. The appellant's incidental demand, though not so in express terms as it was for instance in Peale v. Phipps, ([34]) was of its nature merely alternative, in the event of his exception to the jurisdiction not prevailing. If any part of the appellant's petition was illegal it was the incidental demand, not the declinatory plea. It is that demand that should have been objected to by the respondents, as incompatible with the exception to the jurisdiction. The respondents replied to the petition and. declinatory plea and proceeded to trial and judgment upon the declinatory plea as a separate issue, and it was the court ex proprio motu which suggested the question of waiver. Now, it is a well settled rule that waiver must be pleaded or invoked by the party who relies upon it. In this case if there has been a waiver at all, it was on the part of the respondents who asked the Court a judgment on the merits of the appellant's s declinatory exception without invoking waiver of it by the appellant. ' Then, were it necessary to determine the point, it would seem that appellant is right in his contention that under articles 1164, 1173, 1175,1176 C. C. P. (new), his incidental or cross-demand was rightly filed with his petition. Arts. 217, 218 219, C.C. P, Turcotte v. Dansereau ([35]). Brunet v. Colfer ([36]); 5 Boncenne-Bourbeau, 100 et seq. Though not a plea, in the ordinary sense of the word, the cross-demand was in the nature of a set-off, or compensation against the respondent's claim. Had he not filed it with his petition he could not later have been allowed to file it, as of right.\nHaving come to the conclusion that the appellant had not waived his declinatory exception, we have to pass upon its merits, and determine whether or not the whole cause of respondents' action has arisen in the District of Quebec. If not, it is conceded, the Court had no jurisdiction. This brings up the controverted question raised in Underwood v. Maguire ([37]), and noticed in Sirey, Code Civil annot\u00e9, under art. 1101, no. 32, under art. 1583, no. 40; Code de proc\u00e9d. under art. 420, no 78, and In Pandectes Fran\u00e7aises vo, \" Obligations,\" no. 7054. In negotiations carried on by correspondence is the contract entered into only when the letter containing the acceptance has reached the party who has made the offer? Or, as put in Sirey, loc. cit.\nEst-il n\u00e9cessaire pour la perfection du contract que l'acceptation soit parvenue \u00e0 la connaissance de celui qui \u00e0 fait l'offre?\nThe jurisprudence and commentators' opinions in France on the question are fully cited and collected in Sirey and the Pandects, loc. cit. If counted merely, the respondents' contention that the question should be answered in the affirmative would seem to have a majority in its favour. But if the reasoning is weighed, the question should, we think, be answered in the negative, and we adopt the view taken by Pother, Vente, no. 32; 24 Demol. 1er, des Contr. No. 72; by Marcad\u00e9, vol. 4, under art. 1108, no. 395; by Lyon-Caen, Dr. Commercial, vol. 3, nos. 25 et seq; by the annotator to the arr\u00e9t of the 21st Jan 1891 in Pand. Franc. 92 2 163 by the annotator o the same arr\u00e9t in Dalloz, 92, 2, 249; by Guillouard, Vente, vol. 1er, no 15; by Vigi\u00e9, Dr. Civ. Fr. vol. 2, no. 1112; and by Hudelot, Obligations,no. 37. It would appear useless to repeat here the argumentation upon which these commentators have reached their conclusions upon the question. A simple reference to them is sufficient. They completely refute the reasoning upon which the contrary doctrine is based.\nIf it were required for the aggregation mentium necessary to create mutuality of obligations in a contract made by correspondence that the party who has made the offer has received the acceptance of his offer, it would follow that the party accepting should himself not be bound till he is informed that his acceptance has reached the party offering. It is obviously of the greatest importance to the commercial community that such a doctrine should not prevail.\nBy the conclusion we have reached upon the question, we declare the law to be in the Province of Quebec upon the same footing as it stands in England, and in the rest of this Dominion, a fact rightly alluded to by Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9 in Underwood v. Maguire (1[38]) as of great importance specially in commercial matters.\nIt had previously in France been said by a learned writer that this view of the question est celle qui pr\u00e9snterait le plus de chances de succ\u00e8s devant la jurisdiction commerciale. Boncenne-Bourbeau, vol. 6, p. 163.\nIt has been argued for the respondents that as under arts 1152 and 1533 of the Civil Code the payment by the appellants under this contract had by law to be made to them in the District of Quebec where delivery of the ties sold to them had to take place they had the right to bring the action there under the provisions of art 85. In France, no doubt, the action is rightly brought where the payment has tobe made. But that is so only in virtue of art. 420 of their Code of procedure, which is treated by the commentators and the jurisprudence as an exception in the tribunaux de commerce to the ordinary rules in the matter. Dalloz, 63, 1,176. Pand. fr. 99 1 22. At common law the indication of a place of payment does not confer jurisdiction upon the tribunals of that place I. refer to Demol. vol. ler no. 374; Sirey Cod. Civ. Ann. under art. 111, no. 52; 12 Duranton, no. 99; 27 Demolombe, vol. 4, des contrats, no. 274; .6 Boncenne-Bourbeau, 210 et seq; Wurtele v. Lengham ([39]); Tourigny v. Wheeler([40]); Cloutier v. Lapierre ([41]) Clark v. Ritchey ([42]). By the act 52 V. oh 48 amending' article 85 of the Civil Code the indication of a special place of payment in any note or writing, wherever it is dated now confers jurisdiction over any action relating to such note or writing upon the tribunals of the place so indicated. But here in the written agreement sued upon there is no such indication of a place of payment and the declaration does not allege any\u00bb Bent v . Lauve ([43]); Vidal v. Thompson ([44]); Morris v. Eves ([45]). The place of payment designated by the law alone is not the indication required by art. ,85 of the. Code as it now reads. It is a stipulated domicile, one expressly contracted for by the parties not the place indicated by the law that this article provides for.\nWhen articles 94 of the Code of procedure read with art. 86 of the Civil Code says that a defendant may be summoned in the case of an election of domicile for the execution of an act, before the Court of the domicile so elected, it means clearly a conventional domicile, not a legal domicile, not the place that the law alone designates as the place of payment.\nIt would seem, moreover, that article 85 C. P. Q. requires that the election of domicile and the indication of a place of payment equivalent thereto under its provisions, be made at such a designated place in a locality that the notifications, demands and suits relating thereto may be made and served thereat; art. 129 C. P. Q. For instance, if a note says payable at Quebec, ' that is not an election of domicile under this article.\n\"We hold therefore that the contract between the parties in this case having been made in Toronto where the appellant accepted the respondent's offer and mailed his letter of acceptance the whole cause of action did not arise at Quebec, and the indication of a place of payment as required to give jurisdiction over the matter to the Superior Court at Quebec not having been alleged nor proved, the action not having been personally served upon the appellant must be dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs, declinatory plea maintained and action dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Dandurand, Bro leur & Boyer.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Taschereau, Pacaud of Smith.\n[1] Q.

Plaintiff proceeded with his action and recovered judgment at the trial for the amount claimed and costs, including costs on the counterclaim, the decree directing him to give the deed demanded by the defendant as soon as the costs were paid. The verdict was affirmed by the court en banc.\nHeld, that as the defendant had succeeded on his counterclaim he should not have been ordered to pay the costs before receiving his deed and the decree was varied by a direction that he was entitled to his deed at once with costs of appeal to the court below en banc, and to the Supreme Court of Canada against plaintiff.

McLean K.C. for the respondent.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice King in allowing the appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This case appears to me to be very simple when divested of all superfluity and prolixity of pleading. The plaintiff in his statement of claim alleges three alternative causes of action. In the first he alleges in paragraph numbered\n2. That on or about the 10th day of September, 1896, it was agreed by and between the the plaintiff and the defendant by an agreement in writing signed by the defendant on that date that the plaintiff should sell to the defendant, and the defendant should purchase from the plaintiff a wharf property land and premises in the first paragraph of the statement of claim mentioned at the price of $450, and that defendant should pay to the plaintiff $100 per year for the first three years, and $150 the fourth year with five per cent interest until said price or purchase money should be paid, and that the said plaintiff should accept payment in full any time within the said dates.\n3. That the defendant went into possession of the said wharf property under said agreement and in part performance thereof on or about said 10th September, 1896\n4. That plaintiff was at all times material to this action ready and willing to complete said sale and purchase and carry out said agreement on being paid said purchase money.\n5. That the said defendant has not paid to the plaintiff the said price or purchase money or any part thereof although the periods at which the first and second instalments of $100 each year were due and payable, have long since elapsed.\n6. That the defendant since he went into possession of the said property has continued and remains in possession thereof though the periods at which the first two instalments of purchase money were payable has long since elapsed and that the defendant has wrongfully refused to carry out said agreement on his part, &c.\nIn paragraph 8 the plaintiff in the alternative makes a claim similar to the above save that the agreement is alleged to be partly in writing and partly oral.\nIn paragraphs 10 and 11 the plaintiff alleges alternatively a cause of action in trespass, namely, that the defendant on divers days and times between the 10th of September, 1896, and 10th September, 1897, wrongfully entered the plaintiff's said property and tore down and removed part of a building of the plaintiff thereon and dug away and removed gravel and soil of the plaintiff from the said property to the injury thereof, and the plaintiff claimed the relief following:\n1. Possession of the said property and $211 mesne profits.\n2. $211.90 for damages for breach of the agreement as set out in paragraph 2.\n3. Or in the alternative $211.90 amount of unpaid instalments of purchase money and interest as damages for breach of the agreement as set out in paragraph 8, of the statement of claim.\n4. Alternatively the plaintiff claims $200 damages under paragraphs 10 and 11 in the statement of claim, that is to say for the alleged trespass in those paragraphs pleaded.\nNow here it may be observed that as to this trespass claim there is no pretence whatever for the insertion of that claim, for it is admitted in the statement of claim that the defendant's entry upon the premises was in part performance of and under the provisions of the agreement for sale and purchase which the plaintiff claims to be still in full force and effect; and therefore the main claim asserted in the plaintiff's action is to recover the two first instalments thereby made payable and which the plaintiff alleges that although overdue the defendant wrongfully refuses to pay. We may then deal with the cause of action as set out in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th paragraphs of the statement as really containing the whole substantial cause of action alleged in the statement of claim. The whole of the contention between the parties which has given occasion for this action consists in this that the defendant insists that it was part of the agreement between him and the plaintiff that the latter should sign an agreement for the execution of a deed upon payment of the purchase money. Immediately upon entering under the agreement he proceeded to build a house on the premises; while doing so some question arose as to whether some person or persons had or not a right of way over the premises. The defendant upon mentioning this to plaintiff saying also that he was negotiating for sale of the premises and therefore was anxious about the agreement, and that it should covenant for a deed with absolute covenants for title when the purchase money should be paid; that the plaintiff peremptorily refused to give the agreement or a deed with covenants for title except against his own acts; that this refusal of the plaintiff was the sole cause of the defendant not having paid the two instalments sued for in the statement of claim.\nUpon the statement of claim having been served on the defendant he seems to have been well advised not to rest his case upon his right to have the agreement which he had insisted upon but which the plaintiff refused but while defending the action upon that ground to become himself a plaintiff by filing a counterclaim against the plaintiff in the action for specific performance; accordingly the defendant tendered to the plaintiff the full amount of principal and interest, namely $510.54, and demanded the execution of a deed with covenants for title, and thereupon pleas to the action were filed on the defendant's behalf in which the defendant admitted all the allegations contained in paragraph 2 of the statement of claim except that the said agreement was in writing, and he denied that the said agreement was in writing, and he said that the agreement was a verbal one and that at the time of the making thereof and as part of the said agreement the plaintiff agreed to execute and deliver to the defendant a written agreement of sale containing the terms set forth in said paragraph, and he said that he was in possession of said premises under said verbal agreement up to the present time; and he denied that the plaintiff was at all or at any time ready to complete and carry out the said agreement by executing a proper conveyance on being paid the purchase money, and he denied that he, the defendant, had ever refused to carry out the said agreement. He pleaded similar pleas to the cause of action as stated in the 8th paragraph of the statement of claim. He then counter-claimed for specific performance of the agreement upon the terms as set out in the plaintiff's statement of claim, and he averred that he had tendered the plaintiff the sum of $510.54 being the full amount of the said purchase money and all interest, and had demanded a deed of conveyance of said property which the plaintiff refused to give, and he alleged that he brought that amount into court to be paid to plaintiff upon the said contract upon delivery of such deed to the defendant; he made then a claim for damages for loss from inability to resell and otherwise, but no evidence at the trial was entered into upon this head.\nNow upon the filing and service of that counterclaim it is apparent that nothing remained to be decided in the plaintiff's action but the question of costs up to that time; the fact of the defendant not having availed himself of the privilege of the last clause of the agreement as set out in the plaintiff's statement of claim until after action brought did not deprive the defendant of his right to demand specific performance of the contract by the execution of a proper deed upon tender of the full purchase money and interest, and the question of the liability for costs up to that time depended upon the question whether the plaintiff's or defendant's contention should prevail as to the right which the defendant had claimed to have a written agreement of sale signed by the plaintiff; instead however of submitting to the defendant's demand for specific performance as contained in the counterclaim the plaintiff in a long replication averred among other things that defendant had waived all right to any written or other agreement than that set forth in the statement of claim, and he denied that he had ever agreed to execute and deliver to the plaintiff any agreement to give a good and sufficient deed of the said property with or without covenants or warranties as soon as the defendant had paid the price or at all, and in a much longer pleading in answer to the counterclaim containing much unnecessary and irrelevant matter, the plaintiff\ndenies that the defendant ever tendered to him $510.54 or any sum, and he does not admit that such sum is the amount of said purchase money with full interest thereon, and he denies that the defendant demanded delivery of a deed of conveyance of said property or of any property which plaintiff refused to deliver or otherwise, or that plaintiff refused to deliver said or any deed.\nAt the trial the plaintiff was examined on his own behalf, and his evidence establishes the defendant's contention. He produced his title deeds to show his title to the property. He produced a paper signed with the defendant's initials which the defendant had written as a memorandum of the agreement which is in the terms set out in the plaintiff's statement of claim, and he explains how it came into his possession. He testified that he agreed to sell the property on the 10th of September, 1896, for $450, $100 each year and the last year $150, with 5 per cent interest, and he to have the right to pay the whole. He produced the paper written by the defendant and signed with his initials, which, he said, was written when the bargain was made. He said that under this the defendant went into possession. He said that he left the bargain not fully complete\u2014that the defendant wrote the paper which he produced in his store, and told witness to carry the paper to Mr. Mack, solicitor, to get agreement written for sale of his property.\nOne, he said, would have a copy signed by the other, or however Mr. Mack would do it.\nHe adds:\nI asked him, that is Mr. Mack, to make the agreement; before I got the agreement made defendant took possession of the property; I was willing and knew defendant took possession and built a new building and filled in wharf; I saw 'him at work and made no objection; I after that knew defendant sold the property to Firth; I met the defendant in the street, and he asked me if the agreement was ready; I said I would go and see. This was some months after the sale; I left orders for the agreement to be made as soon as possible.\nHe then admitted the tender of the $510.54 accompanied with a letter dated 18th May, 1899, addressed by the defendant to the plaintiff as follows: Dear Sir,\u2014I herewith tender you $510.54 and demand a delivery of the deed with the usual covenants of the wharf property, &c., sold by you to me on September 10th, 1896, free from all incumbrances\u2014\nand he adds:\nthe money was offered me and he wanted me to sign the papers; I said I would not take it,\nthat is the money tendered.\nNow without referring to the evidence of the defendant, or to any other evidence, the plaintiff here admits the whole of the defendant's counterclaim for specific performance, and he establishes defendant's contention that it was agreed that the agreement verbally made should be reduced to writing and signed by the plaintiff. Upon this evidence the defendant was entitled to judgment upon his counterclaim, and judgment thereon was pronounced in his favour subject to this qualification that before he should receive from the plaintiff a good valid conveyance of the property with usual covenants and warranty he should pay to the plaintiff (in addition to the sum of $510.54 paid into the court which the prothonotary was ordered to pay out to the plaintiff) the costs of the action and of the counterclaim, thus making a new contract for the parties. The defendant's appeal from this judgment must prevail upon the filing of the counterclaim for specific performance. The plaintiff had no just ground for resisting that claim. Upon tender of the full amount of $510.54 he had no claim for any other sum than for such costs as he might have been entitled to as costs of his action. Had he submitted, as he ought to have done to the counterclaim, it would have been competent for the court to have adjudicated, and it, no doubt, would have adjudicated in respect of these costs. All the subsequent costs have, quite unnecessarily, been incurred by the plaintiff resisting the counterclaim by pleading upon the record the matters alleged therein, and which he is compelled to disprove himself when coming forward as a witness in his own behalf. Had the plaintiff submitted on the counterclaim to execute whatever deed the court should declare the defendant entitled to, and had he asked at the same time for his costs of action up to that time he would have, no doubt, I think, succeeded, and all the subsequent costs of this action and counterclaim wherein such a small amount pecuniarily is at stake would have been avoided. The plaintiff has already received under the judgment of the court the $510.54 paid into court to abide the judgment of the court on the counterclaim so that in the terms of the contract the defendant was entitled to his deed without his right thereto being qualified by payment of a further sum by way of costs or otherwise. He has succeeded substantially upon his counterclaim and was of right entitled to his costs thereof. The appeal should therefore be allowed with costs and the judgment of the court below varied by ordering the plaintiff to execute forthwith upon demand a good and sufficient conveyance in fee simple of the property in the pleadings mentioned to the defendant with the usual comments for good title, and by ordering the plaintiff to pay to the defendant when taxed all the costs of the counterclaim less the amount of the plaintiff's costs of the action up to the filing of the counterclaim, which costs are allowed to the plaintiff and to be set off against and deducted from the defendant's costs on the counterclaim. This is the utmost relief which, I think, can be granted to the plaintiff in this protracted litigation for the costs of which subsequent to the counterclaim, unnecessarily incurred, I think the plaintiff to be responsible.\nSEDGWICK J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice King. KING J.\u2014The appellant having succeeded in the courts of Nova Scotia upon his counterclaim for specific performance of the agreement sued on by the respondent, it was error to have made it a condition of his right to the specific performance claimed and allowed, that he should pay the costs of the unsuccessful party. And this is not merely a question of costs, but of substantive right.\nThe decree should be varied so as that the appellant should be entitled to his deed at once, the full amount of purchase money with interest being in the custody and under the control of the court.\nAs to the costs in court below of the appellant in respect of the counterclaim, they might be denied to the appellant, i.e. there might be no costs allowed one way or the other. This out of deference to the opinion of the courts below.\nAccordingly I would be favourable to this variation of the decree\u2014that the appellant be given the immediate right to receive a deed from respondent, but without costs in the court of first instance, and that respondent be entitled (as directed by the court below) to the costs of his original action.\nThat the appellant will have his costs of appeal in this court and his costs of appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I concur in the above judgment of Mr. Justice King.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Wade & Paton.\nSolicitor for the respondent: James A. McLean.\n[1] 33 N. S. Rep. 334.\n"}

There is no charge of negligence save that the authorities in charge of the ranges \"savaient que l'exercice du tir \u00e0 cet endroit, surtout avec les balles et fusils employ\u00e9s dans les derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es \u00e9taient dangereux pour les voisins\" The rifle range is not a public work within the meaning of sec. 16 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act, and, even assuming it to be so, the injury did not take place upon it, but in a field more than a mile and a half distant. The expression \"any officer or servant of the Crown\" in the section mentioned, does not include officers or men of the militia, which might (see R. S. C. ch 41, sec. 10) include all male inhabitants of Canada capable of bearing arms. There is no allegation or proof that militia regulations in respect to rifle practice have not been carried out, but on the contrary the ranges are shewn to be as safe as they could reasonably be made. It has not been shewn by whom the shot was fired that did the injury, and it is clear that if fired by any person not \"on duty,\" there can be no liability. The Militia Act, R. S. C., ch. 41, sec. 69, does not make any provision for compensation for injury to the person. We refer to The Queen v. McLeod[3]; The Queen v. Filion[4]; Black v. The Queen[5], Sourdat \"Responsabilit\u00e9,\" par. 87.\nThe judgment of the Court (Girouard J. dissenting) was delivered by:\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014On the 25th of September, 1897, the suppliant while working in his field upwards of a mile behind the targets of the C\u00f4te St. Luc rifle range, near Montreal, at a time when rifle practice was going on there, was wounded by a bullet presumably coming from the range. The property occupied by this range had been leased by the Government from one Descarries, on the 7th of June, 1888, under authority of an order of His Excellency-in-Council, of 12th January, 1888.\nThe suppliant brought this action in the Exchequer Court by petition of right against the Crown, claiming $10,000 for personal damages, alleging that the bullet which wounded him had been fired by one of the militiamen of Her Majesty who was practicing shooting at the place, and that\nles autorit\u00e9s d\u00e9pendant du d\u00e9partement de la milice qui ont le contr\u00f4le de ce champ de tir, savaient que l'exercice du tir \u00e0 cet endroit, surtout avec les balles et les fusils employ\u00e9s dans les derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, \u00e9taient dangereux pour les voisins.\nNo other act of negligence or ground of action is charged in the petition of right.\nThe judge of the Exchequer Court dismissed the action upon the ground that the rifle range was not a public work within the meaning of that term as used in the Exchequer Court Act, 50 & 51 Vict. c. 16, sec. 19, clause c. The appellant has failed in his endeavour to prove that he is aggrieved by that decision. The reasoning of the learned judge of the Exchequer Court upon this point seems to m\u00e8 unassailable, and I concur fully with all that he has said upon it without repeating it.\nThe section in question reads as follows:\nThe Exchequer Court shall also have exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine the following matters:\n(c) Every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property on any public work resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown, while acting within the scope of his duties or employment. I would say, apart from the reason that this rifle range was not a public work in the sense of the Act, that there is no evidence here that the suppliant's wounding resulted from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment, or that he suffered any injury on any public work. Moreover, it is not proved who fired the shot that wounded the suppliant. It may have been fired by one of the amateurs, or volunteers not on duty, who were there practising on that day with the men having what is called in the case, government practice.\nThen i do not see that the words \"any officer or servant of the Crown\" can be held to include the officers or men of the militia. It must not be lost sight of that the suppliant to succeed must come within the strict words of the statute. It is in evidence that the regulations of the Governor-in-Council, as to this range were all followed, and the\nautorit\u00e9s d\u00e9pendant du d\u00e9partement de la milice qui ont contr\u00f4le de ce champ de tir,\nhave not been proved to have been guilty of any negligence.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Charbonneau & Pelletier\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.

Fitzpatrick K.C. (Solicitor-General of Canada), and Archer, for the appellants, cited Jones v. Gooday ([1]); Thayer v. City of Boston ([2]); Waldron v. City of Haverhill ([3]): Seldon v. Village of Kalamazoo ([4]); Soulard v. city of Saint Louis ([5]); Meuller v. at. Louis and Iron Mountain Railroad Company ([6]); Banque d'Hochelaga v. Montreal, Portland and Boston Railway Company ([7]) The plaintiffs are entitled to recover indemnity for the land taken by ordinary action in the courts, as the city failed and refused within a reasonable time to take proper steps to have the indemnity fixed as provided by statute. This case is distinguished from The city of Montreal v. Hogan ([8]), which was a case of trespass where the city never had a title; here they have complete title and lawfully took possession of the property. Atwater K.C. and J. L. Archambault K.C for the respondent. The city is prohibited from proceeding with the expropriation on account of the circumstances contemplated by 59 Vict. ch. 49, sec. 17, and cannot go on until the financial position has improved. The proposition to take possession and widen the street, etc., was always subject to the observance of the formalities of expropriation which have not been, and for the present cannot be completed, by fixing the price and assessing parties liable for the special tax. These events not having happened the agreement became and remains ineffective, and plaintiffs have only a \u2022 choice between taking mandamus to compel the city to proceed and having their property restored to its former condition, recovering damages, if any, which they may have suffered in the meantime, d Otherwise they are bound to wait till conditions \"permit of the continuation of expropriation proceedings, now prohibited by the statute. The principle upon which the indemnity was assessed in the trial court by striking an average is also wrong and, in this case, resulted ' in excessive damages, which could not be sanctioned by an appellate court. We refer to Hollester v. The City of Montreal ([9]); The Grand Trunk Railway Company v. Coupal ([10]); and The City of Montreal v. Hogan ([11]). The city must be ruled to-day by the provisions-of 62 Vict. ch. 58, which also governs the plaintiffs in respect to their remedy.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nGIROUARD J. \u2014 This case affords another illustration of the glorious uncertainty of the law governing the City of Montreal. It would require the ingenuity of a Philadelphia lawyer, to use an old popular expression, to ascertain exactly where the powers of the city council end and the rights of the citizens commence Charters after charters, containing hundreds of clauses and sub-clauses, have been passed and repealed, the last two being in 1889 and 1899 without any indication of what is old or new law, so that the greatest confusion exists in almost everything. No laws have produced more litigation, and the decisions alone of the Privy Council and of this court in cases where the City of Montreal is a party would form almost one volume. This confusion we pointed out in Hollester v. The City of Montreal (1); Crawford v. The City of Montreal ([12]); and The City of Montreal v. Hogan (3).\nThese cases, like the present one, turned upon the application of section 17 of 59 Vict. ch. 49 :\u2014\nThe said council shall not be bound to make the improvements, the cost whereof in whole or in part has to be paid by the city, and which exceeds the limits of the power to borrow, without prejudice to recourse for damages, losses and expenses incurred by reason of the non-execution of the said improvement.\nThis Act was sanctioned and became law on the twenty-first of December, 1895.\nIt appears that at this time and for a few years previously, the appellants were proprietors of a valuable property known as Erskine Church, at the corner of St. Catherine and Peel streets, upon which they intended to erect stores. In 1894, architect Dunlop prepared plans for them with a view of making such alterations to the church building as would be necessary for a departmental store. On the second of November, 1894, the majority of the proprietors in the district sent the following petition to the city council *\nWe, the undersigned proprietors and taxpayers of St. Antoine Ward, respectfully suggest the immediate purchase of the strip of land about fifteen feet in width projecting into Peel street between St. Catherine street and Dominion Square\nWe understand that this property can be had at a reasonable price without any expropriation proceedings, and as the owners have applied for a permit to erect a building thereon, according to plans prepared by A. F. Dunlop, architect, it is essential that early action be taken.\nThis is a matter of great importance, as Peel street at that point is already too narrow for the traffic on it and must eventually be widened\nThe petition having received the recommendation of both the Road and Finance Committees the council at its session of the twentieth of May, 1895, adopted the said recommendation, which reads as follows:\nThat they have considered the accompanying petition and recommend that the line of the proposed widening of Peel street on the east side be extended to St. Catherine street, as shewn on plan hereunto annexed, so as to make said street of a uniform width between Dorchester street and St. Catherine street, in the St. Antoine Ward.\nThey further recommend that the city attorney be instructed to take the necessary steps to procure said change in the homologated plan of said St Antoine 'Ward. Consequently the city attorneys applied to the Superior Court for \u00e0 modification of the homologated plan of the city, which was granted by Mr. Justice Doherty on the eighth day of June, 1895.\nOn the nineteenth of June, 1895, the appellants forwarded to the city surveyor, Percival W. St. George, and the Road Committee, the following offer:\u2014\nHaving the intention to take advantage of the dispositions of the charter of the City of Montreal, relative to the annual expropriations which will take place according to section 222 of the charter, as amended by 54 Victoria, chapter 78, (Quebec), and being desirous and willing to cede and abandon to the said city that part of that immovable property designated as numbered fourteen hundred and fifty-seven, (1457), of the cadastre of St. Antoine Ward, in said city, which said part of immovable belonging to us is situated and comprised within the old line of Peel street and the new line, as it appears by the homologated plan of the said ward, we respectfully ask now from you to indicate the lines of said homologated plan as regards said part of said immovable property to be so expropriated in order that we may get the benefit of said cession so made the said city, and in order that said portion of immovable property be inscribed in the list of annual expropriations to be made during this year.\nWe, moreover, consent that the city should take at once possession of said land.\nThe offer was duly recommended by the Road and Finance Committees and, finally, on the twenty-third of August. 1895, the council adopted their reports, which read as follows:\u2014\nThat they have considered the accompanying offer of cession of a strip of land on Peel street according to section 222 of the charter as amended by the Act 54 Vict. chap. 78 and they recommend that said strip of land lying between the old line of Peel street and the homologated line of said Peel street be expropriated under the provisions of the law governing the annual expropriations and the said strip of land as shewn on plan hereunto annexed, be included in the list of properties to be expropriated this year.\nOn the tenth of October, 1895, the appellants wrote to the city clerk:\u2014 We are ready to allow the city to take possession of property necessary for the widening of Peel street as ceded by us some time ago from the old Erskine Church property and now awaiting the expropriation of the same. We ask also that \"firimite sidewalk\" be made both on Peel street and St. Catherine street as would willing to pay half the cost of the same. We are making important improvements upon the property and expect to have the same study for occupation on December 1st: we would, therefore, urge that this sidewalk be proceeded with at once.\nAn estimate of the cost of the firimite sidewalk was made by the city surveyor on the fourteenth of October, 1895, shewing that it would cost $ 1,334.95. The construction of this sidewalk was recommended by the competent committees, and on the eighteenth of November 1895 the council adopted their reports, which are in the following terms :\u2014\nThat they have considered the accompanying petition of F. Fairman and C. C. Holland and they recommend that a firimite sidewalk be laid outside of their property corner of Peel and St. Catherine streets at an estimated cost of one thousand three hundred and thirty-two dollars and ninety-five cense ($1,332.95) one half the cost thereof to be paid by the petitioners and the other half by the city.\nAs the season was too far advanced, this firimite sidewalk about twelve feet wide was not constructed till May 1896 and at the same time the balance of the land two and one-half feet was paved in asphalt as part of the carriage road; but in the fall of 1895, the corporation at once cut down a row of trees and laid down a temporary sidewalk and took possession of the piece of land in question fourteen and one-half feet by one hundred and seventy feet, making 2,487 square feet, says Mr. St. George, which was immediately open to the public and has ever since remained in the possession of the city as part of Peel street.\nNothing further was done towards fixing or paying the indemnity. The respondents thought that, armed with the new powers granted to them by the Legislature in December, 1895, they were not called upon to move. In September, 1896, they were sued for what the appellants alleged to be the value of the property forming, they alleged in their declaration, 2,486 feet in superficies, namely, eighteen dollars per square foot, or a total of $44,748. What was their answer They admit that they are bound to pay an indemnity under the expropriation laws, but only when the limits of their borrowing powers will permit them to do so, as provided for by section seventeen of 59 \"Vict., ch. 49 quoted above. In the alternative, they offer back the land, and at the argument before us invoked our decision in The City of Montreal v. Hogan ([13]).\nThe two cases are not alike. In the latter case there was no cession by the proprietor, no possession by order of the city council, but merely the tortious acts of its officers. Hogan alleged in fact that the city had taken possession of his land illegally. Here, on the contrary, the city has a valid title. The proprietors say so, and the city does not deny it, and could not deny it. Section 313 of the charter of 1889 which was then in force, enacts that the city may acquire any property required for public utility either \"by agreement or expropriation.'' The agreement was perfect, and the fact that the price to be paid was to be determined by the commissioners to be named by the court is not inconsistent with the validity of the cession, for even under the common law the price of sale may be determined by third parties to be named. Pother Vente nn. 24 and 25. Even section 222 as amended in 1890, by 54 Vict. ch. 18, sec. Y, recognizes the validity of such a cession. Expropriation, that is transmission of land, and payment of indemnity are two different things. The latter is a personal right which may be renounced by the proprietor, partly or wholly. He may be willing to rely upon the credit and good faith of the expropriating party. This indulgence is often in the best interests of all parties and it is not surprising to find it sanctioned by the jurisprudence of all modern countries. De Lalleau, nn, 753, 754; Am. & Eng. Encycl. of Law, vo. \" Eminent Domain,\" pp. 1102, 1144.\nThe city's pretention that under section 17 of the Act of 1895, 59 Vict. ch. 49, they are not bound to proceed, is altogether unfounded. This enactment applies only to future improvements, and not to past ones, for instance the enlargement of Peel street in the fall of 1895. The respondents understood this so well that in May, 1896, they laid down the pavement, asphalt m part on the carriage road, and the firimite sidewalk, in pursuance of the order of the council in 1895. They should have done more they should have demanded from the court the appointment of commissioners to fix the indemnity and collected the same.\nThe appellants are therefore entitled to their indemnity, without waiting any longer. If the respondents are called upon to pay otherwise than provided by the expropriation laws they have only themselves to blame. They even allege in their plea that they do not intend to proceed, and nothing else is left for the proprietors to do but to take their remedy at common law. They might perhaps have forced them to move by writ of mandamus, but the city cannot take advantage of that objection, as they were in default and now declare they will not act under the expropriating statutes.\nTwelve witnesses have been examined by the plaintiffs upon the question of value of the land and as many for the defendant. There is great variance in their opinions, as always happens in such cases ranging from five dollars to twenty-five dollars per foot. The trial judge (Lemieux J), who maintained the action considered all the witnesses equally competent and reliable and he therefore took the average of their figures, and acting upon that principle, which this curt condemned in The Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Coupal ([14]), allowed them about thirteen dollars per foot. \u2022 or a total of $32,818.00. Chief Justice Lacoste, who dissented in appeal considers that this amount is not too much, with due deference I believe it is not onl3 exaggerated but also arbitrary.\nThe appellants and one D. Graham bought and took possession of the Erskine Church property on the 23rd of September, 1892, although the deed was signed only on the 20th of April 1893. There was at that time quite a \"boom\" in real estate on St. Catherine street in the neighbourhood, where several of the large retailers of the lower town had already moved up, or were about to move. The price paid by the appellants was six dollars per square toot, or a total of $128,730.\nA summary of the registered transfers in that district proved in the case, shews that about six dollars per foot was the market price from 1889 to 1897. In 1889 only one sale was recorded, corner of Mansfield street bought by the Bank of Montreal for six dollars per foot. In 1890 and 1891 no transfer appears. In 1892 one for $2.33 and another for $9. In 1893, eight transfers, three below $6, two at $6, and one at $7.25, one at $9.86 and one at $11. In 1894, two transfers, one at $5 and the other at $9.92. In 1895, one at $5.70. In 1896 and 1897 to May one at $5.\nThe appellants paid cash $28,730 and the balance of $1000000 they promised, by the deed of sale, to pay on the 23rd of September 1897 with interest at the rate of five per cent from the 23rd of September 1892.\nOn the 17th of November, 1892, to avoid a partage or licitation Mr. Fairman purchased the one-third of Mr. Graham for $12,000; but if we take into consideration the one-third of the purchase money the latter paid in cash, namely $9,576.66, his share of the interest of the balance for nearly fourteen months, amounting to about $1,934, his share of the taxes, amounting altogether to $1,100, insurance and probably some law costs in relation to the transaction it is clear that Mr. Graham merely recouped himself without realising any profit. Up to the time of the expropriation, the plaintiffs received no rent and from the 1st of January, 1896, their tenants, H. and N. B. Hamilton, agreed to pay them $7,000 per annum and the taxes during the whole duration of the lease, viz., ten years. The landlords undertook to make certain alterations in the buildings, which they did during, the fall of 1895, but there is not the slightest evidence of their cost or value.\nThe rate of interest payable to the bailleurs de fonds establishes that, at the time of the expropriation, in 1895, the appellants considered that five per cent was the value of money. Witnesses for the plaintiffs, Bishop and Dunlop, who alone express an opinion upon the subject, think that real estate should bring a net return of six per cent says one, and four and one-half says the other. Probably five per cent is the correct figure, just as the rate of interest on money agreed to by the appellants. At that rate it will take $6,436 of the rental to pay the interest on the original purchase price, leaving only $564 per annum for insurance and wear and tear, without speaking of the alterations made in 1895, to make a church building suitable for a departmental store.\nThe wear and tear, insurance and taxes, Mr. Bishop, the only witness who speaks on the subject, values at one and one-half per cent, or about $1,930 per annum. We know that the taxes amount to $1,100, thus leaving $830 to be charged annually against the property for insurance and wear and tear. Under these circumstances, I would give the appellants six dollars per square foot, the price they paid or $14,916 with interest thereon from the 1st of November, 1895, date of the expropriation and possession, for which amount, judgment should be entered against the respondent, the whole with costs before all the courts\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Archer & Perron.\nSolicitors for the respondent; Ethier & Archambault.\n[1] 8 M. & W. 146.\n[2] 19 Pick.

S. Q. 1299.\nThe provisions of the Quebec Statute respecting the sale and management of public lands (32 Vict. ch. 11, R. S. Q. Art. 1299) do not authorize the cancellation of letters patent by the commissioner of Crown Lands where adverse claims to the lands exist.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side, (Boss\u00e9 and Cimon JJ. dissenting), reversing the judgment of the Court of Review, at Quebec, which set aside the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Quebec ([1]), and declared the letters patent of grant of the lands in question to the defendant null and void.\nThe facts of the case and questions at issue on this appeal sufficiently appear from the statement in the judgment of the court delivered by His Lordship Mr. Justice Girouard\nFitzpatrich K.C. (Solicitor-General of Canada) and L. A. Cannon for the appellant. The information seeks the cancellation of the letters patent granted to the defendant on the ground that they were so granted in error, the former letters patent granted of the same lands to the representatives of the late Hugh and John Montgomery having been illegally cancelled by the Commissioner of Crown Lands for the purpose of giving effect to an adverse claim. See 32 Vict. ch. 11 sec. 26; R. S. Q. art. 1299.\nJ. A. Lane for the respondent. The first letters patent issued were clearly wrong and consequently the commissioner had jurisdiction to cancel them. The information merely alleges that they were not legally revoked \" by indorsement;\" there is no allegation of the existence of any a adverse claim\" nor any proof of such to demonstrate that the commissioner had so exceeded his jurisdiction. This was a new point first raised on the appeal to the Court of Review and should not have been entertained. That judgment was ultra petita.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGIROUARB J.\u2014On the 13th of February, 1888, certain letters patent for lots twenty-eight and twenty-nine of the Township of Restigouche, were cancelled by the Commissioner of Crown Lands for the Province of Quebec, upon the ground that they had been issued by error to the legal representatives of John and Hugh Montgomery, instead of to the representa- tive of Thomas Montgomery, and subsequently, to wit on the 28th of April, 1888, new letters patent for the same lots were issued in favour of the said representative of the late Thomas Montgomery, who is the respondent. The commissioner alleged in his decree of revocation that he was empowered to do so by section twenty-six of the Quebec Statute, 32 Vict. ch. 11. He admits himself, and it is proved beyond doubt that the representatives of the late John and Hugh Montgomery had an adverse claim. He there fore acted without jurisdiction, and his act is ultra vires and utterly void. He should have left the parties to their remedy in the ordinary courts of the province. The section in question reads as follows:\nWhenever a patent has been issued to, or in the name of the wrong party, through mistake in the Crown Lands Department, or contains any clerical error, or misnomer, or wrong description of the land thereby intended to be granted, the Commissioner of Crown Lands, (there being no adverse claim) may direct the defective patent to be cancelled and a correct one to be issued in its stead which corrected patent shall relate back to the date of the one so cancelled and have the same effect as if issued at the date of such cancelled patent.\nFor this reason which is more fully developed by Mr. Justice Andrews in the Court of Review, and Mr Justice Cimon in appeal we are of opinion that the appeal must be allowed. The judgment of the Court of Review is restored and the said letters patent granted on the 28th of April, 1888, to the respondent for the said lots of land are anulled and declared void and of no effect, but without costs as both parties were in error the Commissioner of Crown Lands in exercising a power he did not possess, and the respondent in contending before all the courts that he had such power.\nAppeal allowed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fitzpatrick & Taschereau.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J. A. Lane.\n[1] Q. R. 18 S. C. 520.\n"}

Under this donation the donee and his vendees claimed title to thirty-six feet frontage as having been actually occupied by him and them since F took possession as owner in 1860, and also that plaintiff had acquired a prescriptive title by ten years possession without title, at the time of the action in 1897 to recover possession of the six feet then in occupation of the defendant, whom plaintiff alleged tobe a trespasser.\nHeld that the deed in 1868 operated as an interruption of prescription and limited the title to the thirty factet of frontage as therein described.\nThe plaintiff's wife purchased from F in 1885 by deed describing the emplacement in a manner similar to the description in the donation, but also making reference to its number on the Cadastral Plan of the Parish which described it as of greater width.\nHold, that the description in the deed of 1885 left the true limits of emplacement subject to determination according to the title held by the plaintiff's auteur which granted only thirty feet of frontage; that by the registered title, the plaintiff was charged with either actual or implied notice of this fact and that, consequently, he had not, in good faith, possessed more than the thirty feet of frontage under this deed and could not invoke an acquisitive prescription of title to the disputed six feet by ten years possession thereunder, and further, that no augmentation of the lands origin ally granted could take place in consequence of the cadastral description of the emplacement in question.\nThe words \" Tel que le tout est actuellement et que l'acqu\u00e9reur dit bien conna\u00eetre '' used in the deed of gift cannot be interpreted in contradiction of the special description that precedes them and can only be construed as extending \"dans les limites ci-dessus d\u00e9crites.\"\nA prescriptive title to lands beyond the boundaries limited by the description in the deed of conveyance can only be acquired by thirty years possession.\nQu\u00e6re\u2014Is a deed of sale of lands ii Quebec to a married woman without the authorization of her husband, sufficient to support a petitory action? Would such a deed be null for defect of form and insufficient, under article 2254 C.C., to serve as the ground for a prescription by ten years possession?\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Quebec, which dismissed the plaintiff's demand for damages, with costs and ordering boundaries to be established on a line giving a uniform width of thirty feet to the emplacement in question, the costs of such bornage in the action and in execution of the decree to be divided equally between plaintiff and defendant.\nThe facts of the case and questions at issue on this appeal are stated in the head-note and in the judgment by His Lordship Mr. Justice Taschereau.\nBelleau K. C. and C. E. Dorion for the appellant. The donation received its proper construction by the conduct of the parties in adopting the full width of the emplacement, thirty-six feet, \" tel que le tout est actuellement, \"etc., and their interpretation justified by eight years of previous possession, which continued thereafter down to the date of the troubles, must rule between their vendees as it did among themselves. It was followed by the cadastre in 1873, and, the deed of 1885 adopted the cadastral description, possession being continued of the full width there given to the emplacement under the new designation as lot No. 660. Arts. 1501 1503 C.C.; 1 Despeisses, t. 1, p. 47. There is in the deed a reference to the real limit on the west side of the lot mentioning the fence and ditch there, which the buyer is burdened with keeping in repair; this fence and ditch existed since 1860. The donee received and plaintiff acquired the lot with its superficial contents up to the fence.\nThe plaintiff being en communaut\u00e9 de biens, the purchase, although by his wife, made the community of which he is the head, proprietor of the lot, as a joint acquest of the community: arts. 1271, 1273 CO.\nIn any case we have acquired a title by thirty years possession (arts. 2210, 2242 C .C.) for the strip beyond the limit described in the deed, and the plaintiff has himself acquired indefeasible title by over ten years possession under the deed of 1885: (art. 2251 C.C.) We refer also to Munro v. Lalonde ([1]); T\u00batrault v. Paquette ([2]); Cummings v. Laporte ([3]); and Herrick v. Sixby ([4]), which latter case, although reversed in part in the Privy Council (L. R. 1 P. C. 436), is still in force on the point as to sales en bloc.\nL. A. Taschereau for the respondent. This action is really petitoire, while it concludes for bornage, and the onus of proof of title is upon the plaintiff. Any possession his auteurs may have had anterior to 1868 was interrupted by the acceptance of the donation then made; arts. 2185, 2227 0.C.; and the action in 1897 is within thirty years. The ten years prescription invoked must be limited to the thirty feet described in the deeds, The possession at any time of any land beyond the limits of these descriptions was equivocal and in bad faith. The deeds were registered and the plaintiff must be charged with knowledge of their contents and limitations.\nThe cadasire is not a title and the error therein confers no right of ownership (art. 2174 C.C.)\nAgain, the title is in the name of the plaintiff's wife and clearly the land is propre de communaut\u00e9 and the title insufficient to support a petitory action by the husband. The husband did not authorize or assist his wife in connection with her purchase and he was not present at the execution of the deed. It is therefore a nullity on the ground of informality and cannot avail in support of the claim by ten years possession (art. 2254 0.0.)\nTASCHEREAU J. Convaincre ses juges qu'un titre qui lui donne trente pieds de front lui conc\u00e8de le droit d'en avoir trente-six est a t\u00e2che ardue que l'appelant s'est impos\u00e9e dans cette cause.\nIl a failli devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour de R\u00e9vision. Nous ne voyons pas qu'il p\u00fbt en \u00eatre autrement.\nLe 22 juin, 1868, par acte notari\u00e9, Alexandre Parent (et uxor), donna \u00e0 son fils Fran\u00e7ois Celestin :\u2014\nUn lot de terre ou emplacement situ\u00e9 en la dite paroisse de Beauport, au lieu appel\u00e9 la C\u00f4te des P\u00e8res, de la contenance de trente pieds de front, (sans le chemin de dix pieds,) sur huit perches de profondeur borne en front, au nord, au chemin de la Reine, en arri\u00e8re au sud et du cot\u00e9 sud-ouest, \u00e0 d'autre terrain appartenant aux dits donateurs, et du cot\u00e9 nord-est \u00e0 la route servant de passage \u00e0 Fran\u00e7ois Charles Parent Phillippe Maheux et Louis Parent, ensemble avec la maison en boss dessus erig\u00e9e, circonstances et d\u00e9pendances, et tel que le tout est actuellement, se poursuit, comporte et s'\u00e9tend de toutes parts sans en rien excepter ni r\u00e9server\nAppartenant aux dits donateurs, le dit immeuble comme faisant partie de plus ample terrain donn\u00e9 au dit Alexandre Parent par feu. sieur Fran\u00e7ois Parent et Dame Marie Maheux, ses p\u00e8re et mere, ainsi qu'il appert par l'acte de donation pass\u00e9 devant Mtre. Chs. Maxime DeFoy, et son confr\u00e8re, notaires, \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, le douzi\u00e8me jour d'ao\u00fbt, mil huit cent vingt-cinq.\nLes donateurs d\u00e9clarent que l'immeuble ci-dessus d\u00e9crit et donn\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 par eux donn\u00e9 au dit donataire d\u00e8s l'ann\u00e9e mil huit cent soixante et que ce dernier a lui-m\u00eame b\u00e2ti la maison qui se trouve sur cet emplacement, mais qu'il ne lui avait jamais donn\u00e9 de titre authentique, et que la pr\u00e9sente donation est consentie pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 cela.\nC'est \"pourquoi les dits donateurs veulent et entendent que le dit-Fran\u00e7ois Celestin Parent jouisse, fasse et dispose comme bon lui semblera en pleine et enti\u00e8re propri\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 compter de ce jour et \u00e0 toujours du dit emplacement ci-dessus d\u00e9crit et donn\u00e9, en cons\u00e9quence ils lui c\u00e8dent transportent et abandonnent d\u00e8s maintenant et \u00e0 toujours, tous leurs droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement quelconques en et sur icelui; et veulent que le dit donataire en soit saisi et mis er bonne possession par qui et ainsi qu'il appartiendra, au moyen des pr\u00e9sentes.\nIl semble \u00e9vident \u00e0 la simple lecture de cet acte que tout ce qu'Alexandre Parent entend donner \u00e0 son fils, lui donne et reconna\u00eet lui avoir donn\u00e9 verbalement en 1860 c'est bien trente pieds et non trente-six, \u00e0 d\u00e9tacher de son terrain se r\u00e9servant implicitement, mais bien clairement tout le reste y compris les six pieds en litige.\nEt Si auparavant son fils en avait pris trente-six pieds il admet, sans \u00e9quivoque, par cet acte qu'il n'a de droit qu'\u00e0 trente pieds, et que l'exc\u00e9dant de six pieds appartient \u00e0 son donateur, qui refuse de lui en donner plus que trente et \u00e0 qui ii lui faut des lors remettre la possession de ces six pieds laquelle il avait usurp\u00e9e.\nEussent-ils le lendemain fait borner leurs propri\u00e9t\u00e9s et tirer la ligne de division entre eux ce n'est que trente pieds au sud comme au nord que la d\u00e9limitation aurait donn\u00e9s \u00e0 l'emplacement en question.\nCet acte du 22 juin, 1868 sous les circonstances, a indubitablement oper\u00e9 une interruption dans la ros- session de ces six pieds que Fran\u00e7ois C\u00e9lestin a Pu avoir jusqu'alors.\nCe n'est donc que de cette date que la prescription acquisitive de trente ans invoqu\u00e9e par l'action de l'appelant en revendication de ces six pieds sous forme d'action en bornage aurait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 courir, pour expirer le 22 juin 1898. Or c'est en 1897, diapr\u00e9s les all\u00e9gations de la d\u00e9claration m\u00eame on au plus tard le 4 mai, 1898, date du bornage par Lefran\u00e7ois, que l'intim\u00e9 en a pris possession. L'appelant ne pent donc r\u00e9ussir sur ce point\nL'article 2210 decr\u00e8te, ii est vrai que la prescription de trente ans peut avoir lieu acquisitivement en fait d'immeubles corporels pour ce qui est au del\u00e0 de la contenance du titre. Mais je l'ai dit l'appelant n'a pas eu sans interruption pendant trente ans la possession de ces six pieds.\nMais nous dit l'appelant, si je ne puis baser mon droit sur la prescription de trente ans, vu qu j'ai achet\u00e9 cet emplacement en 1885 de Fran\u00e7ois C\u00e9lestin Parent, et que j'ai depuis joui sans interruption jus qu'en 1897 de trente-six pieds de front en vertu de ce titre, jen ai acquis la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 par la prescription de dix ans.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a r\u00e9pondu comme suit \u00e0 cette partie de sa demande:\nConsidering that as the said sale by the said F. C. Parent to plaintiff's wife also restricts the limits of the lot sold to her to the sanie extent the plaintiff's claim to a greater width by reason of a title by prescription of ten years with title is also untenable.\nNous arrivons \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion. Voici comment est d\u00e9crite la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 vendue \u00e0 l'appelant dans cet acte de 1885;\nUn emplacement situ\u00e9 en la dite paroisse de Beauport, C\u00f4te des P\u00e8res, contenant trente pieds de front (sans le chemin de dix pieds qui se trouve au sud-ouest de la maison ci-apr\u00e8s mentionn\u00e9e ) sur huit perches de profondeur, born\u00e9 en front au nord an chemin de la Reine au sud et ax sud-ouest \u00e0 Sylvain Parent, (maintenant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9,) et au nord-ouest au chemin de sortie de Madame Dumontier representant Phillippe Maheu et autres avec ensemble la maison en boss dessus construite circonstances et d\u00e9pendances, le dit emplacement \u00e9tant le lot num\u00e9ro six cent soixante (660) des plan et livre de renvoi officiels du cadastre pour la dite paroisse de Beauport, tel que le tout est actuellement et que l'acqu\u00e9reur d\u00e9clare bien connaitre.\nAu sud et ax sud-ouest \u00e0 Sylvain Parent n'est \u00e9videm ment pas une limite pr\u00e9cise; la description laisse \u00e0 determiner \u00e0 quel endroit le terrain de Sylvain Parent, (maintenant l'intim\u00e9,) termine et o\u00f9 celui de l'acheteur, l'appelant, commence.\nL'\u00e9nonciation de la contenance dans cet acte \u00e9tait donc comme elle l'\u00e9tait dans la donation \u00e0 l'auteur de l'appelant essentielle et indispensable pour d\u00e9terminer ce qui \u00e9tait vendu, parce que l'emplacement, ii appert par l'acte, ne pouvait \u00eatre sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9 et distingu\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re certaine du terrain de l'intim\u00e9 on de ses auteurs que par la contenance.\nL'appelant, sur cette partie de la cause, prend pour admis qu'il a un titre pour ces six pieds. J'ai un titre, dit-il, j'ai joui pendant dix ans, donc j'ai acquis par prescription. Mais, c'est l\u00e0 prendre pour admis ce qui est de fait le point controvers\u00e9. Et s'il a un titre \u00e0 ces six pieds cadit questio; ii en \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire le lendemain de son achat tout aussi bien qu'apr\u00e8s dix,. trente ou cinquante ans. Et d'un autre cot\u00e9, s'il n'a pas de titre, la possession de dix ans ne lui en a pas acquis la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 par prescription.\nOr ce n'est que trente pieds que son titre lui donne. Ce n'est que trente pieds qu'il a achet\u00e9s de bonne foi, car il savait on est cens\u00e9 avoir su, par le bureau d'enregistrement, que son vendeur n'avait que cela par la donation de son p\u00e8re, et pas un pouce de plus. Il n'a pas poss\u00e9d\u00e9 les autres six pieds en vertu de son titre. Le cadastre, il est vrai, donne trente-six pieds \u00e0 cet emplacement, mais c'est l\u00e0 une erreur dont l'ap pelant ne peut se pr\u00e9valoir de bonne foi. L'article 2174 du Code d\u00e9cr\u00e8te expressement que nulle erreur dans la description ou l'\u00e9tendue d'un terrain inscrit au cadastre ne peut \u00eatre interpret\u00e9e comme donnant \u00e0 une partie plus de droit que ne lui en donne son titre. Et le cadastre n'est pas son titre. Il n'y est fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans son acte d'achat que parce que la loi devenue alors en force obligeait le notaire de le faire. Art. 2168 C. C. C'est dans les bornes fix\u00e9es par son acte d'achat exclusivement que ses droits reposent or ii n'y a, dans cet acte, que la contenance qui indique ces bornes, qui puisse guider la d\u00e9limitation de son terrain. Il est impossible d'y voir la vente d'une chose certaine et determin\u00e9e, sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 la contenance, pr\u00e9vue par l'article 1503 du Code Civil Cet article r\u00e9git entre vendeur et acheteur Mais c'est avec son voisin qu'il doit borner non pas avec son vendeur. Cette diff\u00e9rence cependant, n'a pas importance dans l'esp\u00e8ce. L'appelant lui-m\u00eame admet qu'il y a erreur dans le cadastre, car ii r\u00e9clame un emplacement plus large au sud qu'au nord tandis que le cadastre lui donnerait une \u00e9gale largeur \u00e0 chaque extr\u00e9mit\u00e9.\nLes mots \" tel que le tout est actuellement et que l'acqu\u00e9reur dit bien conna\u00eetre e style de notaire ne peuvent s'interpr\u00e9ter dans les deux actes en question, qu'avec l'addition des mots \"dans les limites ci-dessus d\u00e9crites.\" 11 est impossible de leur donner une signification que les mettrait en contradiction avec la description sp\u00e9ciale que les prec\u00e8de.\nOn peut prescrire au del\u00e0 de son titre, dit l'appelant. C'est vrai. L'acqu\u00e9reur d'un terrain determine peut prescrire la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d'un terrain plus \u00e9tendu que celui qui lui est attribu\u00e9 par son titre. Mais non pas par la prescription de dix ans. Ce n'est que par trente ans qu'il peut prescrire la partie non comprise dans son titre, la partie au del\u00e0 de son titre.

G.\nB having a hotel scheme under promotion, agreed to purchase an old building from R in order to prevent it falling into the hands of persons who might use it for a brewery and thereby cause a nuisance and ruin his enterprise. R by falsely representing that he had a serious offer for the purchase or lease of the property for the purpose of a brewery, induced B to close on his agreement and take a deed of the property, the payment of the price being deferred On discovery of the falsity of these representations B notified R that he repudiated the contract and invited him to bring an action to test its validity if he was unwilling to give a release and take back the property. The vendor delayed some time in taking action for the recovery of the price and, in the meantime, B remained in possession and collected the rents.\nHeld, that, under the provisions of the Civil Code, as the vendor had made false representations which deceived the purchaser as to the principal consideration for which he contracted, he could not recover; that the purchaser had a right to have the contract rescinded on the ground of error; that under the circumstances, the delay in bringing the action could not be imputed as larches of the defendant nor waiver of his right to have the contract set aside and that defendant's administration of the property in the meantime could not be construed as ratification of the contract.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench appeal side, reversing the judgment of the Court of Review, at Montreal, and restoring the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, by which the plaintiff's action had been maintained with costs.\nThe defendant was interested in a hotel enterprise at Chambly in connection with which he was attempting to organize a joint stock company, the proposed site for the building being close to old barracks belonging to plaintiff which had at one time been used as a brewery but had fallen into ruin without any real saleable value. For the purpose of preventing the re-establishment of a brewery, which might prove a nuisance in the immediate vicinity of the proposed summer hotel and ruin his important enterprise, the defendant secured from the plaintiff a right of pre emption or option to purchase the barracks property in case any offer should be made to buy or rent it by persons likely to use it again as a brewery. Some time afterward three strangers visited Chambly and looked over the property, making remarks about its suitability for brewing lager beer if the water m the river could be used for that purpose but they made no definite offer either to rent or purchase. The plaintiff immediately instructed his solicitor to insist upon the defendant exercising his option at once, otherwise that he would deal with the strangers who were offering to buy or lease for a long term and utilize the barracks as a brewery. The defendant was pressed to close upon this representation and purchased the property at a price considerably above its actual market value, receiving a conveyance and becoming a party to the deed covenanting to pay the price at a subsequent date therein stated. On discovering that he had been led into error, in thus purchasing, through misrepresentations, the defendant refused to carry out his bargain, invited the plaintiff to take back the property or to sue upon the covenant, if he wished to test its validity and ill the meantime Collected. the rents and looked after the administration of the property of which he had received possession. After some considerable delay the action was taken, to which it was pleaded that the defendant had been induced to purchase through fraudulent misrepresentations, and that his obligation was vitiated by error as to the moving consideration and by the artifices used to mislead him into making the bargain when there was not any chance of the strangers either buying or renting the property for the purpose of using it as a brewery.\nThe Superior Court, (Davidson J.) maintained the plaintiff's action, but this judgment was reversed unanimously by the Court of Review (Sir Melbourne Tait A. C J. and Mathieu and Gill JJ.) The present appeal is from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench reversing the Court of Review and restoring the trial court judgment, W\u00fcrtele and Ouimet JJ. dissenting.\nAtwater K.C. and Beauchamp K.C. for the appellant. Error was the determining cause of the contract, induced by misrepresentations made by the plaintiff as to a serious offer having been made. No want of diligence can be imputed to the defendant, for he notified the plaintiff of his repudiation of the contract as soon as he was made aware of the falsity of the representations and as the plaintiff would not take back the property and give a release he put him en demeure to enforce specific performance by suit to test the validity of the obligation. it was through no fault of the defendant that plaintiff hesitated and delayed the action. The administration of the property in the meantime was no waiver or ratification, but a duty legally imposed on the defendant who was obliged to hold possession and collect the rents until the questions in difference were determined.\nThe contract was entered into as the result of man\u0153uvres without which the other party would not have contracted and it should be annulled at the demand of the party who has been deceived, even though there is no fraud.

The solicitor acted on the plaintiff's instructions in misleading defendant and the fraud thus practiced by the agent may be set up against the principal, in the sense that the nullity of the contract by reason of fraud could be demanded as against the principal. 1 B\u00e9darride, \" Dol. et Fraude,\" nn. 78-81.\nFitzpatrick K.C. (Solicitor General of Canada) and Lafleur K.C. for the respondent. It is clear that there was no fraud contemplated by plaintiff, nor was there\n34 L. C. Jur. 294. (6) 27 Can. S. C. R. 510. even a false statement made. The plaintiff was convinced that the strangers who had visited the property seriously intended to buy or lease, and fearing the loss of a market for the property, called upon the defendant either to exercise or abandon his option. The consideration inducing defendant to purchase was good and sufficient and he ratified his bargain by many subsequent acts, held possession, interested himself to secure exemption from taxes, collected rents and so forth from the date of his purchase, 20th April, 1896, till suit, 9th September. 1897. This is a waiver and operates to estop defendant from having the contract annulled. This long delay was allowed to elapse although defendant was aware of all the facts material to his defence in Jane, 1897. The facts have been found in the plaintiff's favour by the trial judge who saw and heard the witnesses, and cannot be reconsidered on appeal.\nWe refer to Paradis v.

([16]).\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014Il serait inutile de relater ici an long les faits nombreux que ce dossier pr\u00e9sente. Monsieur le juge Sir Melbourne Tait, en a fait une analyse d\u00e9taill\u00e9e et si compl\u00e8te qu'il me suffit d'y r\u00e9f\u00e9rer. Nous en sommes venus, avec la Cour de Revision, \u00e0 la conclusion que l'appelant n'a achet\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question que parce que l'intim\u00e9 lui avait dit ou fait dire que Cummings avait offert de l'acheter ou de la louer pour en faire une brasserie. Or il ressort clairement de la preuve que Cummings n'a jamais fait une telle offre. L'intim\u00e9 ne pourrait pas soutenir que si l'appelant n'eut pas achet\u00e9, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 serait pass\u00e9e entre les mains de Cummings, ni alors, ni en aucun temps depuis. Cummings et ses associ\u00e9s jurent positivement qu ils n'ont jamais fait d'offres \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 lors de leur visite \u00e0 Chambly, et n'ont jamais eu l'intention d'en faire depuis.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 a mis l'appelant en demeure quand ii n'y avait pas le moindre danger que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 passe en d'autres mains, bien plus, avant m\u00eame qu'il ait vu Cummings. Qu'il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 coupable de fraude dans le sens vulgaire de ce mot, ii a droit au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du doute. Mais qu'il f\u00fbt de bonne foi ou non, ne peut affecter la question. Il est peut-\u00eatre possible qu'il n'ait pas eu le dessein de tromper l'appelant, mais ii la tromp\u00e9 tout de m\u00eame, et force \u00e0 acheter de suite dans la crainte que s'il n'achetait pas, Cummings acheterait. Il l'a mis dans l'erreur et c'est cette erreur qui a \u00e9t\u00e9, pour l'appelant, la causa contractui, la consid\u00e9ration principale qui l'a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 \u00e0 acheter pour me servir des termes m\u00eames du Code art. 992. Son consentement a \u00e9t\u00e9 surpris.\nSans doute l'erreur sur le motif d'un contrat n'est pas g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement une cause de nullit\u00e9. Mais ce n'est pas sur son motif que l'appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 induit en erreur dans l'esp\u00e8ce, mais bien sur le seul fait que l'a d\u00e9termine \u00e0 acheter, le fait d'une offre s\u00e9rieuse de Cummings. Et d'ailleurs, quand l'erreur dans le motif, dans la cause impulsive d'un contrat, r\u00e9sulte de l'artifice, dol, ou des fausses representations d'une des parties contractantes, la partie tromp\u00e9e a le droit de demander la resolution du contrat. La lettre \u00e9crite par l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 Monsieur Sicotte le seize mars n'est pas justifi\u00e9e par la preuve. Son imagination \u00e9tait sans doute surexcit\u00e9e. Il s'est fait illusion et a pris pour accompli ce qu'il pensait devoir arriver et pouvoir pr\u00e9voir. Tant qu'\u00e0 Monsieur Sicotte, personne n'a song\u00e9, devant nous du moins \u00e0 mettre sa bonne foi en doute. E l'appelant n'avait pas raison d'\u00eatre injuste \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, comme il l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 dans les questions qu'il lui a pos\u00e9es comme t\u00e9moin.\nTant qu'\u00e0 l'engagement que l'intim\u00e9 avait pris envers l'appelant de lui donner l'option d'acheter, on ce qui est appel\u00e9 au dossier le droit de pr\u00e9emption, on la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence (the refusal., la preuve en est si claire, que tant en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et en Cour de Revision, qu'en Cour d'Appel, ii ne semble pas y avoir en le moindre doute \u00e0 ce sujet. L'intim\u00e9 d'ailleurs dans sa d\u00e9position a d\u00fb l'admettre Mais cc fait n'est peut-\u00eatre pas essentiel. Si sans cet engagement l'intim\u00e9 eut obtenu de l'appelant son consentement \u00e0 ce contrat par la fausse repr\u00e9sentation que Cummings avait offert d'acheter de suite les pr\u00e9misses pour en faire une brasserie, le consentement de l'appelant aurait tout de m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenu sous de faux pr\u00e9textes.\nTant qu'\u00e0 la pr\u00e9tendue ratification par l'appelant nous adoptons l'opinion de Monsieur le juge Tait sur ce point comme sur tous les autres. L'Appelant a r\u00e9pudi\u00e9 son achat aussi promptement qu'il lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 possible de le faire. Au lieu de prendre une action lui-m\u00eame, ii a somm\u00e9 l'intim\u00e9 de prendre l'initiative; et si celui-ci a retard\u00e9 de ce faire, l'appelant ne peut en souffrir. Il a administr\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, c'est vrai, mais, sons les circonstances, c'\u00e9tait son devoir de le faire en attendant que la justice prononce sur le diff\u00e9rend entre lui et l'intim\u00e9.\nNous sommes unanimement d'avis d'allouer l'appel avec depens et de r\u00e9tablir le jugement de la Cour de Revision avec frais dans toutes les cours contre l'intim\u00e9.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Beauchamp & Bruch\u00e9si.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lafleur & Macdougall.\n[1] 34 L.

[1897] ch. 160) and if he negligently allows an open car to come in contact with a passing vehicle whereby the conductor, who is standing on the side in discharge of his duty, is struck and injured the electric company is liable in damage for such injury.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (27 Ont. App. R. 151) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe facts presented on the appeal were as follows:\nOn the 29th of June, 1899, the respondent, Snell, was in the employ of The Toronto Railway Company, as a conductor on their line of street railway in the City of Toronto. For thirteen years he had been employed in a similar capacity not only by the defendants, but by the company who owned the franchise before it came into the hands of the defendants by purchase from the City of Toronto. On the evening of the 29th of June, Snell was performing his duties as conductor on one of the open cars of the defendants operated by electricity on Queen Street East, a leading thoroughfare in the City of Toronto. In these open cars the seats are placed across the car and there is no aisle or passage for the conductor to pass from the rear to the front of the car for the purpose of collecting fares or performing his other duties. The only way the conductor can go from one end of the car to the other to collect the fares is by a side step or running board extending along the outside of the car. About 8.15 on the evening in question, Snell was standing on the running board and had just collected a fare from a passenger. On the track in front of the car and going in the same direction was a wagon with a load of furniture. This wagon was in the act of pulling off the track and had pulled off a sufficient distance to clear the car but not to clear Snell standing on the running board. The motorman, without slackening speed, ran the car at the rate of eight miles an hour past the wagon. The wagon or the load came in contact with Snell, throwing him violently to the ground. It is for the injuries sustained by him by being thus knocked off the car that he brought action against the defendants.\nThe respondents\u2019 cause of action arises under R.S.O. ch. 160, section 3, subsection 5, The Workmen\u2019s Compensation for Injuries Act: \u201cWhere personal injury is caused to a workman by reason of the negligence of any person in the service of the employer, who has charge or control of any points signal, locomotive, engine, machine, or train upon a railway, tramway or street railway, the workman, or in case the injury results in death the legal personal representatives of the workman, and any persons entitled in case of death shall have the same right of compensation and remedies against the employer as if the workman had not been a workman of, nor in the service of, the employer nor engaged in his work.\u201d\nThe question for decision was: Was the motorman an employee in charge of a machine or engine on the appellant\u2019s street railway under this section?\nThe case was tried with a jury who found that the motorman was guilty of negligence. Judgment was entered for the plaintiff and the damages assessed at $1,200. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, from whose judgment the defendant appealed to the Supreme Court.\nBicknell for the appellant.\nRobinette and Godfrey for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE and SEDGEWICK, KING and GIROUARD JJ., were of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs, for the reasons given in the Court of Appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014There is no dispute as to the facts in this case. The only question in the appeal is whether or not the motorman on an electric street railway is the person having control of the movement of the train of which he is the motorman within the meaning of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. The learned trial judge held that he was; the defendants, on the contrary, insists that he is not, and that the conductor, the injured man in the present case, is. Apart from this contention, no objection whatever has been taken to the learned trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury, and none indeed could be, for in every particular it was a most fair charge. In so far as the present case is concerned, that is to say as to an injury alleged to have been caused by the manner in which the train is propelled by the motorman, he is necessarily the person having control of the car within the meaning of the statute referred to. There being no other point raised in this case, the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: James Bicknell.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Robinette & Godfrey.\n[1] 27 Ont.

(dissenting.)\u20141. A new point should never be entertained on appeal if evidence could have been brought to affect it had objection been taken at the trial. 2. In the present case, the concurrent findings of both courts below, amply supported by evidence ought not to be disturbed, and as the company itself prevented the performance of the condition of the agreement in question requiring the assent of the Government to the transfer of the binder twine manufacturing contract, its non-performance cannot be admitted as a defenece to the action upon the executed contract.\nGwynne J. also dissented on the ground that the judgment appealed from proceeded upon wholly inadmissible evidence and that therefore, the action should have been dismissed and further, that the evidence which was received and acted on though inadmissible for the purposes for which it was intended, shewed that the action was based upon a contract between the plaintiffs and defendant for the commission of an indictable offence; that neither party could recover either by action or by counter-claim upon such a contract and, therefore, that the incidental demand, as well as the action should be dismissed\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court sitting in review, at Montreal, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court District of Montreal which maintained the plaintiffs' action to the extent of $22 -824 48 with interest thereon at eight per cent per annum from 1st October, 1896, until paid, and the interest at the same rate on $4880.26 from 1st October 1896 to the 18th of April 1898 and costs and further dismissing' the defendant's incidental demand with costs.\nThe circumstances under which litigation arose in this case and the questions at issue upon the appeal are stated in the above headnote and in the judgments reported.

Does the evidence establish a conspiracy or illegal combination between the parties affecting public interests?\n2. If so, can the court take notice of it, although, not pleaded or set up in the factums, or argued at the hearing?\n3. And finally if both questions be answered in the affirmative, are the parties or either of them entitled to an account of the moneys paid and received in the course or by reason of the illegal dealings and operations of the parties and recover the same, or should the court refuse to entertain the action?\"\nHis Lordship Mr. Justice Taschereau dissented from the order and said: \"I do not take part in this order. I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\" His Lordship's reasons for this judgment appear below.\nHis Lordship Mr. Justice Sedgwick concurred in the order, and His Lordship Mr. Justice King said: \"I am of opinion that the questions framed by Mr. Justice Girouard for a re-argument of the appeal are appropriate they seem to me to be material\" and he concurred in the order. On 7th March 1901 it was ordered that the re-argument should take place after the hearing of the Ontario Appeals at the Winter Sessions and, on 8th March, 1901, an order was made dispensing with the re-argument, discharging all orders and directions therefor, and the case stood for judgment as it was at the close of the hearing in November, 1900.\nOn the 28th of March, 1901, Their Lordships Justices Gwynne, Sedgwick, King and Girouard being present, (His Lordship Mr. Justice Taschereau, refusing to take any part, and not present,) judgment on the merits was pronounced by the majority of the court, Gwynne J. dissenting, by which the appeal on the principal demand was dismissed in part with costs, the judgment appealed from being reduced and the appellant condemned to, pay to the respondents $18,-044.86 with interest thereon from the 23rd of December 1896 and costs in all the courts, and the judgment appealed from on the incidental demand was affirmed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU.J \u2014On this appeal, which presents very little else but questions of fact, we would all be of opinion to confirm the judgment in the case that has been tried argued and determined in the court of first instance, that has been argued and determined in the Court of Review and that has been argued here on both sides. But it is now suggested for the first time that the case should be determined upon a ground never taken at bar, never argued here or in the two courts below and never tried in the court of first instance. Now, that is an untenable proposition.\nI should have thought that if a new point, as the one suggested, had, in our opinion, necessarily to be determined the rational conclusion would have been,\n*Reasons for dissenting judgment of 7th December, 1900. if not to remit the case to the court below at least to order that the parties should be heard here upon it.\nHow fraught with danger of doing injustice is the course proposed, it is unnecessary to insist upon.\nIf such a point had been taken at the trial evidence to meet it might have been given. The whole matter might have been explained. And it is \u00e0 rule, never to be departed from, that a new point in appeal should not be allowed to be taken if evidence could have been brought to affect it had it been taken at the trial.\nTo me it seems almost incredible that it could be proposed, upon mere conjectures and suspicions, to find these parties guilty of conduct amounting to a crime punishable by seven years penitentiary, not only without ever having heard them upon that charge, but even when they have never been charged or accused of it.\nAs to the merits of the case that was argued and determined in the two courts below the only case that has been submitted for our consideration, the appeal entirely fails. The concurrent findings of the two courts is, upon overwhelming evidence, that as regards the tender and contract and in the taking possession of and working of the binder twine business in the Central Prison, leased to P. L. Connor by the contract of 25th September, 1895, and which was subsequently transferred to Robert Heddle the said Connor and Heddle were but the pr\u00eate-noms and salaried representatives of the defendants and acted on their behalf and in their interest under their control and for their exclusive profit that for the purpose of the tender contract and working of said business which had been carried on by the defendants since the said 25th of September 1895, the plaintiffs advanced and procured for the defendants, at the agreed rate of interest, the sums mentioned in the declaration and that the plaintiffs fulfilled all their obligations towards the defendants under the agreement of the 29th of February, 1896; that at their request they caused a transfer of the contract of the 25th of September, 1895, to he made to Robert Heddle, the pr\u00eate-nom and employee of the defendants, and also furnished the capital required for operating the said business and that this transfer would have received the consent of the Lieutenant-Grovernor-in-Council, if Heddle, under the advice of the defendants had not withdrawn his demand to that effect.\nThe appellant's contention, based upon the condition. requiring the consent of the Lieutenant-Goernoing Council to the transfer of the contract in quisti\u00f3n amounts to nothing else than a fraudulent attempt on its part to the rid of its responsibilities. Under the circumstances of the case, the appellant cannot now be admitted to avail itself of that defence upon an executed contract.\nSir Melbourne Tait in the Court of Review has fully demonstrated this. I do not see anything that can. be added to his comments upon the case.\nGWYNEE J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal presents a most singular case of what the plaintiffs in the action, the now respondents, claim to be the simple case of money lent and advanced by the plaintiffs to the defendants and paid to and for their use at their request. To establish this contention a volume of 500 pages of printed matter containing the pleadings, evidence and reasons for the judgment now in appeal, and 49 pages of printed matter in an argument presented to us by the respondents in their factum have been deemed to be necessary an unusual circumstance in the case of a simple action to recover money lent and advanced to and to the use of the defendants at their request. The declaration, in which the plaintiffs' cause of action is asserted, alleges that on the 29th day of, February 1896 the defendants were indebted to the plaintiffs in divers sums of money, to wit, in the sum of $5,000 advanced for their benefit by the plaintiffs and deposited with the Government of the Province of Ontario to accompany a tender for the obtaining of a contract for the manufacture of binder twine at the Central Prison at the City of Toronto, and at their request and in the further sum of $7,350 for a like sum constituted a first charge on the earnings of said manufacturing institution at the sad Central Prison at Toronto and taken over by plaintiffs in settlement of a certain claim due them, and accepted by the said defendants as a debt and charged, on. said business to be repaid by them, and the further sun of $22,048.52 advanced by the plaintiffs at the' request of, said; defendants and invested in the said business and. interest on the said different amounts and lastly for an overcharge on a certain lot of twine amounting to $803.30.\" The declaration then alleges that on the. 29th day of February 1896 the said plaintiffs and the defendants acting by and through their general manager one Elisha M. Fulton entered into a certain written agreement whereby it was agreed and covenanted that the plaintiffs should transfer to the defendants the right from the Government of the Province of Ontario to manufacture binder twine in the Central Prison which contract P. L. Connor had already transferred to them, and further, that the plaintiffs would furnish the defendants with the necessary capital to carry on the business of manufacturing twine at said Central Prison during the then ensuing season of 1896 and that they should obtain necessary discounts with the assistance of the defendants from the Dominion Bank of Toronto and that at least $40,000 of the sum furnished should be repaid between the 1st and 15th days of June then next and as to the balance all the moneys invested by the plaintiffs in the said business were to be repaid by the 1st day of October then next save and except the aforesaid mentioned sum of $7,350, the repayment of which sum was to extend over the first two years of the Government contract.\nThe declaration then proceeded to claim in the. itemized account the said several sums of $5,000 as advanced on the 21st August 1895 with interest thereon from that date; $7350 as advanced on the 25th day of September, 1895, with interest thereon from that date; $22,048.22 as advanced on November 7th 1895 with interest thereon from that date and certain other items amounting in the whole (after deduction of certain sums entered therein as, credits) to $34,054.74 which sum with interest thereon at 8 per cent since October 1st, 1896, is what the plaintiffs claimed in the action.\nNow here it is to be observed that the declaration contains no averment of the performance by the plaintiffs of any of the acts by the agreement of the 29th of February, 1896, covenanted to be performed by them, nor of any advances having been made by the plaintiffs to the defendants under the clause in that agreement by which they undertook to furnish the necessary capital to carry on the business of manufacturing twine in the Central Prison during the season of 1896. The sole claim made by the declaration is in respect of the principal sums of $5,000, $7,350 and $22,088.22 alleged to have been advanced to the defendants at the respective dates aforesaid of the 21st of August, 25th of September and 7th November, 1895, together with interest thereon and a few other items not appar ently connected with the agreement of 23th of February, 1896.\nTo this declaration the defendants pleaded;\n1st plea: A general denial.\n2ndly. A special plea that the plaintiffs never performed the essential condition precedent necessary to the contract of 29th February, 1896, going into effect and becoming binding upon the company defendant, and never gave and secured to the defendants the object and consideration of their said contract, to Wit, the right from the Government of Ontario to manufacture binder twine at the Central Prison for the period mentioned in the contract of the 25th of September, 1895, but wholly failed to secure such right to the defendants. And\n3rdly. A plea in thirty-four paragraphs which is in substance and effect an amplified, repetition of the matters pleaded in and covered by the two previous pleas coupled with a long argument insisting with great prolixity upon the particular points in which the plaintiffs failed in the performance off their covenant in the said agreement, as had been pleaded in the said second plea. All of which matters, assuming the defendants'' construction of the agreement of 29th of February to be correct, were matters the performance of which it was necessary for the plaintiffs to have averred in their declaration, and to establish in evidence in order to succeed in an action against the defendants for breach of their covenants contained in the instrument.\nNow as to the second plea the averments therein contained although proper and essential in an action or an incidental demand instituted by the defendants against the plaintiffs for breach of their covenants in the: instrument were quite inappropriate and unnecessary as a plea by way of defence to an action framed as the cause of action set out in the declaration in the present case is wherein the contention of the plain-tiffs simply is that the true construction of the instrument of February, 1896, is that the defendants thereby covenanted to pay to the plaintiffs moneys then due for money previously lent and advanced by the plaintiffs to and for the use of the defendants at their request a point determinable by the construction of the instrument.\nThe whole of the matters in the third plea ( it must I think, be admitted,) were also wholly irrelevant and unnecessary and improper to be set out upon the record as a \"olea to the cause of action as set out in the declaration. A few of the paragraphs will serve as a specimen of the whole.\nThe fourth paragraph avers simply a fact appearing on the face of the contract of the 25th September, 1895, mentioned in the declaration, namely, the names and description of the several parties thereto.\nThe fifth paragraph simply stated what was the provision contained in the seventeenth paragraph of the said contract of the 25th of September, namely, that\nthe contractor shall not assign this agreement or sublet the same without the consent of the lieutenant in council.\nThe plea in its sixth paragraph averred that the contractor referred to in paragraph seventeen of the contract was the said P. L. Connor and the Lieutenant Governor in Council referred to was the Lieutenant Governor of the Province of Ontario and the Executive Council of that province.\nIn the seventh paragraph the plea averred that the said Lieutenant Governor in Council had never assented to any assignment of the said contract by the said P. L. Connor to the plaintiffs. In the eighth paragraph il was averred (in short substance) that it was a condition precedent to any obligation undertaken by defendants by the agreement of February, 1896, without which they would not have entered into that agreement that the said plaintiff should lawfully assign the said contract of the 25th September 1895 to the defendants in accordance with said seventeenth paragraph thereof, viz., with the assent and approval of the Lieutenant Governor in Council.\nIn the ninth paragraph it was averred that by the said agreement of February, 1896, the plaintiffs undertook and agreed that the said contract of the 25th September, 1895, should be legally transferred to the defendants with the consent of the Lieutenant Governor in Council.\nIn the tenth paragraph it was averred that the plaintiffs had frequently acknowledged and submitted, as was the fact, that they Were bound to transfer the said contract and to procure the assent of the Lieutenant Governor in Council thereto and that without such transfer the defendants never consented to, authorised or incurred any liability to the defendants.\nBy paragraph twenty-seven it was averred that without a due and legal transfer of the said contract of the 25th of September, 1895, duly assented to by the Lieutenant Governor in Council the said defendants would not have had any locus standi in and with respect to the said prison plant and would have been without any right or title to conduct the said operations and as a matter of fact the said prison authorities never in any manner or form recognised the said defendants in any manner in connection with the said prison plant hut always dealt in respect thereto, with the said P. L. Connor and his representatives. All these matters (and all the other paragraphs of this third plea are of similar nature) constitute simply an argument in support of the defendants construction of the contract of .February. 1896. and seem to have been inserted solely for the purpose of meeting the plaintiffs' construction of that agreement as appearing in their declaration to the effect that it was entered into merely in respect of, and to prescribe the times of payment of sums of money antecedently lent and advanced by the plaintiffs to the defendants at their request. These several matters so with great prolixity set out upon the record did not in reality constitute any issuable pleading by way of defences to the cause of action set out in the declaration which as already observed, was for the recovery of sums alleged to have been lent and advanced by the plaintiffs to the defendants at their request prior to the 29th of February 1896 and by that instrument covenanted to be paid at the times therein mentioned with interest as therein mentioned.\nThe plaintiffs by way of answer to the above pleas pleaded to the said second plea as follows:\nThat each, and all and every of the allegations of said plea is and are false except in so far as the same may be specially hereinafter admitted. That as appears by the allegations of the plaintiffs' declaration the defendants were indebted to the plaintiffs for the causes set out in the said declaration prior to the agreement of the 29th of February, 1896, which the said defendants' plea calls the \u201c pretended contract which is invoked by the plaintiffs, and which is really the sole (\u00a1round of their pretended demand against defendants,\" and that the said agreement only fixed the date of the repayment of said sums advanced long previously by the plaintiffs to the defendants at their request and for their benefit in connection with the Central Prison binder twine contract.\"\nAnd further among other things not necessary to be set down at large\nthat the said P. L. Connor, mentioned in the said agreement, had been long previous to the said 25th day of September, 1895, employee and pr\u00eate-nom of the said defendants and both he and the plaintiffs would only have been too willing to transfer not only the right to manufacture which they did but also would have been willing that the contract should have been in name as it was in fact transferred to defendants but the latter never wished same to be done, but preferred carrying on as they ever did since the date of the said contract between the Inspector of Prisons and said P. L, Connor the business for the sole benefit of the said company defendant by whom it was assumed confidentially and under the asked and granted pledge of secrecy, and that for the benefit and advantage of the defendant company.\nTo the defendants' third plea, the plaintiffs pleaded an answer which, as it is pleaded in reply to a pleading itself irrelevant and defective for the reasons already stated, partakes necessarily of the same defects as those which characterized the plea to which it is pleaded in reply; it is unnecessary therefore to notice it further than to say that it repeats what had been alleged in the answer to the defendants' second plea, and contains what has been throughout the trial and still is, the main contention upon which the plaintiffs rest their cause of action and their right to maintain the judgment therein now under consideration.\nThe allegation is\nThat the said P. L Connor obtained the said contract for the benefit of his employers the said defendants; that the whole business was assumed confidentially by them, and that from and after the going into force of the said contract of the 25th of September, 1895. the whole business was carried on for the exclusive benefit of the said defendants and under their sole control, the only right pertaining to the said plaintiffs il respect of said contract, and the business connected therewith being their option of advancing the money necessary for the carrying on said business at six per cent interest per annuity and two per cent bonus,\nThe defendants filed an incidental demand for damages alleged to have been sustained by them by reason! of the non-fulfilment of the covenant of the plaintiffs contained in the said agreement of the 29th of February, 1896, to which the plaintiffs as incidental defendants pleaded by way of defence the same matters which they had pleaded by way of answer to the pleas of the defendants in the principal action.\nNow the sole contention of the plaintiffs upon this singularly framed record was that the defendants being upon the 29th of February, 1896, indebted to the plaintiffs in the several sums stated in the declaration mentioned for advances of like sums made at the respective dates in the declaration mentioned by the plaintiffs to the defendants at their request executed the instrument of February, 1896, for the sole purpose of prescribing the times and mode of repayment of such loans, and that such was the sole intent and effect of that instrument, while on the contrary the contention of the defendants was that the sole obligation incurred by the defendants to the plaintiffs was incurred under and by virtue of, the terms of that instrument of February, 1896, which as they contend was a contract of purchase by the defendants, and of sale and transfer by the plaintiffs to the defendants, or as they should direct, of the contract between, the Ontario Government and P. L. Connor of the 25th September 1895, for the residue of the term by that contract created and which the plaintiffs declared to have been transferred to them and to be in their power to transfer to the defendants; and the defendants filed their incidental demand for damages alleged to have been sustained by them for non-fulfilment by the \"plaintiffs of their covenant in that behalf contained in the said instrument and to be performed by them. The main contention between the parties thus appears to have been as to, and to be determinable by, the construction of the instrument of February, 1896. The case proceeded. to enqu\u00eate. The contract of the 25th September, 1895, having been produced by and on behalf of the plaintiffs it appeared that Patrick Louis Connor therein described as of the City of Brantford, in the County of Barant thereinafter called the contractor' did for himself, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns covenant with the Inspector of Prisons among other things,\nto at all times at his own cost provide all expert labour and instruction necessary in manufacturing and to supervise and instruct the prisoners in the work required of them in operating the plant, &c.\nThe contract then contained provisions for limiting the price at which the twine manufactured at the prison should be sold to the farmers. Then by sections 13, 14 and 17 it was agreed as follows :\n13.The contractor shall take over at cost all the manufactured twine and binder twine material on hand at the time of entering upon the contract, the twine at a price to be arrived at the same as provided in making up the selling price of twine by the contractor, and the unmanufactured material at invoice prices, with cost of delivery at the prison added.\n14.This contract shall, subject to the herein contained provisions as to default and resumption by the Government, be in force from the 1st day of October, 1895, until the 1st day of October, 1900, renewable for a further period of five years provided the Lieutenant Governor in council considers it in the public interest that such further period should be granted.\n17. The contractor shall not assign this agreement or sublet the same without the consent of the Lieutenant Governor in Council.\nThe plaintiffs also produced the agreement of the 29th of February, 1896, which is as follows :\nIt is hereby mutually agreed by and between the Consumers Cordage Company, limited, a body corporate and politic, with its head office and chief place of business in the City of Montreal, P.Q., party of the first part, and the firm of N. K. and M. Connolly, contractors of the City of Quebec, party of the second part, witnesseth that whereas Mr. P. L. Connor, of Brantford, Ontario, has acquired the right from the Government of the Province of Ontario, to manufacture binder twine in the Central Prison in the City of Toronto, in the said province, for a period of five years from October 1st, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-five, to October 1st, nineteen hundred, the party of the second part hereby agrees to transfer and make over to the party of the first part the. said right from the Government of the Province of Ontario to manufacture binder twine in the Central Prison in the City of Toronto in the said province for the full period of said contract with P. L. Connor.\nThe party of the second, part further agrees to furnish all the capital that may be required for said manufacturing operations at said Central Prison for and during the full term of the twine season of 1896 at which time the party of the first part hereby agrees to reimburse the party of the second part all money they have invested in the said business, and not later than October 1st, 1896, with interest thereon at eight per centum per annum, but it is understood and agreed that at least $40,000 forty thousand dollars) of this shall be paid between June 1st and 15th, 1896, and if required the party of the second part shall assist the party of the first part to obtain any part of this amount through the Dominion Bank at Toronto, as well as a sum of $73350 constituted by P. L- Connor as a first charge on the earnings of the said manufacturing institution and taken over by the party of the second part in settlement of accounts with John Connor of St John, N.B. The payment of this amount shall extend over the first two years of the Government contract.\nThis agreement is signed E. M. Fulton as manager of the consumers Cordage Company, limited, on behalf of that corporation, and by N. K. and M. Connolly, the plaintiffs in the present action. Now as the main question between the parties as to the plaintiffs' right to succeed in this action is as to the admissibility of evidence tendered by the plaintiffs and objected to by the defendants' counsel and received by the learned judge at enqu\u00eate subject to such objection and to future consideration as to its admissibility and as to whether it should be acted upon, and as that question depends upon the construction of the contract of February, 1896, it will be convenient before entering upon this latter question to advert to certain other evidence given at enqu\u00eate not objected to, or open to objection, and which seems to have also a bearing upon the question whether the evidence objected to by the defendants and received subject to further consideration should be accepted and acted upon as admissible. It appears then that in the summer of 1895 the plaintiffs, Nicholas K. Connolly and Michael Connolly and one John Connor, trading in partnership together tinder the name, style and firm of \" The Continental Twine and Cordage Company,\" were carrying on the business of manufacturers of rope and binder twine at certain premises in the City of Brantford, leased from defendants, under a lease dated the twenty-eighth day of January, 1895, and also at the Penitentiary at Kingston under some contract executed by the Dominion Government which was not produced but of which the said partnership firm, had control. The business carried on by the said firm at Brantford was under the management of Patrick L. Connor as superintendent for and on behalf of the said partnership firm in which employment he himself said that he continued until the first of November, 1895, at which time the lease of the Brantford premises where the said partnership business had been carried on was taken off the hands of the lessees by their lessors the defendants.\nIn the month of July or early in the month of August 1895 the Ontario Government advertised for tenders for leasing the Central Prison plant for manufacturing rope and binder twine and required each tender to be accompanied with the deposit of $5,000 as security for the bona fides of the tenderer and to remain as security for the fulfilment by the lessee of the terms of the lease in the event of the tenderer be-coming the lessee. On or about the 21st of August, 1895, Patrick L. Connor, being at that time in the employment of the Connollys, and John Connor (who was his brother) as their superintendent of the home manufacturing business carried on by them at Brantford put in a tender to the Ontario Government in reply to their advertisement for tenders for a lease of the Central Prison twine manufacturing plant. About the 20th. of August John Connor drew upon his partners, the present plaintiffs, for $5,000, payable at sight to his own order. This draft was addressed to the plaintiffs to care of R. Moat & Co., bankers, Monreal, who were the brokers of the plaintiffs and (as deposed by the plaintiffs bookkeeper) was cashed by Messrs. Moat & Co. and forwarded to John Connor and was deposited with Patrick L. Connor's tender in accordance with the requirements of the Ontario Government's advertisement for tenders. This is This first item in the plaintiffs' declaration and in the itemized account therein charged under date of 21st August, 1895.\nAfterwards on September 13th, 1895, P. L. Connor put in another or substituted tender and in relation thereto, on the 18th September, addressed and sent to the inspector of prisons a letter in which, referring to his new tender of the 13th instante, and to certain matters connected therewith, and to the contract tendered for he makes use of the following language :\u2014\nIt is also understood that the cheque for $5,000 which accompanied my first tender in this matter is to be held by you as security to the Government for carrying out my second tender as explained by this letter\nThen as to $1350 the second item in the plaintiffs' declaration and which the plaintiffs therein allege to have been an item of debt owed by the defendants to the plaintiffs upon, and prior to, the 29th day of February, 1896, and which is charged in the itemized account set out in the declaration as having accrued due upon the 25th day of September, 1895, and therefore from that date interest is charged thereon, Martin Connolly, the then book-keeper of the plaintiffs, deposed that all he knew as to that item was that he had seen a note for t at amount made by Patrick L. Connor to the plaintiffs but when he saw it, he did not say, but he said that he knew nothing whatever as-to the consideration for which it was given, although he adds that he was confidential clerk of the plaintiffs-as a rule. In short there is not a particle of evidence offered in the case for the purpose of establishing that,. and the plaintiffs do not contend that as is averred in the plaintiffs' declaration, this sum constituted a debt due by defendants to the plaintiffs prior to the 29th of February, 1896. The evidence does not profess to disclose any liability whatever of the defendants to the plaintiffs in respect of this item other than such as appears in the agreement of the 29th of February, 1896, the nature and character of which we shall consider in the construction of that instrument.\nNow as to the sum of $22,0485.22, the third item in the plaintiff's declaration, that sum constituted money payable to the Ontario Government by Patrick L. Connor under the 13th paragraph of his contract ,-of the 25th September for the manufactured twine and binder twine material then on hand, and it was paid by him in the month of November of that year to the Ontario Government out of the proceeds of a cheque of Messrs. R. Moat & Co. Montreal the brokers of the plaintiffs,. dated the 7th November, 1895 for $25,000 (twenty-five thousand dollars), and made payable to the order of the plaintiffs and indorsed by them to the said John Con-nor the brother of Patrick L. Connor and plaintiffs' partner. Now as to this item Martin Connolly, the bookkeeper of the plaintiffs, and called as a witness by the plaintiffs, said that he knew that the plaintiffs' brokers in Montreal had charged this sum in the firm's account to Mr. Michael Connolly, and that on a subsequent occasion, but when he did not say, Mr. Michael Connolly told him to charge the amount,. $250(30 to the Central Prison account, which he said that he accordingly did; and he added that subsequently, it having appeared that some four hundred and. odd. dollars had gone into the Brantford business the charge to the Central Prison account was reduced to $22,048.22, and, this he said took place when the plaintiffs came to have a settlement with Mr. Fulton but when this took place he did not say, but naturally, in view of the contract of the 29th of February 1896 it must needs have been after the execution of that instrument and for the purpose of arriving at the amount of the moneys in that instrument referred to as the investments theretofore made by the plaintiffs in the binder twine manufacturing industry at the Central Prison with the view of determining the extent of the defendants' liability under that instrument.\nNow the materiality of this evidence in the present case is that in the books of the plaintiffs there seems to have been an account opened as the Central Prison account to which this sum of $25 000 was by the direction of one of the plaintiffs, charged.\nThe evidence given by the plaintiffs' bookkeeper as to this item is important as evidencing the fact that the plaintiffs, when one of themselves directed this amount to be charged against an account opened in their books and known as the Central Prison account must have been interested in the business carried on at the Central Prison in respect of which the account was opened. That seems at least to be the natural conclusion to arrive at from the bookkeeper's evidence.\nThere is still one other piece of documentary evidence to be referred to, prior to the execution of the agreement of the 29th of February 1896 It is a letter of the 24th of February, written by the plaintiff, Michael Connolly, giving to Mr. Heddle an introduction to a Mr. Archbold, a person then employed as an accountant in the business of manufacturing twine at the Central Prison under the lease to P. L. Connor. My purpose of referring to it is simply to evidence the fact that Mr. Michael Connolly was exercising some control over that business quite inconsistent with the present , contention of the plaintiffs' that they never had any concern, with interest in, or control over the business carried on at the prison, the whole of which, as they allege, was the sole business of the defendants, which in fact and truth had always from the making of the contract of the 25th September been under the sole management and control of the defendants.\nThe terms of the letter are just those which would naturally be used by a person interested in and having management and control of the business The letter is as follows:\nMontreal, Febuuary 24th, 1896.\nMr. Archbold,\nCentral Prison Toronto\nDEAR SIR,\u2014This letter will introduce to you the bearer, Mr. Heddle, to whom you will submit your accounts and any statement in connection with the industry you are able to furnish him; kindly introduce him to Mr. Daly who. as well as yourself, will kindly take any instructions Mr. Heddle wishes to give.\nYours very truly.\nM. CONNOLLY.\nWithin four days after the date of this letter the agreement of the 29th February, 1896, already set out was executed and the plain construction of that instrument is that the plaintiffs thereby covenanted to transfer and make over to the defendants (or to cause to be transferred to them or to such person as they should direct, for that would be a discharge of the plaintiffs' covenant) the right granted by the Ontario Government by the contract of the 25th September, to P. L Connor to manufacture binder twine at the Central Prison for the full period of the five years granted by the said contract to said P. L. Connor; that in the said business of manufacturing twine under said contract they, the plaintiffs, had invested divers moneys, the amount of which is not stated; that further they were possessed of a claim for $7,350 which P. L. Connor had legally and effectually constituted a first charge upon the earnings of the said manufacturing institution in satisfaction of that sum due by John Connor (P. L. Connor's brother) upon a settlement of accounts between him and the plaintiffs his copartners; and by the instrument the plaintiffs further covenanted to furnish all the capital that might be required for said manufacturing operations at said Central Prison for and during the full term of the twine season of 1896, and the defendants in consideration thereof and as the purchase money to be paid by them for such transfer covenanted to pay to the plaintiffs all the moneys then already invested by them and thereafter to be invested by them in the said twine manufacturing operations by way of capital to be furnished by them under their covenant in that behalf with interest at 8 per cent not later than the 1st October, 1896, and of the sum total of such investments which was expected to exceed $40 000 the defendants covenanted to pay $40,000 between the first and fifteenth of June, 1896, and they further covenanted to pay to the plaintiffs within the first two, years of the term granted by the said contract between the Ontario Government and P. L. Connor, so as aforesaid covenanted to be transferred by the plaintiffs to the defendants, the said sum of $7,350, so as aforesaid alleged to have been constituted by P. L. Connor a first charge in favour of the plaintiffs upon the earnings of the manufacturing operations carried on under said contract.\nNow as to this contract, and first as to this sum of $7,350, it appears to be recoverable only by way of satisfaction of a like sum alleged by the contract to have been constituted by P. L. Connor a first charge in favour of the plaintiffs upon the operations carried, on under his contract with the Ontario Government to be so constituted a valid charge upon the industry at the Central Prison by Connor it must have been so charged as to afect the legal term created by the instrument of the 25th September, 1895, vested in him and his assigns; and for the plaintiffs ever to recover that sum against the defendants upon this covenant of theirs in the instrument of February 1896, it would be necessary, I apprehend, for the plaintiffs to aver in their declaration and to prove in evidence that the charge was legally constituted by P. L. Connor, and that the legal estate and interest subjected to the charge by Connor had been effectually transferred to the defendants or to some person appointed by them so as to vest in the defendants or such person the legal estate or interest which had been vested in Connor and by him subjected to the charge. It cannot admit of a doubt that this sum of $7,350 is by the instrument of February, 1896, made part of the purchase money or consideration covenanted to be paid by the defendants for the legal and effectual transfer to the defendants, or as they should direct, of the Ontario Government's contract or lease with Connor, and there is nothing' whatever in the instrument to justify a suggestion that the consideration for the other sums made payable by the defendants by the instrument is different from the consideration for the covenant to pay the $7,350 namely, the transfer of the legal and beneficial interest in the contract of the 25th September 1895, which the plaintiffs covenanted by the instrument to transfer. In the declaration in the present action there is in reality no case whatever made for the recovery of that sum under the terms of the instrument of February, 1896, and so neither for the recovery of any of these other sums mentioned in the instrument to become payable by the defendants.\nThen as to these sums of $5,000, and $22,048.52, claimed by the plaintiffs in their declaration, these sums clearly appear to be, and must be regarded as being, moneys then already invested by the plaintiffs in the said twine manufacturing business at the Central Prison. As to the $5,000 it was invested, as we have seen, on the 21st of August, 1895, at which date Mr. John Connor admits that he was not engaged in the service of the defendants, but was then the partner of the plaintiffs in manufacturing twine at Brantford, of which business, as already stated, P. L. Connor admitted himself to have been superintendent on behalf of the partnership firm consisting of his brother and the plaintiffs until the 1st of November, 1896, when the lease was taken off their hands by the defendants.\nAs to the $22,088.52 I have already adverted to the manner in which that sum came to be entered by the plaintiffs in the books kept by them as a charge against the Central Prison Account. As to the covenant to furnish all the capital necessary to carry on the manufacturing operations at the Central Prison during the season of 1896 it is to be observed that such capital was to be furnished at the sole charge and expense of the plaintiffs; the defendants were under no obligation whatever to assist the plaintiffs in providing that capital or any other sum whatever. This, the plaintiffs' covenant to furnish all the necessary capital to carry on the business during the year 1896, seems to constitute a joint adventure or partnership between the plaintiffs and the defendants in the said manufacturing operations until the close of the season of 1866 upon an agreement that the moneys which the plaintiffs had already invested in the said manufacturing operations prior to the 29th of February, 1896, together with what should there-after be invested by them under their covenant to furnish the necessary capital for the season's operations, together with interest at the rate of 8 per cent should be paid by the defendants to the plaintiffs at latest by the 1st of October, 1896, when the plaintiffs' connection with the business should cease the intention and expectation of both parties being, as I think would seem, that these sums should be paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the season's manufactured twine which by that time were expected to be realised; and this would seem to account also for the plaintiffs covenanting to assist the defendants, if required, in raising at the bank in June the moneys then payable in advance of the realisation of the stock manufactured during the season. Now that the plaintiffs had in fact at the time of the execution of the agreement of the 29th February, 1896, the beneficial interest of P. L. Connor in the agreement of the 28th September, 1895, and although not the legal estate vested in them in the sense of being accepted as lessees in the place of Connor under the seventeenth paragraph of the Government's contract yet that they had absolute control over P. L. Connor in compelling him to transfer such contract so that it should be effectually transferred and made over to the defendants or as they should direct for the full period of five years mentioned in the contract of September, 1895, as covenanted by the plaintiffs, appears from the following letter addressed by the plaintiff, Michael Connolly, to Martin Connolly the plaintiff's bookkeeper at Quebec;\nCOLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., April 18th, 1896.\nMY DEAR MARTIN,\u2014On my return I intend to stop off a day in Toronto and in order to save time and avoid making another trip there, if I had the papers that P. L. Gonnov signed making the transfer of the central Prison contract I might get \u00edfc transeferred. While I. am there, I wish therefore you would. send the transfer he has signed to my address, Queen's Hotel, Toronto, and when I am there I will see if the transfer cannot be made to Heddle; but perhaps N. K. (meaning the other plaintiff) had best see Fulton and find out from him if there is no other person to whom he would as soon have the transfer made.\nI expect to reach Leadville this evening about six and of course will then know what there is in sight.\nYours truly,\nM. CONNOLLY.\nThe bookkeeper to whom this letter was addressed complied with the request therein contained.\nThen there is a letter dated the 18th May 1896 from the plaintiffs to Mr. Heddle which seems to show very plainly that Mr. Heddle was then under the actual control and in the employment of the plaintiffs in the discharge of duties in connection with the Central Prison. It is as follows:\nQUEBEC, May 18th, 1896,\nR. HEDDLE, Esq , Brantford.\nDEAR SIR,\u2014Referring to your favour of the 12th instant we would say that we have been assured by Mr. John Connor that the different owners of the respective notes that have been protested would take immediate steps to make a settlement and we would wish you to get them from the bank when paid and forward to us here.\nOur Mr. Michael Connolly writes asking us to get you to ascertain whether Mr. P. L. Connor's house at Brantford is free from incumbrance, and he also states that Mr. P. L. C. was to pay for horse and rig purchased by him from the Continental Company. If this has not been done it would be well for you to take possession of the horse for the company or sell it if you cannot find use for it.\nMr. Connolly also states that he promised the Dominion Bank that he would give them all out collections in connection with the Central Prison and wishes you to act accordingly.\nYours faithfully,\n(Signed,) N. K. & M.CONNOLLY.\nPer M. P. CONNOLLY.\nThen by a letter dated 30th May, 1896, from the plaintiff, Michael Connolly, to Mr. Heddle, it appears that the plaintiffs were as anxious, as they allege the defendants were, to preserve secrecy as to the business of manufacturing twine at the Central Prison, and that such secrecy consisted in not letting it be known that either the plaintiffs or the defendants had any connection with the business carried on at the prison. The letter is as follows .\nDEAR MR. HEDDLE, I wrote you to-day sending you a copy of a letter to be addressed to Mr. Gibson asking that you be substituted for Connor as the contractor for the Central Prison output or manufacture. I hope you will get the thing through as soon as possible.\nI also sent you a letter from parties to Kelly making inquiries about prices of binder twine. When answering them you had best use plain paper so as to not identify the Continental with any of the prisons.\nThe copy of the letter to be sent to Mr. Gibson was also produced and it was headed with the words following:\nDo not use any letter heading but plain paper.\n\" The Continental \" here mentioned is a body corporate into which, by letters patent dated the 28th of December, 1895, Messrs. John Connor and the plaintiffs who had previously carried on business in partnership under the name style and firm of the;\u201d Continental Twine and Cordage Company,\" and two others were incorporated into a company under the same name with the affix, \" Limited.\"\nIf as is now contended by the plaintiffs, P. L. Connor acquired the Government contract of the 25th September in his own name, but in truth to and for the sole use and benefit of the defendants, holding it as their servant, agent or pr\u00eate nom, and if from that date, (as is also now contended by the plaintiffs) always continually enjoyed the full benefit of that contract to their own use and have always had the sole management and control of the business carried on under the contract, and if as is also now alleged by the plaintiffs they had no interest whatever in said business and never interfered in its management or control it is difficult to understand how Mr. Heddle if at the date of the 30th May, 1896, he was acting solely as the agent of and under the sole management and control of the defendants), should have had in his possession the paper headed with the name of the Continental Twine and Cordage Company, or why Mr. Michael Connolly should have been the person to caution him to be guarded as to what paper he should use upon the occasions referred to in the letter of 30th May.\nIt must he admitted that the act of Mr. Michael Connolly upon that occasion is inconsistent with the present contention of the plaintiffs.\nNow the admissibility of the evidence which was objected to by the defendants' counsel, and which was received subject to such objections and to future consideration as to its admissibility, and as to its being acted upon by the court, must be tested not merely by reference to the instrument of the 29th February, 1896 and to its true construction, but also by the other acts, documents and evidence to which I have referred.\nThe Superior Court adopted and acted upon as admissible the whole of the evidence so objected to, and the judgment founded upon that evidence has been maintained by the Court of Review. The judgment in its first consid\u00e9rant adjudges\nthat it results from the proof and [documents in the case that the tender the, contract, the taking possession and the operation of the rope factory established in the Central Prison of Ontario, at Toronto, and leased to one Patrick Louis Connor, by contract dated September 25th, 1895, and subsequently transferred to one Robert Heddle, the said Connor and Heddle were only the 'pr\u00eate noms and salaried representatives of the defendant, that they acted on its behalf and for its interest, under its exclusive control and direction and for its profit and advantage solely, and that for the purpose of the tender, contract and operation of the said rope factory which was always operated by the defendants since September 25th, 1895, the plaintiff advanced and furnished to the defendant on demand of its authorised officers the sums of money at the rates of interest mentioned in the principal demand.\nThen in a second consid\u00e9rant it is declared that the defendants have fulfilled all the obligations incumbent upon them by the agreement of February 29th, 1896. No possible force can be given to this consid\u00e8rant. It was doubtless introduced in reference to the second plea above set out, which, as I have already shewn, offered no issuable matter by way of defence to the plaintiffs cause of action as set out in their declaration. The first consid\u00e9rant wholly disposed of that cause of action and in view of that adjudication the second consid\u00e9rant is insensible as in truth amounting no more than this that whereas by the first consid\u00e9rant it is established that the plaintiffs had never had any interest in or control over the property which, by the agreement of the 29th of February, 1896, they covenanted to transfer to the defendants, but that such property was always the property of the defendants and in their actual possession and enjoyment, and under their sole management and absolute control, and that therefore the plaintiffs could not have been and were not under any obligation to transfer to the defendants the property which they had always had in their actual possession and enjoyment and being under no such obligation by the instrument of the 29th of February, 1896, they fulfilled that obligation. In another consid\u00e9rant the court held that the $7,350 is not yet exigible and for that reason and for that only was deducted from the amount claimed, and after another consid\u00e9rant, that the pretention contained in the defendants' plea and incidental demand against the incidental defendants are unfounded, the judgment condemned the defendants to pay to the plaintiffs the sum of $22,324.48, with, interest at 8 per cent from 1st October, 1896, until payment, with costs, and dismissed the incidental demand with costs.\nThe effect of acting upon as admissible the evidence which was objected to by the defendants has been in. my opinion, and I say it with the greatest deference, and the effect of the first cosid\u00e8rant found thereon -as above set out has been to subvert and render wholly nugatory a rule prevailing in the jurisprudence of every country, and which, in the jurisprudence of the Province of Quebec, where the action in the present case was instituted, is expressed in art. 1234, C.C.,\nthat testimony cannot in any case be received to contradict or vary the terms of a valid written instrument\nIt has also had the effect of pronouncing at the instance of one of the parties the instrument of the 29th February, 1896, deliberately signed by both parties, to be absolutely delusive, nugatory and false, and for that reason to be wholly void, or else to be capable of the construction now contended for by the plaintiffs, which construction is wholy inadmissible as being in direct contradiction of the plain terms of the instrument and wholly inconsistent moreover with all the facts in evidence exclusive of the evidence objected to. The admission of the evidence objected to has also had the effect of introducing into the case a flood of false swearing, an evil, the prevention of which constitutes a large portion of the foundation upon which the rule of law, as expressed in art. 1234, C.C., is based. As I am of opinion that the evidence upon which the judgment is founded was inadmissible and that therefor, the judgment founded thereon cannot be maintained, I do not propose to analyze the evidence for the purpose of discovering upon which side the false swearing has been, nor whether upon one side only; but no one can read the large mass of matters which. have been introduced for the purpose of establishing a claim which, in contradiction of the plain terms of agreement of 29th February, 1896, is now alleged to have been at the time of the execution of that instrument the common case of a debt then due for moneys previously lent by the plaintiffs to the defendants at their request without seeing that there has been much false swearing in the case somewhere.\nNow the judgment being based, as I think it is, upon inadmissible evidence cannot be maintained. But although the evidence is inadmissible for the purpose for which it was tendered by the plaintiffs, having been acted upon by the court it is now before us on this appeal and we cannot shut our eyes to what we think it does establish beyond all serious doubt or controversy, namely, that the contract of the 25th of September, 1895, and everything which has taken place there under which has been the subject of discussion in the action including the agreement of the 29th February, 1896, constitute merely steps in the carrying out or attempt to carry out a combination, arrangement, agreement and conspiracy entered into between Mr. John Connor and the plaintiffs, and Mr. Fulton, the manager of the defendant company, to unduly enhance the pride of binder twine in the interest of and for the benefit of the plaintiffs and the defendant company and others engaged in the manufacture of that article and to the manifest loss and prejudice of the farmers of the Province of Ontario for whose benefit the manufacture of binder twine at the Central Prison was instituted by the Government of the province under the authority of an Act of the Provincial Legislature in that behalf I much doubt that a contract of that nature or any contract to give effect to a combination or arrangement of such a nature could be made by Mr. Fulton so as to be binding upon the corporate body whose manager he is, hut assuming the corporate body to be bound by Mr. Fulton's act, so as to make such his act the act of the corporate body, I cannot entertain a doubt that courts of justice when a contract under discussion appears to a court of justice to have been entered into for the purpose of giving effect to a combination, arrangement or conspiracy of the nature mentioned, should not permit themselves to be made instruments in giving effect to such a contract. That a combination and arrangement of the nature I have spoken of is the true and only natural solution of the dealings of all the parties concerned in the combination namely Mr. John O'Connor the plaintiffs, and Mr. Fulton is, I think, the proper conclusion resulting from the evidence which has been acted upon by the Superior Court in the present case. Mr. Heddle, a witness called by both the plaintiffs and the defendants, accredited by both of them, and in the confidence of both seemed to have no doubt upon the point, and he seems to have been in a position to know. The principal part of the delicate business seems to have been confided to Mr. John Connor as a person from his ability and experience in matters of the very delicate nature of those in question made him most competent to assume and discharge the duties of the office. Some of his letters to which I refer without setting out their contents at large, throw light upon his method of procedure, namely, those filed as exhibits D 79, D 80, D 84, D 87, D 88, D 89, D 91, D 92.\nIn declining to give any effect to this contract either for plaintiffs or defendants, I would do so in the interest of public order and morality and to maintain the integrity of courts of justice, As we are bound to give the judgment which in our opinion should have been given by the Court of Review our judg- ment, I think should be to dismiss the principal action and the incidental demand and to leave each party to bear and pay their own costs of the action the incidental demand and this appeal.\nSEDGEWICK and KING JJ. concurred in the judgment delivered by GIROUARD J\nGIROUARD J.\u2014The majority of this court agrees that the binder twine business of the Toronto Central Prison was the business of the appellants, carried on by agents for their sole advantage and benefit, and that if we had to decide this case upon the issues Presented in the courts below and also in this court our duty would be to dismiss the appeal for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Tellier, and more elaborately developed by Acting Chief Justice Tait. But in the course of our deliberations, suspicion came to our mind that perhaps the respondents were endeavouring to enforce an illegal contact, and, in consequence, we felt in duty bound to order a re-hearing upon some new points which embarassed us, and to which we desired to have the assistance of counsel. As these points affect public interests, which private parties might not perhaps feel inclined to clear up, we instructed the registrar of this court to communicate our order, together with the factums and case, to the Attorneys-General for Quebec and Ontario, and also to the Minister of Justice of Canada who are by statutes the constitutional guardians of the administration of justice, although no machinery is provided for such an emergency. We thought that this want of legislative enactment did not preclude courts of justice from giving such order as the ends of justice might commend in a particular case. Art. 3 C. P. Q. In taking this course we followed quite a respectable precedent in Scott v. Brown ([1]), where, in 1892 the English Court of Appeal took the same objection and. maintained, it after hearing both parties. It is unfortunate that for reasons which appear upon the proceedings of this court the re-hearing could not take place. Nothing more is left for us to do, but to dispose of the case as it stood before the re-hearing was ordered.\nI must confess that my suspicions arose at the outset, when reading the factums. At page 5 of the appellants' factum, they say :\nTo form a correct idea of what was the true position between the respondents and the appellants previous to the 29th of February 1896 it is necessary to recall the condition of the binder twine trade at that time. The appellants for several years had controlled the business in Canada. They had factories in Halifax, Montreal, Brantford Port Hope, etc. They could produce sufficient twine for the Canadian consumption, and were protected against imported twine by a duty of 25 per cent. In 1896, the protective duty was reduced to 12 1\/2 per cent. Previous to this date, the Government of Ontario introduced into the Central Prison at Toronto, a plant to manufacture twine and the Dominion Government did the same thing in the Kingston Penitentiary, with the object of competing by prison labour against the appellants. The Ontario Government, after working the plant themselves, advertised for tenders. It will be seen at a glance how important it was for the appellants that the contractor who secured the plant, should work in harmony with them to prevent the slaughter of prices which had previously taken place under the management of the Ontario Government. Two contractors were bidding for the plant, Mr. Hallam and Mr. John Connor, under the name of his brother P. L. Connor. John Connor, in the name of his brother was the successful competitor.\nThe two courts below unanimously found that Hallam and Connor were bidding confidentially for and on behalf of the appellants As Sir Melbourne Tait, A.C.J., truly observes :\nAs to the transfer of the Government contract to the defendants, I think the evidence clearly shows that they wanted to keep it secrete that the Central Prison business was carried on in their interest and never wanted the contract transferred to their own names And at page 43 of the respondents' factum, more light is thrown upon the true character of the trans actions '.\nThe question naturally arises, if the appellants owned this contract, why should the respondents agree to obtain a transfer of it through P. L. Connor to them? It must be remembered, however, that absolute secrecy was necessary for the purpose of the successful working of the scheme by which the appelants wanted to control the output of all the twine mills in Canada and of this prison mill where the Government was endeavouring by the means of prison labour to defeat the monopoly in binding twine by selling it to the farmers at a fraction over cost, and had P. L. Connor refused to carry out the provisions of the letter of 29th of October the appellants could never have compelled him to do so as the Government of Ontario would have cancelled the right to manufacture as provided in clause 12 of the contract, (exhibit P., 6, case p. 55,) had it become known that the appellants, the very institution which the Government was seeking to fight were the contractors\nThe respondents do not seem to realize that by giving to the appellants the aid of their money and credit, and every other possible assistance, they placed themselves in almost the same objectionable position. They, perhaps, thought that they were only helping a movement tending to remove slaughtering prices in an article of commerce, which, jointly with John Connor, they were producing in the Brantford mill leased by them from the appellants in January, 1895, and operated for export only. But they knew, at least should have known, that legal combinations are formed openly and in good faith between all the producers interested for the honest purpose of giving them all fair and equal protection against ruinous competition, without causing any injury to the public or any class of the community. They should have known that combinations secretly organized by the fraudulent interposition of third persons paid and salaried for the purpose, to unduly enhance the price of a commercial commodity, are contrary to public policy and even criminal. Secrecy and false representations constitute one of the elements of conspiracy. Grain to be made and injury to be done to the public or an individual are another.\nI do not propose to review the 250 pages of oral evidence, and the 200 pages of printed documents thrown in p\u00eale-m\u00eale at different stages of the trial. Conspiracies are always intricate and difficult to prove and I regret that I cannot be as brief as I would like to be. Dealing with facts in the first instance and of our own motion, our findings must be clear.\nIt appears that in August and September, 1895, John Connor, of St. John, N.B., a large shareholder of the company appellants, E. M. Fulton, its president and general manager, Michael Connolly, and others, met in Toronto and Montreal for the purpose of acquiring, for and on behalf of the said company, the business of the Toronto Central Prison then advertised to let. As it is important to know exactly what took place at the very inception of the proceedings, I will quote the story as told by all the parties interested.\nPatrick L. Connor's story is short. He was not a leading actor on the scene, but merely played a secondary and passive roll assigned by the Consumers' manipulators; he does not appear to have possessed pecuniary means of any consequence; he was a practical twine manufacturer in charge of the Brantford mill, and his name was necessary to better deceive the Ontario Government. His brother, John, conducted the negotiations.\nThe Consumers' Cordage Company, (he says) put through the deal and my brother as well as I considered we were both representing the Consumers' Cordage Company.\nOn the 18th September, 1895, he writes to Mr. Noxon, the inspector, that he is ready to satisfy him- self and the Government as to his financial ability to carry out the terms of his tender.\nIt is also understood (he adds) that the cheque for $50000 which accompanied my first tender in this matter is to be held by you as security to the Government for carrying out my second tender.\nJohn Connor :\nQ. Will you please state now that the correspondence is filed, as shortly as possible, what have been your transactions with the Consumers Cordage Company, your brother, and the officials of the Ontario Government with regard to the Central Prison twine contract?\nA. In the latter part of August, 1895. I had various conversations with E. M. Fulton, sr., in the office of the Consumers Cordage Company, in reference to the Central Prison binder twine plant, which was at the time advertised through the public press, by which tenders for the operation of this plant were invited from the public. I think it would be probably the 28th or 29th of August, Mr. Fulton, on behalf of the Consumers Cordage Company, closed an agreement with me by which I was to enter the employment of the Consumers Cordage Company. The agreement, which was then closed verbally, was reduced to writing, and signed under the date of 29th of August, that is the agreement was kept in abeyance from the latter part of August, and only executed in the office of Mr. Fulton's of October, but I was to enter the employ of the Consumers Cordage Company under the terms of the company on the 1st day of September. * * *\nSo, on September 1st, I entered the employ, pursuant with the agreement\u2014the understanding with Mr. Fulton, on behalf of the company. I was immediately detailed to go to Toronto, for the purpose of preparing a tender which was to be presented to the Ontario Government, and I was directed by Mr. Fulton to secure if possible that tender. Before starting for Toronto, it was arranged that that tender would go in in the name of my brother, P. L. Connor who was a resident of Brantford, Ontario, audit was thought, both by Mr. Fulton and myself, that it was better that the bidder on this contract should be from the province of Ontario, more especially as my brother was acquainted with some of those governing the province, and he resided in the city of Brant ford, and was a binder twine manufacturer. * * *\nQ. In the conversations you had, and in the negotiations with Mr. Fulton, or the Consumers Cordage Company, and the Messrs. Connolly, how was Mr. P. L. Connor treated in relation to that contract?\nA. He was treated, Your Honour, as an employee of the Con u mers' Cordage Company; just simply his name was used as the lessee, believing it was expedient in the interests of the Consumers' Cordage Company that his name should be so used?\nMichael Connolly :\nQ. Mr. Connolly, would you tell us what you know about the obtaining of the contract for the Central Prison in the month of September, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-five, aud how you came to-be mixed up with it?\nA. Well the first intimation I had or the first knowledge I had of the matter, was from John Connor, who called to see me in Kingston and laid the matter before me telling me the Consumers' Cordage Company desired to control the output from the different mills in the Dominion, as fast as they could acquire them, and when the time came he would tender on their behalf, but in somebody else's name, and thereby secure the contract for them and if we chose we would contribute. * * *\nQ. After meeting Mr. Connor did you meet anybody connected with the Consumers' Cordage Company?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Whom, and tell us what took place?\nA. I met Mr. Fulton, senior, the president and general manager of the Consumers' Cordage Company who confirmed all that Mr. Connor had represented to me.\nN. K. Connolly :\nAt the time that the lease of the Toronto binder twine factory or the prison factory, was leased, the Consumers' Cordage Company was very anxious to control the output of the country, and they wanted to get that lease and I believe they employed Mr. Connor as well as another gentleman in Toronto, to get it for them.\nThe promise (to refund advances) was made soon after the contract on or about the contract being signed. It may have been done previous to the contract being signed, for Mr. Fulton was talking to both my brother and myself regarding getting the contract\u2014what a good thing it would be for the Consumers' Cordage Company to have control of the whole outfit, that it would then keep the market at any price they thought fit, or at least, at a paying price.\nThe testimony of Mr. Fulton, an old man of TO years is somewhat contradictory, but the documentary evidence produced, which, in cases like this, is always of great value in determining les faits et gestes des parties clearly shews that his memory was very deficient; he admits himself that it is weak. In substance his evi- dence does not however differ from that of the other witnesses He states that the Toronto Central Prison and the penitentiary at Kingston had practically ruined the twine business of Canada, and on hearing of the advertisements for the lease of the Toronto mill he proceeded to that city about the middle of August, 1895 to see what could be done in the interests of his company. He made several trips to Toronto, always in great secrecy, being even afraid to register his name at any hotel. On the 4th September, 1895, he writes a note to John Connor while in Toronto;\nI am hereby invitation, incog., so do not mention it to any one.\nHe first saw one Hallam, and immediately came to terms with him. He learned from him that John Connor was also looking after the Central Prison contract. After some delay and a good deal of negotiations, held both in Montreal and in Toronto he succeeded in securing the services of both Hallam and Connor, and the assistance of the respondents. Fifty-seven cents per 100 lbs. of twine or rope to be produced was the figure first settled by them as the bid or rent of plant and convict labour. But on the 31st of August, Fulton tele graphed John Connor to raise it to 72, and finally, when the Government decided to call for new tenders John Connor and Hallam agreed with him to put in a concurrent bid of 75c, prepared by himself and similar in every respect. It turned out however that this was done by Hallam alone and not by Connor. The latter had learned that \"eighty will close and nothing else;\" in f\u00e9ct, Fulton had telegraphed him on the 10th of September, that Hallam wired him so. He, therefore came to the conclusion that it would be prudent to advance his tender by 71\/2, and make it 82k. Fulton looked upon this change as a \" trickery,\" and he complained bitterly in a letter written to Patrick L. Connor, on the 21st September, but the same day John Connor telegraphed Fulton:. Executed contract with my brother. Hallam out of it. Agreed to take over stock October 1st. Rest easy and do nothing more.\nThe contract was actually signed on the 25th September, 1895, by Patrick L. Connor and Noxon, the inspector of prisons and public charities for Ontario.\nIn order to, prevent the possibility of a combination with monopolists several clauses were inserted in the contract which will be noticed later on; but one should be mentioned here. Clause 17 provides that\nthe contractor shall not assign this agreement or sub-let the same without the consent of the Lieutenant-Governor in council.\nWhat a revelation' if before signing or afterwards, the inspector had been told that the c contractor \" was the great Consumers' Cordage Company. Noxon swears that neither Fulton or any employee of the company ever told him that Fulton was at the back of the Central Prison contract.\nA cheque for $5,000 accompanied both the tender and the contract, as requested in the advertisements. It had been provided for by the respondents accepting and cashing on the 21st August, 1895, in Montreal, the draft of John Connor on them for the same amount, dated Brantford, 20th August, 1895. P. L. Connor swears that this cash reached him in the shape of a c certified cheque or draft\" which he deposited with his tender.\nDuring all these negotiations, no complete under standing was put in writing beyond telegrams and letters, which might be mislaid or destroyed. On the 18th October 1895, Fulton writes to John Connor :\nI think it advisable that you and Connolly should come to Montreal just as soon as possible and have all understandings and agreements placed in proper ship shape.\nThis was done in Montreal on the 29th October, 1895, where four documents were carefully prepared and signed simultaneously in Mr. Fulton's lawyer's office: First. A letter from John Connor to Fulton in the following terms:\nAs my brother, P. L. Connor, has secured the control of the Ontario prison plant for five (5) years on certain terms, with which you are familiar. I beg hereby to state, on his behalf that this contract was secured by him and myself in the interests and for the benefit of your company, and is to be assumed by you confidentially, the business to be conducted in P. L. Conner's name; our colleagues, Messrs. M. and N. K. Connolly, to have the option of contributing the working capital required at 6 per cent interest and a bonus of 2 per cent.\nThe output is to be marketed from year to year.\nSecondly. A proposal of agreement respecting the Brantford mill and also the Toronto Central Prison signed by John Connor, and agreed to in. a P. S. by the respondents, who are styled his \" associates s where he formally offers to appellants his services in the twine and cordage business for a term of years from the 1st of September, 1895; at a salary of $2,500 per annum not more than six months to be called for annually. In fact, he had been engaged on the 29th of August, and on the 22nd October, 1895, he received $208.33, \"being for one month's salary.\" Mr. John Connor's last conditions were \u00b0\n8.This agreement and the connection between me and your company to be kept absolutely confidential and secret by myself and my associates\n9.P. L. Conner to be retained as superintendent of the Brantford mill, or otherwise in the employ of the' company at fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500) per annum.\nThirdly. An acceptance by Fulton of the above proposals and terms, in which he says :\nOn behalf of the company, I now agree to all the terms and conditions of your letter, and shall consider the agreement a binding one from September 1st, 1895, until September 1st, 1896, and thereafter until terminated according to your letter.\nWith respect to the necessity for preserving the secrecy regarding your connection, I think the suggestion an admirable one, but we will have many opportunities of discussing this and other business matters I see no necessity for further contracts between us. Your letter and this reply are enough, and, therefore, again accepting the offer made by you with the approval of your esteemed colleagues.\nThe fourth document had reference to the price of twine to be manufactured at the prison and will be noticed hereafter.\nThe combination having been thus fully organized, the respondents were called upon by Fulton, John Connor and sometimes by Patrick his brother\u2014 who from time to time came down from Brantford to look after the Central Prison affairs,\u2014to advance the necessary funds to carry on the business, and among others a sum of $22048.22 to make to the Government of Ontario the payment of the raw material and manufactured goods in the prison at the time of the contract. This sum was advanced in Montreal on the 7th November, 1895, by a cheque of R. Mowat & Co., brokers of Montreal, for $22500 on the Molsons Bank in that city, payable at par in their Toronto branch, to the order of the respondents indorsed by them to the order of John Connor, and indorsed by the latter, and finally deposited by P. L. Connor with the Dominion Bank, in Toronto, where it was checked out by him in favour of the Ontario Government. Mr. N. K. Connolly, who indorsed the cheque for his firm, at the request of Fulton thinks with hesitation that he sent it to John Connor. It was certainly issued, certified by the Molson's Bank and indorsed by the respondents in Montreal. John Connor, who, on the 1st November, had been requested by letter from Fulton to go down to Montreal to arrange about finance, is positive. At page 268 of the case, he says, and he repeats the statement at page 269 :\nThat was a draft handed me in Montreal by N. K. Connolly which amount I took to Toronto to pay for the material This sum of $22500, and also the $5,000 deposited with the contract, are the only amounts in question in ' the present appeal.\nSoon after a line of credit with a bank became necessary, and on the 12th December, 1895, the respondents guaranteed the account of the Toronto prison agency by P. L. Connor with the Dominion Bank in Toronto, who advanced them in the latter city, large sums of money, amounting altogether to $47,000, which are not, however, involved in this case.\nIt will not be necessary either to refer at length to the assignment in 1896 of the contract by Patrick L. Connor to Robert Heddle, which was not carried into effect. It appears conclusively that this assignment was made with the full knowledge, and I may say at the special solicitation of the respondents, who, as recent investors (February, 1896), in the capital stock of the Consumers exercised considerable influence over the board of directors Being dissatisfied with the past management they desired the change.\nOn the 30th of May, 1896, Michael Connolly sends Heddle a draft letter to be addressed to the Hon. Mr. Gibson, member of the Ontario Government, \" on plain paper, having no letter heading,\" enclosing a copy of the assignment, and requesting him to have the same ratified, and Heddle accepted in place of Connor. . Of course the fact that Heddle was like Connor, a servant and pr\u00eate nom of the appellants, is carefully concealed. By this time, Noxon, the inspector,\nknew all about the combine in prices and so writes Heddle to Fulton fears an attack from the Patron element in time.\nBut he had no reason to suspect that he was dealing with the Consumers Cordage and in the interest of their gigantic monopoly. But, adds Mr. Connolly to Heddle,\nI hope you will get the thing through as soon as possible, This Mr. Heddle had been the confidential book keeper of the appellants for years, and in February, 1896 had been sent to the Central Prison to look after their interests, which he reported to be in bad shape. Contracts were \"mixed up\" with the Brantford business. The accounts were \" not in such a state as they should.\" On the 25th of February, 1896, he writes to Fulton :\nI mentioned to you last right that my impression as to the working of Central had not been satisfactory. I regret to confirm this.\nFrom that time Heddle took the full management of the whole business on behalf of the appellants, and was recognized as the representative of P. L. Connor by the prison authorities, expecting that the assignment would soon he completed.\nIn the meantime (20th June, 1896) the respondents had guaranteed a new line of credit in his favour with the Dominion Bank to the extent of $60000.\nThe assignment had been signed by P. L. Connor, on the 7th March, 1896, the name of the assignee being, however, left in the blank, but filled afterwards with the name of Robert Heddle at the request of the appellants and respondents. Months elapsed before the matter was really approached by the Ontario Government It appears from the evidence of Mr. Noxon that no objection would have been made to the assignment provided an additional bond of $10,000 was given which the respondents readily granted, and, in fact executed on the 15th October, 1896. But serious difficulties between the appellants and respondents were brewing about the repayment of advances. Heddle, acting at the request of the appellants, dropped his application for a confirmation of the transfer to himself and the business continued to be carried on by Heddle in the name of P. L. Connor as previously. Finally, two other documents fully exhibit the true position of the parties '.\n1st \u00c1 deed of agreement set forth in the declaration of the respondents, signed by them and the appellants on the 29th February, 1896, which reads as follows :\u2014\nThat, whereas Mr. P. L. Connor, of Brantford, Ontario, has acquired the right from the Government of the province of Ontario to manufacture binder twine in the Central Prison in the city of Toronto in the said province, for a period of five years from October 1 one thousand eight hundred and ninety-five, to October 1 nineteen hundred, the party of the second part hereby agrees to transfer and make over to the party of the first part the said \"right \" from the Government of the province of Ontario to manufacture binder twine in the Central Prison in the city of Toronto in the said province for the full period of said contract with P. L. Connor.\nThe party of the second part further agrees to furnish all the capital that may he required for said manufacturing operation at said Central Prison for and during the full term of the twine season of 1896, at which time the party of the first part hereby agrees to reimburse said party of the second part all moneys they have invested in said business, and not later than October 1 1896 with interest thereon at eight per cent per annum, but it is understood and agreed that at least $40,000 (forty thousand) of this amount shall be paid between June 1st and 15th, 1896, and, if required, the party of the second part shall assist the party of the first part to obtain any part of this amount through the Dominion Bank of Toronto, as well as a sum of seven thousand three hundred and fifty dollars ($7,350.00) constituted by P. L. Connor as a first charge on the earnings of said manufacturing institution, and taken over by the party of the second part in settlement of the accounts with John Connor, of St. John, N.B. The payment of this amount shall extend over the first two years of the Government contract\nWe have already seen that soon after the respondents obtained from P. L. Connor a transfer in favour of Heddle, for and on behalf of the appellants that they did everything in their power to have the same ratified by the Government, and that finally without their interference, its acceptance would have been obtained.\nThe above agreement, if it has any validity, establishes beyond doubt that the judgment appealed from, allowing the whole of their demand with the exception of $7,350, which was not due before September 1897, is well founded.\nThe second deed, although not signed by the respondents, contains admissions by the appellants which are, perhaps, unnecessary in face of all the documents and the evidence in the case. But as it is approved by the board of directors it is not without importance. First, on the 15th September, 1896, the following resolution was adopted by the board:\nThat Mr. Elisha M. Fulton, sr., be, and is hereby authorized to sign and enter into an agreement indemnifying Messrs. Nicholas K. Connolly and Michael Connolly, in respect of the bond and suretyship undertaken by them in respect to the Toronto Central Prison contract, on the 25th day of September, 1895, and assigned by Patrick L. Connor to Robert Heddle, acting for this company which the directors consider it advisable to carry out.\nThis is, I believe, the only paper passed by the board of directors, but it is sufficient to establish the authority of Fulton to act as he did. The business of the Central Prison in the name of Patrick L. Connor, conducted first by John Connor and last by Robert Heddle, was the business of the appellants.\nIt must be added, however, that it does not appear that the directors were aware of the methods used by their president and manager. These were probably considered as mere details left to his own judgment.\nThe deed of indemnity is dated the 3rd of October, 1896, and reads as follows :\nWhereas, the said Nicholas K. Connolly and Michael Connolly have become sureties and bondsmen to and in favour of the Inspector of Prisons and Public Charities for the province of Ontario for the fulfilment by one Patrick Louis Connor and his assignee, Robert Heddle of a certain contract made between the said Inspector of Public Prisons and Charities and the said Patrick L. Connor, on the twenty-fifth day of September, 1895, at the request of the Consumers Cordage Company, and;\nWhereas, the said Robert Heddle is an employee of the said Consumers Cordage Company, Limited, and carries on the said enterprise in the interests of the said company and the said Consumers Cordage Company, Limited and the said Elisha M. Fulton, senior, personally, desire to indemnify the said Nicholas K. Connolly and Michael Connolly, in respect of the undertaking given by him to the Inspector of Prisons and Charities.\nNow, therefore, it is agreed and covenanted by and between the said parties hereto as follows, to wit :\u2014\n1. In consideration of the said Messrs. Nicholas K. Connolly and Michael Connolly having become bondsmen and sureties, as herein above set forth the said Consumers Cordage Company, Limited, and the said Elisha M. Fulton, senior, personally, hereby guarantee and agree to indemnify and hold harmless the said Nicholas K. Connolly and Michael Connolly, in respect of all undertakings given by them as such bondsmen and sureties, and agree to pay to the said Nicholas K. Connolly and Michael Connolly on demand, the amount of any damages which they may be put to in respect of their said undertakings.\nFinally, as the respondents were pressing for money, an itemized account was made up, on or about the 1st of October, 1896, at the request of both parties, by Heddle and one Martin R. Connolly confidential book keeper of the respondents (but hot related to them), in the head office of the Consumers Cordage in Montreal, and accepted as s settled \" there by the parties.\nThat settlement of accounts is produced and the respondents claim what still remains due and payable under the same. The two courts below have found it proved and they also found that the appellants promised to pay the same. As remarked by Sir Melbourne Tait, A.C.J., the appellants practically admit this fact in their pleadings. They allege,\nthat the said statement was prepared by plaintiffs simply as being the amount which would have been payable by the defendants to the plaintiffs, had plaintiffs procured the consent of the Lieutenant-Governor in council to the transfer of the said contract to them, (the said defendants) and the said defendants never undertook or promised, or bound or obliged themselves to pay the said sum of money or any part thereof until the said transfer and consent were legally and formally given, and granted by the Lieutenant-Governor in council, and at the time the said statement was prepared, the said plaintiffs specially and particularly promissed and undertook that they would. procure the said consent of the said transfer as required by paragraph 17, of the said contract, of the 25th September, 1895.\nBy the deed of the 29th February, 1896, the respondents,\nagreed to transfer over to the party of the first part the said 'right' (to manufacture binder twine in the Central Prison) from the Government of the province of Ontario.\nIt is impossible that the parties contemplated a transfer to the appellants in their own name. Such a deed would have killed the enterprise. What was intended in the agreement of the 29th of February 1896 was a transfer to Heddle from Patrick L. Connor whose management, through John Connor had been recently found unsatisfactory by Heddle. This transfer from Patrick L. Connor to Heddle was soon afterwards executed and would have been finally accepted by the Ontario Government if no hostile action had been taken by the appellants.\nThere is ample evidence in support of the findings of the courts below, partly quoted by Sir Melbourne Tait-\nWriting to Heddle, on the 12th November 1896 Fulton, speaking of the itemized account further says :\u2014\nThat is only showing a balance due them of nearly $400000, because that amount was made up with the $50000 security deposit, $7,500 Connor's election contribution, a large amount of interest and other things that I allowed to go in at that time on a basis of their giving us the prison now and carry until next summer all last season's twine\nOn the 7th November, 1896, Fulton, hearing further that the bank was also pressing for the payment of a demand note for $47, 000 wrote to Heddle :\u2014\nI am sorry to feel so distrustful of the Connollys for in most respects they have behaved generously towards the company, but they are evidently now trying to force us to take over the prison and all its twine or transfer the lease to some new party and are using the bank to force us to an issue This places us in a very embarrassing fix. The company is now carrying so much twine it will be impossible to take on this additional prison load, and to throw it up means our losing. the control of the prison altogether, which will be most unfortunate\nOn several occasions Fulton expressed his regrets at \u2022 his inability to raise the necessary funds to put the Connollys out of the concern. He offered bonds of an American coal company, in liquidation, but as they were not marketable they were not accepted, and no other alternative was left to both the bank and the respondents, but to take legal proceedings. The pre sent action was instituted on the 23rd of December 1896, and the business of the appellants, in the name of P. L. Connor in the Central Prison, soon after collapsed.\nNow let us see how this contract was worked out in so far as the Ontario Government and the farmers of Canada were concerned. The results were :\u2014\n1. The uniformity of prices and a monopoly in the twine mills of Canada, which were all either owned or operated by the appellants. At the very beginning, Fulton boasted to the Connollys that the getting of the twine mills would permit the appellants \" to keep the market at any price they thought fit, or, at least, at a paying price.\"\nOn the 29th October, 1895, on the very occasion of signing of the contracts between the parties, in the solicitor's office in the presence of the respondents, called the a associates,\" John Connor writes to the appellants :\u2014\nGentlemen,\u2014As my brother. P. L. Connor, has secured the control of the Ontario prison plant, for making binder twine, for a period of five years on the terms of the Government public prospectus, I beg hereby to state in his behalf, that this contract was secured by him and myself in the interests and for the benefit of the Consumers' Cordage Co The business is to be conducted in P. L. Connor's name, but under the direction and control of the Consumers' Cordage Co. It is understood that I am to be allowed 8 per cent interest on the capital employed. The output is to be marketed from year to year. Having also the disposition of the product of the binder twine plant of the Kingston Penitentiary, it is hereby agreed that said output of binder twines shall be marketed conjointly with the Consumers' Cordage Company, and the undersigned, in conformity with such conditions as will guarantee absolute uniformity of prices.\nOn the 1st May, 1896, Fulton sends to Heddle, a \"list of prices now established for the season\" that is the first season following the date of the contract, observing at the same time :\nI suppose you have all twine particulars from Jenkins or Bonnell. Note your telegram about Bonnell, representing all the manufacturers. I have thought a good deal about this and of the importance of avoiding even the appearance of a combination, but it will not pay to put out a man for each company and Bonnell can so easily attend to all The price list is not issued by any one or combination of manufacturers, but goes out as from Bonnell, commercial broker, salesman, or whatever you please to call him, not the special representative of any one manufacturer. You can now quote prices in reply to all inquiries, not sending price list, but writing each party and quoting prices you know especially adapted to their trade or wants.\nHe wished so much to avoid even the appearance of combination that on the 5th of June, 1896, he did not hesitate to request Heddle to ask Noxon for permission\nto do business in the name of the Central Prison or Central Reformatory, Robert Heddle, agent or contractor\nbut whether the permission was granted or not, does not appear.\n2. Fictitious cost of twine.\u2014The contract provides for a certain mode of ascertaining the price to be paid by farmers, by adding to the cost price of the fibre, cost for manufacturing, allowing for waste, etc., and one and one-half cents per pound, and finally, adds clause 5, par. d :\nThe aggregate shall be the maximum selling price of the twine to farmers for their own use. On the 1st May 1896 Fulton writes to Heddle :\nWe will be called upon by Noxon to submit items of our cost of prison twine under the contract. We are required to sell any farmers applying to the prison at cost, and 11\/2c per pound profit. Noxon may ask for these items and you must he prepared to furnish them and support your figures with evidence. Here is my idea of cost per 100.\nFollows a list of figures shewing cost price to be $8.25 per 100 lbs, for manilla rope and $6.06 for sisal. And he concludes:\nSo if you can make good our estimate of cost, our prices must be satisfactory to the Government.\nOn the 4th of May Heddle answers:\nI shall go carefully into your costs of twine at the Central.\nSo far as we can judge from a letter of Noxon to P. L. Connor of the 29th December 1896 this estimate of cost was accepted under reservation.\n3. Fraudulent decrease of production.\u2014 The contract provides for a production of four tons or over of binder twine per day of ten hours, subject to a heavy fine. Early in the season of 1896, he urges the necessity of closing: down the Central, so that the stock in hand in other mills where no contract limitations existed might reach the market. As early as the 28th February, 1896, and for two months previously, Heddle reports to Fulton that the Central Prison had not worked \" an average of two hours per day.\" Writing to Heddle on the 26th of June, 1896, Fulton says : \" Cannot we get up an excuse to shut Central Prison down until next holidays. Intimate casually that machinery is in bad shape making bad twine. On the 14th of July he writes that Halifax has been closed for the season; Port Hope, now running on Standard, will also close down this week.\nWe are not making, he adds, any twine at this mill. As soon as you finish sisal orders you will have to shut down too. We have so much mixed twine that we can change tags and bags to suit any orders that may come in. When you shut down you should arrange to get your packers on very short notice to change bags and tags when required.\nSubsequently, during September and till the 11th of December, 1896, Fulton incessantly writes to close down for a year if possible, or at least for any length of time See letters of the 12thOctober 21st October, 1896 11th November and 8th and 11th December, 1896. In a letter of the 24th of September, 1896, Heddle writes to Fulton :\nAs wired you yesterday, Mr. Noxon has decided to place the prisoners in the binder twine mill on Monday and continue from day to day, charging the contractor on four tons per day. I interviewed the warden in regard to this, but he flatly refused to remain any longer idle. Mr. Noxon would not argue the matter one moment: the latter gentleman is perfectly aware that Connolly wants to go out of it.\nAnd on the 7th of November 1896, he instructed Heddle:\nGo as slow and light on prison work as possible, so that your present stock of hemp will hold out until we get the matter settled.\nIt is evident that the combined efforts of Fulton and of his agents were directed to injure the Government of Ontario in particular and the community in general.\nIt must be remarked that the respondents, although fully aware of the end which the appellants had in view when acquiring the business of the Central Prison, do not appear to have taken any part in, or to have had any knowledge of, the methods employed by Fulton and Heddle to reduce the production or increase the cost price. The same remark applies to the board of directors. , who, like the respondents, were acquainted with the nature and object of the organization. Conjectures and suppositions might be made as to these matters and other details hut they are insufficient to sustain a verdict. Such, are the facts proved in the case. Unfortunately for the parties in this cause they establish clearly that a conspiracy, affecting injuriously public interests by unreasonably raising the price of an article of commerce, had been organized and maintained by them and their agents for more than one year for the benefit of the company appellants.\nBut can we take notice of these facts which have not been set up in the pleadings, nor in the factums, or even at the hearing before us? Can we, of our own motion, pronounce the adventure illegal and even criminal, and as a necessary consequence, all the transactions connected with it? In France before the promulgation of the code, the opinion seemed to prevail that courts of justice can do so and since the code there are quite a few jurists who hold the same view. D'Argentr\u00e9, Ancienne Coutume de Bretagne, art 266, ch. 2, n. 11: Dunod, Prescriptions. 1st Part, ch. 8, p. 47; Bouhier, Coutume, ch. 19, n. 12; 7 Toullier, n. 553; Dalloz, Rep. vo Nullit\u00e9, n. 49; Arr\u00eat of the 26th March, 1834, reported in Troplong, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, vol. 1, p. 111; Premier Des Actions, n. 201. According to some other authorities illegality of contracts cannot be pronounced except at the request of one of the parties interested or of the state if the nullities are absolute and in the public interests. See 1 Biret, Des Nullit\u00e9s, 49; 1 Laurent, nn. 69 to 72; 1 Demolombe, n. 381.\nThe rule is clearly laid down in the English and American jurisprudence\u2014although, perhaps, not more than one or two precedents can be quoted where it was actually enforced \u2014that a judge is in duty bound, ex-officio, to notice illegality of that character. I have been able to collect from the law reports two cases in point, Scott v. Brown, ([2]) decided in 1892 by the English Court of Appeal, and Fabacher v. Bryant, ([3]) which was decided in 1894 by the Supreme Court of Louisiana. These decisions, and the language of all the judges in the other cases, proceed upon the ground that if, from the statements of one of the parties either in the courts below or in appeal, or otherwise, the cause of action appears to arise ex turpi caus\u00e2, or out of the transgression of a positive law, \" there,\" continues Lord Mansfield,\nthe court says he has no right to be assisted. It is upon that ground the court goes, not for the sake of the defendant, but because they will not lend their aid to such a plaintiff.\nHolman v. Johnson ([4]); Price v. Mercier ([5]); City of Montreal v. McGee ([6]); L' Association St. Jean-Baptiste de Montr\u00e9al v. Braull ([7]). But see Clark v. Hagar ([8]).\nAt first I entertained some doubts upon this point of procedure. I was afraid that articles 110 and 113 of the new Code of Civil Procedure of Quebec might interfere with the old ruling. This code came into force some months before the case was argued in the first court, but after the issues were joined. Article 110, which is new, says :\u2014\nEvery fact which, if not alleged, is of a nature to take the opposite party by surprise, or to raise an issue not arising from the pleadings, must be expressly pleaded.\nArticle 113: The court cannot adjudicate beyond the conclusions, that is as set up in the issues.\nThese rules were no doubt enacted in the interest of the parties themselves, and were never intended to apply to a case like this where law and order are alone at stake and where both parties are interested to be silent rather than to expose themselves to a criminal charge\nThere is, however, a declaration of principle in article 2188 of the civil code which seems to settle this point. It is conceded that laws of prescription under the code are laws of public order, but, in consequence of that article, they cannot be applied by the judge ex proprio mot\u00fb, meaning that, in every other case, laws of public order must be noticed by him. Art. 2188 :\u2014\nThe court cannot, of its own motion supply the defence resulting from prescription, except in cases where the right of action is denied.\nAnd does not article 1000 likewise lay down the principle that absolute nullities can be noticed officially, without any action or pleading?\u2014\nError, fraud and violence or fear are not causes of absolute nullity in contracts. They only give a right of action, or exception, to annul or rescind them.\nNow let us see what effect in law this unforeseen feature of the case will have upon the action of the respondents.\nEx turpi caus\u00fb non oritur actio \u2014This and other kindred maxims of the Roman law have been adopted by all civilized nations, whether governed by that system of laws or by the common law of England. The law reports of every country are full of decisions where courts of justice have refused to enforce contracts opposed to good morals or public policy or prohibited by positive laws. It would be a waste of time to cite the cases where this fundamental principle, upon which rests the whole social edifice, has been applied; they are well known to the bar and are collected in the text books and the law digests, and more particularly in the American and English Encyclopedia of Law, (2 ed.) vo., Illegal Contracts, and in Dalloz, Repertoire, vo. Obligations, nn. 553 to 651, and Supplement, nn. 157 to 193. The difficulty exists only when courts of justice come to deal with actions arising incidentally out of illegal transactions. - In these cases, the jurisprudence of Great Britain and France are far apart; and it must be added that in some of them there is great diversity of opinion in the courts governed by the English Common law.\nThis case as I understand it is not to be decided according to the principles of the English jurisprudence nor by those of the Roman law but by the rules laid down in the Civil Code of the province of Quebec, similar in this respect to the French code. All the contracts were executed and signed in the city of Montreal. The advances which are involved in this cause were also made in Montreal to the appellants or their agents, although the money was actually used by them in Toronto. In fact the headquarters of the adventure were in Montreal, where all reports were made and all instructions came from. But even if the transactions had taken place in Toronto, sitting as we do in a Quebec case without any proof that the laws of Ontario differ from those of Quebec I must assume that they are alike. Glengoil S. S. Co., v. Pilkington ([9]). Finally, article 6 of the Civil Code, says that the law of Lower Canada is applied\nwhenever the question involved relates * * * to public policy.\nThere is no room for doubting that in Old France, and for many years after the promulgation of the Code Napol\u00e9on, judges and jurists followed the rules of the Roman law. As in England it was held that courts of justice would not assist a wrongdoer in recovering any money, whether due or paid, in respect of a contract prohibited by law or contrary to good morals or public policy, for few French jurists make the distinction between malum in se and malum prohibitum. The Civil Code is explicit :\u2014\nThe consideration is unlawful when it is prohibited by law or is contrary to good morals or public order. C.C., art. 990; C.N., art. 1133. Under the old law recovery condictio indebiti would not be allowed in any such case. As Pothier, Obi. No. 43, observes, the wrongdoer having sinned against the laws and public morals is unworthy of the assist anee of the public courts,\nest indigne du secours des lois pour la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de la somme due.\nDomat and Merlin are of the same opinion and all the early commentators of the French Code such as Toullier, Duranton, Troplong, Delvincourt and others, who simply adopt the Roman law and ignore the articles of the Civil Code. Larombi\u00e8re and Aubry et Rau and a few others make a distinction between contracts which are immoral or criminal and those which are only illegal, ultra vires or against public policy, a distinction which has been followed by the Quebec Court of Appeal in Rolland v. La Caisse d'Economie de Notre Dame de Qu\u00e9bec ([10]) without, however, expressing any opinion as to the question of r\u00e9p\u00e9tition in cases of immoral contracts, n'\u00e9tant pas app\u00e9l\u00e9s \u00e0 la decider observes Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9 speaking for the court but when this court came to deal with the same case, the principle was merely laid down that money lent by a hank contrary to law, can be recovered back ([11]) This and other distinctions were introduced by the Scholastics, Grotius even holding that after the consummation of the crime, the wrongdoers could assert their rights in a court of justice. See Barbeyrac sur Puffendorff (ed. 1713), vol. 1, pp. 402 to 410. They were partially recognized by the tribunals of Europe, including the English courts, at least till after the time of Lord Mansfield but since they have been very considerably modified, both in England and in France. See Benjamin on Sales and Smith's Leading Cases and Pandectes Fran\u00e7aises, Rep. vo. Obligations. For the purposes of this case, it is unnecessary to examine the nature and effect of these distinctions which are altogether inapplicable to it. The broad rule must be established that under the Code moneys advanced or paid, not being the profits of the illegal, or even immoral or criminal adventure or contract can always be recovered back by the advancing party, whether or not he be a principal to the same. Ernest Dubois in a foot note to an arr\u00eat of the Court of Cassation, of the 15th December, 1873, which is reproduced by Mr. Justice Routhier in the recent case of McKibbin v. McCone ([12]) is about the only recent writer of note who advocates the old rule. He takes some notice of the articles of the Civil Code but considers them inapplicable. His reasoning, however, is refuted by nearly all the subsequent commentators. Dubois asserts that\nparmiles auteurs qui out \u00e9crit depuis la promulgation du Code Civil, l'exclusion de la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition est encore la doctrine qui compte le plus de partisans.\nThis was undoubtedly true at the time Dubois wrote in 1873. But among those he mentions, how many did refer to the articles of the code? They all invoke purely and simply, the rules of the Roman law, precise and express if you like but inconsistent with the spirit and text of the code. And if we look at the number of writers who since Dubois' time, have expressed an opinion on the subject, it cannot be denied that to-day the large majority of the commentators are opposed to the Roman doctrine. Dubois further states that la grande majorit\u00e9 des arr\u00e9ts is in favour of it but to do so he is obliged to set aside quite a number of arrets rendered in cases of sale or cession of public offices, which he endeavours to distinguish from the ordinary cases of illegal contracts. The commentators adverse to his views cannot see any ground for distinguishing, and in support of the general rule that la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de l'indu lies to recover back moneys paid under an illegal or even an immoral contract Marcad\u00e9 for instance concludes :\nLa doctrine contraire dont quelques arrets out fait l'application \u00e0 la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de la partie du prix d'offices minist\u00e9riels convenu en dehors du trait\u00e9 ostensible, est enfin repouss\u00e9e aujourd'hui par la jurisprudence. See Huc, Vol. 8 n. 392\nThere may possibly be cases where the sense of justice would be so shocked as to close its eves and ears and turn the rascals out of court the moment the true character of the suit is revealed, for instance a demand to recover back moneys paid to commit murder or other atrocious crimes, although I do not wish to express any opinion upon a supposition of that kind. No case of this description can be found in the reports and there is very little probability that in the future more than in the past criminals of this class will ever soil the precincts of courts of justice for they are well aware that they would have to face a cross-demand by the State for confiscation. We need not trouble for the present at least, about these imaginary cases, and we may treat them as the legendary English one of Everett v. Williams, where, in 1725, the highwayman, in a disguised declaration, was suing his companion to account for his share in the plunder. It is not reported anywhere, except in the European Magazine for 1787, vol. 2, p. 360, undoubtedly as a good sensational story for its readers. Lord Kenyon, after examing the office, found no record of it, and we may well pronounce it a fiction, as much as the more amusing case of Bardell v. Pickwick, reported in Dickens. See Evans' Pothier, vol. 2, p. 3.\nThe Code Napoleon, art 1131, 1235, 1376, 1965 and 1967 is reproduced almost word for word in articles 989, 1047 1140 and 1927 of the Civil Code of the province of Quebec. Art. 989 says :\nA contract without a consideration, or with an unlawful consideration, has no effect.\nIt is argued that to refuse la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de l'indu would be to give to such a contract a most important effect, which, also upon grounds of public policy, ought not to be tolerated. Even partners, whatever may be their rights to demand an account of the unlawful profits, are entitled to restitution of moneys put by them into the legal firm. In all cases of illegal immoral or criminal contracts, the parties should be replaced where they stood before the illegal act was committed.\nArticles 1140 of the Civil Code introduced a new maxim into the French law :\nEvery payment presupposes a debt; what has been paid where there is no debt may be recovered.\nThe Roman law, which was followed by Pothier, Domat and the old commentators admitted the action condictio indebiti only when error was shown. The principle of our code that no one is allowed to enrich himself at the expense of another did not exist in the Roman law.\nThen article 1140 makes an exception to the general rule:\nThere can be no recovery of what has been paid in voluntary discharge of a natural obligation.\nFinally, article 1927, already referred to, contains another exception in respect to gaming contracts and bets, which are generally prohibited by the same article:\nIf the money or thing has been paid by the losing party, he cannot recover it back, unless fraud be proved.\nThese exceptions, it is contended, establish the general rule that in all other cases of illegal contracts recovery of moneys paid can be obtained. After some hesitation and not without some dissenting voices, it has finally been accepted by the courts and commentators.\nMarcad\u00e9 was one of the first, about 1845, to denounce the old doctrine as being contrary to the text of the code and to public policy, and no doubt the authority of his great name had considerable influence upon the change which about that time took place in the French jurisprudence. He says, vol. 4, n. 458:\nNous ne saurions adopter ce syst\u00e8ms qui nous parait aussi contraire \u00e0 l'int\u00e9r\u00eat social qu'au texte de la loi. Notre Code, \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence du droit romain, ne permet pas qu'on s'enrichisse jamais aux d\u00e9pens dautrui; il ne veut pas qu'on puisse jamais garder le bien qui appartient \u00e0 d'autres. Aussi l'art. 1376 d\u00e9clare-t-il de la mani\u00e8re la plus absolue que quiconque re\u00e7oit ce qui ne lui est pas dl est oblige \u00e0 le restituer sans distinguer pourquoi ni comment a \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9e la chose qui n'\u00e9tait pas due; tandis que le droit romain ne permettait la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition \u00e0 celui qui avait pay\u00e9 ind\u00fbment qu'autant qu'il l'avait fait par erreur; Si quis indebitum ignorans solvit, condicere potest; sed se sciens se non debere solvit, cessat repetitio ([13]). Il ne faut donc pas argumenter ici du droit romain : et du moment qu'un bien n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9 qu'en ex\u00e9cution d'une obligation nulle, et d\u00e8s lors sans \u00eatre d\u00fb, le juge ne peut pas se dispenser, en face de l'art. 1376, d'en ordonner la restitution. La doctrine contraire, dont quelques arr\u00eats ont fait l'application \u00e0 la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de la partie du prix d offices minist\u00e9riels convenu en dehors du trait\u00e9 ostensible, est enfin repouss\u00e9e aujourd'hui par la jurisprudence.\nIn a foot note to the 7th edition of his work published in 1873, nearly twenty years after his death, no less than twelve decisions of the Cour de Cassation are quoted in support of his views.\nDemolombe soon followed and did not hesitate to hold the same opinion. He says :\nNotre avis est que la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition devrait \u00eatre toujours admise, lorsque le payement a \u00e9t\u00e9 en vertu d'une obligation qui avait une cause illicite * * * D'une part, l'article 1131 dispose dans les termes les plus absolus, que l'obligation sur une cause illicite ne peut avoir aucun effet; or, cette obligation aurait un effet, et m\u00eame un effet tr\u00e8s important, si elle faisait obstacle \u00e0 la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition; donc il r\u00e9sulte du texte m\u00eame qu'elle n'y saurait faire obstacle. D'autre part les plus hautes consid\u00e9rations d'int\u00e9r\u00eat public nous paraissent exiger que ces obligations soient consid\u00e9r\u00e9es de la fa\u00e7on la plus consid\u00e9rable, comme destitu\u00e9es de toute valeur juridique, et qu'elles ne puissent engendrer aucun droit ([14]).\nLaurent, Vol. 16, n. 164 :\nAux termes de l'article 1131, l'obligation sur une cause illicite ne peut avoir aucun effet, or, n'est-ce pas lui donner un effet tr\u00e8s-important que d'emp\u00eacher la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition? L'ordre public et la moralit\u00e9 ne seraient-ils pas bless\u00e9s si celui qui a retire un b\u00e9n\u00e9fice d'une convention que la loi r\u00e9prouv\u00e9e pouvait le conserver? Voil\u00e0 la vraie turpitude, pour nous servir du langage traditionnel il n'y a qu'une mani\u00e8re de pr\u00e9venir ce scandale, c'est de donner l'action en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition dans tous les cas\nColmet de Santerre, ed. 1883, Vol. 5 n. 49 bis :\nL'ex\u00e9cution m\u00eame de l'obligation n'en couvrirait pas la nullit\u00e9, et la partie pourrait r\u00e9p\u00e9ter ce qu'elle aurait pay\u00e9, car elle aurait pay\u00e9 ce qu'elle ne devait pas. Cette decision, admise g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement en ce qui concerne les obligations sans cause, est cependant l'objet de vives controverses quand il s'agit des obligations sur cause illicite. On trouve, en effet, dans des textes de droit romain une distinction que Pothier a reproduite et qu'un grand nombre de jurisconsultes modernes out adopt\u00e9e. On accorde la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition \u00e0 la partie dont le role dans la convention, n'a rien d'immoral et on la refuse du moment que celui qui a fait un paiement avait jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le immoral dans la convention primitive. Si Pierre a promis 1,000 francs \u00e0 Paul pour que celui-ci s'abstienne de commettre un d\u00e9lit on accorde \u00e0 Pierre la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition apr\u00e8s qu'il a pay\u00e9; mais s'il s'agissait d'exciter Paul \u00e0 commettre un d\u00e9lit on refuse la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition.\nSur la premi\u00e8re hypoth\u00e8se la solution de Pothier est incontestable soit qu'on accorde la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition, d'apr\u00e8s les principes sur les obligations sans cause, soit qu'on la conc\u00e8de en vertu de la r\u00e8gle sur les conditions illicites. Mais, dans la deuxi\u00e8me esp\u00e8ce, nous ne voyons pas comment, dans le droit fran\u00e7ais actuel, la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition peut \u00catre d\u00e9ni\u00e9e \u00e0 celui qui a pay\u00e9. Il ne devait pac ([15]) il a pay\u00e9 donc il a le droit de rep\u00e9rer ([16]). Les articles qui consacrent le droit de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter l'indu ne distinguent pas en vertu de quelle r\u00e8gle la chose pay\u00e9e \u00e9tait indue. Il faudrait une exception \u00e0 l'article 1235 et \u00e0 l'article 1376, pour que l'opinion de Pothier put \u00eatre admise dans notre droit. Cette exception n'est pas dans notre Code, et nous pouvons ajouter elle ne devait pas s'y trouver. En effet la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 ce que celui qui stipule le salaire d'un acte illicite soit bien convaincu qu'il ne poss\u00e9dera jamais ce salaire en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9, que non-seulement il ne pourra en obtenir le paiement, mais qu\u00e9 le paiement, m\u00eame effectu\u00e9 n'aura pas un caract\u00e8re stable et d\u00e9finitif.\nPont Explications du Code Civil, ed. 1884, vol. 7, il. 53 under the title Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s .\nAssur\u00e9ment, la pr\u00e9tention du d\u00e9tenteur serait audacieuse, puis qu'elle ne tendrait \u00e0 rien moins qu'\u00e0 retenir pour lui toutes les mises et \u00e0 s'enrichir ainsi aux d\u00e9pens de ses coassoci\u00e9e en invoquant le fait d\u00e9lictueux, ou en tout cas illicite, dont, aussi bien que ceux-ci, il serait lui-m\u00eame l'auteur ou le complice; mais il s'en faut de beaucoup que sa d\u00e9fense p\u00fbt \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme p\u00e9remptoire. On lui r\u00e9pondrait justement que, ayant re\u00e7u les mises non comme propri\u00e9taire, mais comme simple d\u00e9positaire en vue d'un emploi sp\u00e9cial et convenu entre tous il est d\u00e9tenteur sans cause et ne peut \u00e9chapper \u00e0 l'action en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition d\u00e8s que l'emploi est prohib\u00e9 par la loi, ou des qu'il est contraire aux bonnes m\u00e6urs ou \u00e0 l'ordre public. Et il n'est pas de tribunal qui put se consid\u00e9rer comme emp\u00each\u00e9 de faire droit \u00e0 l'action en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition, parce que, bien loin d'invoquer l'existence de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, celui qui forme cette action se fonde pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment sur l'invalidit\u00e9 de la convention. C'est pour faire pr\u00e9valoir la nullit\u00e9 qu'il intente sa demande; et c'est en l'accueillant seulement qu'on donne satisfaction \u00e0 la loi puisque la repousser ce serait maintenir les effets du contrat, l'un des associ\u00e9s retenant alors le montant des apports, qu'il n'a Pu toucher, cependant, qu\u2019en vertu de ce contrat.\nGuillouard, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ed. 1892, n. 58 :\nToute autre est la nature de l'action par laquelle l'associ\u00e9 r\u00e9clame la restitution de l'apport qu'il a verse; il invoque pour agir, non pas le fonctionnement de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 non pas l'existence d'une communaut\u00e9 de fait, que l'on ne peut pas substituer apr\u00e8s coup, nous le reconnaissons \u00e0 une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ill\u00e9gale; mais il invoque pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment ce qui a-\u00e9te jug\u00e9 la nullit\u00e9 de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et, se fondant sur le principe qu'un contrat nul ne peut produire aucun effet il demande \u00e0 son ancien associ\u00e9 de lui restituer des valeurs qu'il d\u00e9tient sans cause. C'est donc le d\u00e9fendeur qui est amen\u00e9 pour s'approprier d'une mani\u00e8re immorale des apports auxquels il n'a aucun droit, \u00e0 rappeler la cause pour laquelle la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9e. Les tribunaux devront, croyons-nous, lui r\u00e9ponde qu'ils n'ont plus \u00e0 s'occuper de la cause de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 car la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 n'est plus en question, mais des cons\u00e9- quences de la nullit\u00e9 qu'ils ont prononc\u00e9e, et ils ordonneront la restitution des valeurs pour la r\u00e9tention desquelles il ne peut invoquer aucune cause l\u00e9gitime.\nDalloz, Suppl\u00e9ment, 1893, evidently does not consider the question as yet open to any discussion. At n. 2308, vo. Obligation, he merely observes :\nIl y a lieu \u00e0 l'action en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition lorsque le payement a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 en vertu d'une cause illicite\nThe compilers of the Pandectes Fran\u00e7aises vo. Obligations, n. 7855 also published in 1893 after setting forth the two systems in controversy and authorities pro and con conclude:\nLa meilleure mani\u00e8re de pr\u00e9venir la formation de certaines conventions honteuses ou illicites, c'est de donner l'action en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition dans tous les cas. Cette raison d'int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a une valeur bien sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celles que l'on peut donner en sens contraire, soit que l'on s'arme du fait de la possession c'est-\u00e0-dire que l'on subordonne la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 un pur hasard, soit qu'un repousse le demandeur en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition \u00e0 raison de son indignit\u00e9, comme si l'on pouvait raisonnablement le d\u00e9clarer indigne d'exercer la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition apr\u00e8s le payement, alors qu'on ne le consid\u00e8re pas comme indigne d'invoquer la nullit\u00e9 de l'obligation par voie d'exception s'il ne l'a pas encore pay\u00e9e.\nIt is useless to add that the R\u00e9pertoire of Dalloz and the Pandectes Fran\u00e7aises are considered as the best legal periodical publications of France at the present time, published as they are by a committee of professors, lawyers and judges renowned for their learning and accuracy.\nHue and Baudry-Lacantinerie, the recognised leading authorities at the Bar and Bench and in the University of France, to-day both hold the same views. Huc, vol. 8, n. 392, ed. 1895, says:\nOn admet par exception que la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition est possible, ind\u00e9pendamment de toute erreur, quand le paiement a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 en vertu d'une convention illicite, alors m\u00eame que le d\u00e9biteur aurait particip\u00e9 sciemment a l'acte illicite, par exemple quand il s'agit de la cession d'une part d'o office minist\u00e9riel Baudry-Lacantinerie, after referring to a few contrary arr\u00eats rendered chiefly by inferior courts, con ' eludes likewise that the jurisprudence allowing recovery is the correct one :\nL'article 1131 qui dispose que l'obligation sur cause illicite ne peut avoir aucun effet serait viol\u00e9 s'il n'y avait pas lieu a r\u00e9p\u00e9tition; car l'obligation sur cause illicite, devenant ainsi inattaquable, serait plus r\u00e9sistance que les obligations dont la cause est licite ([17]).\nHue and Lacantinerie quote several recent arr\u00eats of the Court of Cassation in support of their contention; Cass. 11th Feb. 1884, S. 84 1 265; 25th Jan. 1887, S. 87, 1, 224; 11th Dec. 1888, and 8th Dec. 1889, S. 89, 1, 213. They also refer to the articles of Meynial, S. 90, 2, 87; 91, 2, 81; and G. Appert, 96, 1, 290. See also Cass. 3rd Feb. 1879, S. 79, 1, 411; Cass. 14th May, 1888 D. P. 88 1 487; Caen 16th Jan. 1888, Id. 2, 319; Seine, 26th July, 1894, P. F. 95, 2, 282; Besancon, 6th March, 1895, P. F. 96, 2, 221; Poitiers, 28th Dec. 1896, P. F. 98, 1, 529.\nMr. Charmont, reviewing the whole French jurisprudence in a foot note to the ar\u00eat of Poitiers on the 28th December 1896 concludes :\nNous souhaitons vivement que le syst\u00e8me consacr\u00e9 par notre arr\u00eat, conforme a l'interpr\u00e9tation de la chambre civile (a branch of the Court of Cassation), finisse enfin par l'emporter. Dans tous ces cas de convention sur cause illicite, il nous parait impossible de refuser l'action en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de l'indu sans violer le texte du code et les principes de notre droit. L'art. 1131 d\u00e9clare que l'obligation sur cause illicite ne peut avoir aucun effet. Comment ne pas reconna\u00eetre qu'elle en aurait un si elle pouvait valider un payement, et si la convention pouvait devenir inattaquable par le seul fait de son ex\u00e9cution 1 Ce qui nous semble encore plus \u00e9vident, c'est que la maxime, qui s'expliquait en droit romain, n'a plus aucune raison d'\u00eatre dans notre l\u00e9gislation; son application n'est qu'une sorte d'anachronisme; c'est tout au moins le r\u00e9sultat d'une confusion. Pour s'expliquer les restrictions apport\u00e9s \u00e0 l'exercice de la condictio ob turpem causam, il faut ne pas oublier que cette condictio est, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, le correctif d'une l\u00e9gislation qui ne se pr\u00e9occupe pas de la cause. A Rome le contrat normalement est formel; l'obligation r\u00e9sulte de l'accomplissement de certaines formalit\u00e9s l\u00e9gales. Quand on a prononc\u00e9 la formule de la stipulation, le d\u00e9biteur est oblige; on ne se demande pas quel but il a poursuivi en s\u2019 obligeant. Cependant, pour temp\u00e9rer la rigueur de ce principe, on vient, dans certains cas. an secours de d\u00e9biteur; s'il est oblig\u00e9 sans cause, sur fausse cause ou sur l'exception non numerate pecuni\u00e6, la condictiosine causa la condictio ob turpem causam. Mais cette protection ne peut jamais lui \u00eatre accord\u00e9e que s'il para\u00eet digne d'int\u00e9r\u00eat; il ne peut \u00e9tre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme tel lorsqu' il a lui-m\u00eame poursuivi un but illicite, et c'est pourquoi, dans cette hypoth\u00e8se la condictio lui est refus\u00e9e ([18]). Il en est tout autrement dans notre droit La cause est actuellement un \u00e9l\u00e9ment n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la formation du contrat; si ce contrat n'a pas de cause ou Si la cause est illicite il est nul et ne peut avoir aucun effet. Les parties n'\u00e9tant pas oblig\u00e9es, tout payement fait par l'une d'elles est indu. Et puisque le droit d'agir en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition n'est qu'une simple cons\u00e9quence de cette nullit\u00e9, on n'a pas \u00e0 se demander si le contractant qui pr\u00e9tend l'exercer, n'encourt aucun reproche; on ne peut jamais le lui refuser ([19]).\nI might add considerably to this list of authorities. See for instance, B\u00e9darride, Fraude vol. 3 nn. 1304 to 1307; Rivi\u00e8re, fur. Compar\u00e9e, nn. 366 to 369; Pillette, Rev. Pra. 1863, t. 15 p. 467; Boistel, Dr. Com. n. 356; Pont, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, n. 51; Lyon-Caen et Renault, 2 Dr. Com. ed. 1892, n. 236; Duvergier, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, n. 30, sur Toullier, vol. 6 n. 126; 7 Rev. Etran. et Fr. vol, 7 p. 568; Boileux, art. 1133, vol. 4, p. 386; Vavasseur, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, ed. 1897, vol. 1, n. 40; 3 Arntz, n. 39.\nHardly one of the two writers can be found within the last quarter of a century in favour of the old rule. I know that we are not bound by the French text books nor even the French decisions but both have always been considered as forming the jurisprudence of France, which could not be and never was overlooked by this court, nor by the Privy Council on all occasions and they are so numerous that it is unnecessary to recall them whenever dealing with articles of the Quebec Code similar to the French Code I feel that I cannot disregard the opinions of these great jurists, who are generally considered in Quebec cases as the best exponents of our code; nor can I ignore the numerous decisions of the Court of Cassation and other French tribunals. Even if I were entertaining a different view, I would hesitate to regard it as the true interpretation of the articles of the code. But the reasons they advance commend themselves to my mind; they are conclusive, and I have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the respondents are entitled to recover back the amount of their advances, but without interest, so as to place the parties exactly where they stood when the illegal transactions took place. In the lottery case of L'Association St. Jean Baptiste de Montr\u00e9al vs. Brault, ([20]), this court decided last term that the contract was illegal and even criminal, and without adjudicating as to the reimbursement of the principal sum advanced, which was not involved in the case refused the interest, which alone was demanded. Few recent French decisions have allowed legal interest from the date of payment, the debtor being considered in bad faith. 0. N., art, 1878. There is a similar article in our code, art. 1049, but it applies only to payments made \" through error of the law, or of fact,' and not to a case like the present one; Art. 1047. In France it applies to all payments not due, whether made by error or knowingly, sciemment. C. N. Art, 1376. We have only Art. 989, which declares that a contract with an unlawful consideration has no effect, and consequently cannot carry interest from the day of maturity, although of a commercial nature, as provided for by article 1069. Therefore, no interest can be allowed before the institution of the action. C. C. Arts 1067, 1077. As to the incidental demand for damages claimed by the appellant for the alleged breach of the contract of 29th February, 1896, the judgment dismissing the same must be confirmed, not only for the reasons given In the courts below, but also because it purports to enforce an illegal contract.\nFor these reasons, I would deduct from the itemized account all the items for interest, amounting altogether to $4,339.62, thus reducing the judgment against the respondents to $18,044.66, with interest thereon from the 23rd of December 1896 date of the institution of the action and all costs\nThe judgment on the incidental demand is confirmed with costs\nAppeal allowed in part with costs.\nAn application for leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was refused.\nSolicitors for the appellant : McGibbon, Casgrain, Ryan & Mitchell,\nSolicitor for the respondents : E.

S. C. c. 135 s. 26 (3).\nLeave to appeal direct to the Supreme Court from a judgment of a Divisional Court of the High Court of Justice under sec. 26, sub-sec. 3 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, cannot be granted unless it is clear that there is a right of appeal from such judgment to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. Motion for leave to appeal direct from the judgment of Mr. Justice MacMahon increasing the amount awarded to plaintiffs by arbitrators appointed to determine the value of lands expropriated by the defendant company.\nThe motion was first made to the registrar of the court sitting as a judge in chambers, who refused the application, and an appeal from his decision to Mr. Justice Taschereau in chambers was referred by him to the full court.\nThe appellant company is a corporation to which the Railway Act of Canada applies. In 1900 notice was given to the plaintiffs of the company's intention to expropriate their land in the township of Nepean offering to pay $2,124.60 therefor which offer was refused. Arbitrators were then appointed under the provisions of the Railway Act to determine the value of the land and they awarded the plaintiffs $2,865, which being deemed insufficient an appeal was taken to the High Court of Justice from the award and heard before Mr. Justice MacMahon, who increased the amount to $5,861. The company applies for leave to appeal direct from the judgment of MacMahon J. to the Supreme Court.\nIn the case of Birely v. Toronto, Hamilton & Buffalo Railway Co.[1], on appeal from the decision of Armour C.J.[2] affirming an award by arbitrators under the Railway Act, the Court of Appeal held that a party dissatisfied with such an award might appeal either to a Divisional Court or to the Court of Appeal, but if he elected to go to the former there was no further appeal to any provincial court.\nGlyn Osier in support of the motion.\nIn Farquharson v.

JUSTICE STREET. Election petition\u2014No return of member\u2014Illegal deposit\u2014Parties to petition.\nA petition under The Dominion Controverted Elections Act (R. S. C. ch. 9) alleged that T., a respondent, who had obtained a majority of the votes at the election was not properly nominated, and claimed the seat for his opponent, and that if it should be held that T. was duly elected his election should be set aside for corrupt acts by himself and agents.\nHeld, that the petition as framed came within the provisions of sec. 5 of the Act and that T. was properly made a respondent.\nAppeal from a decision of Mr. Justice Street overruling preliminary objections to the election petition.\nAt the election of members of the House of Commons on November 7, 1901, for West Durham, the candidates were the appellant Thornton and Robert Beith. Thornton received the greater number of votes, but exception having been taken to the deposit of $200 at his nomination by marked cheque neither party was returned as elected, but a special return was made of the circumstances. Then an election petition was filed against Thornton and the returning officer which, after stating the necessary facts as to the petition and of Beith's nomination, alleged as follows: \"4. And your petitioner further states that at the time fixed by the said proclamation, or prior thereto, Charles Jonas Thornton, of the township of Clarke, in the county of Durham, farmer (hereinafter called the respondent), or some one on his behalf, did produce to the returning officer for the said election a nomination paper, stating therein the name, residence and addition of the said respondent as a person proposed, but neither at the time the said nomination paper was produced to and filed with the returning officer, nor at any time prior or subsequent thereto, was the sum of $200 in legal tender or in the bills of any chartered bank doing business in Canada, deposited in the hands of the said returning officer by or on behalf of the said respondent Thornton.\"\n\"5. And your petitioner further states that on the day fixed by the said returning officer for summing up the votes cast at the said election, objection was taken to the return of the respondent by reason of the invalidity of his nomination, as more particularly set forth in paragraph 4 hereof, and the said returning officer, in view of such objection, made a special return of all the circumstances to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery at Ottawa, and returned no member as elected at the said election.\"\n* * * * * *\n\"7. And your petitioner submits that the nomination paper of the said respondent was invalid and should not have been acted upon by the returning officer, and by reason of the invalidity of the nomination paper of the respondent your petitioner submits that his election was null and void and that he should not be returned as member for the said Electoral District, but that the said Robert Beith, being the only candidate validly nominated at the said election, should have been returned as elected thereat.\" \"8. And your petitioner further states that if it should be determined by this honourable court that the said respondent was duly nominated and entitled to have been returned as elected at the said election, such election of the said respondent was undue, and should be declared to be null and void, by reason of the fact that the said respondent by himself, by his agents and by other persons on his behalf before, during, at and after the said election, was guilty of bribery, treating, personation and undue influence, as defined by the Dominion Elections Act. the Dominion Controverted Elections Act, and other Acts of the Parliament of Canada, whereby the said respondent was and is incapacitated from serving in parliament for the said Electoral District.\"\nThe petition alleged other corrupt acts and prayed\u2014\n\"(1) That it may be determined that the nomination of the said respondent was invalid and should not have been acted upon, and that the said Robert Beith should be returned as elected thereat, or that a new election should be ordered for the said Electoral District.\"\n\"(2) Or, in the alternative, that if this honourable court shall be of opinion that the said respondent was duly nominated at the said election, then that it may be declared that the said election was undue and should be declared to be null and void, for that the respondent, by himself, and by his agents, was guilty of the said several corrupt and illegal acts and practices hereinbefore charged as having been committed by him, or by his agents, before, during, at and after the said election.\"\nPreliminary objections to the petition were filed on behalf of the respondent Thornton, among them being the following: \"The said petition in its form and contents and the relief sought is unauthorized in law, and is in violation of the provisions of sections 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the Dominion Controverted Elections Act, inasmuch as it attempts to group together in one petition, with but one deposit of security more than one cause of complaint, to wit\u2014no less than three causes of complaint. (1) Of no return; (2) Undue election of your said respondent; (3) Unlawful acts of a candidate, to wit, your said respondent, not returned, the effect of which is that your said respondent is alleged to have become disqualified to sit in the House of Commons.\"\nArgument on the preliminary objections took place before Mr. Justice Street when they were overruled and an appeal was taken from his judgment to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nW. D. McPherson for the appellant. Thornton should not have been made a respondent to this petition. It alleges that he was not a candidate and complains of \"no return\" of a member. The only person responsible for that is the returning officer. See Harmon v. Park[1].\nAll candidates are not necessary parties. Monkswell v. Thompson[2]; Lovering v. Dawson[3]; Lyne v. Warren[4].\nAssuming the facts alleged in the petition to be proved the prayer could not be complied with. North Victoria Election Case[5] following Stevens v. Tillett[6].\nAylesworth K.C. for the respondent was not called upon. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014(Oral): The law applicable to this case is contained in section 5 of The Dominion Controverted Elections Act[7], which section, so far as it is material to the appeal, reads as follows:\n5. A petition complaining of an undue return, or undue election of a member, or of no return, or of a double return, or of any unlawful act by any candidate not returned, by which he is alleged to have become disqualified to sit in the House of Commons at any election may be presented to the court by any one or more of the following persons:\n(a) A person who had a right to vote at the election to which the petition relates; or\n(b) A candidate at such election.\nThe fifth paragraph of the election petition, which alleges that\u2014\non the day fixed by the said returning officer for summing up the votes cast at the said election, objection was taken to the return of the respondent by reason of invalidity of his nomination, as more particularly set forth in paragraph four hereof, and the said returning officer in view of such objection made a special return of all the circumstances to the clerk of the Crown in Chancery at Ottawa, and returned no member as elected at the said election,\nbrings the case within the section of the Controverted Elections Act, just read, the petitioner being a person who had a right to vote at the election, and the allegation being that there was \"no return\" of a member elected.\nThe appellant claims that as it was alleged in the petition that he was not duly nominated, and therefore not a candidate, he could not be made a respondent. But he was a candidate de facto if not de jure, and Mr. Beith could not claim the seat without giving him an opportunity to assert his rights before the election court.\nI am far from saying that all the points presented for our consideration are precluded by this decision. On the contrary, many of the arguments so ably urged before us by counsel for the appellant may be renewed when the petition comes on to be heard on its merits and should then have great weight. Our present decision is on a matter such as might have been raised on demurrer in an action.\nTASCHEREAU, SEDGEWICK and GIROUARD JJ. concurred.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I only desire to say this. I think that a petition framed as the one in this case could be properly presented to the election court, but I was doubtful whether or not it should have been presented against the returning officer alone, but that is a question which might more properly come up on the trial of the merits of the petition and not on preliminary objections. I do not dissent from the decision of the court.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. D. McPherson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Simpson & Blair.\n[1] 6 Q. B.

An execution having been threatened he then paid the taxes under protest. In 1897 he was again assessed under the same circumstances, and took the same course with the exception of appealing to the Supreme Court of Canada from the judgment refusing a certiorari, and that court held the assessment void and ordered the writ to issue for quashing. J. then brought an action for repayment of the amount paid for the assessment in 1896.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, that the judgment refusing a certiorari to quash the assessment in 1896 was res judicata against J., and he could not recover the amount so paid.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick setting aside a verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiff and ordering judgment to be entered for the defendant.\nThe material facts are set out in the above head-note.\nCurrey K.C. for the appellant. The assessment for 1896, the amount of which was paid by plaintiff and which he now seeks to recover, was precisely the same as that for 1897 which was declared illegal by this court. Jones v. City of St. John[1]. He has, therefore, a right to be repaid the money to which the city was never entitled. City of London v. Watt[2]; Preston v. City of Boston[3].\nThe appeals committee was without jurisdiction as the assessment was illegal and consequently the judgment refusing certiorari is not res judicata against the plaintiff. Mayor, &c., of London v. Cox[4].\nC. J. Coster for the respondent. The appellant cannot set up want of jurisdiction in the inferior court unless such defect appears on the face of its proceedings. Colonial Bank of Australasia v. Willan[5] following Reg. v. Bolton[6]. See also Brittain v. Kinnaird[7].\nThe appellant having paid the tax voluntarily after the judgment refusing a certiorari such judgment is res judicata. Flitters v. Allfrey[8].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by;\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (oral).\u2014I have read very carefully the opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Barker in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, and I entirely agree with it. The taxes of 1896, which form the subject of the present action, fall within the same category as those of 1897 in respect to which we gave our former judgment (1). But putting this entirely out of the question, here we find that Mr. Jones, after having been assessed, applied to the statutory tribunal, the appeals committee of the common council, which had authority to deal with the subject matter, and rendered the decision in consequence of which he paid the taxes now sought to be recovered. This alone would have constituted res judicata against him, but we have more. The plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, before making the payment, which he made only after that court had affirmed the decision of the appeals committee. As was suggested by my brother Taschereau, if the Supreme Court had decided the other way, it would have been res judicata in favour of Jones.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: L.

[1897] c. 223 s. 606 (2).\nAbout 10.30 a.m. on a morning in January a man walking along a street crossing in Toronto slipped on the ice and fell receiving injuries from which he eventually died. His widow brought an action for damages under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act, and on the trial it was shown that there had been a considerable fall of snow for two or three days before the accident, and on the day preceding there had been a thaw followed by a hard frost at night. There was evidence, also, that early in the morning of the day of the accident employees of the city had scattered sand on the crossing but the high wind prevailing at the time had probably blown it away.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (27 Ont. App. R. 410) that the facts in evidence were not sufficient to show that the injury to the deceased was caused by \u201cgross negligence\u201d of the Corporation within the meaning of R.S.O. [1897] ch. 223, sec. 606 (2).\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the above head-note. Aylesworth K.C. for the appellant referred to Town of Cornwall v. Derochie[2]; Driscoll v. Mayor of St. John[3].\nFullerton K.C. and Chisholm for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE J.\u2014In the judgment of the Court of Appeal at Toronto in this case and in the reasons upon which that judgment is founded I entirely concur. For the suggestion that the original grade upon which the street crossing where the accident occurred was constructed was so faulty and defective as to constitute any ingredient in establishing that \u201cgross negligence\u201d of the Corporation necessary to maintain an action against them, there was not in the evidence the slightest foundation whatever; and the only other suggestion of negligence of the Corporation was in substance to the effect merely, that they had not succeeded in preventing the severe inclemency of the weather upon the morning in question, in which inclemency a high wind travelling at the rate of from 24 to 28 miles an hour constituted a most material element, from being attended with its natural consequences. There was evidence that between the hours of 7 and 8 and of 9 and 10 on that morning the Corporation had made use of the ordinary method to countervail the inclemency of the weather by spreading sand upon the crossing in question, but that such method proved ineffectual in the present case was reasonably attributable to the high wind not suffering the sand to remain upon the slippery places where it was spread. To hold the defendants responsible in the present case would not only have the effect, as stated by the learned judges of the Court of Appeal, of depriving the defendants altogether of the recent Ontario statute which exempts municipal corporations from liability in the cases of accidents occasioned by falling on icy places unless in case of gross negligence by the Corporation, but would introduce a new element of liability by making the Corporation responsible as for gross negligence in not providing means which shall prove effectual to prevent injury happening to any one from ice upon the streets in the city being occasioned by the inclemency of the weather however severe it be. The appeal must, in my opinion, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Barwick, Aylesworth & Wright.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Thomas Caswell.\n[1] 27 Ont.

The total expenditure is not to exceed $300,000 and not more than $20,000 can be expended in any one year without a vote of the ratepayers.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (27 Ont.

The action in this case was brought for the price of work done by the plaintiffs as contractors for the installation of a filtration plant in connection with the waterworks system of the City of Windsor under a contract with the Board of Water Commissioners, and the only question to be decided on the appeal was whether or not the Board could make a valid contract for the work without the sanction of a by-law of the City Council.

City of New York[7].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This action although for the recovery merely of the sum of $892 is one of very considerable importance not only because this sum is claimed as a progress estimate of work which involves the outlay of $20,000 if an instrument purporting to be a contract dated the 7th November, 1896, between the plaintiffs and the defendants is valid and binding, but also because it raises a much more important question namely, whether the corporate body called the Water Commissioners of the City of Windsor are agents only of the municipal corporation of the city and subordinate thereto in the performance and discharge of the duties and powers imposed upon and vested in them by the Act incorporating them or, on the contrary, are paramount to the municipal corporation of the city, and can compel the latter body to adopt a scheme or process of filtering suggested by a majority of the corporate body called The Water Commissioners, &c., which consists of only three persons, and to provide the money necessary to pay the expense of putting the scheme into operation although a by-law passed by the city council for the purpose of taking the opinion of the ratepayers upon the scheme was, in accordance with the provisions of the law in that behalf, submitted to the ratepayers in 1895 and was rejected by them. It is admitted that the municipal corporation of the city are the only persons by the statute incorporating the Water Commissioners made liable to pay for the works mentioned in the document of the 7th of November, 1896, if that constitutes a valid contract; the question really in issue therefore is whether the municipal corporation of the city was under an obligation to pay the $20,000 mentioned in that document and which the corporate body called the Water Commissioners have therein undertaken to covenant to pay or cause to be paid to the plaintiffs. The details of the circumstances which led up to the execution of the document sued upon as a binding contract and the provisions of the statute in virtue of which alone the Water Commissioners had any authority, and under which alone they purported to act, have been so fully dealt with by the learned judges of the Court of Appeal at Toronto that I do not propose to deal with those matters so fully dealt with by them further than to say that I entirely concur in their construction of the statute by which the defendants have been made a corporate body called the Water Commissioners of the City of Windsor, and that such corporation in the discharge of the duties imposed upon them, and in the exercise of the powers vested in them by the statute incorporating them, act as agents of, and not as paramount to, the municipal corporation of the city.\nThese Acts in the Province of Ontario which vest the management of waterworks in small corporate bodies seem to have been drafted by different persons employed by the several municipal corporations petitioning the legislature for the passing of the. several Acts and so we find the form and frame of the Acts somewhat different, but these essential elements maintained in all of them namely, that all the works when constructed and all profits derived therefrom in excess of the money spent annually in maintenance are the property of the municipal corporations respectively, and that by-laws must be passed by the councils of the municipalities in the manner required by law to authorise the expenditure of any of the funds of the municipal corporations for the construction of the works contemplated to be constructed before any contract valid and binding upon the municipal corporation can be entered into by the commissioners. Thus in 1872 was passed the Act 35 Vict. ch. 79 incorporating the Water Commissioners of the City of Toronto. That Act was passed at the instance of, and upon the petition of the municipal council of the cor- poration of the city. In the preamble it is recited among other things that\nthe Council of the Corporation of the City of Toronto have by petition declared that it is deemed necessary and advisable that the said Corporation of Toronto should have the power to purchase, construct, have and manage as to them shall seem meet certain waterworks on behalf of the City of Toronto, and it is expedient to grant the prayer of the said petition.\nThe Act then proceeds in its first section to enact\n1. That the Corporation of the City of Toronto by and through the agency of commissioners and their successors to be elected and appointed as hereinafter provided may, and shall have power to, design, construct, build, purchase, improve, hold and generally maintain, manage and construct waterworks and all buildings, or other machinery and appliances therewith connected or necessary thereto in the City of Toronto and parts adjacent as hereinafter provided.\nSection 2 then enacts that the commissioners and their successors should be a body corporate consisting of five members of whom the mayor for the time being shall ex officio be one\u2014but the mode of selection of the other four is postponed to the 37th and 38th sections of the Act. Sec. 3 and the subsequent sections prescribe the duties and powers of the commissioners as such corporate body, and for the purpose of constructing the said waterworks and for meeting the payment of any other matter or thing contemplated or allowed by the Act, the Corporation of the City of Toronto are empowered to raise the money necessary by the issue of debentures not exceeding in the whole the sum of five hundred thousand dollars as is provided in section 29. Then by sec. 37 it is enacted that\nthis Act shall not have any force or effect until the Council of the Corporation of the City of Toronto shall pass a by-law authorising the construction of the said waterworks and on the said by-laws being finally passed it shall be lawful for the mayor of the said city and he is hereby authorised and required within fifteen days after the passage of the said by-law to issue his warrant under the corporate seal, &c. Here follow provisions for procuring the election of the four other commissioners, who together with the mayor, constitute the corporate body. Now by this Act it is plain that the commissioners so made a corporate body are as such corporation subordinated to, and authorised to act merely as agents of, the municipal corporation assisting them in the construction, maintenance and management of the works authorised to be constructed by the by-law required to be passed before ever the corporate body for construction, maintenance and management comes into existence, and it is to works so authorised by by-law of the city corporation that the duties and powers vested by the Act in the subordinate body are limited. Upon the same day was passed the Act 35 Vict. ch. 80, whereby the mayor for the time being and one person elected for each ward by the citizens, as provided in the Act, were made a corporate body under the name of the Water Commissioners of the City of Ottawa. The preamble of that Act recited that the corporation of the City of Ottawa had passed a by-law for the construction of waterworks, and for raising by debentures the sum of $400,000, and that the ratepayers of the city had assented thereto; that such sum was not sufficient for the purpose, and that the corporation had petitioned to be authorised to repeal the former by-law and to pass another for raising the sum of $500,000 for the same purpose. This Act was plainly framed upon the model of the City of Toronto Act, 35 Vict. ch. 79, with which, including sec. 37, it is identical in every respect save that it omits the 1st section of the Toronto Act, which in my opinion was reasonably deemed unnecessary in view of the provisions of sec. 37, which are identical with those of sec. 37 of the Toronto Act. Then in 1874 was passed 37 Vict. ch. 78 entituled \u201cAn Act for the construction of waterworks for the Town of Peterborough.\u201d This Act contains all of the sections of the Toronto Act, 35 Vict. ch. 79, which prescribe the duties and powers of the commissioners when incorporated, but it contains some more sections not important to be considered in the present case; its 38th section is in. pari materi\u00e2 with sec. 37 of the Toronto Act, but is more precise in its provisions. It enacts sec. 38\u2014\nThis Act shall not have any force or effect until the council of the corporation of the town of Peterborough shall pass a by-law authorizing the construction of the said waterworks,\nbut no by-law shall be so passed until first, estimates of the intended expenditure shall be published for one month and notice of a poll to be taken on the proposed by-law, and a copy of the by-law shall be also published for one month: nor secondly until such poll shall be taken and a majority of the electors voting at the poll are in favour of the by-law; nor thirdly, unless the by-law is thereafter passed at some meeting of the council of the corporation held not less than ten days nor more than one calendar month after the taking of such vote; and sec. 39 enacted that if the proposed by-law should be rejected at such poll no other by-law for the same purpose should be submitted to the electors for the current year. Upon the same day was passed the Act 37 Vict. c. 79, under which the defendants in the present action were incorporated. The preamble of that Act recites that the municipal corporation of the town (now the city) of Windsor had established waterworks at an expense of $100,000, and that the municipal council of the corporation had by petition asked for an Act to provide for the better working, management and extension of the said waterworks and to legalize and confirm by\u2011law No. 20 passed by the town council and approved by the ratepayers in aid of waterworks, and that it is expedient to grant the prayer of the said petitioners. The Act then enacted:\n1. The waterworks already constructed or that may hereafter be constructed in the town of Windsor, or in any adjacent municipality, in extension thereof under the provisions of this Act shall be placed under the management of commissioners and their successors to be appointed as hereinafter provided, who shall have power to design, construct, build, purchase, improve, alter, hold and generally maintain, manage and conduct waterworks and all buildings, matters, machinery and appliances therewith connected or necessary thereto in the town of Windsor or parts adjacent as hereinafter provided.\n2. The commissioners and their successors shall be a body corporate under the name of the \u201cWater Commissioners of Town of Windsor,\u201d and shall be composed of three members of whom the Mayor of the town of Windsor for the time being shall be ex officio one and the said commissioners shall have all the powers necessary to enable them to manage the system of waterworks now established, to extend the same, to construct new or additional ones and to carry out all and every the other powers conferred upon them by this Act.\nThen from sec. 3 are inserted sections identical with these in the three Acts already mentioned containing provisions as to the duties imposed upon, and the powers vested in the commissioners as a corporate body and those which declare the whole property in the works mentioned in the Act and in the rent and profits accruing therefrom annually less the amount of necessary disbursements of the commissioners for management to be vested wholly in the municipal corporation for the general purposes of the municipality. The section which vests in the municipal corporation the power of raising all the funds necessary to be expended in construction and repairs is the 33rd which enacts that\nfor the purpose of acquiring the necessary lands, rights and privileges for the extension and repairs of the said waterworks, or for the purpose of meeting the payment of any other matter or thing contemplated or allowed by this Act, the corporation of the town of Windsor shall have power\nto raise by debentures a sum not exceeding $300,000 including debentures for waterworks then already issued,\nbut every by-law for raising on the credit of the said municipality any money, additional to that already raised for waterworks purposes, shall, before the final passing thereof, receive the assent of the electors of the town of Windsor in the manner provided for in the 231st section of the Municipal Institutions Act, except that the municipal council of Windsor may raise by by-law or by by-laws without submitting the same for the assent of the electors of the town any sum or sums not exceeding in any one year $30,000 for waterworks purposes.\nThis sum is by the Act of 1894, 57 Vict. ch. 87, reduced to $20,000. Then the sec. 45 of 37 Vict. ch. 79 declares, as it appears to me, in clear terms, that in the exercise of the powers vested by the Act in the water commissioners incorporation, that body acts only as agents of, and as subordinate to, or concurrently with the municipal corporation in the matter of waterworks, for the whole cost of the construction and maintainance of which, as the property of the municipal corporation, they alone are liable, and therefore, as it seems to me, they should be made defendants, if not sole defendants, in every action brought to recover any sum of money made payable in respect of every valid contract for such purposes entered into by their agents the water commissioners incorporation.\nIn 1894 was passed the Act 57 Vict. ch. 87 in amendment of the Act 37 Vict. 79. By that Act it was enacted that\nfor the purpose of extending the water mains, constructing a new intake pipe, and repairing the waterworks of the City of Windsor, the corporation of the said city shall have power to issue debentures for the said city in addition to the debentures authorised to be issued by the town of Windsor under the provisions of sec. 33 of 37 Vict. ch. 79,\nand it was enacted that every by-law for issuing debentures for raising money under the provisions of that Act should be submitted to the ratepayers under the provisions of the Consolidated Municipal Act, provided always that the said corporation may issue by by-law or by by-laws without submitting the same to the ratepayers any sum of money not exceeding in any one year $20,000\nfor the purposes mentioned in this Act. It has been argued that the rejection by the ratepayers of the by-law submitted in 1895 for raising a sum of money (I do not see the amount stated) for the purpose of putting into operation the filtering process spoken of must not be regarded as a rejection by the ratepayers of the principle of the filtering process as inefficient, but should be attributed to the fact that the application of the money of the municipality to instituting the filtering process was not authorised by that Act, the purposes thereof as therein mentioned being limited to extending the water mains, constructing a new intake pipe, and repairing the waterworks of the city. It may be admitted that the purposes named in the Act do not include the filtering process, but that is rather a question of law depending on the construction of the Act which naturally should have been considered before submitting the by\u2011law to the ratepayers. The question as submitted to them, I think, was whether, assuming the by-law to be quite legal, the ratepayers approved of the outlay of the public money as proposed to the particular purpose named in the by-law. Assuming then an outlay of the public money for the purpose of putting the filtering process into operation not to be within the purposes specified in the Act of 1894 I do not well see how it can be said to be within the purposes of the Act of 1874. The municipality had expended the sum of $281,700 of the $300,000 authorised to be raised for the purposes of that Act, namely for extending and improving the waterworks previously established under by-laws or a by-law passed for the purpose by the council of the municipality as provided by the Act. Of the $300,000 so. authorised to be raised only the sum of $18,300 remained unapplied. Granting it then to have been competent for the city municipality to have raised that sum for some waterworks purposes, it would seem, I think, that such purpose should be for some work additional to the works mentioned in the Act of 1874, which had been completed under the provisions of the by-laws or by-law passed for that purpose, and the council of the municipality alone could determine what the particular purpose should be to which such $18,300 or any part thereof should be applied Now at the time of the passing of the Act of 1894 that sum not having been applied to any waterworks purpose would seem, I think, to have come under the Act of 1894 by which $200,000 in addition to that sum were appropriated to the purposes named in the Act. This expression in the 1st section, \u201cin addition to the debentures mentioned,\u201d &c., &c., seems to me to appropriate the $18,300 remaining unapplied under the Act of 1874 equally with the $200,000, to the purposes mentioned in the Act of 1894.\nThis point not having been mentioned in the argument before us I do not rest my judgment upon it although it seems to me, I confess, to add some strength to the judgment of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal in which independently, however, of it I entirely concur. As no valid contract for any work in excess of $20,000 could be entered into by the Water Commissioners Corporation until after the passing of a by-law by the council of the municipality assented to by the ratepapers authorising the construction of the work named in the by-law, so equally no valid contract can be entered into by them under the statute for the construction of any work to cost less than $20,000 unless in virtue of a by-law previously passed by the council of the municipality authorising the construction of such work. The water commissioners corporation are not by the Act made paramount to the city corporation, nor have they any power to compel the municipal council to pass a by-law, the principle of which they may utterly disapprove of as wasteful, extravagant, ineffectual for the purpose contemplated or of an experimental character, or the principle of which had been disapproved of and rejected by the ratepayers, or for the purpose of experimenting upon suggestions of the commissioners. The statute does not place the council of the municipality in subjection to the water commissioners of the city in any such manner. I am of opinion also that the city corporation were a necessary party if not the sole necessary party to be made defendants in the present action, for if the instrument sued upon constituted a valid contract under the provisions of the Act of 1874 the question really at issue was. Were the city corporation bound by the act of their agents, the water commissioners corporation? To an action raising such an issue the city corporation was the necessary party. The judgment condemning the water commissioners corporation to the payment of the sum demanded, $892 with costs, has no force under the statute if it is not imperative upon the city corporation to fulfil and satisfy the judgment, and that question could not be adjudicated upon adversely to the city corporation in their absence, and there is no warrant for dividing such a claim against the city into two actions instead of determining the whole question in one action by making the city corporation the actual as they are the real defendants. For all the above reasons I am of opinion that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Murphy, Sale & O\u2019Connor.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Clarke, Cowan, Bartlet & Bartlet.\n[1] 27 Ont.

The cause of action arises on commission of the first act of adultery, and the statute begins to run then. Evans v. Evans[2]; Patterson v. McGregor[3].\nHyde K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The cause of action first set out in the statement of claim in this case is the old action on the case for criminal conversation expressed in the language of the modern formula of pleading, and, as so stated, is in substance simply that in the year 1885 (it should have been 1886), upon the request of the defendant, the plaintiff\u2019s wife left the home of the plaintiff with the defendant, and that they went together to the City of Toronto, in the province of Ontario, where ever since their arrival they have lived, and still, at the time of the commencement of this action, do live together in adulterous intercourse, whereby the plaintiff has been deprived of the comfort and enjoyment of the society of his wife, and her affections have been alienated from the plaintiff, and he has been deprived of the assistance which he formerly derived from her and to which he was entitled.\nTo this is added a paragraph asserting a cause of action for wrongfully enticing the plaintiff\u2019s wife from the plaintiff and procuring her to absent herself from him for some time from the year 1885 (should be 1886), to the time of the commencement of this action.\nAs this cause of action was only inserted to meet the case of the plaintiff being unable to prove the adulterous intercourse charged in the previous paragraph, and as that intercourse has been established by most abundant evidence, the cause of action stated for wrongfully procuring the plaintiff\u2019s wife to absent herself from her husband has become merged in the charge for adulterous intercourse, and is, apart from that cause of action, quite immaterial, and it was so properly treated at the trial. It is only necessary, therefore, for us to deal with the cause of action for adulterous intercourse as set out in the statement of claim.\nNo plea in denial of that cause of action has been put upon the record, unless the plea of the Statute of Limitations, namely,\nthat the cause of action which the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim purports to set forth did not accrue within six years next before the writ of summons herein was issued\nmay be construed as being a plea of \u201cnot guilty\u201d within six years.\nThe averment in the statement of claim that in the year 1886, the defendant took the plaintiff\u2019s wife from the plaintiff\u2019s house in Doncaster, England, where they resided, and removed to the City of Toronto, and has ever since lived with her there in adulterous intercourse, and is still living with her in such intercourse, is precisely equivalent to an averment that the defendant is now at the time of the bringing of this action living with the plaintiff\u2019s wife in adulterous intercourse in the City of Toronto, and has lived with her in such adulterous intercourse ever since some time in the year 1886, when he induced her to elope with him from the plaintiff\u2019s house in Doncaster, England, and qu\u00e0cunque vi\u00e2 it is viewed, a plea that a cause of action so alleged did not accrue within six years next before the commencement of the action can admit of no other construction than that no part of the adulterous intercourse, which is the cause of action stated, to which the plea is pleaded, took place within six years before the commencement of the action.\nIn an action on the case for criminal conversation according to the old form of pleading, the wrong might have been stated to have been committed \u201cdiversis vicibus et diebus,\u201d and in such a case it was competent for a plaintiff to recover upon proof of adulterous intercourse having taken place within six years before the commencement of the action.\nHow then when, as here, it has been abundantly proved by witnesses who have known the defendant ever since his arrival in Toronto, in September, 1886, and it is sworn absolutely by the defendant himself, that he and the plaintiff\u2019s wife have been and still are living together in adulterous intercourse, can it be argued that the plaintiff is deprived by a plea of the Statute of Limitations of his right to recover in this action because of its being alleged in the statement of claim that the adulterous intercourse commenced in England in 1886, and has ever since continued?\nWhen, to an action of the nature of the present, the Statute of Limitations is pleaded and an isolated case appears, or several distinct isolated cases appear, to have taken place more than six years before the commencement of the action and a case or cases is or are shown to have occurred within six years, evidence of those cases which occurred at periods beyond the six years must be excluded from the consideration of the jury, and the damages recoverable are limited to the cases proved to have occurred within six years before action. This was the case of the Duke of Norfolk v. Germaine[4]. \u201cWhether or not that rule is applicable to a case like the present where the adultery charged is one continuous cohabitation alleged to have been commenced in England in 1886, and to have been continued to the present time, it is not necessary to decide in the present case, for the learned Chief Justice Meredith, at the trial, in very clear terms directed the jury to exclude from their consideration everything which, by the evidence, appeared to have occurred within the six years next ensuing the elopement in 1886, and to confine themselves to the subsequent conduct of the parties. For the contention that the Statute of Limitations is a complete bar to the plaintiff\u2019s remedy, notwithstanding the proof of the relationship which existed between the parties during the six years next preceding the commencement of the action, there is no foundation in law\nThen it was argued that strict evidence of the actual marriage of the plaintiff was necessary, and that such evidence was not given. Evidence of an actual marriage, i.e. a marriage de jure, was undoubtedly necessary although there was no plea on the record denying the marriage and expressly putting it in issue. Rule 403 made under the authority of the Ontario Judicature Act is as follows:\nSave as aforesaid the silence of a pleading as to any allegations contained in the previous pleadings of the opposite party is not to be construed into an applied admission of the truth of such allegation.\nThe editors of the last edition of the Judicature Act, Messrs. Holmsted & Langton, say in a note to this rule:\nWhen a material fact is alleged in pleading, and the pleading of the opposite party is silent in respect thereto the fact must be considered in issue\nciting Waterloo Mutual v. Robinson[5]; and Seabrook v. Young[6].\nThis rule is in terms the exact reverse of the English Order 19, rule 13 which provides that:\nEvery allegation of fact in any pleading if not denied specifically or by necessary implication or stated to be not admitted in the pleading of the opposite party shall be taken to be admitted. It was therefore incumbent on the plaintiff to give strict proof of the marriage.\nThis it appears to us he has done sufficiently by the supplementary proof which the learned Chief Justice permitted to be given after the trial of the issues which were left to the jury. That the Chief Justice had the power to adjourn the trial for the reception of such evidence and for further consideration and to permit proof by affidavit there can be no doubt, in view of the rules 564, 567 and 682.\nThe only point remaining is upon the question whether we should grant a new trial.\nThe claim for a new trial is rested upon what appears, I think, to be a misconception of the charge of the learned Chief Justice to the jury, which appears to have very fairly and fully drawn the attention of the jury to all the matters urged by the defendant\u2019s counsel in his client\u2019s behalf. The defendant\u2019s ground of complaint, if any there be, seems to be that the jury have not given that consideration to the points so submitted to them by the learned Chief Justice which the defendant thinks was due to them rather than to any just ground of complaint against the charge given to the jury.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Lobb & Baird.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Louis F.

There is no dispute as to the facts, and the questions we have to decide are entirely matters of law. The learned Chief Justice of Ontario dissented from the judgment of the court which was in favour of the present respondent who was also the respondent below and the plaintiff in the action.\nIt was proved at the trial that one Carl Bauer had an account with the defendants at their agency in Toronto, and that on the 25th of January, 1897, he drew a cheque in the following form: No. 136. TORONTO, ONT., January, 25th, 1897.\nTO THE BANK OF HAMILTON.\nPay to Cash...........................or bearer $\nFive................................................... \/100 Dollars.\n(Signed)CARL BAUER.\nThis cheque Bauer on the same day presented to the ledger-keeper of the respondents who wrote the folio number of the account in the ledger on the cheque and stamped it with the words \u201cBank of Hamilton, Toronto, entered January 25th, 1897,\u201d and handed it back to Bauer who did not present the cheque to be cashed but took it away with him.\nOn the following day, January 26th, 1897, Bauer entered the figures \u201c500\u201d in the space after the $ mark and wrote the word \u201chundred\u201d in the blank space after the word \u201cfive\u201d in the body of the cheque and deposited it to his credit in an account with the appellants at their agency in Toronto, and immediately drew out nearly the whole sum. Bauer never had any greater sum to his credit with the respondents than the sum of $10.22. On the morning of the 27th January the appellants sent the cheque for $500 in the usual course through the clearing house to the respondents who paid it and stamped it with the words \u201cBank of Hamilton, Toronto, paid January 27th, 1897.\u201d\nOn the following day (January 28th), the respondents discovered the fraud and demanded repayment from the appellants who declined to restore the money. In the mean time Bauer had drawn a cheque for the full amount of the balance to the credit of his account with the appellants. At the time of the payment of the cheque by the respondents Bauer had to the credit of his account with them but twenty-two cents, and this appeared from the respondents\u2019 ledger.\nThe cheque as altered by Bauer and paid by the respondents was as follows: No. 136. TORONTO, ONT., January 25th, 1897.\nTO THE BANK OF HAMILTON.\nPay to Cash...................................or bearer $500.00.\nFive hundred and........................... xx\/100 Dollars.\n(Signed)CARL BAUER.\nSome evidence was given as to the usages of the clearing house and the practice of the respondents and other banks in making payments through it. I do not refer to this evidence, for in the view I take it is immaterial.\nIt is clear that the payment by the respondents was made under a mistake of fact, in reliance on what appeared on the face of the cheque which after the forgery presented the appearance of a marked cheque for $500.\nThe rule of law that money paid by mistake can prim\u00e2 facie be recovered from the person who receives it must therefore apply unless the case can upon the facts stated come within some exception to that rule.\nIt was contended in the court below on behalf of the appellants that the judgment of Mr. Justice MacMahon was wrong and that the rule mentioned was improperly applied, and that for two reasons. First, it was said that the case of Young v. Grote[11] applied, and that the respondents were debarred from recovering by reason of their negligence in certifying a cheque which from its form was susceptible of alteration on account of the blank spaces left in it. In other words they set up the defence of estoppel by negligence. The majority of the Court of Appeal repelled this defence, and the Chief Justice in his judgment did not deal with this question. Secondly, it was insisted that the cheque having been paid on the 27th of January, and the amount paid not having been reclaimed until the morning of the 28th, there was such negligence in making the demand for repayment that the respondents were for that reason precluded from recovering.\nThe majority of the court overruled this defence also which was upheld, however, by the Chief Justice in his dissenting judgment in which he relied upon the authority of Cocks v. Masterman[12] and other cases following that authority.\nYoung v. Grote[13] was a case between a banker and his customer. The facts were that the latter having occasion to leave home had left some cheques signed by himself in blank for the purpose of his business with his wife which she was to hand over to the plaintiff\u2019s clerk for such amounts and on such occasions as she should in her discretion think fit. The clerk applied to her for a cheque which she gave him to be filled up for an amount and to be used for a purpose to be approved of by her. The clerk showed her the cheque filled up for the proper amount, but she omitted to notice that space was left which enabled the clerk, as he did, to commit a fraud similar to that perpetrated by Bauer in the present instance. The Court of Common Pleas held that the loss must fall upon the customer and not on the banker who had cashed the forged cheque.\nIt is not easy to ascertain from the report the exact ratio decidendi of the several judgments but in his judgment in the case of Schofield v. Lord Londesborough[14], Lord Watson seems to consider it attributable to one or the other or both of two principles, namely: first that one who signs a negotiable instrument in blank impliedly as regards third persons authorises it to be filled up for any amount for which the stamp is sufficient. The second ground was he thought that as between banker and customer it is by virtue of some rule of law or some implied agreement the duty of the latter to take reasonable care that cheques are so drawn as to present no opportunity for frauds on the former. Lord Watson does not say whether these grounds or either of them are sound, but he considers them to be reasons for distinguishing the older case from Schofield v. Lord Londesborough\u2014the case before the House of Lords\u2014in which the acceptor of a bill had enabled the drawer feloniously to convert an acceptance for \u00a3500 into one for \u00a33,500 by means of blank spaces left in the bill when he accepted. It was held that this did not meet the defence of forgery set up by the acceptor against a bon\u00e2 fide holder for value of the altered acceptance. This decision proceeded on principles which have been applied in a variety of cases, and which are familiar to all for as the Lord Chancellor says in Schofield v. Lord Londesborough[15]:\nA man for instance does not lose his right to his property if he has unnecessarily exposed his goods or allowed his pocket handkerchief to hang out of his pocket, but could recover against a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser of any article so lost notwithstanding the fact that his conduct had to some extent assisted the thief. It is true that stolen goods sold in market overt could be retained by a bon\u00e2 fide purchaser for value notwithstanding that they had been previously stolen; but the same result would follow equally whether the owner had been careful or careless in the custody of his goods.\nIn other words it would seem that there is no duty obliging a man who is dealing with others to take precautions to prevent loss to them by the criminal acts of third persons, and the omission to do so does not in the absence of some special and exceptional relationship amount to negligence in law. This is the law as I understand the judgment laid down by the House of Lords in Schofield v. Lord Londesborough. Then if this is so and we are I think bound by the authority of that case, can there be any distinction between the case of a certified cheque like the present and an acceptance? I can see none and I entirely agree with Mr. Justice Osler and Mr. Justice Moss in the reasons given in their judgments. I would also refer to the case of the National Bank of Commerce v. The National Mechanics Banking Association[16] in which the Court of Appeals of the State of New York in an able and well reasoned judgment reaches the same conclusion in the case of a certified cheque raised in amount under circumstances precisely similar to those before us. I may also refer to that case as assigning the true reason for the decision in Mather v. Lord Maidstone[17], namely, that one who pays an acceptance to which his name has been forged is estopped from recovering back the money upon the ground that he is bound to know his own signature.\nAs I have said the learned Chief Justice did not in his judgment deal with the present case in the aspect in which it has just been looked at, but founded his opinion on another point. That point was this\u2014it was said that the respondents having paid the cheque on the 27th were too late to recall the payment when on the morning of the 28th they discovered the fraud and consequent mistake in payment since the appellants might have been prejudiced and their position altered by the delay. For this not only Cocks v. Masterman[18] was relied on but other cases also, the principal of which was a decision of Mathew J. in London & River Plate Bank v. Bank of Liverpool[19]. In all these cases however it will be found that they were mistaken payments by parties behind whom were others secondarily liable, recourse against whom might have been lost by delay and the holder thus prejudiced. In some of them also the principle of Mather v. Lord Maidstone[20] was applicable. I deny that there is any abstract rule of law which requires that the money paid shall be demanded on the day of the erroneous payment without regard to any question of prejudice to the holder. Each case must depend on the facts. If however there is any such rule of law it must be confined to the case of acceptances.\nIn the present case it is impossible that the delay could in the least degree have caused detriment to the appellants. This point also arose in the case before cited in the New York Court of Appeals[21], and was there held to be no defence, and I am convinced it has been properly decided against the appellants in the present case.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J. (dissenting.)\u2014The appeal must, in my opinion, be decided upon a wholly different principle from that upon which either Young v. Grote[22], or Schofield v. The Earl of Londesborough[23], was decided. Neither of these cases has really any application in the present case. The only negligence which it is all necessary to refer to, is the negligence of the respondents causing injury to themselves alone in paying a cheque drawn upon them by a customer of which the appellant was the bon\u00e2 fide holder for value and which, under the circumstances, as asserted by the respondents in their action and as proved by them, they were under no obligation to pay but which they did pay in due course upon presentment, notwithstanding that they possessed, and they alone possessed, the fullest possible means, of which they did not avail themselves, of knowing that by reason of the fraud of their customer, the drawer of the cheque, they were under no obligation to pay it, and the only question is whether or not they can recover from the appellants the amount so paid to them.\nIt now appears by the evidence in the action that on the twenty-fifth of January, 1897, one Bauer, (whom we must regard as having then been a customer of the respondents, (his bankers), drew a cheque upon them for the sum of five dollars payable to \u201ccash, or bearer.\u201d On the same day he procured the respondents to mark it \u201cgood\u201d with their stamp impressed thereon containing the words \u201cBank of Hamilton, Toronto, entered, January 25th, 1897.\u201d He then altered the sum \u201cfive\u201d to \u201cfive hundred\u201d in such a manner as not to create any, the slightest, suspicion that any alteration of or tampering with the cheque had taken place. It was to all appearances a perfectly valid cheque for five hundred dollars, marked by the respondents as good for that amount.\nSo altered he transferred the cheque on the twenty-sixth of January, for value to the appellants, who caused it to be presented for payment to the respondents through the Toronto Clearing House and, on the twenty-seventh of January, the respondents paid the cheque and stamped it on that day with their stamp as \u201cpaid.\u201d\nDoubtless they assumed that, having stamped the cheque upon the 25th of January, as \u201centered,\u201d they had funds to meet it, and that, therefore, they paid it upon presentment.\nIn this it appears the respondents were mistaken, but the mistake was one in respect to which they had in their possession the fullest possible means to avoid making. It was a mistake having its origin solely in their own default or negligence, for, if they had referred to their own books, before paying the cheque, they would have seen, as they did see on the twenty-eighth of January, that the drawer of the cheque had no such sum to his credit in their hands.\nIt was thus that then, for the first time, the respondents discovered that the alteration from \u201cfive\u201d to \u201cfive hundred\u201d dollars had been made.\nHaving thus made discovery of the fact of forgery, the respondents demanded re-payment of the amount paid on the twenty-seventh of January, in excess of the \u201cfive\u201d dollars for which amount they had marked the cheque before it was altered, the excess being claimed to be recoverable as money paid by mistake of fact. The mistake of fact, under the influence of which the cheque was paid, was, I think, as already observed, no other than a mistake in concluding from seeing the respondents\u2019 stamp of the 25th January on the cheque, that there were funds of the drawer\u2019s to pay it. That mistake led to the discovery, (on the twenty-eighth of January, when first they referred to the books), of the fact of alteration of the sum of five dollars for which the cheque had been marked to \u201cfive hundred.\u201d But the mistake under the influence of which the cheque had already been paid, at a time when no forgery was suspected or could have been discovered, save by a reference to the respondents\u2019 books, remained unaltered and if that mistake did consist, as I think it did, in ignorance of the fact that the respondents had no funds of the drawer\u2019s in their hands sufficient to pay the cheque, or in a mistaken belief that they had, then Chambers v. Miller[24] is an unquestioned authority that money paid by reason of such a mistake of fact cannot be recovered back.\nThen it is to be borne in mind that the forged alteration was made by the drawer of the cheque him- self and it affected only the liability the respondents had incurred by affixing their stamp to it on the twenty-fifth of January. In all other respects the cheque was perfectly good and was as binding upon the drawer, in the interests of and for the benefit of the respondents, for the full amount of the five hundred dollars after they paid the cheque and received it from the appellants as it had been in the hands of the appellants in the interest of and for the benefit of the appellants until payment, so that it cannot be said that the respondents paid the money, which is now sought to be recovered back from the appellants without having received any value or consideration for such payment, as could have been said if the forgery committed had been of the drawer\u2019s signature. The language of Erle C.J. in the above case of Chambers v. Miller[25] is precisely applicable in the present case, as imputing the respondents\u2019 loss occasioned by having paid the cheque to their own fault and negligence disqualifying them from recovering back the amount paid, rather than to what the law regards as a mistake of fact entitling the respondents to recover back the money paid.\nHe there says at page 182:\nWith regard to cheques, the well known coure of business is this: When a cheque is presented at the counter of a bank, the banker has authority on the part of his customer to pay the amount therein specified on his account. The money in the banker\u2019s hands is his own money. On the presentment of the cheque it is for the banker to consider whether the state of the account between him and his customer will justify him in passing the property in the money to the holder of the cheque.\nThe presentment of the cheque to the bank of the respondents through the clearing house gave to the respondents full opportunity of determining by reference to their books whether or not they should pay the cheque. Of this opportunity they did not avail themselves. If they had availed themselves of the opportunity so given they would have discovered, as they did discover on the day after they had paid the cheque immediately upon referring to the books, that the cheque which had been marked on the 25th of January was for $5, and not for $500.\nSurely it is to their own fault and negligence and not to any mistake of fact that, under the circumstances, the respondents\u2019 payment of the cheque must be imputed; it was so held by Lord Mansfield in Price v. Neal[26].\nIn Cocks v. Masterman[27], a bill purporting to be accepted by A., payable at his banker\u2019s, was paid by the bankers on presentment, they believing the acceptance to be in the handwriting of A., a client of theirs. The next day discovering that the acceptance was a forgery, they notified the holders to whom they had paid the amount of the bill, and brought an action to recover it back. It was contended upon two grounds that the plaintiffs could not recover. First, that the bankers should have satisfied themselves of the genuineness of the acceptance before paying, and; secondly (and upon this the court unanimously proceeded expressly guarding itself from being understood as giving any opinion upon the first point), that the holder of the bill is entitled to know on the day when it becomes due, whether it is a honoured or a dishonoured bill, and that, if he receive the money, and is suffered to retain it during the whole of that day, the parties who paid it cannot recover it back.\nNow, as to the first point taken in that case, in respect of which the court guarded itself from being understood to express an opinion, there cannot, I think, be entertained a doubt that where, as in the present case, a cheque having a bank\u2019s stamp thereon certifying to its genuineness, which must be taken to be the purpose of affixing the stamp so as to give it transferable value, and the amount of the cheque has been altered, after being so stamped and before being used by the drawer, in such a perfectly deceptive manner that the alteration was incapable of detection by any means whatever save by reference to the bank\u2019s own books, by the use of which means the alteration immediately becomes plainly patent to the bank, and the bank without the use of such means, being satisfied apparently upon seeing its own stamp, pays the amount to a bon\u00e2 fide holder for value, such a payment must be regarded as in the bank\u2019s own wrong and must be attributed to its own default and neglect and cannot be recovered back upon a suggestion that the payment was made under the influence of what the law regards as a mistake of fact. And the language of the court as above extracted from Chambers v. Miller[28], is, I think, in support of this view.\nThe second ground in Cocks v. Masterman[29], upon which the court unanimously proceeded, is however precisely in point in the present case.\nIn Mather v. Lord Maidstone[30], the principle upon which Cocks v. Masterman29 was decided, was in 1856 affirmed in the following language by Jervis C.J.\nAs a general rule the holder of a bill of exchange has a right to know whether or not it has been duly honoured by the acceptor at maturity, and when the bill is presented, if the acceptor pays it, the money cannot be recovered back if the acceptor has the means of satisfying himself of his liability to pay it, though it should turn out that the acceptance was a forgery.\nAnd by Cresswell J.:\nA man accepts a bill of exchange purporting to be drawn by one Thompson, and pays it, and if it afterwards turned out to be a forgery, he \u2018cannot afterwards be permitted to say that he paid the money under a mistake, and in The London and River Platte Bank v. The Bank of Liverpool[31], Cocks v. Masterman, as approved and affirmed in Mather v. Lord Maidstone, is again recognised as having established\na clear unimpeachable rule which ought not to be tampered with.\nThe Court of Appeal of Toronto seems to have been of opinion that the respondents had a superior equity to the appellants which entitled them to recover back the money from the appellants.\nIn what does that superior equity consist?\nNo blame, default or negligence of any description in the transaction is attributable or attributed to the appellants. The alteration was so well made as to give no ground of suspicion, and the appellants could not by any means have discovered the forgery. They were holders for full value of the cheque as altered. On the other hand, the respondents had, and they alone had ample means of discovering the forgery by simple reference to their own books. Surely the default, omission or neglect to avail themselves of so ready a method in their possession to have detected the forgery of their own acceptance and so to protect themselves cannot be said to give to them an equity superior to the right of the innocent holder for value to retain the money paid to them by the respondents in satisfaction of a cheque which, upon such payment, the appellants transferred to the respondents, who became as entitled to recover the amount from the drawer, equally as the appellants themselves would have been if the respondents had not paid the cheque.\nThere is no case in the books to support the respondents\u2019 claim to recover back the money paid by them to the appellants, but, on the contrary, the judgment in their favour in the present action is in direct contra- diction of a principle well established by the cases above referred to, all tampering with which is to be deprecated.\nI am of opinion, therefore, that the appeal should be allowed with costs, and the action dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J. concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Girouard.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I do not see that we can decide this case otherwise than the learned judges of the two courts below have done, although I fear that the conclusion arrived at will be injurious to our commercial intercourse, not only at home, but also abroad, and more particularly in the neighbouring States of the American Union, where a different principle generally prevails.\nI quite agree with them that there was no negligence on the part of the Bank of Hamilton in not discovering and giving notice of the raising of the cheque until the morning after it went through the Clearing House. In fact, according to the custom among bankers, the verification with the books of the bank is not made, and cannot be made, before that time. At all events, the Imperial Bank was not prejudiced by the delay.\nBut can we say as much about its conduct in accepting or marking the cheque in the incomplete form in which it was presented?\nFrom the beginning of the argument I felt that Young v. Grole[32], which had been the standard authority for more than half a century, had been well decided and expressed the law of England; even as late as 1891, we find it quoted as a binding authority by the House of Lords in The Bank of England v. Vagliano[33].\nI can see however that a distinction should be made between that case and the present one, the former arising out of the relation of mandant and mandatory, which does not exist in that of the acceptor or certifyer and holder of a cheque. But is not negligence to affect the latter case as the former one? Is not the acceptor or certifyer under some obligation or duty to the public when dealing with an instrument transferable by mere delivery?\nI never supposed that there is a duty on his part to guard against crime; that evidently concerns the lawmaker; but I certainly thought that he should not facilitate its commission by others and that, at least, he should be prudent, and that having occasioned damage by not filling the blanks which were the immediate cause of the fraud upon the holder in due course, he, and not the latter, ought to suffer. Negligence by the bank on which a cheque is drawn, is especially recognised by secs. 78, 79 and 81 of the Bills of Exchange Act, as an important element of responsibility to the holder in the negotiation of crossed cheques. Why not apply the same principle to the action of the bank negligently certifying a cheque, especially if we consider that there is no obligation on its part to accept or certify, but merely to pay. The principle of negligence seems to rule over all the operations of business men, whether under the common law the law merchant, or any other law. A decision holding the bank so acting responsible to the holder would be more in accord with the notions of right and wrong I have learned from the writings of that great jurist, Pothier, which led to the ruling in Young v. Grote, and also in a case still more in point decided unanimously by the Court of Appeal of the Province of Quebec; I refer to Dorwin v. Thomson[34]. In my humble opinion, that ruling is the mere application of the elementary principle that every person is responsible for the damage caused by his fault to another, whether by positive act, imprudence, neglect or want of skill. I have always been under the impression that this principle was held good in every country, in England as well as everywhere else, in commercial as well as in civil matters. But after much conflict of opinion, the House of Lords in Schofield v. The Earl of Londesborough[35], has held that it did not apply to a case where a drawer of a bill of exchange availed himself of spaces, which he had purposely left, to raise the amount of an acceptance from five hundred pounds to three thousand five hundred pounds, and that the acceptor, who had not filled the spaces, was not liable to a holder in due course. Rightly or wrongly, the highest tribunal of the Empire has overruled Young v. Grote, in so far as the general principle of negligence can be applied, because, observe their Lordships, it was founded upon the civil law and the authority of Pothier, which, they add, form no part of the mercantile law of England.\nAlready this decision has undergone an unusual amount of adverse criticism which will be found summarised in Am. & Eng. Encycl. of Law (2 ed.) vo. \u201cBills and Notes,\u201d page 332; La revue Legale, 1890, p. 436, and in a valuable book on the principles of Estoppel, just published by Mr. Ewart, K.C. of the Winnipeg Bar.\nWe are bound by the decision of the House of Lords, till set aside by an Act of the Canadian Parliament. I cannot distinguish this case from Schofield v. Londesborough, because in the latter case the instrument was a bill of exchange and not a cheque. The Bills of Exchange Act, 1890, sec. 72, declares that a cheque is a bill of exchange drawn on a bank, payable on demand.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Laidlaw, Kappele & Bicknell.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McCarthy, Osler, Hoskin & Creelman.\n[1] 27 Ont.

The mortgage not being registered gave H. no priority over subsequent incumbrancers. Two months later G. gave H. a second mogtgage on said property to secure a note for $794. Shortly after this a contractor applied to G. for a large quantity of lumber for building purposes. G. being unable to purchase the logs asked the Merchants Bank for an advance. The bank, knowing G. to be financially embarassed, refused the advances to him but agreed to make them if some reliable person would purchase the logs, which was done by G.'s bookkeeper, and in consideration of an advance of $3,500 G. assigned the contractor's order to the book\u2014 keeper and agreed to cut the logs at a price fixed and deliver them to the bookkeeper at the mill site. The latter then assigned to the bank all monies to accrue in respect to the contract, which assignment was agreed to by the contractor, and a day or two after also assigned to the bank three booms of logs by numbers in addition to one assigned previously. This purported to be done under sec. 74 of The Bank Act. Two or three days later G. made an assignment for benefit of his creditors, previous to which, however, the logs had arrived at the mill and were mixed with other logs of G. The greater part had been converted into lumber when H. seized them under his chattel mortgage.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia (7 B. C. Rep. 465), that no property in the logs assigned to the bank had passed to G., and H. having no higher right than his mortgagor, could not claim them under his mortgage.\nShortly before G.s assignment for benefit of his creditors his bookkeeper transferred to the bank a chattel mortgage given him by G. to secure payment of $800. The judgment appealed from ordered the assignee in bankruptcy to pay the bank the balance due on said mortgage.\nHeld, reversing said judgment, that the assignee had been guilty of no acts of conversion and was not liable to repay this money. The mortgage was not given to secure advances and did not give the bank a first lien on the property. The bank was in the same position as if it had received the mortgage directly from G. when he was notoriously insolvent.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1] reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendant.\nThe following statement of facts is taken from the judgment of Drake J. on appeal:\n\"The facts of this case are somewhat involved. Grray \" was a sawmill owner at Nelson, B.C., and being \" involved in financial difficulties, on the 25th of April, \" 1898, he made a bill of sale by way of mortgage to \" Houston of his sawmill and machinery and all lumber \" therein, and all lumber dressed or undressed which \" might at any time be brought on the mill premises. \" This bill of sale was apparently not duly registered, \" as the affidavit made in support of it was not sworn \" until the 26th of September, 1898, and is therefore \" not binding on subsequent incumbrancers. The \" defendant undertook at the trial to furnish certified \" copies of his bills of sale, but hitherto has not done \" so. We must therefore take the bills of sale as they \" appear in the appeal book to be correct.\n\" On the 28th of June, 1898, Gray gave to Houston \" a further bill of sale by way of mortgage to secure a \" note of $794.22 payable on demand with ten per cent \" interest. This bill of sale was apparently regular. \" On the 11th of August, 1898, Lawford assigned to the \" plaintiffs a chattel mortgage given to him by Gray \" on the mill and machinery to secure $800. Gray \" also made an assignment to Ward for the benefit of \" his creditors of all his property, and Ward, according \" to his evidence taken 27th January, 1899, contested \" the plaintiff's right to the machinery as being subject \" to the security in favour of Gray's creditors. Some \" time about the 1st of August, W. H. Armstrong, a \" contractor, applie to Gray to be supplied with a \" large quantity of lumber for bridge building. Gray \" had no means of buying the necessary logs, and \" applied to the plaintiffs for an advance. The plain \" tiffs, aware of Gray's position, refused, but the \" manager, Mr. Kydd, said if some person whom \" they could trust would undertake the contract they \" would advance the necessary funds to him to buy \" the logs, and Mr. L. C. Lawford, Gray's bookkeeper, \" with the approval of the plaintiffs, agreed to buy \" the logs, and the plaintiffs agreed to advance him \" the necessary funds for the purpose in order to \" carry out the arrangement. On the 4th of August \" Gray assigned the order of Armstrong to Lawford, \" and agreed to cut the lumber at $1.50 per M. and \" deliver the same to Lawford at the mill site. This \" agreement purports to be made in consideration of \" an advance of $3,500 to Gray.\n\" On 6th August Lawford assigned to the plaintiffs \" all moneys to accrue due to them from Armstrong \" in respect of the contract which Armstrong accepted. \" On the 8th of August L. C. Lawford assigned to the \" bank booms 48, 49 and 50, aggregating 545,000 feet, \" which were then in process of cutting, having \" previously assigned boom 47. This assignment pur\" ported to be made under section 74 of the Bank \"Act, 1890. On the 30th of August boom 49 was \" assigned to the bank. On the 6th of September \" boom 50 was also assigned, and on the 20th of \" September a further deed confirming the former \" assignments, and including boom 47, was made \" by Lawford to the bank. These various documents \" seem to have been executed by way of precaution \" to make the bank secure in case any mistake had \" occurred in the original transfers under the Bank \" Act. All moneys necessary to pay the expenses \"connected with the booms were advanced by th \" plaintiffs to Lawford, and disbursed by him, and \" Gray gave Lawford promissory notes for the sums \" he had thus advanced, and these notes were indorsed \" to the bank.\n\" These booms arrived at the mill, and when there \" Gray appears to have mixed the logs with other logs \" in his boom, and the greater part were converted \" into lumber, and immediately Houston, as alleged \" mortgagee, claimed them under his chattel mort \" gage.\"\nTaylor K.C. for the appellant Houston.\nGarrow K.C. for the appellant Ward.\nSir Charles Hibbard Tupper K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by :\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This case, for the facts of which I refer to the judgments in the courts below, involves two separate appeals, one by Houston who claims a lien on the logs in question having priority over that of the respondent, and the other by Ward, the assignee, for the benefit of creditors of Gray who insists that he is not liable to the bank for the money which the judgment has directed him to pay.\nAs regards Houston's appeal there can, in my mind, be no doubt but that the proof established conclusively that the money advanced by Mr. Kydd, the agent of the bank, was so advanced to Lawford as the agent of Gray to enable the latter to purchase the logs required to carry out the Armstrong contract, and that the logs seized by Houston on the 16th of September included the logs purchased for that purpose. The legal consequence is that under the 74th and other sections of the Banking Act the bank had a first lien upon the logs so purchased with their money which they in good faith lent for the purpose to which it was thus applied and that Houston is bound to account for the logs he so possessed himself of.\nAs to Ward, it does not appear to us that he was guilty of any conversion or other wrongful act as regards the logs. The appeal by him should therefore be allowed and the action dismissed against him except in so far as it is considered to be in the nature of a mortgage action for the purpose of enforcing a security.\nThe first clause of the judgment which directs Ward to pay to the respondents $530 being the amount secured by a chattel mortgage of the 15th of August, 1898, Gray to Lawford, assigned to the bank on the 16th of September, i manifestly wrong. The bank is not entitled to any security on those chattels giving them priority under the Bankers Act. It was not given to secure money advanced to buy the goods. It is conceded that Houston has priority over these tools and plant, Lawford having paid merely the vendors lien of A. C. Shaw & Co. did so presumably with the money of Gray and was entitled to no security from Gray, and the bank as assignee of Lawford can stand in no better position as against the creditors of Gray represented by Ward his assignee.\nIt is therefore just as if Gray, when he was notoriously insolvent to the knowledge of the bank and on the same day on which he executed an assignment for the benefit of his creditors, had made a direct mortgage to the bank ; manifestly such a mortgage cannot be enforced.\nHouston's appeal is dismissed with costs. Ward is entitled to the costs of his appeal here and also to all costs in the court below except (as regards the costs below) in so far as he is to be regarded as the representative of the mortgagor in an action to realize a mortgage security, and as to these latter costs, they are to be reserved until the final decree.\nAppeal of Houston dismissed with costs. Appeal of Ward allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant Houston: Hanington & Taylor.\nSolicitors for the appellant Ward: Elliott & Leanie.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Macdonald & Johnson.\n[1] 7 B.

Smith (Plaintiff)\nRespondent\n1901: May 17.\nPresent:\u2014Sir Henry Strong C.J. and Taschereau, Gwynne. Sedgewick and Girouard JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nNegligence\u2014Railway company \u2014Injury to passengers in sleeping berth.\nS. an elderly lady, was travelling on a train of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company from Montreal to Toronto. While in a sleeping berth at night, believing that she was riding with her back to the engine she tried to turn around in the berth, and the car going around a curve at the time she was thrown out on to the floor and injured her back. On the trial of an action against the company for damages it was not shown that the speed of the train was excessive or that there was any defect in the roadbed at the place where the accident occurred to which it could be attributed.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, that the accident could not be attributed to any negligence of the servants of the company which would make it liable in damages to S. therefor.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia reversing the verdict at the trial in favour of the defendant company.\nThe material facts are sufficiently stated in the above head-note. The trial judge withdrew the case from the jury and ordered judgment to be entered for the defendant. The court en banc set aside this judgment and granted the plaintiff a new trial.\nNesbitt K.C. and Harris K.C. for the appellant.\nDrysdale K. C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by: THE CHIEF JUSTICE (oral).\u2014It is clear beyond a doubt, though I say it with all respect, that there was no proof of negligence which would have warranted the Chief Justice, who presided, in submitting the case to the jury. It would have been exceedingly wrong if he had done so, and his power of dealing with a case in the way he did when there is no such proof depends on rules which are now quite elementary.\nI find in the old reports that in cases of coach accidents in England it was customary to leave the case to the jury as a whole, but that stage of the law has long since passed away. The principle laid down by the House of Lords, in some quite recent cases, as that upon which the courts ought to act, is that it is the duty of the judge to inquire for himself as to whether or not there is any evidence of negligence for the jury. If there is none, he should dismiss the action; if there is any evidence he is to call upon the defendant to disprove it, and if he fails to do so the plaintiff must have judgment.\nIn the present case the question of negligence must depend either upon negligent construction of the permanent way or negligent running of the train. There has been no proof made of either. In order to prove that the railway was badly constructed the plaintiff would have required a great mass of expert evidence, in order to admit which it would have been necessary to lay the foundation by an inquiry, of vast scope and involving very heavy expense, as to the construction of the whole of the line from Montreal to Toronto, including the necessity of curves and so forth. At the time of the accident it appears to have been probable that the train might have been going round a curve. It is in the very nature of things that all railways must have some curves, and we must presume that the curve in this case was necessary and proper for the construction of the road and also that it had been properly constructed.\nThen again, as my brother Taschereau remarked during the argument a high rate of speed is not necessarily evidence of negligence, and, moreover, there is no proof that there was an irregular or excessive rate of speed. Beyond this allegation or inference there has been no attempt made to show that there was any negligence. This elderly maiden lady, journeying upon a most laudable mission, appears to have had no previous experience of travelling by railway and using berths in sleeping cars, and she met with the accident. Her berth appears to have been constructed in the usual manner, with all customary appliances for the comfort and safety of passengers, and an electric button to ring a bell for the porter in case of any assistance being required, of which, however, she did not avail herself. She appears to have been in an extraordinary posture at the time the accident occurred, trying to change her position in the berth, when the train probably went round a curve at a rate of speed not shown to have been improper. The accident must be attributed to her own act and inexperience.\nTo some extent it would appear that the accident was on account of a change made in the location of the plaintiff's berth from a lower to an upper one, through the train of the Intercolonial Railway failing to make the proper connection at Montreal, but this is not to be attributed to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.\nWe must allow the appeal and dismiss the action with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Harris, Henry & Cahan.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Drysdale & McInnis.\n"}

T. Taschereau J.) which dismissed the action with costs, ordered the defendants immediately to cease the publication and sale of the work complained of to render an account of the total edition printed and published and of sales made, and directed that the record should be returned to the court of first instance for taking accounts and adjudication as to damages and the other conclusions of plaintiffs' demande, the defendants being also ordered to pay the costs of the appeal.\nFitzpatrick K.C.

It appears as if the book published by the appellants had not been made with the pen, but with scissors and paste pot. I have read the notes of Mr. Justice Taschereau and Mr. Justice White in this case. I think the former goes too far in his judgment in the Superior Court in finding excuses for the defendants. Mr. Martin, who prepared the manuscript of the work complained of ought to have been called. No doubt the manuscript was destroyed or lost in the process of printing and the printers cannot be expected to have any recollection as to how it was made, whether written by hand or simply with printed sheets pasted in. Mr. Martin was possibly the only person who could have given the information on this point which the defendants ought to have been prepared to give. It was clearly upon the defendants to shew what he did and how it was done in order to rebut the prima facie case against them made out by the plaintiffs' evidence of piracy.

The assured applied for other insurance but before being notified of the acceptance of his application the premises were destroyed by fire.\nHeld, that there was no breach of said condition. Commercial Union Assurance Co. v. Temple, (29 Can. S. C. R. 206) followed.\nIn one count of his declaration plaintiff admitted a breach of said condition but alleged that it was waived. On the trial counsel agreed that the facts proved in the case against the Commercial Union should be taken as proved in the present case. These facts showed, as held by the decision in the previous case, that there was no breach.\nHeld, that the agreement at the trial prevented the appellant company from claiming that respondent was estopped from denying that there had been a violation of the condition.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick sustaining the verdict at the trial in favour of the plaintiff. The questions to be decided on the appeal are sufficiently stated in the above head note.\nLeighton McCarthy for the appellant. The condition as to other insurance is not the same as that in the Commercial Union case. In this policy other insurance even if invalid will avoid the policy.\nPlaintiff having admitted in his declaration and at the trial that he had effected other insurance without consent is estopped from denying a breach of the condition. Ewart on Estoppel p. 187.\nThere was a mortgage on the property when the policy issued and plaintiff thereby ceased to be owner and his interest not being disclosed the policy, was void. See Citizens Insurance Co. of Canada v. Salterio[1]; Torrop v. Imperial Fire Insurance Co.[2]; WestChester Fire Insurance Co v. Weaver[3].\n(Respondent's counsel were only required to argue the last point.)\nPugsley K.C., Atty. Gen. of New Brunswick, for the respondent. A mortgagor is always regarded as the owner of the mortgaged property. In North British and Mercantile Ins. Co. v. McLellan[4] the Chief Justice said \"a mortgagor is deemed the owner of the property mortgaged both in a popular and a technical sense.\"\nThe insurers who must state the nature of the interest insured are named in the policy and the mortgagor is not one.\nEvery decision of the courts in the United States and Canada dealing with this condition has held the mortgagor to be the owner. See Dolliver v. St. Joseph Fire & Marine Ins. Co.[5]; Friezen v. Allemania Fire Insurance Co.[6]; Insurance Co. v. Haven[7]. Masters K.C. follows for respondent. The wording of the condition shows that the term owner was intended to include a mortgagor, and in some policies the mortgagor is referred to as owner. Hopkins v. Provincial Insurance Co.[8].\nIn Sinclair v. Canadian Mutual Fire Insurance Co.[9] a mortgagor was held to be \"absolute owner\" of the mortgaged property.\nA mortgagee has a conditional interest, but not a mortgagor.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE \u2014We are all of opinion that the respondent was the sole and unconditional owner of the property within the meaning of the conditions of the policy, and that the interest of the assured was not untruly stated by him. The North British and Mercantile Ins. Co. v. McLellan[10], and Dolliver v St. Joseph Fire & Marine Insurance Co.[11], are authorities in point.\nThe other objections relied on in the appellants' factum, viz., that the assurance in the Quebec Assurance Co invalidated the policy, was, we think, rightly considered by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick to have been decided adversely to the contention of the appellant in the former case of Temple v. The Commercial Union Assurance Co.[12] by which we are bound.\nThe question of estoppel not referred to in the factum, but raised for the first time at the argument here, is not open to the appellant under the agreement come to at the trial that the facts proved in Temple v. The Commercial Union Assurance Co. (5) should be taken as proved in this case, and that upon this evidence with any additional facts which either party might prove, the case should be decided. This agreement entirely precludes the highly technical objection of an estoppel on the pleadings.\nConcurring as we do in the reasons given in the judgment of the court appealed from, it is unnecessary to write more fully.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

Williams & Co.,\" and brought the action against the respondent for the price of an engine, ordered by respondents in writing, and other machinery supplied in connection with repairs to the foundry, amounting in all, according to the amended statement of claim to $495.91 The order was given through the plaintiffs' agent W. The principal defence to the action was that the company supposed and was led to believe that they were dealing with a company carrying on business in Toronto as \"The A. R. Williams Machinery Company (Limited),\" with which it had previous dealings, and which, at the time, had in its possession machinery belonging to the defendant of the value of $780 which it was agreed with W. should be accepted in payment for the machinery ordered. The trial judge found that the business carried on in Montreal was distinct from that carried on in Toronto, but that at the time the order was given defendant believed it was contracting with the Toronto company, and that there were surrounding circumstances to lead to the belief that the business carried on in Montreal and Toronto were one and the same. He held that the plaintiffs were bound by the bargain, made with W., and, on the ground that it was not inconsistent with the written agreement to prove that payment was to be made otherwise than in cash, he received evidence of the agreement relied on by the defendant.\nAfter hearing counsel for the parties the court reserved judgment, and on a subsequent day dismissed the appeal for the reasons given in the court below by the Chief Justice of Nova Scotia and by Townshend J. in the trial court. Gwynne J. dissented from the judgment rendered by the majority of the court and was of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs and the plaintiffs' action maintained.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nRussell K.

He first applied to the Chief Justice of his province for a writ of habeas corpus which was refused. Then he applied to Graham J. who referred the matter to the Supreme Court. After argument and due consideration his application was again refused, two judges dissenting. No appeal was taken from such judgment and he now renews his application to me, a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada, under section 32 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act.\nThat section may give me all the power which the common and statute law gives to judges of superior courts in matters of habeas corpus, but it does not constitute me a court of appeal with jurisdiction to void or reverse judgments of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. If I have in the premises equal and co-ordinate power with a judge of that court, my power most certainly does not extend further. The suggestion is almost impertinent, but were either of the two judges of the provincial court who until now, have had no part in the matter, to grant the writ and, in spite of the judgment of the Supreme Court, and in vindication and assertion as well of his autonomy as of his possibly superior and conceivably infallible knowledge of law, to release the prisoner, his action, violating elementary principles as to legal authority and precedent, would be open to not undeserved censure. In the case supposed he would unhesitatingly and without question accept as law the judgment of his court.

J. and Taschereau, Gwynne, Sedgewick and Girouard JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nWill\u2014Capacity of testator\u2014 Undue influence.\nA codicil to a will executed shortly before the testator's death, increasing the provision made by a former codicil for a niece of his wife who had lived with him for nearly thirty years, a considerable portion of which she was his housekeeper, was attacked as having been executed on account of undue influence by the niece.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Taschereau and Sedgewick JJ. dissenting, that as the testator was shown to be capable of executing a will at the time he made the codicil, considering the relations between him and his niece even if it had been proved that she urged him to make better provision for her than he had previously done such would not have amounted to undue influence.\nHeld, also, following Piera v. Perera ([1901] A. C. 354) that even if there was ground for saying that the testator was not at the time of execution capable of making a will if he were when he gave the instructions the codicil would still have been valid.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the ruling of the Probate Court Judge who refused to admit to probate a second codicil to the will of Edward P. Archbold.\nThe testator, E. P. Archbold, died on June 29th, 1898, aged 83 years. By his will he left $600 a year to the appellant which was increased to $800 by a codicil not attacked in these proceedings. A second codicil, increasing the annuity to $1,000 and bearing date June 16th, 1898, was refused probate, the probate Judge holding that the appellant had not satisfied the conscience of the court that the testator was capable of making a will at that date and that it expressed his last will.\nThe executors impeached the last codicil on the grounds that the testator was too infirm and feeble in mind to administer his. affairs; that the codicil was made at the instigation and under the influence of the appellant; and that it was prepared and executed during the absence of the residuary legatee, testator's only son, and secretly, which were suspicious circumstances not explained away by the latter. The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, the Chief Justice dissenting, affirmed the ruling of the Probate Judge in refusing probate of this codicil.\nNewcombe K. C. for the appellant. Suspicions entertained by the court must be \"pregnant suspicions\" in order to justify rejection; Raworth v. Marriott[1]; Goodacre v. Smith[2]. The testator's instructions were sufficient; it is not necessary to show that the codicil was read over by him before he signed it; Raworth v. Marriott (1); Goodacre v. Smith (2); Parker v. Felgate[3]. As to the law respecting undue influence we refer to Adams v. McBeath[4]; Hall v. Hall[5]; Beamish v. Beamish[6]; Wingrove v. Wingrove[7]; Boyse v. Rossborough[8]; Parfitt v. Lawless[9]. The judge in first instance admitted improper evidence on the part of the executors, and improperly excluded evidence favourable to appellant, Crowninshield v. Crowninshield[10]. We also rely upon Aitkin v. McMeckan[11]; Re Stulz[12].\nDrysdale K.C. for the respondents. The question involved in this appeal is one of fact, passed upon by the trial court and the Court of Appeal, and ought not to be reversed City of Montreal v. Cadieux[13]; Senesac v. Central Vermont Railway Co.[14] The concurrent findings on questions of fact in the courts below should not be interfered with upon appeal.\nThe second codicil was prepared by appellant, who takes a large benefit under its terms, under circumstances which raise the suspicion of the court; it ought not to be pronounced for unless the party propounding it adduces evidence which removes such suspicion and satisfies the court that the will was the voluntary act of the testator, and that he knew and approved the contents of the instrument. Tyrrell v. Painton[15]; Fulton v. Andrew[16]; Barry v. Butlin[17]; Ashwell v. Lomi[18]; Baker v. Batt[19]; Parker v. Duncan[20]; Brown v. Fisher[21]; Parfitt v. Lawless[22].\nThe learned counsel then dealt with the alleged suspicious circumstances attending the preparation and execution of the will and contended that they indicated both improper influence by the appellant and incapacity of the testator.\nThe appellant, by the codicil, practically raises her own annuity from the $800 a year provided in the former codicil to $S,250 a year at no remote date, as by the death of any one of the three annuitants (both the others being advanced in years), the provisions for the annuitant who dies accrue to the survivors and the whole amount provided for the three annuities goes to the last survivor during life. The trial judge discredited the appellant and disbelieved her story; and was fully justified in doing so, not only by her demeanour but in the matter of her testimony; and her statements are improbable, inconsistent, contradicted and uncorroborated. As a large benificiary, who procured the codicil in her favour, she was bound to see that the testator received proper and independent advice, and the testimony in support of the codicil should not be that of herself alone, but independent and impartial.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE J.\u2014In Adams v. McBeath[23] I was unable to concur in the judgment of this court affirming a will executed under the circumstances appearing in that case, for the reason that in my opinion the case came within the principle laid down by the House of Lords in Fulton v. Andrew[24]; by the Privy Council in Baker v. Bait[25]; and Barry v. Butlin[26]; by Sir John Nicholl in Paske v. Ollat[27]; Billinghurst v. Vickers[28]; Ingram v. Wyatt[29]; and by Sir John Hannen in Parker v. Duncan[30]; and Broupn v. Fisher[31]; and because I was of opinion that the person who had caused the will in question in that case to be prepared and executed giving all the property of the deceased to himself, had not removed the burthen imposed upon him by the principle laid down in those cases.\nIn the present case I can see nothing in the evidence which brings it within the principle laid down in the above cases; nothing whatever justifying the impeachment of any conduct of the appellant in connection with the testator's making the codicil in question, as constituting undue influence.\nIt is quite possible, although no evidence of the fact was offered, that as a niece of the testator's deceased wife who had lived with her uncle the testator for many years, and in the latter years of his life as his housekeeper, the appellant may have persuaded the testator that he should make some better provision for her than was contained in his will as then already made, but such persuasion if established could not be characterised as undue influence. There is in my opinion no evidence of the codicil which is impeached having been procured to be executed by any undue influence whatever exercised by her. The evidence abundantly establishes the competency of the testator and that a day or two before he caused the codicil to be prepared he communicated to an intimate friend his intention to alter his will, whereupon that friend advised him to consult a solicitor, which it appears that he did, and the codicil was prepared by a professional gentleman of the highest reputation, upon instructions given both in writing under the testator's hand and also orally; and the codicil so prepared the testator copied in his own handwriting and executed. The recent case of Perera v. Perera[32], in approving Parker v. Felgate[33], is an instructive case which would have supported this will even if there had been any foundation for a suggestion that the testator had not sufficient mental capacity to make a will. The appeal should, in my opinion, be allowed with costs and probate be ordered to be granted of the will and codicils.\nTASCHEREAU and SEDGEWICK JJ. were of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Borden, Ritchie & Chisholm.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Drysdale & McInnis.\n[1] 1 Myl. & K. 643.\n[2] L.

R. 285) discussed and approved.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, affirming the judgment of the Court of Review at Montreal upon the case reserved by the trial judge refusing with costs the motion of the d\u00e9fendant for judgment non obstante veredicto, and granting, with costs, the motion of the plaintiff \u00eas qualit\u00e9 for judgment upon the verdict rendered by the jury at the trial, and ordering, in conformity with the verdict, that judgment should be entered for the plaintiff for $5,000, with costs, as damages for injuries sustained by the plaintiffs minor son, Hector McArthur, through an accident occasioned on account of the negligence of the defendant\nThe material facts are sufficiently stated in the judgments reported.\nUnder the provisions of art. 491 C. P. Q., the trial judge abstained from rendering judgment for the plaintiff in whose favour the verdict of the jury had been given, but reserved the case for the consideration of the Court of Review for the special causes stated in the following certificate viz.:\n\"This case came on to be heard before me and a special jury, on the first of February, 1900. The trial continued with the exception of the intervening Saturday and Sunday until the 5th of February when the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff\"\n\"To question seven the jury answered that the explosion occurred through the fault and neglect of the company by their neglect to provide proper machinery, and by their neglect to take proper precautions to prevent an explosion; and to question nine that the damages suffered amounted to $5000.\"\n\"I therein took until this day, Friday, the 9th of February, to further consider whether I should render judgment upon the verdict or reserve the case for the consideration of the Court of Review.\"\n\"I now determine and adjudge not to render judgment upon the verdict, but to reserve the case for the consideration of the Court of Review when and as thereto moved according to law, and for the following special causes: \"\n\"1. Simpson, the general manager, who designed the automatic shot shell loading machine in question is designer, draughtsman and machinist. Rousseau, the machine foreman of the company is a practical machinist; he approved the designs and. built the machine by himself, or under his immediate supervision.\"\n\"2. After construction the machine was tested for some days before employees were allowed to handle it \u2022 a short time afterwards a ' knock out ' was added and a detail in the loading mechanism strengthened by the replacement of brass by iron material.\"\n\"3. at the date of the accident the machine had been in use for from 12 to 14 months, saving an interruption of a few weeks during which work was suspended.\"\n\"4. The machine automatically loaded from six to seven thousand shells a day; no primer exploded, no accident of any kind occurred and no complaint nor suggestion was made that risk or danger existed in consequence of any defect in the machine.\"\n\"5 When Hector McArthur entered the company's employ in June, 1897, he was assigned to the duty of keeping the machine supplied with wads and powder; saving a few weeks, he continued in the performance of this work until the occurrence of the explosion, a year afterwards; he never reported or suggested to the foreman or other superior officer that his employment was attended with danger in consequence of any defect in the machine.\"\n\"6. The company's officers believed that the machine was working safely and satisfactorily.\"\n\"7. After the explosion, no exploded shell was found.\" \"8. The shot shell room was under the constant supervision of a competent foreman; the evidence is further without contradiction that every possible precaution was taken to insure the safety of the employees in the room.\"\n\"C. P. DAVIDSON,\"\n\u201cJ. S. C.\u201d\nMacmaster K.C. and Fleet for the appellant. The evidence showed no negligence on the part of the company which could be the proximate cause of the explosion from which the injuries resulted. The certificate of the trial judge makes it quite obvious that he did not approve of the findings of the jury. The origin of the accident is totally unexplained, and it has been shown that the machine in question was constructed by competent machinists s that it had worked well for the fourteen months it had been in use loading thousands of cartridges daily without accident or complaint or suggestion of any defect or danger in its operation. The trial judge's certificate vouches for the excellent condition of all the machinery in the factory and the great care taken to ensure the safety of the employees. We rely upon the decisions in Webster v. Friedberg ([1]); The Metropolitan Railway Co. v. Wright ([2]); Phillips v. Martin ([3]); Wakelin v. The London and South Western Railway Co ([4]); The Municipality of Brisbane v. Martin ([5]); The New Brunswick Railway Co. v. Robinson ([6]); The Canadian Coloured Cotton Mills Co. v. Kervin ([7]); Deroches v Gauthier ([8]); Mercier v. Mor in ([9]); Montreal Rolling Mills Co. v. Corcoran ([10]); Tooke v. Bergeron ([11]); Canada Paint Co. v. Trainor ([12]). On the whole it is respectfully submitted that the judgments appealed from were erroneous, and the appellant should be relieved. The plaintiff's action should be dismissed, or in any event a new trial should be granted, and in the latter event, the appellant's motion, asking for particulars as to the allegations of the respondent's declaration in the Superior Court, should be granted.\nHutchins and Harvey for the respondent. We have the findings of the jury in our favour, and both the Court of Review and the Court of Appeal have concurred in those findings as justified by the evidence. This court should not reverse concurrent findings of all the courts below especially when the facts have been found by a jury. There was no attempt to non-suit, and the trial judge considered that there was evidence upon which the jury was required to render a verdict. The main ground on which appellant moved for a new trial was that a witness failed to appear and give evidence at the trial \u2022' it never was contended that the plaintiff's evidence was not full and complete. The jury believed plaintiff's witnesses and found negligence against the company, and that the machine was defective, improper and obsolete. Both courts below thought likewise. The doubts that appear to have arisen in the judge's mind, after the trial was over, can be of no consequence. He was not called upon to find the facts or draw inferences that being the special function of the jury. We refer to The Asbestos and Asbestic Co. v. Durand ([13]); Arts. 1205, 1238, 1242 C. C.; The George Matthews Co. v. Bouchard ([14]), and the authorities there considered; Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Rainville ([15]) * Citizens Light & Power Co. v Lepitre ([16]). Many of the cases cited by the appellant are good authorities for refusal to reverse concurrent findings of courts appealed from. It is clear, in this case, from the evidence, that there was no contributory negligence on the part of the employee who was injured, but on the contrary it is shown that the company accumulated large quantities of explosive materials in dangerous proximity to its employees and failed to take reasonable and proper precautions to prevent accidents. The company was bound to take extra precautions under the circumstances of their trade but failed to do so, and the injuries complained of resulted. The whole jurisprudence is against reversing in such a case.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nGlROUARD J J consider that the principles of law involved in this appeal have been finally settled by this court in a long and unbroken series of decisions more particularly in Montreal Rolling Mills Co. v. Corcoran ([17]); Tooke v. Bergeron ([18]); Cowans v. Marshall ([19]); Burland v. Lee ([20]); Canada Paint Go v. Trainer ([21]) * The Dominion Cartridge Co. v. Cairns ([22]) * The George Matthews Co. v. Bouchard ([23])..\nIn the latter case the court reviewed the decisions which had been rendered in France since Montreal Rolling Mills Co. v. Corcoran (1), had been decided, and we did not fail to notice that in all of them some ten or twelve determined chiefly by the Court of Cassation the rule has been re-affirmed invariably and most emphatically that no employer is responsible for injuries suffered by an employee in the course of his employment, unless the latter proves, by positive testimony, or by presumptions weighty, precise and consistent that there is fault on the part of the former, and that this fault is the immediate, necessary and direct cause of the injury he sustains. We added that this jurisprudence was (1898), accepted as settled in France, and that no hope for a change favourable to the cause of the workingman could be entertained, except by and through legislative authority. They did apply to the legislature and secured the passing of a statute known as \" Ia loi du 9 avril 1898,\" which in cases of injuries from accidents in the course of their employment, grants them partial compensation from the employer, in the form of a pension or insurance, de plein droit, without proving any fault. See Pandectes Francaises 1899 part 3, p. 49 and also the very interesting foot notes by Mr. Fernand Chesney.\nThis special relief has already occasioned many contests before the tribunals of France but has been undoubtedly the cause of a considerable decrease in the number of suits for indemnity under the common law.\nBut whenever the employee injured is demanding full compensation under that law, that is, the Civil Code the arr\u00eats continue to be unanimous in exacting proof of a fault which certainly caused the injury. Cass. 30th March 1897; P. F. '98, 1,111; Cass. 12th June, 1899; Cass. 1900, 1,20; Orleans, 18th February, 1898 Orleans, '99, 2,22; Cass. 11th December, 1899; Cass. 1901 115; Cass. 13th December, 1899; Cass. '93.\nThe arr\u00e9ts of 30th March 1897, and of 13th December 1899, are especially interesting in the present case. It will be sufficient to quote the former.\nAttendu que le 10 mars, 1894, le sieur Grande, employ\u00e9 \u00e0 bord d'un paquebot de la Compagnie Transatlantique a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de l'explo sion de la chaudi\u00e8re et que le landemain il succombait aux suites de ses blessures; que sa veuve a assign\u00e9 la Compagnie Transatlantique en dommages int\u00e9r\u00eats; que pour repousser cette demande l'arr\u00eat attaqu\u00e9 conclut que l'accident a don\u00e9\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 deux enqu\u00eates et v\u00e9rifications technique faites imm\u00e9diatement, l'une par la commission de surveillance, l'autre par M. Vance, expert commis par le juge d'instruction; qu'il r\u00e9sulte de ces deux mesures d'instruction que les foyers et chaudi\u00e8res du Mar\u00e9chal Bugeaud \u00e9taient construites conform\u00e9ment aux r\u00e8gles de l'art, en bon \u00e9tat d'entretien et qu'il leur est impossible de d\u00e9terminer la cause d'un accident qui doit rentrer dans la cat\u00e9gorie des accidents fortuits d\u00e9jouant toute pr\u00e9vision et ne pouvant engager aucune responsibilit\u00e9.\nI am not aware that the soundness of this doctrine has been questioned by any member of this court. The only dissent I can find is in the appreciation of the evidence in one or two cases.\nIt is suggested that a recent decision of this court in The Asbestos and Asbestic Co. v. Durand ([24]) is not entirely in harmony with this jurisprudence. The head-notes and summary of facts by the reporter, which form no part of the opinion of the court, do not accurately represent that opinion as it is there stated that \"the cause of the explosion\" which produced the accident was unknown. That opinion clearly shows that we simply held that sufficient evidence had been adduced to establish negligence on the part of the employer which was the cause of the accident so as to justify us not to interfere with the unanimous findings of facts by two courts. The proof adduced was not direct; it was by presumptions which are recognised by the Quebec Civil Code as legal evidence.\nArt. 1205: Proof may be made by writings, by testimony, by presumptions, etc.\n[Note by Reporters. The head-notes and statement of the case referred to were prepared under directions of the late Mr. Justice King and the printed proofs specially revised by him. See remarks by Tasphereau J. at page 406 infra.] Art. 1238: Presumptions are either established by the law, or arise from facts which are left to the discretion of the courts\nArt. 1242: Presumptions not established by law are left to the discretion and judgment of the court.\nOur lamented brother King, who delivered that opinion, did not find that the cause of the explosion was unknown; he merely held that the court might reasonably presume that it was caused by the excessive accumulation of a highly dangerous material in close proximity to the workmen. He said:\nClearly, therefore, upon the evidence adduced by the defendants themselves, there was, at the time of the explosion, an unnecessary and unreasonable quantity of this highly dangerous explosive in dangerous proximity to the workmen engaged in carrying on their work; and no attempt is made to excuse or explain the circumstance.\nThe negligence involved in this was one of the efficient causes of Rivard's death, which, as admitted and found, was caused by the explosion that in fact took place, and was not the conjectural consequence of a smaller explosion.\nThe peril to life from high explosives is so great, and as shown by the evidence, the cause of their explosion frequently so obscure, that damage may fairly be anticipated as likely to ensue from the act of one who accumulates an unusual and unreasonable quantity in dangerous proximity to others. In placing it where an opportunity for damage may be created either by the nature of the substance or by fortuitous circumstances or neglect of others or other causes, he takes the chance of the happening of such other event and cannot disconnect himself from the fairly to be anticipated consequence of his own negligence.\nIn the declaration (after averring that the explosion which caused the death was that of at least three boxes of dualine, in the building contiguous to that occupied by the deceased), it is averred that \"it was an act of gross neglect on the part of the defendant to leave such a large quantity of explosive matter such as dualine, in the said building. and the death of the said Theodore Rivard resulted from and was due to the carelessness gross neglect and fault of the defendant.\"\nIn what has been adduced [there [is proof of this allegation, and hence the appeal should be dismissed\nThe present case is similar to the preceding one in one respect, namely, that the accident was caused by an explosion. But as to the cause of this explosion, it is very different. Here we are left entirely in the dark. No negligence or fault whatever is established and no presumption is possible. The courts below do not even attempt to indicate any. All the witnesses declare they cannot account for the accident. Alone the plaintiff attributed it to a jam of the cartridges in the automatic machine. But that was a mere supposition. He is not even certain that his back was not turned to the machine at the time of the explosion. It is proved that the machine was perfect and worked regularly and properly. The trial judge so found and certified under the provisions of the new Code of Civil Procedure and there is ample evidence in support of his finding.\nThe Court of Appeal did not review the evidence. The Court of Review did, Mr. Justice Langelier delivering a long and elaborate opinion. But he accepts a supposed negligence as proved. He says:\nMais qu'est-ce qui a amen\u00e9 l'explosion dans la machine? Aucun t\u00e9moin, n'a Pu le dire, mais H. M. et Stewart pensent qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 cause par le fait que, comme cela \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 souvent, d'apr\u00e8s eux, une cartouche aura \u00e9te saisie dans le sens de sa longeur par les pinces, et un doigt de celles-ci frappant sur Ia capsule en a emen\u00e9 l'explosion.\nIt is of no importance to know what the witnesses think, but what they have seen and can testify as facts. In The Asbestos and Asbestic Co. v. Dutad ([25]), there was indisputable evidence of fault, and not a mere suggestion or surmise as in this case. The plaintiff should have been non-suited.\nThe appeal is therefore allowed with costs and respondent's action dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J. (dissenting).\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. In the case of The George Matthews Company\nPage 402]\nv. Bouchard ([26]) this court refused to disturb the con current findings of fact of two courts of the province, though it was very doubtful if the injuries complained of by the plaintiff had actually been caused by the negligence of the defendant\nNow the appellant here is asking us to give less consideration to findings of fact by a jury, concurred in by two courts, than findings of fact by a judge were in that case deemed to he entitled to.\nThe respondent has proved and the jury have found that the accident in question was not caused by his own fault or negligence And it clearly was not caused by the act of God. Neither was it a fortuitous event; art. 17, subsec. 24 C. C., or an inevitable accident; The \" Schwan\" ([27]); Eugsler v. West ([28]).\nThen there is ample evidence, (a complete analysis of it has been made by Mr. Justice Langelier, in the Court of Review; I refer more particularly to the depositions of Aikins, Stuart and the two McArthurs), that the machine used by the appellant was defective, one employed nowhere else in factories of this kind, and discarded altogether by the appellant itself since this accident, presumably because the workmen would thereafter have nothing whatever to do with it. And the jury have given credit to that evidence, though the appellant endeavoured to prove the contrary by its employees. it is further proved that the explosion took place in the machine itself.\nNow, the jury, seeing an explosion in a defective machine and having before them evidence that it was utterly impossible to otherwise account for it, have drawn the inference of fact that the machine exploded because it was defective. There is nothing in the case to justify me in saying that the two courts of the province (eight judges), were clearly wrong in holding that this conclusion was not an unreasonable one. Metropolitan Railway Co. v. Wright ([29]); Art. 501 C. C. P. It falls within the exclusive province of a jury to pass upon presumptive evidence of this nature. The suppositions and conjectures the appellant would rely upon cannot militate against the common sense view of the facts that guided this verdict. The company placed a defective instrument in the respondent's hands; the jury found consequently, that it had not taken the extra care required when there is an extra risk, clearly a question of fact; the instrument exploded and injured the respondent. It seems to me that from the facts proved, as it was in evidence, that the explosion could not reasonably be traced to any other cause, the jury could fairly infer that the appellant's negligence in not providing a safer machine was the cause of the respondent's injuries.\nIt is possible that, upon the evidence, a judge might be satisfied that appellant had taken all the care reasonably required under the circumstances. But that was a fact for the \"jury who we have to assume received and acted upon the directions expected from the presiding judge in such a case. As per Brett J. in Bridges v. The North London Railway Co. ([30]) at page 232. And they having found that the appellant has not acted with the prudence and care that: the law required on its part to disturb their verdict would be to usurp their functions.\nTo use the words of Mr. Justice Brett, in Bridges v. The North London Railway Co. (2).\nIf such decisions may be overruled on the mere ground that the courts or judges do not agree with them, the juries are bound to matters of fact by the view of the judges as to facts. That cannot be. Or as said in other words by the Privy Council in the case of The Connecticut Mutual Life ins. Go. v. Moore ([31]).\nIf the only question for their lordships were whether or not they take the same view of the evidence as the jury, they might be disposed to say that the evidence on the part of the defendants somewhat preponderates. But this is not enough to justify them in granting a new trial l to hold it to be enough would be, in fact, to substitute a court for a jury.\nIt is much better and more in conformity with our system of trial by jury, that juries should sometimes render verdicts against the weight of evidence as estimated by trained judicial minds, than that their verdicts should be too readily set aside by the judgment of judicial minds, who, in matters of fact, are subject to the same infirmity as jurors and are not less liable to differ among themselves. Vide The Connecticut Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Moore ([32]); Dublin, Wicklow & Wexford Railway Co. v. Slattery ([33]); Smith v. South Eastern Railway Co. ([34]); Washington & George town Railroad Co. v. Harmon's Administrator ([35]).\nCertainly, as the appellant argued, the plaintiff has to prove his case upon an action of this nature. But it is a fallacy to contend, as they virtually do, that a stricter proof should be required from him than which would be required to convict a man of murder or manslaughter by negligence. Arts. 213, 220 Crim. Code.\nAs said by Baron Pollock in Bridges v. The North\nLondon Railway Co. ([36]).\nThe plaintiff no doubt, is bound to make out her case, and cannot, by bare suggestion, challenge its rebuttal, and if what I have stated was mere speculation, it ought not to have gone to the jury. but if it was an inference which could be fairly drawn from facts proved in the same manner as things unseen or unproved\u2014which in the eyes of the law are the same\u2014are constantly inferred and found as facts by a jury then the evidence should have been submitted to the jury, together with any which the defendants chose to adduce, and which might have exculpated or further inculpated them according as their witnesses knew more of the occurrence and confirmed or displaced the evidence for the plaintiff.\nOr as Lord Penzance puts it in Parfitt v. Lawless ([37]).\nIt is not intended to be said that he upon whom the burden of, proving an issue lies is bound to prove every fact, or conclusion of fact, upon which the issue depends. From every fact that is proved, legitimate or reasonable inference may, of course, be drawn and all that is fairly deducible from the evidence is as much \"Droved for the purpose of a prim\u00e2 facie case as if it had been proved directly. I conceive, therefore, that in discussing whether there is, in any case, evidence to go to the jury what the court has to consider is this whether, assuming the evidence to be true, and adding to the direct proof all'such inferences of fact as, in the exercise of reasonable intelligence, the jury would be warranted in drawing from it there is evidence to support the issue.\nIt is upon that principle that in the case of The Canada Atlantic Railway Co. v. Moxley ([38]), in the Ontario Court of Appeal and in this court ([39]) the verdict of the jury based upon an inference of facts was upheld, though there was much room for doubt.\nAnd the following other cases, inter alia, show that the tendency of modern rulings in this court has been, as in the English courts, Pollock on Torts, (5 ed.) pp. 413, 414, if not to enlarge, at least not to curtail the functions of the jury. St. John Gas Light Co. v. Hat field ([40]); Grand Trunk Railway Go. v. Weegar ([41]); Toronto Railway Co. v Grinstead ([42]); The Toronto Railway Go. v. The City of Toronto ([43]); Drennan v. City of Kingston ([44]) confirmed in this court ([45]) * The Canadian Coloured Cotton Mills Co v Talbot ([46]) * The Manufacturers Accident Ins. Co, v. Pudsey ([47]); The Grand\nL. R. 2. P. & D. 462. (6) 24 Can. S. C. R. 570. Trunk Railway Co. v. Railville ([48]); The Halifax Electric Tramway Co. v. Inglis ([49]).\nIn the recent case of The Asbestos and Asbestic Co. v. Durand ([50]) a non-jury case, the cause of the explosion was unknown; (the syllabus of the case, as it appears in the report is, I have ascertained, in the handwriting of the learned judge himself who delivered the judgment, and ipsissimis verbis, given by the reporter as handed down by him); but the defendant was held liable because by allowing an unnecessary quantity of dynamite to accumulate in dangerous proximity, it could not\ndisconnect itself from the fairly to be anticipated consequences of its own negligence,\nit being clear that the injured party was not himself the cause of his injuries.\nNow if an inference of fact of this nature can law fully be drawn by the court in a non-jury case, a jury, it seems to me, can likewise reasonably do so, where, as here it is likewise found that the \"plaintiff was not guilty of negligence.\nThe appellants seem to place great reliance upon the certificate of the learned judge who \"presided at the trial. But as Tread it that certificate does not help their case. First, as to the facts, the jury's conclusions, not the judges, it is trite to say, must prevail. Ad questionem facti nonrespondent judices. Secondly, article 469 of the Code of Civil Procedure Specially decrees in accordance with the English practice, that, whenever the judge is of the opinion that the plaintiff has given no evidence upon which the jury could find a verdict, he may dismiss the action. Now, by the fact that the learned judge did not dismiss the action but left the case to the jury, he necessarily must be assumed to have been of the opinion that there was a case made out by the respondent for them. The appellants themselves do not appear to have contended before the learned judge, at the close of the respondent's case that there was room for his interference* And, if there was a case for the Jury, upon the authority of Lambkin v. Tue South Eastern Railway Co. ([51]) this appeal must be dismissed. There, as here, though the verdict of the jury had been upheld by two provincial courts, yet the defendants impugned it before the Privy Council as being against the evidence. But, said their lordships:\nWith respect to the verdict being against evidence, it appears to their lordships that the question of negligence, being one of fact for the jury, and the finding of the jury having been upheld or at all events not set aside by two courts, it is not open under the ordinary practice to the defendants.\nThe cases cited by the appellant of The Montreal Rolling'Mills Co\u00bb v. Corcovan ([52]); The Canada Paint Paint Co. v. Trainor ([53]); The Dominion Cartridge Co. v. Cairns ([54]) had not been fried by a jury. In the cases of Tooke v. Bergeron ([55]); and Burland v. Lee ([56]); (also non-jury cases,) the actions were dismissed upon the ground that the injuries complained of had been caused by the negligence of the plaintiffs themselves In Cowans v. Marshall ([57]) a new trial was ordered upon the ground that the answers of the jury were unsatisfactory. The case of Wakelin, v. The London and South Western Railway Co. ([58]) and that class of cases have no application. There, as in The Canadian Coloured Cotton Mills Co. v Kervin ([59]) in this court it Was consistent with the evidence that the accident was due to the injured party's own carelessness. Here, there is no room for such a contention; the jury has found conclusively that the plaintiff has not been guilty of negligence. Moreover, contributory negligence, had any been found, does not, in the Province of Quebec, defeat the action. Price v.

It is not sufficient that the same may be made certain by some process of calculation or some act to be performed in the future.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench for Manitoba (2) reducing the damages given at the trial by deducting the interest allowed. One Charlebois had a contract to build the Great North-West Central Railway, and the defendant Preston contracted with him to do the fencing, taking Musson, the other defendant, into partnership for the work. Plaintiffs then agreed with defendants to do the fencing, the agreement containing the following provision.\n\u201cEstimates for the said work shall be made monthly by the company\u2019s engineer, or at such other times as the said engineer shall deem reasonable and proper, and such estimates, less ten per cent rebate, shall be paid forthwith upon same being paid to said Preston and Musson by said company, and the said ten per cent rebate shall be paid forthwith upon same being paid to said Preston and Musson by said company.\u201d\nCharlebois not having been paid by the company, Preston took proceedings and obtained judgment, which it was agreed should be entered against the company direct. This judgment was assigned to other parties by which plaintiffs claimed that their right to judgment under the above clause immediately attached. They received the principal of their claim and brought suit for the interest, which the trial judge allowed but the full court deducted from the amount given by the verdict.\nAylesworth K. C. for the appellants. The court below followed Merchant Shipping Co. v. Armitage (1) in holding that plaintiffs were not entitled to interest. That decision does not bind this court, and is not in accord with others before and since. Duncombe v. Brighton Club & Norfolk Hotel Co. (2) decided in the following year, is directly opposed to the ruling in Merchant Shipping Co. v. Armitage, as is Macintosh v. Great Western Railway Co. (3), decided ten years earlier, and in London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co. v. South Eastern Railway Co. ([1]), Lindley L. J. characterizes the decision in Merchant Shipping Co, v. Armitage as \u201c a restricted, or perhaps it may be called rather a narrow contraction of this Act of Parliament.\u201d See also the opinion of Lord Cairns in Rodger v. Comptoire D\u2019Escompte de Paris ([2]), and McCullough v. Clemow ([3]), in which the whole question as to interest is discussed by Mr. Justice Osler.\nChristopher Robinson K. C. and Elliott for the respondents. Merchant Shipping Co. v. Armitage ([4]) has never been overruled, and was followed by the Court of Appeal in London, Chatham & Dover Railway Co. v. South Eastern Railway Co. ([5]) overruling the judgment of the Chancery Division cited by the learned counsel for the appellants. And see Webster v. British Empire Mutual Assurance Co. ([6]).\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I do not see that upon any of the grounds taken by the appellants, they can succeed upon their appeal. I entirely agree with the reasons given in the full Court of Manitoba. I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014By the contract of the 12th of October, 1889, declared upon in this case no sum of money was made payable or could ever become payable to the plaintiffs except for work then yet to be performed, accepted and certified by the engineer of the railway company as executed in conformity with the provisions of the contract; what amounts, if any, and when any such amounts should be so certified depended on the judgment of the engineer and subject to this further condition that nothing should become payable by the defendants until they should receive payment for work which they had contracted to perform for one Charlebois who claimed to have a contract with the Great North West Central Railway Company for constructing their railway, part of which work was the work which the plaintiffs by sub-contract with the defendants contract to perform.\nThe judgment in the declaration alleged to have been pronounced by the High Court of Justice for Ontario upon the 28th of September, 1891, in the suit of Charlebois against the railway company (to which suit the Union Bank who were then assignees of the whole right, title and interest of the plaintiffs in and under, the said contract and on whose behalf and in whose interest the present action is prosecuted were parties, defendants, to the said suit equally as the plaintiff Preston) can not, in my opinion, by reason of anything therein contained be construed to constitute, as the appellants contend, payment to the defendants in the present action within the meaning of the contract of the 12th of October, 1889, of the sums therein mentioned, the payment of which to the defendants was by the contract made a condition precedent to the plaintiffs having any cause of action against the defendants.\nIt appears upon the record before us that in the month of January, 1890 the Union Bank as assignees of all the rights and interest of the appellants in and under the contract of the twelfth of October, 1889, received as money payable to the appellants under their contract with the respondents, the sum of $2,611 out of monies payable to, and paid on account of, the respondents\u2019 claim against Charlebois under their contract with him. It in like manner appears also that shortly after the rendering of the judgment of the High Court of Justice in Ontario on the 28th of September, 1891, the respondent Preston with the knowledge and consent of the Union Bank as assignees of the appellants assigned all the right, title and interest of the respondents to receive payment under the said judgment for the work performed by them under their contract with Charlebois to one Nugent (then the attorney of the respondents, now the attorney of the plaintiffs in the present action which is plainly brought in their names in the interest of and for the Union Bank) upon trust to pay there out when received the balance of the amount due to the appellants under their contract.\nIt is not disputed that since the month of January, 1890, no sum was actually paid to either of the respondents personally or to any one on their behalf until the month of February, 1898, when the sum of $8,400 as due to the respondents under their contract with Charlebois was paid to Nugent as such trustee for the Union Bank, the assignees of the claim of the appellants against the respondents. Out of this sum it appears that Nugent paid the bank the sum of $5,835.50 retaining the balance in his own hands. Upon affidavits of these facts it also in like manner appears that application was made by the respondents for an order to have Nugent joined as a defendant with them which motion was refused, for what reason does not appear, and judgment was thereupon rendered in the action against the defendants therein, the now respondents, for the sum of $1,078.50, with interest thereon at the rate of six per centum per annum from the commencement of the action until the recovery of judgment. From that judgment the respondents have not appealed and the sole question therefore before us on this appeal is upon a question whether or not the appellants or the Union Bank in their right are entitled to recover interest which they claim from the 28th September, 1891, under statute 3 & 4 Wm. 4, ch. 42, s. 28, upon the sum of $6,914, which as now appears would have been the amount then payable to the plaintiffs if the defendants had then received the amount due to them under their contract with Charlebois.\nNow in The Merchant Shipping Co. v. Armitage ([7]) it was held in the month of November, 1873, unanimously by seven judges in the Exchequer Chamber, that where by a charter party a lump sum of \u00a35,000 was agreed to be paid for freight after entire discharge and right delivery of the cargo in cash two months after the date of the ship\u2019s report inwards at the Custom House, and part of the cargo was lost by fire the full sum of the \u00a35,000 was payable under the contract. So far as the sum was concerned there was a sum certain payable under the contract, but it was held unanimously that it was not made payable at a time certain by the contract. In the month of March, 1874, the case of Hill v. The South Staffordshire Railway Co. ([8]) was decided by Vice Chancellor Hall. The question there arose upon a contract between the railway company and a contractor which provided that payments should be made monthly as the work proceeded on the certificates of the company\u2019s engineer; some payments on account were made and a demand was made by the contractor upon the company for payment of a balance claimed by the contractor. This amount was in excess of the amount recovered in an action brought by the contractor in consequence of the company not having complied with the contractors demand and it was held by the learned Vice Chancellor that interest could not be recovered under 3 & 4 Wm. 4, ch. 28, there being no sum certain payable under the contract at a time certain. This case was determined wholly independently of The Merchant Shipping Co. v. Armitage (1) which was not cited by counsel on the argument nor by the learned Vice Chancellor. The case of the defendants was argued by Lindley Q.C., subsequently Lord Justice Lindley, whose argument the Vice Chancellor seems to have adopted, and it appears to me so much to the point that I quote a few passages of it. At p. 163 he says:\nThe statute only applies to debts or sums certain. Is the sum now found due from the defendants a debt or sum certain\u2014that will depend on the meaning of the expression certain. There was no certainty what would become payable to the contractor even in respect of the \u00a392,000\u2014for that was subject to variation, and unquestionably the other sums which were payable under the contract were not sums certain. It is said that anything is certain which can be rendered so by the contract or anything else\u2014that is clearly too wide a construction.\nThen he cited Annandale v. Pattison (2) decided it is true under a different statute namely the stamp Act 55 Geo. 3 ch. 184, but strongly in support of his argument. Then again he says:\nCan it be said that because the chief clerk has found that a sum\u2014now of course a certain sum\u2014is payable by the defendants that it is a debt or sum certain within the meaning of the statute ? When was it certain ? Was it so before it was ascertained ? How can it be said that a sum which is ultimately found due in respect of all sorts of work constitutes a debt or sum certain within such meaning ? It can only be upon the theory that everything is certain when it is made so\u2014a proposition not disputed\u2014but it is plain that interest is to be payable in respect of a certain instrument; therefore it must be a definite stated sum mentioned in the agreement itself. It cannot be found in the contract itself what particular sum can possibly be payable under it. To do that the functions of the engineer must be performed for it was deputed to him to find out in respect of what work the calculation was to be made. This argument resting so forcibly upon the uncertainty of the sum\u2014a point not in uncertainty in The Merchant Shipping Co. v. Armitage ([9]) may possibly account for that case not having been referred to in Hill v. 7he South Staffordshire Railway Co. ([10]) in which case the argument on behalf of the plaintiff was largely rested upon Mildmay v. Methuen ([11]), and Macintosh v. The Great Western Railway Co. (4). These cases were also cited by the plaintiffs in the present case, but the learned Vice Chancellor shows why they are wholly unsatisfactory authorities and unreliable upon the question before him as to which in giving judgment he says:\nIndependently of any authority upon the point I should have said that this was not a case in which within the meaning of the statute there had been a demand made in writing of a sum certain payable at a certain time.\nIn the month of June, 1875, the case of Duncombe v. The Brighton Club and Norfolk Hotel Company (5) came before the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench composed of Blackburn, Mellor and Lush JJ. The terms of the contract were contained in a letter dated the 28th of September, 1865, from the plaintiffs to the defendants, which was as follows:\nI have thought over your application respecting the Norfolk Hotel, the best terms I could offer would be one-third in cash and bills at six and twelve months for the balance.\nThis letter related to negotiations which had taken place between the writer of it and the company in relation to furnishing the hotel.\nThe terms of the letter were accepted by the company and the furnishing was completed in the month of March, 1866, at the cost as appeared by the bill rendered by the plaintiff of \u00a33169 1s 11d.: the defendants paid on account of the third of this amount the sum of \u00a3800 0s 0d, leaving \u00a3256 0s 0d unpaid. Subsequently an action was brought to recover this sum, and it was in respect of interest claimed upon it from the completion of the furnishing of the hotel in March, 1866, that the question arose.\nNow it is to be observed that neither The Merchant Shipping Co. v. Armitage ([12]), nor Hill v. The South Staffordshire ([13]), was cited, and from the judgments pronounced by the learned judges it is quite plain that they were not aware of either of these decisions. Blackburn J. was of opinion that the case did not come; within the statute, and he held that interest was therefore not recoverable. He said:\nI think that the construction of the statute is that the written instrument should specify the time; and if that be so, the written instrument in this case does not do so,\nand he expresses his surprise that there is so little authority on the subject; and again he says:\nI have already expressed my opinion that they (the words of the statute) do mean that the debt or the sum certain must be payable at a certain time by virtue of the written instrument, and that it is not enough that it afterwards becomes payable on a certain day. The section does not mean by a certain time, a time which is to depend upon a future named event, which will when the event happens become certain.\nMellor J. while differing from the opinion of Blackburn J. said that he did so with doubt and hesitation. He stated his opinion to be\nthat the object of the statute was not that the actual day should be ascertained on the face of the instrument, but that the basis of the calculation which was to make it certain should be found in the instrument in writing.\nThen he explained how as he was of opinion that such basis appeared on the letter of the 28th of September, 1865. The goods were to be paid for one-third in cash, one-third by a bill at six months, and the residue by a bill at twelve months. I think when the goods were sent in the time for the payment of one-third in cash had arrived, and all the rest of the calculation must depend upon that.\nAnd what he meant he explains further by saying:\nIt is not necessary that the day for payment should be named e.g, \u201c the debt shall be payable on the 1st of October,\u201d but it is sufficient if the time can be ascertained by the terms which are in writing and which enable the jury to form a safe basis of calculation as to the time certain at which it is to be payable,\nand he closes his judgment by saying:\nI am, shortly, of opinion that if the basis of the calculation is to be found in the written instrument it is enough.\nHe was thus of opinion that if anything had to be done further than a mere calculation made upon a basis sufficiently defined in a written instrument then the case would not be within the statute, and interest would not be recoverable. We may, I think, reasonably conclude that a majority of two to one would not have arrived at the judgment if the case in the Exchequer Chamber had been cited. However the judgments of Blackburn J. and Mellor J. both make reasonably clear that in a case like Hill v. The South Staffordshire Railway Co. ([14]) where the functions of an engineer must intervene before anything becomes due under the contract, which was the case here, they would have entirely concurred with the argument of Lindley, Q.C. and the judgment of the Vice Chancellor in that case.\nIn the London & Chatham Railway Co. v. The South Eastern Railway Co. ([15]) the cases of The Merchant Shipping Co. v. Armitage ([16]), and of Duncombe v. The Brighton Club & Norfolk Hotel Co. ([17]) came under the consideration of the Court of Appeal consisting of the Lords Justices Lindley, Bowes and Kay, and it was unanimously held that the latter case was inconsistent with the former by which, it being a judgment of the Exchequer Chamber, the Court of Appeal was bound. It is true that Lord Justice Lindley there expressed the opinion that the construction put upon the statute by the Exchequer Chamber was a narrow construction but he nevertheless entertained no doubt that it must prevail. We cannot, however, from that observation infer that the Lord Justice had any doubt of the soundness of his argument or of the judgment of the learned Vice Chancellor adopting it in Hill v. The South Staffordshire Railway Co. (1) between which and the present case rather than between the present case and the Armitage case a parallel exists. The judgment of the Lords Justices having been appealed from to the House of Lords (2), was affirmed there. Lord Chancellor Herschell did not express any opinion as between the Armitage case and the Duncombe case because in his opinion neither case supported the claim of the appellants in the case before the House. He stated, however, his opinion upon the construction of the statute to be that the certain sum payable must be a sum certain which is due absolutely and in all events from the one party to the other although it may not constitute strictly speaking a debt, and he held that in the case before the House there was not a sum certain payable at a certain time by virtue of a written instrument. The application of the rule so expressed is quite sufficient for the purposes of the present case. Lord Watson was of opinion that the statute was evidently framed in recognition of the law as stated by Lord Tenterden in Page v. Newman (3) to the effect that interest is not due on money secured by a written instrument unless it appears on the face of the instrument that interest was intended to be paid or unless it be implied from the usage of trade as in the case of mercantile instruments. Lord Morris unhesitatingly expressed his entire concurrence in the judgment of the Exchequer Chamber. Lord Shand while concurring with the Lord Chancellor in other respects alone expressed his inability to concur in the opinion of Lord Morris. In this state of the authorities the rule as laid down in the Exchequer Chamber is still binding in all parallel cases, but as already observed the case of Hill v. The South Staffordshire Railway Co. ([18]) is most similar in its circumstances to the present case, and there does not appear to have ever been raised any objection to the construction of the statute upon which that case proceeded.\nUpon the authorities as they stand I cannot hesitate to say that in the contract before us there is no sum certain payable at a time certain within the meaning of the statute. I entertain no doubt that the judgment of the 29th September, 1891, in the declaration mentioned did not constitute payment to the defendants of the monies, the payment of which to them was, by the contract, made a condition precedent to the plaintiffs having any cause of action against the defendants. What was sought to be done by that judgment was, by a rather irregular mode, but still to endeavour to obtain better security for payment at some future time not only of the claims of the defendants here but also of the Union Bank and others for claims against Charlebois by transferring his liability to the railway company and so substituting them, the parties really benefited by the work done, in the place of Charlebois, but of present or immediate or proximate payment no expectation was at the time entertained by any one. To treat that transaction as a payment of the defendants claim against Charlebois or the company is in my judgment wholly inadmissible. The appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK and GIROUARD JJ. concurred in the dismissal of the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Ewart, Fisher & Wilson.\nSolicitor for the respondents: Geo.

Taschereau J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of Street J. at the trial[2] in favour of the plaintiff. The question to be decided on this appeal is stated in the above headnote. The facts are set out in the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nNesbitt K.C. and H.S. Osler for the appellant.\nTeetzel K.C. and Thompson K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Sedgewick.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. The respondent\u2019s horses, it is clear, got upon the railway line because it was not fenced, as required by the statute. The reasoning of the Court of Appeal seems to me unassailable.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The railway of the defendant crosses a farm of one Burns, in the Township of Saltfleet, in the County of Wentworth, in the Province of Ontario, through which, in a low place about fifteen feet below the upper surface of the farm a natural stream runs, which during the spring and autumn freshets flows in a great volume and with considerable force insomuch that during their continuance no animal can pass along the bed of the stream from one side of the railway to the other, but in the summer season the water is low and then animals can pass along the bed of the stream from one field to another. The defendants in constructing their railway across the farm made their railway over the stream by a stone arch on a level with the general surface of the upper lands, the top of the arch being from 12 to 15 feet above the bed of the stream. They also constructed and have maintained fences on either side of their railway terminating at the walls of the arch across the stream so that no animal in a field on either side of the railway can get on to the railway at any place direct from such field. The whole of the space under the arch, constitutes the bed of the stream, and in point of fact no use whatever is made of such space by the defendants.\nThe plaintiff is the owner of horses which he had placed at pasture with Burns the owner of the farm. The evidence is that two of the plaintiff\u2019s horses passed from the field belonging to Burns on the south side of the railway along the bed of the stream into the field on the other side. How long they remained there does not appear, but it does appear that they escaped from that field through a fence bordering on a highway, by reason of the insufficiency of such fence and of the negligence of Burns or his servants in not keeping that fence in an efficient condition, and that they thence proceeded along the highway to a point where it is crossed on the level by the defendants\u2019 railway, from which point, crossing the cattle guards maintained by the defendants there, they got on to the railway track, and at some distance from the highway crossing were killed by a passing train. In an action by the plaintiff to recover the value of the horses so killed it clearly appears that the horses got on to the railway track from the highway by reason of the inefficiency of the cattle guards maintained by the defendants there, but the defendants rest for their defence upon this that the horses of the plaintiff which were killed were, as the defendants contend, contrary to the provision of sec. 271 of the Railway Act, 51 Vict, c. 29, at large upon the highway which is crossed on the level by the defendants\u2019 railway, and that being so at large they reached the place where the highway is crossed by the railway, and that although they get on to the railway outside of the line of the highway by reason of the insufficiency of the cattle guards main- tained by the defendants there and were killed by a train of the defendants nevertheless the plaintiff is disentitled to recover for the value of the horses.\nThe plaintiff on the contrary contended, and his contention has been maintained by the courts in the Province of Ontario, that by the section 194 of 51 Vict., c. 29, as amended by 53 Vict., c. 28, it was the duty of the defendants to have fenced across the stream on either side of the railway, and to have so prevented all possibility of animals crossing along the bed of the stream under the railway, and that having neglected so to do, they cannot appeal to the fact of the horses having got on to the railway by reason of the insufficiency of the fence separating Burns\u2019s farm from the highway, nor insist that the horses were wrongfully on the highway.\nThe contention of the defendants on the contrary was that their fences as constructed were in perfect conformity with the provisions of the statute as they were sufficient to prevent any cattle from getting directly from either of the fields of Burns on to the railway, and that this was the object and intent of the sec. 194 which imposed on the defendants the obligation of fencing on either side of the railway, and they contended further that even assuming their obligation to fence on either side of the railway to have required them to fence across the stream in question, they were nevertheless entitled to insist as they did that their omission to do so was not, under the circumstances appearing in evidence, a matter of which the plaintiff could avail himself in support of the present action; for that it was clearly established that the negligence of Burns in not maintaining a sufficient fence alongside of the highway was the cause of the horses getting on to the highway and so that they were on the high- way at large wrongfully within the meaning of the sec. 271.\nThe contention of the plaintiff was maintained upon the authority of Sneesby v. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company[3]. In that case the negligence of the defendants\u2019 servants had caused a drove of cattle which were being driven along a road crossed by the defendants\u2019 railway to become so infuriated that they rushed furiously away from the control of the drover and in the course taken by them in their terror they got into a garden or orchard close to the railway, and in their fury broke down a fence separating the garden from the railway upon which some were found killed at the distance of about a quarter of a mile from the road where they had been terrified by the negligent conduct of the defendants, and it was held that as the defendants had been guilty of negligence which caused the drover to lose control over the cattle and caused the cattle to become infuriated it was no answer that if the fence of the garden had not been defective the accident would not have happened, and that consequently the damages were not too remote.\nBetween that case and the present there is no parallel; there the injury suffered by the cattle was the direct consequence of the act of negligence committed by the defendants which consisted in this that there was a steep incline from the level of the railway to the level of the road, and while the cattle were proceeding along the road across the railway track several trucks were by the negligence of the defendants\u2019 servants, allowed to run down between the cattle and the persons in charge of them and so separated the cattle from the persons in charge of them. There the defendants were held to be liable because the injury complained of followed directly in continuous sequence from the wrongful act of the defendants\u2019 servants. In the present case the omission to fence across the stream assuming it to constitute default in the discharge of the duty imposed upon the defendants did no injury to the plaintiff. His horses remained in the possession of and under the care of Burns, when in the field to which they removed by passing under the railway on the bed of the stream equally as they had been before. Between the omission to fence across the stream and the defect in Burns\u2019s fence alongside of the highway there is no connection whatever; none of cause and effect as there was in Sneesby v. The Lancanshire and Yorkshire Railway Company[4]. The present case, therefore, can not be rested upon the judgment in that case, nor are the defendants estopped, by reason of anything appearing in evidence, from insisting that the cause of the horses getting on to the highway was the defect of Burns\u2019s fence, or from claiming the benefit of the said sec. 271.\nThat section which has been in force in virtue of (and without alteration since the passing of) the Act 20 Vict. c. 12, sec. 16 enacts that:\nSec. 271. No horses, sheep, swine or other cattle shall be permitted to be at large upon any highway within half a mile of the intersection of such highway with any railway at rail level unless such cattle are in charge of some person or persons to prevent their loitering or stopping on such highway at such intersection.\nBy an unbroken series of decisions of the courts of Ontario and of that portion of the late Province of Canada constituting Upper Canada, from 1858 to the present time, it has been held that the mere fact of an animal being on a highway within the prescribed distance from a railway crossing without being in charge of some person, as required by the statute apart from all consideration of how it got there, constitutes being at large within the meaning of the statute, and that the statute takes away the right of action not only where an animal so at large is killed or injured at the very point of intersection of the railway with the highway, but also in case of its being killed or injured on the railway outside of the limits of the highway to which place it had gotten by reason of the insufficiency of the cattle guards of the defendants at the crossing. This ruling has been invariably maintained and although the statute in which the section originally appeared has since then been amended by the legislature no alteration has been made in this section.\nThe general rule so laid down is, however, I apprehend, like all general rules, subject to some exception, as for example, in case an animal should inadvertently escape from an enclosure in which it was kept and a person in charge should immediately go in search of it, or that an animal being led by a person on foot on a highway should escape from him and run away from the control of the person leading it and that such person should immediately follow in pursuit of it, but that in these cases the person in search of the one or in pursuit of the other should only succeed so far as to get up in time to see the animal cross from the highway on to the railway outside of the limits of the highway by reason of the insufficiency of the cattle guards of the railway, and that the animal should be killed or injured before the person following it could interpose and drive it away it would seem hard if in such a case the railway company should be held to be irresponsible for a loss so occasioned by the insufficiency of the cattle guards which they are required by statute to maintain.\nHowever, the present case is not one of that nature but is of the class which is governed by an uninter- rupted series of decisions extending over a period of 43 years which I do not think should now be departed from especially in a case in which the plaintiff rests upon quite a different ground, and has not called in question the correctness of these decisions.\nAs to the other point I am of opinion that the erection of fences on either side of the railway terminating at the walls of the arch constructed over the stream, as was done in the present case, constituted complete fulfilment of the obligation imposed by the statute on the appellants.\nThe appeal must therefore be allowed.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The defendant company\u2019s line of railway between Hamilton and Niagara Falls crosses the farm of two brothers named Burns in the Township of Saltfleet, Wentworth County, Ontario.\nThrough the farm and substantially at right angles to the railway track runs a wide natural watercourse with high banks on either side which watercourse the railway crosses by means of two culverts or bridges each twenty feet in width and fifteen feet in height. For the most part during the year the stream is so filled with water as to prevent animals from fording it or passing under the culverts, but sometimes in the autumn it is dry enough for this purpose. That was the case in September, 1899, when the accident happened which is the foundation of the present action.\nOn the south side of the track there is a pasture and upon the north side a field used for pasture after the spring crops are taken off. The plaintiff by agreement with the owners of the land was pasturing a number of horses on the lower field. At the time in question the stream under the culverts between the two fields having become so small or shallow, the horses in the lower field were enabled to pass up stream to the upper field. That field had all summer been surrounded by fencing erected on three sides by the proprietors, the fourth side being the fencing and bridging of the railway, but through the negligence or mistake of some one unknown, a panel on the northern fence separating the field from a highway had been left open and the plaintiff\u2019s horses escaping through the opening to this highway which crosses the railway track at right angles and on the level a short distance therefrom, wandered upon the road-bed of the railway. Two were struck by a train passing westward and were killed. There was some question raised at the trial as to whether the cattle guards on each side of the highway crossing were in proper condition, but I will deal with this later on.\nThere is no complaint as to the condition of the fences on each side of the railway track; they were in perfect repair. The company had not, however, maintained a fence across the watercourse running under the culverts although about ten years before it had by request made some sort of a barricade under one of the culverts where the water was dry. The fences, however, on each side of the track were firmly attached to the perpendicular walls of the culverts and there was no possibility, as things stood at the time of the accident, for cattle in any way to obtain access to the road-bed or railway tracks, except by means of the highway some distance from the stream. The respondent contends that the company were bound not only to maintain fences in such a way as to prevent cattle from straying upon its tracks but were equally bound to erect such fences or other structures and adopt such other measures as would prevent them from going under the track through the culverts from one side of the railway property to the other. The trial judge, Street J., decided in favour of this contention and that view was upheld by the Court of Appeal.\nIt is elementary to say that a railway company is under no common law liability to build such fences as are claimed here. The burden imposed upon it in that regard is wholly legislative and to place liability upon it the case must be brought within the four corners of a statute. The statute upon which the defendant\u2019s liability is here claimed is the Railway Act of 1888, (51 Vict. c. 29, sec. 194,) as amended by the Act of 1890, (53 Vict. c. 28, sec. 2). I cite some of the sections relied upon.\nSection 194.\u2014When a municipal corporation for any township has been organised and the whole or any portion of such township has been surveyed and subdivided into lots for settlement, fences shall be erected and maintained on each side of the railway through such township, of the height and strength of an ordinary division fence with openings or gates or bars or sliding or hurdle gates of sufficient width for the purposes thereof with proper fastenings at farm crossings of the railway and also cattle guards at all highway crossings suitable and sufficient to prevent cattle and other animals from getting on the railway.\nSub-section 3, (as amended by the Act of 1890). If the company omits to erect and complete as aforesaid any fence or cattle guard, or if, after it is completed, the company neglects to maintain the same as aforesaid, and if, in consequence of such omission or neglect, any animal gets upon the railway from an adjoining place where, under the circumstances, it might properly be, then the company shall be liable to the owner of every such animal for all damages in respect of it caused by any of the company\u2019s trains or engines, and no animal allowed by law to run at large shall be held to be improperly on a place adjoining the railway merely for the reason that the owner or occupant of such place has not permitted it to be there.\nSection 271 of the Railway Act, which also affects the case is as follows:\nSec. 271. No horses, sheep, swine or other cattle shall be permitted to be at large upon any highway within half a mile of the intersection of such highway with any railway at rail level, unless such cattle are in charge of some person or persons to prevent their loitering or stopping on such highway at such intersection.\n* * * * * *\n3. If the cattle of any person, which are at large contrary to the provisions of this section, are killed or injured by any train at such point of intersection, he shall not have any right of action against any company in respect of the same being so killed or injured.\nThe plaintiff, as I have said, contends that under this legislation the railway company is bound to erect and maintain a fence on each side of the culvert across the watercourse and upon the dividing line between the railway property and that of the adjacent owners.\nThe company, on the other hand, asserts that it is not bound to maintain fences across watercourses at all or to build them on the boundary line, but that so long as it erects and maintains fencing sufficient in character to fulfil the statutory condition and which prevents cattle from straying upon the railway tracks, it has wholly fulfilled its statutory obligation.\nAccording to my view the company\u2019s contention is the correct one.\nThe court below, in order to support the plaintiff\u2019s view, had recourse to the interpretation clause in the Railway Act, section 2, (q.), which provides that the expression \u201crailway\u201d means any railway which the company has authority to construct and operate, and includes all stations, depots, wharves, property and works connected therewith, and also any railway bridge or other structure which any company is authorized to construct under a special Act, and they hold that the word \u201crailway\u201d in section 194, (fifth line,) is therefore equivalent to railway property, and that it thus becomes obligatory on the railway company to erect its fences on the dividing line between its land and that of the adjacent proprietor. In other words, that the section, in fact, calls for a division, line, or boundary fences. Is this the proper construc- tion? There is sufficient, I think, in the section itself to shew that it is not. Its object seems to me clear and express, namely, the securing of protection for adjoining proprietors. If parliament had intended to insist upon the erection of and maintainance of boundary fences, it would have said so.\nOn the contrary, the phrase of the section leads to the inference that a boundary fence was not intended but only a fence on each side of the track of the height and strength of a line fence.\nAgain, in the proviso at the end of sub-section one of section 194, there is an indication that the object is to protect, not the railway, but the owners of improved and occupied lands on each side of it. So long as such protection is afforded by a fence of the prescribed character there is no liability.\nAgain, by the same subsection, provision is made for cattle guards at highway crossings and the only kind of cattle guard required is one suitable and sufficient to prevent cattle from going on the railway, another clear indication that the object of the section was the prevention of injury to the property of the adjacent owner.\nSubsection three strongly indicates the same motive. The only penalty for breach of the requirements in regard to fences and cattle guards is that in the event of the company\u2019s neglect, the company shall be liable to the owner, not for all damage which may happen to him or to his property, but only for the damage which he may suffer on account of animals killed or injured by the company\u2019s trains or engines.\nIf it was the duty of the company to erect its fences on the exact limit of its \u201cright of way,\u201d there would, I think be a clear indication of such intention and there would have been some penalty imposed for failure to perform such duty. All this, it seems to me, goes to shew that the intention of the legislature was not in any way to provide for the safety of the company\u2019s property or the company\u2019s servants, or for the delimitation of the respective lands of the company and the adjacent proprietor, but solely for the latter\u2019s protection in so far as the animals claimed by him or under him might be damaged through lack of the statutory requirements.\nIt seems to me that it is not necessary to look at the interpretation clause to ascertain the meaning of the word \u201crailway\u201d here. When it uses that word the presumption is that it uses it in its primary, ordinary sense. Everyone knows what the word \u201crailway\u201d ordinarily means; (\u201ca way on which a train passes by means of rails,\u201d a learned English judge described it in 1883; Doughty v. Firbank[5]); and it must receive that meaning unless there is some all-powerful necessity compelling a departure from it and justifying the addition of one or more or all the entities also specified. Besides, if the rules of interpretation compel us here to add the word \u201cproperty\u201d converting the substantive \u201crailway\u201d into an adjective, qualifying the word \u201cproperty\u201d are we not equally bound to add all its neighbouring words, and to conclude that the obligation of fencing extends to stations, depots, wharves, bridges, and all other structures the building of which is within the company\u2019s powers.\nTo enlarge; if the plaintiff\u2019s contention is the correct one, all the company\u2019s property wheresoever situate, whether there is a railway track on it or not, and irrespective of the purposes for which it may be used, must be fenced. This burden will cover the depots and station houses, freight sheds and all other erections upon its lands no matter how inconvenient or detrimental to the public such fencing may be. It will cover its magnificent Victoria Bridge and all bridges across streams and lakes whether navigable or not navigable as well. What has generally been supposed to be the paramount right of a ship-owner, the right of navigation through navigable waters, must give way, as well as those rights over floatable streams which, in Ontario at least, have been secured to the public by other statutes. Tunnels too must come within the operation of the rule as well as those enormous structures of masonry high above the adjacent houses which one sees in large cities both in the old world and the new, upon the crown of which the railway tracks are laid and the railway operations carried on.\nI say the railway Act cannot be construed so as to give colour to a demand involving such a useless and insensate expenditure. The true view as to the use to be made of the interpretation clauses is, I think, well stated in Hardcastle, (2 ed.) at page 236, as follows:\nAn interpretation clause * * * is not to be taken as substituting one set of words for another, or as strictly defining what the meaning of the term must be under all circumstances, but rather as declaring what may be comprehended within the term where the circumstances require that it should be comprehended. If therefore, an interpretation clause gives an extended meaning to a word, it does not follow as a matter of course that, if the word is used more than once in the Act, it is on each occasion used in the extended meaning, and it may always be a matter of argument whether or not the interpretation clause is to apply to the word used in the particular clause of the Act which is under consideration.\nVide also cases there cited.\nOther sections of the Railway Act aid us, I think, in coming to the conclusion that the legislature never contemplated the imposition of the burden referred to.\nSection 90 specifies certain general powers which the company may exercise, and among them, it has the right;\u2014(g), to construct across or over any river, stream or watercourse, permanent embankments, acqueducts, bridges, arches, etc.;\u2014(h), to divert or alter, as well temporarily as permanently, the course of any stream, river or watercourse, in order to carry the same under the railway.\nSection 91 provides that, if in the course of the construction of a railway, a river, stream or watercourse has been diverted or altered, it shall be restored as nearly as possible to its former state so as not materially to impair its usefulness.\nSections 178 and 179, the one providing that no company shall cause any obstruction in or impede the free navigation of any river or stream across which its railway is carried, and the other in substance, that where the railway is carried across any navigable river, the company shall leave open certain spaces between the bridge piers and shall erect such swing or other bridges over the river\u2019s channel as the Governor General in Council may direct, both indicate that in such cases the idea of fencing was wholly foreign to the mind of the legislature.\nThese provisions of the Railway Act and the considerations to which I have referred lead, I think, to the inevitable conclusion that fencing is necessary only upon each side of the company\u2019s road-bed where such fencing will protect the land owners from danger or injury by the engines or trains of a railway to any of the land owner\u2019s cattle which, otherwise, might stray thereon, and that where the fence is properly attached to the piers of a bridge crossing a watercourse so as effectually to prevent access of the cattle to the roadway above, the bridge piers and the bridge itself must be deemed to be sufficient fencing, and that in case of navigable streams at least, no fencing at all was ever contemplated or was necessary. If this view of the case be the correct one, then the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover wholly fails. No negligence or breach of statutory duty can be imputed to the railway company, and the plaintiff\u2019s remedy, if any, must be against his lessors, or the persons through whose negligence the accident happened.\nIt may be advisable, however, that I refer to another point to which reference was made at the argument. The plaintiff rested his whole case according to the statement of claim upon the company\u2019s neglect to erect and maintain proper fences across the watercourse on both sides of the culverts. No claim was made by reason of the alleged defective cowcatchers on each side of the highway where it crosses the railway track. Leave was, however, given at the trial to add a paragraph setting up the insufficiency of these guards. During the course of the trial, counsel for the defendant contended that the company\u2019s liability depended upon the correctness of the plaintiff\u2019s claim as to the fencing across the watercourse, admitting that, if that contention was right the company was liable, and it was thereupon, as I read the case, admitted in substance that the horses got through the south field to the north field through a culvert, and that there was no one in charge when they got upon the highway, and it was thereupon agreed that no evidence should be given as to the sufficiency or insufficiency of the cattle guards. Evidence was, however, given subsequently upon that point.\nThe learned trial judge did not, I suppose, in view of the admission that was made, pass upon that question, but as there might be some question as to this, it is, I think, well here to state, which I think counsel for the plaintiff admitted at the trial, that in my view the question as to the cattle guards cannot be raised. This, I think, necessarily follows from section 271 above cited. The horses in question were admitted to be at large upon the highway within half a mile of its intersection with the line of railway. They were in charge of no one so as to prevent their loitering or stopping on the highway at the point of intersection. It was at that point they were killed and the owner has not therefore any right of action by reason of such killing. This point was expressly decided in the case of Nixon v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co.[6], and as I understand the judgment of the court below the soundness of the judgment of the late Mr. Justice Rose in that case was not called in question.\nThe result is that the appeal is allowed and judgment shall be entered for the defendant with costs incurred in the courts below. Pursuant, however, to the undertaking contained in the order of the court below allowing this appeal, the respondent is entitled to the costs of this appeal, each party to have the right of set-off and the party in whose favour the balance of costs is found to have execution therefor.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014Concurred.\nAppeal allowed with costs to respondent as directed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: John Bell.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Teetzel, Harrison & Lewis.\n[1] 1 Ont.

The questions arising on this appeal are stated in the judgments reported.\nBelcourt K.C and Perron for the appellant. The affidavit was received, as appears by the jurat before a firm of prothonotaries who do not constitute a moral person capable of administering or receiving oaths in judicial proceedings. Art. 23 C. P. Q. The affidavit is not in conformity with 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 20, sec. 3, because the petitioner uses in his affidavit the words c contestation d'\u00e9lection\" instead of the words \" p\u00e9tition d'\u00e9lection,\" and has sworn merely that the contestation of election is true to the best of his knowledge and does not conform to the statute which gives the form of affidavit and exacts that the \"petitioner should swear that the allegations of the election petition are true.\nNo copy of the petition certified by the prothonotary as required by law was served on the appellant ; the copy served as well as that of the procedure accompanying it was certified by \"Grignon & Fortier, prothonotary, etc.\", who have no right, as a firm, to certify judicial proceedings. Further, there has been no sufficient proof made of the quality of the petitioner as an elector, as required by R. S. C. ch 9, sec. 5. Richelieu Election Case ([1]); Macdonald Election Case (2).\nThe petition was served in the office of the prothonotory of the Superior Court, and in the presence of one of the prothonotaries who was then acting during the vacation in the place and stead of the judge. This service was contrary to Art. 147 0. P. Q.\nBeaudin K.C. for the respondent cited The Lunenburg Election Case ([2]) Macdonald Election Case ([3]) * Mercier v.

Canada.\" If article 147 C. P. Q. could apply, respondent has not, under Art. 174, alleged and proved prejudice.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an appeal by the sitting member against a judgment dismissing his preliminary objections to a petition against the return.\nFour objections to the judgment of the court below are raised by the appeal. Two were dismissed on the hearing and one was abandoned. There only remains to be considered he objection numbered three which is that the petitioner has not proved his quality.\"\nThe petitioner filed the petition in the character of a voter, or, in the words of the statute \"as a person who had a right to vote at the election.\" The appellant by his preliminary objections denied the petitioner's status as a person having a right to vote. It was therefore incumbent on the petitioner to prove his right.\nThe petitioner established by his evidence that his name appeared on the voters' list used at the election by the production of a certified copy of that list returned to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery; see Dominion Evidence Act 56 Vict. ch. 31 secs. 13 & 14; and which copy moreover appears to be an imprint emanating from the Queen's Printer, which of course under the law as it now stands required no verification beyond the statement appearing on its face that it was issued by the Queen's Printer. 61 Vict. ch. 14 sec. 10, subsec. 5. This was amply sufficient and the objection is therefore nothing less than frivolous. The appeal is dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J\u2014All the objections taken by the appellant have been abandoned or dismissed instanter at the hearing except the one concerning the proof of the election list, which, in my opinion, is as frivolous as the other ones.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs. It is one clearly taken only for delay.\nGWYNNE J. \u2014 This is an appeal from a judgment dismissing preliminary objections filed to an election petition.\nThe petition was filed in the office of the prothonotary of the Superior Court of the District of Terrebonne having at the foot of it an affidavit the jurat to which was as follows :\nAsserment\u00e9 devant nous \u00e0 St-Scholastique dans le district de Terre-bonne ce quinzi\u00e8me jour de d\u00e9cembre mil neuf cent.\nGRIGNON & FORTIER,\nProtonotaire de la cour superieure dans et pour le district de Terrebonne.\nAt the same time a copy of the petition was left with the prothonotary to be forwarded to the returning officer pursuant to the statute, which, copy was on the same day mailed to the address of the returning officer\nIt may here be observed that it is not disputed that in point of fact the petitioner was sworn to the truth of the matters alleged in the affidavit by one or other of the two gentlemen named respectively Grignon and Fortier, or that they jointly are prothonotary or prothonotaries of the Superior Court of the District of Terrebonne.\nThe preliminary objections are contained in twenty-two paragraphs in the 18th of which the defendant alleges\nthat the petitioner did not appear upon the list of the electors of the Electoral District of Two Mountains at the time of the election in this cause.\nThis objection is again repeated thus in paragraph 21.\nThe petitioner in this cause has not and had not a right to vote at the election which is in question in the present cause. That he is not inscribed as an elector upon the electoral list which was used at the said election.\nIn the 19th and 20th paragraphs the respondent in the petition complained that the petitioner had lost, if he ever had the right to vote at said election by reason of the committal by him of divers acts of bribery and corrupt practices said to have been committed by him both before and during the election.\nIt is not perhaps now necessary to inquire whether the charges alleged in these paragraphs which appear to aim at converting a petition against a sitting member to avoid his election upon charges made of bribery and corruption into an indictment against the petitioner upon charges of bribery and corrupt practices alleged to have been committed by him constitute proper matter to be inquired into by way of preliminary objection to an election petition, because the defendant although given the most ample, opportunity for proof failed to establish any of the charges alleged and the learned judge who adjudicated upon the preliminary objections has so adjudged and determined, and no suggestion of any ground of appeal against such judgment has been made before us or in the appellant's factum on appeal.\nThe whole gist and substance of the objections alleged in the other paragraphs of the preliminary objections are thus comprised and summed up in paragraphs 22 and 23.\n22. The intimation of the said election petition and of the notice of its presentation\u2014of the certificate of deposit of security\u2014of the appearance and election of domical of the petitioner's advocate\u2014of the appointment of the petitioner's attorney made to the defendant is irregular, illegal and null, inasmuch as the said intimation was made to him in the office of the clerk of the 'Superior Court for the Province of Quebec, in the District of Terrebonne, during office hours, in presence of the prothonotary of the said court then acting as such prothonotary in vacation, in the absence of the judge of the said court for the said district.\n23. In consequence no intimation of the petition and of the notice of presentation of the said election petition\u2014of the security and the other proceedings in this cause has been made to the defendant.\nThe defendant pr6duces in support of his preliminary objections the following exhibits ;\u2014\n1. A copy of the election petition and of the affidavit at the foot thereof;\n2. A copy of the certificate of deposit of security ;\n3. A'copy of the appointment of petitioner's attorney ;\n4. The appearance and election of domicil of the petitinner's advocate ;\nand the preliminary exceptions thus conclude.\nFor all the reasons above mentioned the defendant concludes to dismiss the petition with costs.\nIt thus appears upon the defendant's own shewing that in point of fact he was served with the above several documents and it was further shown in evidence that the election petition with, the affidavit at the foot thereof was presented and filed in the prothonotary's office on the 15th December, 1900, and a copy delivered to the prothonotary to forward and which was forwarded by him by post on the same day to the returning officer and the defendant's sole contention was that by reason of alleged irregularity in the manner in which the signature of the prothonotaries appeared on the affidavit and the other papers and proceedings filed and certified by Grignon & Fortier, prothonotaries of the Superior Court, & were all null and void and nullified the petition which was filed. The learned judge before whom the matter of the preliminary objections was heard adjudged and determined that the petitioner had established. his status of a petitioner who had a right to vote at the election and to file the election petition filed in the cause, and as to the several objections of alleged irregularities relied upon by the defendant as constituting nullities he adjudged and determined that they were not well founded in law and so he dismissed the preliminary objections. From this judgment the present appeal is taken and in the argument before us in so far as relates to the alleged irregularities relied upon as constituting nullities the contention of the appellant was limited to the fact of the affidavit having the jurat subscribed with the names \"Grignon & Fortier, protonotaire,\" &c., &c. and the fact of other papers served on defendant being similarly signed. The fact that the petitioner had made oath to the matter alleged in the petition before one of the two gentlemen who jointly fill the office of prothonotary of the Superior Court of the District of Terrebonne not being disputed the objection taken that the one who administered the affidavit had subscribed the jurat with the name of \" Grignon & Fortier, protonotaire,\" &c, &c, can amount at most to an irregularity and. one which it would be competent for the court to cause to be amended; the objection, in truth, if a good one in the opinion of the court was attributable to the officer of the court for which the petitioner should, not be made to suffer. Such an objection, should be made by an ordinary motion in court like any ordinary motion upon the ground of irregularity committed in the progress of a cause and not as a preliminary objection which calls in question the validity and very existence of the petition. Upon such a motion being made I cannot think that any court or judge could hesitate in directing the jurat to be amended (if the signing the j6int name of the prothonotaries was unauthorised by the practice of the Superior Court) by that one who had administered the oath subscribing his own name to the jurat nunc pro tunc, so as to avoid stifling an inquiry into the grave charges in the election petition.\nAs to the petitioner's status the appellant's contention simply is that the evidence given by the petitioner of his status was not legal evidence at all his contention being, that the only legal evidence of status is a certified copy by the clerk of the Crown in Chancery of the list or copy of list actually used at the election. This contention he makes upon the assumed authority of the Richelieu Election Case([15]) but no such point was decided by the court in that case ; all that was decided was, that a certified copy by the clerk of the Crown in Chancery of the list returned to him by the revising officer as the list finally revised by him constitutes no evidence at all of a petitioner's status, and that such status can be proved only by the petitioner's name appearing as a voter on the list actually used at the election. Then in the Winnipeg Election Case ([16]), this court held that a certified copy by the clerk of the Crown in Chancery of the list or copy of list returned to him by the returning officer at an election as the actual list used at the election is sufficient prim\u00e2facie evidence of the list used at the election and so a sufficient compliance with the judgment in the Richelieu Election Case ([17]) The appellant relies upon these two cases, and the respondent does not at all question their authority in the present case, but neither the Richelieu case nor any other case has ever held that original ' public documents of which for convenience of proof a copy certified by a public officer in charge of the original may be made by statute prim\u00e2 facie evidence, when themselves produced constitute no evidence. The originals themselves do of course when produced constitute the best evidence.\nThe respondent in point of fact, ex abundanti cautela produced a plethora of evidence of his status as a petitioner. He called the Secretary Treasurer who under the Provincial law made the voters' list which under the Dominion Franchise Act now in force 61 Vict, ch 14 constitutes the voters' list in force at Dominion elections at the polling division in question He produced the original list prepared by him and retained in his possession under Art. 185, R. S. Q. He also proved that he transmitted a duplicate original of that list to the Registrar of the County of Terrebonne as required by Art. 303, R. S. Q. The registrar was called and he produced that list and proved that he had transmitted a copy of it to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery as required by the Dominion Statute 61 Vict. ch. 14.\nThe Clerk of the Crown in Chancery was called and produced the copy of list as transmitted to him and he proved that he had transmitted it to the Queen's Printer to be printed by him as required by sec. 10 s.s. 5 of 61 Vict. ch. 14 and had received back the copy so sent to the printer together with a number of printed copies. He also proved, that immediately upon the issue of the writ of election for the election in question he transmitted to the returning officer for the District of Terrebonne two of the said printed lists of voters so received from the Queen's Printer for every polling division in 'his district, including the polling division in question. It was not disputed that these lists so transmitted to the returning officer were authenticated by the imprint of the Queen's Printer as provided in sec. 10 s.s. 6 of 61 Vict. ch. 14.. He also produced the very list which had been returned to him by the returning officer as the one actually used at the election in question. Of the two printed lists which had been so transmitted to him by the Clerk of the Crown for the polling division in question he produced the one which he had retained in his own possession and by marks in his own handwriting on the list pr\u00f3duced by the Clerk of the Crowni as the one returned to him as the one used at the election he identified that list to be the very one he had sent to the deputy returning officer to be used, and finally the poll clerk by marks in his handwriting on that list also identified it as the very one which had been used at the election. It was not disputed that all of these lists in so far as related to the polling division in question corresponded with each other and contained the petitioner's name thereon as a voter, and his identity with the person of his naine on the list was established by evidence. Thus the status of the petitioner was established in the most perfect manner possible. The appeal therefore must be dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK GIROUARD and DAVIES JJ. concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant : J.L.

JUSTICE BELANGER\nControverted election\u2014preliminary objections status of petitioner\u2014\u201461 V. c. 14 ; 63 & 64 V. c. 12 (D.)\u201459 V, c. 9. s. 272 (Que )\u2014Dominion franchise\u2014construction of statute.\nThe principal contention on preliminary objections to a controverted election petition was that the petitioner had been guilty of corrupt practices before and during the election, and that, by the effect of the statutes 61 Vict. ch. 14 and 63 & 64 Vict. ch. 12, the Dominion Franchise Act was repealed and the provisions of the \" Quebec Elections Act\" regulating the franchise in the Province of Quebec substituted therefor so as. thereby, to deprive the petitioner of a right to vote under 59 Vict. ch. 9, sec. 272, and being so deprived of a vote that he had no status as petitioner. In the Election Court, evidence was taken on issues joined and the judge, holding that no corrupt practice upon the part of the petitioner had been proved, dismissed the preliminary objections. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada ;\nHeld, that, as corrupt practices had not been proved, the question as to the effect of the statutes did not arise.\nPer Gwynne amendment to the Dominion Franchise Act by 61 Vict. ch. 14 (D.) and 63 & 64 Vict. ch. 12 (D.) has not introduced into that Act the provisions of section 272 of \"The Quebec Elections Act\" so as to deprive a person properly on the list of voters for a Dominion election of his right to vote at such election.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of His Lordship Mr. Justice B\u00e9langer dismissing the preliminary objections to the petition against the return of the appelllant as member for the Electoral District of Beauharnois in the House of Commons of Canada.\nThe questions at issue upon this appeal are stated in the judgments reported.\nBelcourt K. C. for the appellant cited the statutes, and Rouville Election Case ([1]) Cunningham on Elections (3 ed.) p. 281.\nBisaillon K.C. and Laurendeau for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The preliminary objection in this case was to the status of the petitioner. It was said that he was a person not entitled to vote because he had been guilty of corrupt acts.\nThere was a long argument to shew that either under the new Franchise Act (which makes the law of Quebec the test of the right to vote at a Dominion election in that province) or under the Dominion Elections Act, a person guilty of corrupt practices cannot vote and consequently cannot maintain a petition against the return. All this argument as to the law, however, appears to me to be immaterial in the absence of evidence shewing that the petitioner, (the respondent in this appeal), was guilty of a corrupt act.\nFor this reason of the want of proof of the pretended ground of disqualification the preliminary objection was rightly dismissed by the court a quo and this appeal must be similarly dealt with.\nTASCHEREAU. J\u2014The petitioner-respondent alleges in his petition that he is an elector, who had a right to vote and has voted at the election to which the petition relates the Dominion election held on the 7th of November, 1900.\nThe appellant filed a preliminary objection on the ground that the respondent, during the said election, had been guilty of corrupt practices and had therefore no right to vote, and consequently no right to present this petition, as the statute gives the right to present an election petition exclusively to a person who has the right to vote.\nWe have, first, to see if, in fact, the appellant has proved that the respondent has committed the corrupt practices of which he accuses him. The question of law whether corrupt practices by a petitioner disentitle him ipso facto, of the right to petition does not come up for our determination if this petitioner is not proved to have committed any. The Superior Court found, as a fact that he had not. I am of opinion, that the appellant has failed to establish that this finding is wrong. The charge in his bill of particulars upon which he seems to rely more specially is that the respondent, two or three days before the election, promised some money to one Joseph Vall\u00e9e to induce him to vote for the candidate Bergeron and did in fact later on give him two dollars. Not Joseph but one Fran\u00e7ois Vall\u00e9e was brought as witness for the appellant to prove that charge. Now, suffice it to say that the judge who heard this witness entirely rejects his testimony as unworthy of belief. Moreover, the bill of particulars does not mention Fran\u00e7ois Vall\u00e9e's name, and this evidence should not have been received. The charge as to one Bougie is also not mentioned in the bill of particulars And Roch Sauv\u00e9, a witness brought by the appellant, entirely fails to prove that respondent committed a corrupt practice by treating any of the electors. The witnesses Emile Boyer and Dominique Lecompte prove nothing whatever against the respondent. These are the only cases relied upon before us by the appellant. The Superior Court could not but find the respondent not guilty of the charges brought against him.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs\nGWYNNE J\u2014This appeal arises upon an election petition to which the defendant filed divers preliminary objections which have been dismissed and from the judgment dismissing them this appeal is taken.\nThe petitioner in his petition alleged that his name was inscribed as a voter upon the electoral list used at the last election held in the electoral district of Beauharnois in the Province of Quebec of a member of the House of Commons, to represent the constituency of that electoral district * that he was an elector qualified and having the right to vote, and as such did vote at the said election ; and the petitioner prayed that the return of the respondent as the member elected at the said election should be set aside and declared to be null and void by reason of the respondent having been, as was alleged in the petition, guilty of divers numerous acts of bribery and corrupt practices mentioned in the petition. The point raised by the appeal is a wholly novel one, insisting in fact, that by force of the recent change in the law affected by the. Dominion Franchise Act, 61 Vict. ch. 14, and the Dominion Election Act, 63, & 64, Vict. ch. 12, the power of defendants in an election petition to raise by way of preliminary objections thereto, questions of a wholly new character is extended in an unlimited degree. The point having been almost the sole point discussed in the appeal before us and having been pressed upon us by the learned counsel for the appellant with the greatest earnestness and persistency, and as the point is one of very considerable importance as effecting in the future election petitions, and the right now claimed for defendants to meet them by filing preliminary objections being of a novel character, I think we should dispose of the appeal upon the point so pressed upon us, even at the risk of being deemed to treat the case at greater length then may be thought absolutely necessary for the disposal of the appeal.\nThe respondent met the petition by filing a long list of preliminary objections.\nIn the fifth he alleges :\nThat before, during and after the said election, the petitioner directly and indirectly by his agents and other persons acting for him \u2022 and in his name, has made gifts, loans, offers, promises and agreements with electors and with other persons with intent to induce electors to support and to Undertake to sport hi8 election and with intent to obtain the votes of electors at the said election, and especially to Joseph Vall\u00e9e an elector and labourer of Salaberry de Valleyfield.\nNow not to dwell upon a fact which appears upon perusal of the objections, namely, that some of them are framed as if the petitioner was himself the opposing candidate at the election, notably that which I have above quoted, and also some of the others, it is to be observed that the objections relate to acts which are by 68 & 64 Vict. ch. 12 declared to constitute indictable offences which upon conviction are punishable some with fine and imprisonment some by fine alone, or by a liability to pay a sum of money by way of forfeiture to any one who shall sue therefor, as a penalty imposed by the act, and it is to be observed that the objections are stated in the most general terms possible (much in the form which, I think it is much to be regretted has been sanctioned by practice in election petitions), charging the petitioner with having c committed all and every one of the acts of corruption defined and prohibited by the law \", and thus enumerating all of the offences of every description which are mentioned in secs 108 to 118 both, inclusively and which, are all made indictable offences punishable severally upon convection in the manner prescribed in the Act. The only attempt at assigning a particular specific act as having been committed by the petitioner is that alleged in the objection above quoted, which is framed as if the petitioner himself had been an opposing candidate, and the offence charged involves the indictable offences of bribery punishable upon conviction by fine and imprisonment'.\nBesides being made indictable offences and punish\" able on conviction all the acts alleged are made in-quirable into upon the trial of an election petition, calling in question the validity of the election, and upon being proved to the satisfaction of the court or judge to have been committed by a candidate or any agent of his the election may be declared void and in some cases a candidate may be disqualified, but no such judgment or finding of the court or judge trying the election petition subjects any person other than a candidate who may have been the person who actually committed the offence so proved to any penalty whatever imposed by the statute on such person.\nSection 129 of the Act attaches to convections for corrupt practices, of whatever description they may be, of which a party is found guilty a very severe penalty in addition to the fine or imprisonment or both, prescribed by the Act for the particular offence, charged. By that section it is enacted that;\nEvery person other than a candidate found guilty of any corrupt practice in any proceeding in which after notice of the charge he has had an opportunity of being heard) shall during the eight years next, after the time at which he is found guilty be incapable of being elected to and of sitting in the House of Commons and of voting at any election of a member of the House of Common's or of holding any office in the nomination of the Crown or of the Governor General of Canada.\nThen section 140 enacts that: Whenever it appears to the court or judge trying an election petition that any person has violated, any of the provisions of this Act for which violation such person is subjected to a fine or penalty (other than fine or imprisonment imposed for any offence amounting to an indictable offence) such court or judge may order that such person shall be summoned to appear before such court or judge at the place, day and hour fixed in such summons for hearing such charge.\nAnd by section 141 it is enacted that :\nNotwithstanding anything in the Criminal Code 1892, no indictment for corrupt practices shall be tried before any court of Quarter Sessions or General Sessions of the Peace.\nThere is nothing in the Act which expresses any intention of Parliament to subject the offences charged in the objections filed by way of preliminary objections to inquiry thereinto as preliminary objections under the statute to an election petition. On the contrary the precise provisions of the Act by which alone a party other than a candidate shall be found guilty of such offences and subjected to the penalties of every description imposed by the statute, in my opinion, exclude all ideas of the accusation of such offences as committed by a petitioner affording a good ground of preliminary objection.\nIt is contented however that, (notwithstanding the precise provisions of the Act to which I have adverted) the Dominion Parliament has by implication introduced into the Dominion Franchise Act 61 Vict ch 14 a clause of an act of the legislature of the Province of Quebec which has the effect of subjecting the petitioner to an election petition to having accusations by way of preliminary objections, made against him of having committed the several offences alleged to the present case, and to having them inquired into and adjudicated upon as and by way of preliminary objections to any further proceedings on the petition.\nThe argument is that as by 61 Vict. ch. 14, it is enacted that for the purpose of a Dominion election held within the limits of the province the qualifications necessary to entitle any person to vote thereat shall be those established by the laws of that province as necessary to entitle such person to vote in the same part of the province at a provincial election, and that as by a provincial statute of Quebec, 59 Vict. ch. 9, sec. 272 it is enacted :\nTout \u00e9lecteur qui \u00e0 une election a commis une acte constituent une man\u0153uvre \u00e9lectorale quelconque d\u00e9fendue par la pr\u00e9sente loi, ou a \u00e9t\u00e9 partie \u00e0 la commission d'un tel acte est ipso facto priv\u00e9 du droit de voter a cette \u00e9lection.\nThen the argument is that as by 37 Vict. ch. 10 sec. 7 (D.), the only persons competent to present an an election petition are\n1st. A person who had.a right to vote at the election to which the petition relates ; and 2nd. A candidate at such election. And, by reason of the 272nd sec. of the Provincial Act 59 Vict. ch. 9, being as it is contended incorporated into the Dominion Franchise Act, it is contended that upon proof upon trial of the preliminary objections that the petitioner committed some or one of the acts of bribery and corrupt practices charged in the preliminary objections, he loses his status as a petitioner, notwithstanding that it is not disputed that he was qualified to be and was entered upon the electoral list in force at the election as a voter thereat and that upon his applying at the election for his ballot paper he was given one and that he voted thereon without his right to vote being disputed, and without his being asked to take the oath which by the Dominion law he was bound to take under penalty of forfeiting his vote if he did not.\nWhat should be the construction of the section of the Quebec statute above mentioned, if it was, as is contended, incorporated into the Dominion Franchise Act, and whether it could be given the construction as contended by the appellant in view of the provisions of the Dominion Acts to which I have referred, I do not propose to inquire, for in my opinion the contention that it is so incorporated is not well founded. Under the Dominion Franchise Act now in force, 61 Vict. ch. 14, the qualifications necessary to entitle any person to vote at a Dominion election save as otherwise is provided by that Act and also by the Dominion Elections Act 63 & 64Vict, ch 12 are those established by the law of the province in which the election is held as necessary to entitle such person to vote in the same part of the province at a provincial election.\nBy article 177 R. S. Q. the secretary-treasurer of every municipality is required to make a list in duplicate of all persons who, according to the valuation roll then in force in the municipality for local purposes, appear to be electors by reason of real estate possessed or occupied by them within the municipality, in any manner specified in article 173.\nProvision is then made for the revision and correction of such list. Article 208 then enacts that every such list when put in force as prescribed in the Act shall, during the whole period in which it remains in force be deemed the only true list of electors with in the electoral district The law then provides for one of those duplicate original lists being retained on record by the municipality and for the other to be registered in the registry office of the registration division in which the municipality is situate Then by 61 \"Vict ch 14 sec 5 s.s.c, it is enacted that the voters lists used at a Dominion election shall be those prepared for and in force under the laws of the province for the purpose of provincial elections, and in sec. 10 of the same Act it is enacted that within ten days after the final revision of every list of voters for the purpose of provincial elections it shall be the duty of the custodian thereof to transmit to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery a copy of such list certified under the hand of such custodian. Then in s.s. 2 of the same section it is enacted that for the purposes of Dominion elections such certified cow shall be deemed to be the original and legal list of voters for the polling division for which the list of which it is a copy was prepared, so long as that list remains in force, subject however to such changes and additions as are subsequent to revision made in such' lists under the provisions of the provincall law. Then by s.s. 3 it is made the duty of the clerk of the Crown in Chancery to cause such certified copy to be printed by the Queen's Printer Then by sub sec 6 it is enacted that all voters lists so printed by the Queen's Printer shall be authenticated by his imprint in the same manner as other Parliamentary documents, and every copy of a voters list bearing such imprint, shall be deemed to beffore all purposes an anthentic copy of the original list of record in the office of the clerk of the Crown in Chancey Now from these sections it is abundantly apparent that subject to certain provisions specified in the Act and in 63 & 64Vict. ch. 14, the sole test of the qualification of a person to vote at a Dominion election, and to be a petitioner in an election petition to avoid any such election is his being entered as a qualified voter upon the list of voters which by the above sections is declared to be and to be deemed to be \"the original and legal list\" and \"the only true list\" of voters within the electoral district.\nSection 6 of 61 Vict. ch. 14 then enumerates several descriptions or classes of persons who though they may be. disqualified by the provincial law from being entered on the provincial list of voters though otherwise qualified shall not be disqualified from voting at Dominion elections, and sec. 2 provides how such persons, although not on the list shall be admitted to vote at a Dominion election. Then 63 & 64 Vict. ch. 12, sections 7, 8, 9, 65, 68,126 and 129 designate divers persons and classes of persons who having the qualification entitling them to be and being entered on the provincial voters lists shall be disqualified from exercising their franchise at a Dominion election. The Dominion Parliament has itself designated every person and every class of persons who although not entered upon the provincial lists as qualified electors at provincial elections shall be qualified to vote at a Dominion election, and in like manner every person and every class of persons who although qualified to be, and as such being, entered upon the provincial lists shall nevertheless be disqualified from exercising their franchise at a Dominion election. The Dominion Parliament has plainly reserved to itself the right of determining what persons., if any, who are entered upon a provincial list as duly qualified electors at a provincial election, shall nevertheless be disqualified from exercising their franchise at a Dominion election, and no provincial Act can qualify that right in any the slightest degree. Sec. 272 of the Quebec Act 59 Vict. ch. 9 has therefore it is clear no operation whatever in the present case.\nThe parties proceeded as appears to trial of the facts alleged in the preliminary objections before having the question as to the sufficiency in point of law of the objections determined, and no evidence was offered in support of any of the objections, save only of that contained in that paragraph which I have above quoted, namely, a charge of bribing Joseph Vall\u00e9e therein mentioned. The learned trial judge discredited the evidence offered in support of that charge and he declared that it was not proved and he dismissed the preliminary objections as well for their insufficiency in point of law as for the absence of proof in point of fact of the only charge in the objections upon which any evidence was offered. In my opinion the sole material question raised by, and argued in the appeal is as to the right of the defendant in the election petition to make the charges involved in the matters (asserted by way of preliminary objections to an election petition and I am of opinion that no such right exists. The appeal should, I think, for that reason be dismissed for evidence offered in support of objections or in objections not constituting good grounds to set up as preliminary objections is irrelevant and so inadmissible and should not be received. The main question here seems to be, as I have said, upon the sufficiency of the objections pleaded by any of the preliminary objections.\nSEDGEWICK, GIROUARD and DAVIES J J. concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant : L. J. Papineau.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J. G. Laurendeau.\n[1] Q. R. 13 S. C. 94.\n"}

J. Travers Lewis for the appellant. The Lisgar Election Case[2] which Mr. Justice Martin followed may be distinguished from this. There no copy of the petition was ever filed and the subsequent steps required by the statute were therefore not taken. In this case all those steps were taken and no prejudice has been suffered by the respondent. The learned counsel cited also Folkard v. Metropolitan Railway Co.[3]; Robertson v. Robertson[4]; Smith v. Baker[5].\nMcDougall for the respondent referred to Edwards v. Roberts[6]; North Ontario Election Case[7]; Noseworthy v. Buckland[8].\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The preliminary objection upon which the court below dismissed the petition was simply this, that whilst the petition was filed within forty days after the holding of the poll, a copy of the petition required by the English rules of court (made applicable by the Controverted Elections Act, 49 Vict. cap. 9, sec. 34) was not filed with the petition nor until the time limited for filing a petition had expired. The election was on the 6th of December, 1900. The petition was filed on the 15th of January, 1901, but a copy was not filed until the 17th or 18th day of January, 1901, the latter dates being subsequent to the expiration of the time for filing the petition.\nWith great respect for the opinions of those from whom I differed in the Lisgar case, I must say that I still adhere to all that I said in my judgment in that case. My views, however, did not prevail, and it was determined by the majority of the court that a noncompliance with the rule requiring the filing of a copy contemporaneously with the filing of the petition was a fatal omission.\nIt was suggested on the argument that this case could be distinguished from the Lisgar case for the reason that here a copy of the petition was filed two or three days subsequently to the petition, whilst in the Lisgar case no copy was ever filed, and it was said that the provision authorising the court or a judge to enlarge the time showed that the omission was not fatal.\nThe same argument as that put forward here, namely, that the rule in question was not imperative, was urged in the Lisgar case and as I thought then was well founded.\nI cannot, however, see that the subsequent filing of the copy distinguishes this case in principle from the Lisgar case, by which I am bound and which I must therefore reluctantly follow. Mr. Justice Martin's decision was correct and this appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. When the law says that the petition must be presented not later than forty days after the holding of the poll and that with that petition a copy thereof shall be left for the returning officer, it seems to me to be just as imperative to leave the copy within forty days, as it is to present the petition itself within that delay. Here, no copy was left during the forty days. The argument that whatever the length of time after the forty days the copy is filed the object of the law is accomplished and no prejudice is caused, is, in my opinion, not tenable. It might as well be contended that a petition may be filed after the forty days. The law says that both the petition and the copy shall be left with the clerk not later than forty days after the election.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I feel difficulty in concurring in the proposition that it is not competent or proper for this court to reverse a judgment of the court differently constituted if it clearly appear to be erroneous.\nThis court is not invested with the prerogative of finality as is the House of Lords whose judgments are the law of the land until and unless varied by Parliament. Nor is this court invested with the prerogative of infallibility so as to prevent its seeing error in one of its own judgments. Not being incompetent to perceive error if there be error in a judgment of the court it must, I think, be competent for it to correct such error if it clearly appear and it be in the interest of the due administration of justice that the error should be corrected.\nSEDGEWICK, GIROUARD and DAVIES JJ. concurred in the dismissal of the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Henry O.

Dugas (26 S. C. R. 20) followed.\nIn an action by the owner of adjoining property for damages thus caused the evidence was contradictory and the courts below gave effect to the testimony of scientific witnesses in preference to that of persons acquainted with the locality.\nHeld, Taschereau J. dissenting, that notwithstanding the concurrent findings of the courts below, as the witnesses were equally credible the evidence of those who spoke from personal knowledge of the facts ought to have been preferred to that of persons giving opinions based merely upon scientific observations.\nIn reversing the judgment appealed from, the Supreme Court, in the interest of both parties, assessed damages, once for all, at an amount deemed sufficient to indemnify the plaintiff for all injuries, past, present and future, resulting from the nuisance complained of, should she elect to accept the amount so estimated in full satisfaction thereof; otherwise, the record was ordered to be transmitted to the trial court to have the amount of damages determined APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Review, at Montreal, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court District of Montreal, which dismissed the plaintiffs action with costs.\nThe action was brought by the owner of a number of dwelling houses built upon land adjoining property upon which the company had built a large power-house equipped with powerful engines and a number of electric dynamos which were utilized for the production of the necessary motive power to operate the Montreal electric tramways authorised by the provincial legislation incorporating the company.\nThe evidence on the part of the plaintiff, (principally tenants who had occupied the dwellings) shewed, that the building of this power-house and the vibrations caused by working the machines placed therein, constituted a nuisance to plaintiff and to her tenants. Doors would be banged windows would rattle, stoves required to have their legs fastened to the floor r glasses would be shaken off sideboards and tables; tinware would jump around; the pans on stoves would clatter; the oil and the flame of lamps would be perceptibly agitated; plaster was shaken down; and the usual small articles of house furniture would be either broken or shaken into tormenting makers of noise. There was also almost constant trembling and jarring underfoot attended with shocks trying to the nervous system. The dwellings became uninhabitable and were gradually deserted on account of the smoke from the powerhouse the noise and the vibrations of the ground and of the houses.\nOn behalf of the respondent this evidence was to a great extent contradicted by persons living in the immediate neighbourho4d and by scientific witnesses who testified to the effect that they had failed to detect any vibration by means of their senses, or as the result of tests by means of extremely sensitive vibrometers and that the noise caused by the works was not of an extraordinary nature, but rather the contrary.\nThe trial court considered that the plaintiff\u2019s evidence had been rebutted and \"consid\u00e9rant que l'establisse-ment autoris\u00e9 de la d\u00e9fenderesse (r\u00e9pondent) n\u2019est donc que l'exercice d'un droit exclusif de toute faute et cons\u00e9quemment de toute responsabilit\u00e9,\" dismissed the action with costs.

As to the appreciation of the scientific testimony, see Crawford v. The City of Montreal ([10]).\nLafleur K.C. and Meredith K.C. for the respondent. There has been no nuisance proved for which any damages can be recovered; all the plaintiff's evidence has been fully rebutted by positive testimony of witnesses and instrumental tests made by scientific \"witnesses. In any case the power-house was lawfully erected and operated and necessary for the purpose of carrying on the business as authorized and in accordance with the powers conferred by the charter of incorporation, 49 & 50 Vict. c. 86, and 57 Vict. c. 73, (Que.), and by by-law 210 of the City of Montreal, and franchises and privileges conferred by law. In view of statutory authority the respondents are entitled to the power-house and to carry on the works complained of The appliances used and the mode of construction are both necessary and proper and, as it has not been proved that the power-house has been erected negligently or that the works carried on in it have been attended with any neglect, there is no responsibility on the part of the company.\nWe rely upon the following authorities: \u2014 Port Glasgow and Newark Sailcloth Co, v.

Baker ([17]).\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by\nGIROUARD J.\u2014Il s'agit dans cet appel plut\u00f4t d'une question de fait que de droit, bien que sur le droit le jugement, qui n'est accompagn\u00e9 d'aucunes notes, ne nous semble pas clair et m\u00eame sur le fait, nous sommes clairement d'opinion qu'il est erron\u00e9. Le jugement de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure, (Tellier, J.) qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la cour de r\u00e9vision \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, (Gill, J. dissident), admet que le propri\u00e9taire de toute usine est responsable des dommages que sa construction ou son fonctionnement peut causer aux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s voisines, soit en les d\u00e9gradant, soit en les \u00e9branlant, soit en les affectant d'odeurs malsaines ou de fum\u00e9es nuisibles, soit en produisant des vibrations, bruits ou autres inconveniens, les bornes du bon voisinage.\nCe principe, \u00e9tabli par une jurisprudence constante en France, vient d'\u00eatre d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 par M. le juge Blanchet, parlant au nom de la cour d'appel, dans une autre esp\u00e8ce qui, \u00e0 en juger par les observations du savant juge, doit \u00eatre analogue \u00e0 celle-ci, si l'on consid\u00e8re qu'il s'agissait d'une action en dommages intent\u00e9e contre l'intim\u00e9e par un deuxi\u00e8me voisin au sujet de la m\u00eame usine; je fais allusion \u00e0 la cause de Felix Gareau v. The Montreal Street Railway Co. ([18]) d\u00e9cid\u00e9e le 18 janvier 1901. Cette cour a fait l'application du m\u00eame principe dans Drysdale v. Dugas, ([19])\nL'intim\u00e9e a soutenu en sus qu'\u00e9tant autoris\u00e9e par la l\u00e9gislature a exploiter un chemin de fer \u00e9lectrique dans la cite de Montr\u00e9al et ses environs elle est par la m\u00eame autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 manufacturer de l'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 sans aucune restriction de temps ou de lieu, et sans responsabilit\u00e9 pour dommages, s'il n'y a n\u00e9gligence de sa part. il ne peut en \u00eatre ainsi en face du Code Civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, quelque soit le droit Anglais sur le sujet. Une corporation n'est pas un \u00eatre privil\u00e9gi\u00e9; c'est, disent les articles 352 et 356 C.C., une personne morale ou fictive r\u00e9gie par les lois affectant les individues, et par cons\u00e9quent r\u00e9pondant de son fait comme eux, sauf les privil\u00e8ges sp\u00e9ciaux conf\u00e8res par sa charte. C'est la doctrine que la cour d'appel de Qu\u00e9bec vient de consacrer, et nous ne croyons pas que, dans la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce les tribunaux inf\u00e9rieures aient decide autrement, bien que les consid\u00e9rants ne soient parfaitement clairs \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Ii est indubitable que l\u2019intim\u00e9e jouit de privil\u00e8ges sp\u00e8ciaux sur les rues publiques, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s riveraines, mais ce point ne se pr\u00e9sente pas devant cette cour, pas plus qu'il ne s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 devant les tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs. Ils paraissent s'\u00eatre appuy\u00e9s sur l'appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve, qui suivant eux ne r\u00e9v\u00e8le rien qui d\u00e9passe la mesure des obligations ordinaires du bon voisinage, auxquelles tout le monde est tenu. Nous sommes d'un avis contraire.\nGrand nombre de t\u00e9moins out \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus de part et d'autre; l'appelante a fait entendre ses locataires et des personnes qui connaissaient les lieux avant et depuis la construction des usines.\nL'intim\u00e9e s'est fortement appuy\u00e9e sur des t\u00e9moignages scientifiques. Mais ils ne peuvent d\u00e9mentir les faits relat\u00e9s par les t\u00e9moins oculaires. Qu'il y ait eu vibrations et bruits et autres inconv\u00e9nients exc\u00e9dant la m\u00e9sure des obligations du voisinage, personne ne peut en douter, lorsque l'on apprend que l'\u00e9tablissement d'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e, appel\u00e9 le \" Power House\" contient six machines \u00e0 vapeur d'une force de huit mille chevaux, et dont l'une, le \" Corliss engine \" p\u00e8se cent tonneaux et faisant 70 \u00e9volutions \u00e0 la minute; en sus dix-huit dynamos \u00e9lectriques. Toutes ces machines fonctionnent sur un sol mou jour et nuit, plus ou moins, suivant que requis pour produire la force motrice n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la circulation des chars \u00e9lectriques, non seulement en la cite de Montr\u00e9al, mais aussi dans la banlieue. Ses deux chemin\u00e9es, dont l'une de 255 pieds de hauteur, surmontent des fournaux qui con-summent de 30000 \u00e0 40000 tonnes de charbon par an. Enfin c'est dit-on le plus puissant et le plus consid\u00e9rable \u00e9tablissement de ce genre en Am\u00e9rique. L'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e n'a pas Pu s'emp\u00eacher d'admettre \u00e0 l'audience devant nous que cet \u00e9tablissement gigantesque causait quelques vibrations \u00e0 la propret\u00e9 de l'appelante. De quel droit peut-elle produire ces vibrations, m\u00eame l\u00e9g\u00e8res, qui proviennent non de la voie publique, mais d'une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e? Qu'on remarque bien que les logements de l'appelante ont \u00e9t\u00e9 b\u00e2tis \u00e0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 la localit\u00e9 formait un quartier de r\u00e9sidences d'ouvriers, \u00e0 quelques distance du district industriel.\nReste la question du montant des dommages.\nLa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'apelante valait $8,000 elle est couverte de seize logements d'ouvriers, vieux il est vrai, mais lui rapportant environ de $1,000 par an de loyer qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9rablement r\u00e9duits par l'\u00e9tablissement de l'intim\u00e9e. Elle insiste qu'il n'v a pas eu de dommages avant l'institution de l'action, intent\u00e9e en 1894,\nM. le juge Gill \u00e9tait d'avis d'accorder $300 de ce chef seulement, savoir $200 pour d\u00e9pr\u00e9ciation de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et $100 pour pertes de loyer. Les t\u00e8moins Loignon et Aubry parlent de $2,000 et $2,200, mais ils comprennent \u00e9videmment des dommages soufferts apr\u00e8s l'action.\nNous croyons qu'il est de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des parties d'estimer ces dommages une fois pour toutes. Nous accordons donc \u00e0 l'apelante, si elle veut les accepter, $2,000 avec int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 compter de ce jour pour toute indemnit\u00e9, pass\u00e9e, pr\u00e9sente et future, provenant de la m\u00eame cause, et \u00e0 d\u00e9faut par elle de ce faire dans un mois de la pr\u00e9sente date nous ordonnons que le dossier soit transmis \u00e0 la cour sup\u00e9rieure du district de Montr\u00e9al afin d'y faire d\u00e9terminer et fixer suivant la loi le montant des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats demand\u00e9s.\nBans l'un ou l'autre cas, l'intim\u00e9e est condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 payer tous les frais encourus tant devant cette cour que devant les tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs. TASCHEREAU J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal, in my opinion, involves nothing but questions of fact, which the concurrent judgments of the two Provincial Courts have upon very contradictory evidence, found against the appellant. I fail to see anything in it to take it out of the well established jurisprudence upon appeals of this nature. In the Privy Council, such an appealwould be dismissed instanter. without calling on the respondent.\nHaving come to this conclusion, I have not to consider the question of law raised by the respondents here, and by the defendants in Hopkin v Hamitton Electric Light & Cataract Power Co.

Cooke v. Millar, (3 R. L. 446; 4 R. L. 240) referred to.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Bedford., declaring the peremption of the plaintiffs' action.\nThe circumstances under which the motion for p\u00e8remtion d'instance was made in this case sufficiently appear in the judgment reported.\nLAFLEUR K.C. for the appellants.\nRACICOT K.C. and DUFFY K.C. for the respondent.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014Le 9 juillet 1900, la d\u00e9fenderesse obtint du protonotaire un certificat constatant que le dernier acte de proc\u00e9dure dans la cause, d'apr\u00e8s les registres de la Cour, \u00e9tait en date du 30 juin 1898, et fit motion pour p\u00e9remption d'instance. Cette motion fut accord\u00e9e par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, dont le jugement fut subs\u00e9quemment confirm\u00e9 par la Cour d'Appel. La cause \u00e9tait pendante le 1er septembre 1897, lorsque le nouveau Code de Proc\u00e9dure limitant \u00e0 deux ans au lieu de trois, le d\u00e9lai pour p\u00e9remption est devenu en force. Est-ce le nouveau ou l'ancien Code qui s'y applique? C'est l\u00e0 la seule question que nous avons \u00e0 d\u00e9cider sur cet appel. Je suis d'avis avec les deux Cours de la province, que c'est le nouveau Code qui r\u00e9git, quand, comme dans l'esp\u00e8ce, le d\u00e9lai des deux ann\u00e9es a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 courir apr\u00e8s le 1er septembre 1897.\nLes instances pendantes tant qu'\u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure sont soumises aux lois actuellement en force eussent-elles \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9es subs\u00e9quemment \u00e0 leur introduction. Mais, dit l'appelant, le 4me par. de la sect. 1\u00e8re du nouveau Code de Proc\u00e9dure fait exception \u00e0 cette r\u00e8gle pour la p\u00e9remption d'instance. Ce paragraphe model\u00e9 sur l'article 2613 du Code Civil se lit comme suit:\nN\u00e9anmoins pour ce qui concorne les proc\u00e9dures mati\u00e8res et choses pendantes lors de la mise en vigueur de ce Code, ou les droits d'appel et les restrictions relatives a un droit mat\u00e9riel ant\u00e9rieurs cette mise en vigueur, et auxquels on ne pourrait en appliquer les dispositions sans produire un effet r\u00e9troactif, les dispositions de la loi qui sans ce Code, s'appliqueraient a ces proc\u00e9dures, mati\u00e8res, choses, droits et restrictions restent en viguenr et s'y appliquent\nLe demandeur soutient que les mots \"les droits d'appel et les restrictions\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022 ant\u00e9rieurs excluent la p\u00e9remption d'instance de l'op\u00e9ration du nouveau Code. Mais c'est l\u00e0 laisser de c\u00f4t\u00e8 les mots \"et auxquels on \" ne pourrait appliquer les dispositions sans produire \" un effet r\u00e9troactif.\"\nL'appelant fait une p\u00e9tition de principe en arguant que le d\u00e9lai pour p\u00e9remption doit \u00eatre, dans l'esp\u00e8ce celui de l'ancien Code, parce qu'en y substituant celui du nouveau Code, ce serait dit-il donner \u00e0 la loi un effet r\u00e9troactif. C'est l\u00e0 la question \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre, y a-t-il r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 ou non \u00e0 limiter \u00e0 deux ans dans cette cause, le d\u00e9lai pour la p\u00e9remption n Je ne puis en voir, \u00e9tant admis qu'il n'y a pas r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 \u00e0 appliquer toute loi de proc\u00e9dure nouvelle \u00e0 une cause pendante. Ii n'y a l\u00e0 aucune atteinte \u00e0 un droit acquis. Un d\u00e9lai qui a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 courir sous un droit nouveau est, en mati\u00e8re de prescription, r\u00e9gi par ce droit, quoique la dette f\u00fbt contract\u00e9e sous l'ancien droit Ce n'est pas l\u00e0 donner un effet r\u00e9troactif \u00e0 la loi. Ii me semble impossible de faire sous ce rapport une distinction entre la p\u00e9remption d'instance et la prescription. Ce n'est que le 30 juin 1898, date de la derni\u00e8re proc\u00e9dure, que le droit du d\u00e9fendeur \u00e0 la p\u00e9remption demand\u00e9e dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce a origin\u00e9. C'est la loi en force \u00e0 cette date qui d\u00e9termine ce droit.\nLa question, en France, ne souffre pas de difficult\u00e9 Juge, en cassation:\nLa demande en p\u00e9remption est r\u00e9gie par le Code de Proc\u00e9dure, bien que l'instance ait \u00e9t\u00e9 introduite avant le Code S V 54 1, 42; Dall. 53, 1, 271.\nC'est l\u00e0 un point reconnu par tous les auteurs et consacr\u00e9 par de nombreux arr\u00eats dit l'arr\u00eatiste. Voir aussi 3 Carr\u00e9-Chauveau.

L. 446; 4 R. L. 240. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, appeal side ([1]), reversing the judgment of the Superior Court ([2]) in favour of the appellant, plaintiff in warranty, in an action against her by Paula S. Gauthier in which she had called the respondent into the suit as warrantor of her title to the lands claimed by the principal plaintiff, and dismissing the demande in warranty with costs.\nBy her petitory action against the appellant, the principal plaintiff sought to recover a parcel of land forming the south-West corner of Ontario and D\u00e8zery Streets in the City of Montreal, having a frontage of twenty-five feet on Ontario Street by a depth of forty feet on D\u00e8zery Street, and of which the principal plaintiff alleged the appellant to be illegally in possession. The appellant had purchased, with legal warranty from the bank in 1885, a parcel of land, at the intersection of the streets mentioned, with a frontage of twenty-feet by one hundred feet in depth described as bounded in front to the north-west by Ontario Street as then laid out upon the plan of subdivision of lands recently included within the extended limits of the City of Montreal, and in rear by other lands in the same subdivision, \"the whole as then enclosed and fenced\" and of which the appellant had then been in possession for some months. The emplacement thus sold and described at the time of this sale fronted upon Ontario Street, a public thoroughfare, then shewn on the plan of sub-division, of the width of one hundred feet but which was reduced in 1887 to the width of sixty feet by the municipal corporation, leaving forty feet between the property of the appellant and the established street line so that her land no longer fronted upon Ontario Street but was bounded towards the north-west by the new emplacement created by the city thus abandoning forty feet of the land which had been reserved for Ontario Street and the appellant took possession of it as an accession to her lands. The principal plaintiff, in 1897, purchased this strip of forty feet from the former owners who were auteurs of the respondent, without warranty of any kind, and, upon this title, the petitory action against the present appellant was instituted.\nThe appellant defended the action and, alleging that she had by the action be n disturbed in her title derived from the respondent and in the quiet enjoyment of her land so purchased, incidentally constituting herself plaintiff in an action of warranty, called the Bank into the suit to defend her against the petitory action. The Bank refused to take up the defence and denied any liability as warrantor for troubles subsequent to the sale resulting from the legitimate exercise of powers conferred upon the municipal corporation.\nThe Superior Court maintained the action in warranty, but this decision was reversed by the judgment now appealed from.\nIn the court below there was no appeal taken by the present appellant from the judgment of the Superior Court maintaining the principal action, and, upon the appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench by the Bank, the court, in reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, upon the question of warranty and dismissing the action in warranty, abstained from pronouncing any opinion as to the judgment of the Superior Court maintaining the petitory action against the appellant. The appellant in the present appeal asked to have the principal action dismissed, but the plaintiff in that action was not made a party to this appeal.\nMignault K.C. and Beaudin K.C for the appellant.

Chevrier ([7]).\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by;\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014En 1885, la Banque, intim\u00e9e, vendit \u00e0 l'appelante un emplacement contenant vingt-cinq pieds de front sur cent pieds de profondeur, borne en front au nord-ouest par la rue Ontario, en arri\u00e8re par la subdivison 54 du num\u00e8ro 54, ainsi que le tout \u00e9tait alors enclos et cl\u00f4ture dont la dite appelante \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 en possession depuis plusieurs mois.\nTant qu'\u00e0 cet emplacement dans les bornes ainsi d\u00e9crites, personne ne conteste le titre de l'appelante, et elle en a toujours joui paisiblement. Et tant qu'\u00e0 la description d'icelui donn\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e dans la vente \u00e0 l'appelante, elle \u00e9tait alors des plus correcte, et l'emplacement vendu avait de fait son front sur la rue Ontario, tel que le comporte l'acte de vente. L'appelante elle-m\u00eame l'all\u00e8gue sp\u00e9cialement dans son plaidoyer en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 laction principale, et la preuve en est d'ailleurs parfaite. Mais l'appelante croit cependant avoir des griefs contre l'intim\u00e9e et voici les faits sur lesquels elle les fonde.\nLa rue Ontario en question qui avait alors cent pieds de largeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 depuis r\u00e9duite par l'autorit\u00e9 munici- pale \u00e0 soixante pieds, laissant quarante pieds entre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelante et la rue actuelle, en sorte que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelante n'est plus maintenant born\u00e9e \u00e0 la rue, mais bien \u00e0 ce nouvel emplacement cr\u00e9\u00e9 par l'abandon de ces quarante pieds comme rue publique.\nUne nomm\u00e9e Gauthier, par une action p\u00e9titoire, r\u00e9clame contre la pr\u00e9sente appelante la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ces quarante pieds. La contestation entre elles, tant qu'\u00e0 ces quarante pieds, n'est pas devant nous sur le pr\u00e9sent appel. Nous n'avons qu'\u00e0 juger du m\u00e9rite d'une action en garantie que la pr\u00e9sent appelante a prise contre l'intim\u00e9e pour la faire condamner \u00e0 prendre son fait et cause sur l'action p\u00e9titoire prise contre elle par la nomm\u00e9e Gauthier.\nL'intim\u00e9e conteste cette demande et nie qu'elle soit garante d'un fait post\u00e9rieur \u00e0 sa vente \u00e0 l'appelante, r\u00e9sultant des actes de l'autorit\u00e9 municipale dans l'exercice de ses pouvoirs. Le jugement aquo a maintenu cette d\u00e9fense, et renvoy\u00e9 l'action en garantie de l'appelante. Je ne puis voir d'erreur dans ce jugement.\nPourquoi l'intim\u00e9e interviendrait-elle dans la contestation entre la femme Gauthier et l'appelante? Je ne puis l\u00e8 voir. Elle n'a jamais vendu le terrain en litige entre elles; elle n'est pas l'auteur de l'intim\u00e9e tant qu'\u00e0 ce terrain. Mais, dit l'appelante, par l'action de la femme Gauthier, je suis troubl\u00e9e dans la jouissance du terrain que m'a vendu l'intim\u00e9e. C'est l\u00e0 une assertion que la lecture de cette action ne justifie pas; la femme Gauthier ne r\u00e9clame rien que ce soit du terrain que la Banque a vendu \u00e0 l'appelante. Sans doute, la cons\u00e9quence de sa r\u00e9clamation, si elle r\u00e9ussit, est bien que la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de lappelante sera diminu\u00e9e; mais ce n'est pas la faute de l'intim\u00e9e si l'appelante souffre des dommages, si sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 a diminu\u00e8 de valeur. Elle n'a pas garanti \u00e0 l'appelante que l'autorit\u00e9 municipale ne changerait jamais les limites de la rue Ontario ne l'abolirait pas toute enti\u00e8re peut-\u00eatre.\nTout acheteur d'une \"propri\u00e9t\u00e9 situ\u00e8e sur une rue salt, ou dolt savoir, que l'autorit\u00e9 municipale a le pouvoir d'\u00e9largir r\u00e8tr\u00e9cir on clore enti\u00e8rement cette rue.\nL'appelante invoque une autre raison contre le jugement a quo. En cour sup\u00e8rieure, elle a lie contestation avec la nomm\u00e8e Gauthier sur l'action p\u00e8titoire de celle-ci, et jugement maintenant cette action a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 en m\u00eame temps que jugement contre la banque sur l'action en garantie. La banque, parait-il, a appel\u00e9 \u00e0 la cour d'appel, des deux jugements, de celui sur l'action principale, comme de celui sur l'action en garantie. C'\u00e9tait ce qu'elle avait \u00e0 faire sous les circonstances. Car comme le d\u00e9cr\u00eate un arr\u00eat de la cour de Toulouse du 16 novembre 1825 ([8]) un garant peut prendre le fait et cause pour le d\u00e9fendeur principal en appel, m\u00eame quand il ne l'a pas fait en premi\u00e8re instance. Mais il est evidentdans leesp\u00e8ce que l'appel do la banque sur l'action principale ne pouvait \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration et d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par la cour d'appel que dans le cas o\u00f9 elle en serait venue \u00e0 la conclusion de d\u00e9bouter son appel sur la demande en garantie. Ce n'est que dans le cas o\u00f9 la cour d'appel aurait d\u00e9cid\u00e9, comme la cour sup\u00e9rieure l'avait fait que la banque devait garantir la pr\u00e9sente appelante, que la banque aurait en int\u00e9r\u00eat et aurait Pu \u00eatre re\u00e7ue \u00e0 attaquer le jugement sur l'action principale. Mais du moment que la cour en est venue \u00e0 la conclusion de renvoyer l'action en garantie, elle devenait, ipso facto, desaisie de l'appel sur l'action principale, et ne pouvait pas adjuger sur le m\u00e9rite de cette action sur l'appel d'une partie qu'elle d\u00e9clarait \u00eatre non garante, et n'ayant cons\u00e9quemment, aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat dans cette action. C'est pourquoi elle s'est abstenue de prononcer sur l'appel du jugement sur l'action principale. Elle ne pouvait que ce faire. Get appel \u00e8tait devenu caduc.\nEt d'ailleurs, comment l'appelante pourrait-elle nous demander de prononcer sur l'action principale en l'absence de la demanderesse qui n'est pas partie au pr\u00e9sent appel?\nJe suis d'avis de d\u00e9bouter l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs,\nSolicitors for the appellant Beaudin Cardinal, Loranker & St. Germain.\nSolicitors for the respondent; Brosseau, Lajoie & LaCoste.\n[1] Q..R. 10 Q.

In an action by W. to recover the amount of his subscription from the promoters.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (2 Ont. L.R. 261) that the latter, having benefitted by the sum paid by W. were liable to repay it though they did not authorize and had no knowledge of the false representations of their agent.\nHeld, per Strong C.J., that neither express authority to make the representations nor subsequent ratification or participation in benefit were necessary to make the promoters liable; the rule of respondeat superior applies as in other cases of agency.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe action is an action for deceit in procuring the plaintiff to subscribe and pay for ten shares of stock in a company promoted by the individual defendants which was afterwards incorporated as the Highway Advertising Company of Canada (Limited). The alleged fraud was committed by the defendants Hotchkiss and McKay who were authorized by the other defendants (appellants) to canvass for and obtain subscriptions for stock in the intended company and consisted substantially in the statements made to the plaintiff by these two defendants that they and their co-defendants had not only between them already subscribed for $50,000 in the stock of the company but that the whole sum subscribed for had actually been paid into a bank for the company. Relying upon these statements as evidence of the soundness and practical character of the scheme and on the faith of their being true, the plaintiff subscribed for ten shares and paid over the whole amount to the defendants.\nIt was found as a fact at the trial and not disputed by the appellants at the hearing that the plaintiff was induced to subscribe for stock on the false representations made by Hotchkiss and McKay. The appellants claimed, however, that they neither authorized the agents to make such representations nor ratified their action by acquiescence or otherwise and that they were not liable for what their agents did beyond the scope of their authority. Whether or not they were liable in such case was the sole question to be decided by the appeal.\nShepley K.C. for the appellants.\nAylesworth K.C. and McEvoy for the respondent Wilson.\nR.V.Sinclair for the respondent company.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE: (Oral).\u2014We do not think that we should withhold our judgment in this case. It is to be regretted that an appeal was taken to this court considering the amount involved, the nature of the questions raised and the unanimity of opinions in the courts below, especially in the Court of Appeal.\nI have no hesitation in saying that I am quite prepared to adopt the principle of law laid down by Mr. Justice Lindley[2], namely, that where false representations have been made by an agent in executing his mandate, though the principal has not directly authorized such representations, yet the rule of respondeat superior applies as in other cases, and it is not essential that the principal should have ratified or derived benefit from the act of his agent.\nI am not sure that all my learned brothers will concur in this, but I am sure they will agree as to what Mr. Justice Moss finds to be the effect of the evidence, namely, that it is patent from the depositions that the principals, if they did not expressly authorise the statement made by their agents, did receive benefit from it in getting the money sought to be recovered by this action. I cannot do better than read an extract from the judgment of Mr. Justice Moss, who says:\nIt was essential to the plaintiff\u2019s case that he should establish either that the appellants themselves were knowingly guilty of actual misrepresentations on the faith of which he acted, or that they authorised Hotchkiss and McKay, or one of them, to act for them in obtaining the plaintiff\u2019s subscription, or that they received the plaintiff\u2019s money or some of it, or that in some way they derived a profit or benefit from the fraud practised upon the plaintiff. I think upon the testimony the plaintiff has succeeded in establishing the three latter propositions.\nFor myself I go further than this and say that neither express authority to make the representations nor subsequent ratification or participation in benefits were necessary ingredients to make the appellants liable, though I agree with Mr. Justice Moss in his conclusion from the evidence that the latter element was in fact present here.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Kilmer, Irving & Porter.\nSolicitors for the respondent, Wilson: McEvoy, Pope & Perrin.\nSolicitors for the respondent, The Highway Advertising Co.: Hanna & Burnham.\n[1] 2 Ont.

Only the facts need be stated, not their legal effect.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendant. The questions raised on the appeal are sufficiently indicated in the above head note, and the facts as far a they are material are set out in the judgment of the court.\nRyckman and Kirkpatrick for the appellant. The respondent having indorsed the note before the payee incurred no liability on it. Steele v. McKinlay[2].\nIf so there was no consideration for the mortgage. The Chattel Mortgage Act must be construed strictly. Barber v. Macpherson[3].\nHellmuth and Saunders for the respondent, were not called upon.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (Oral).\u2014We all think this appeal must be dismissed. The questions to be decided are: First: Did the respondent incur any liability by indorsing a note not made payable to him but to the Molsons Bank and not indorsed by the payee? Secondly: Were the recitals in the chattel mortgage of the consideration for which it was made sufficient?\nAs to the first point it appears that the note in question was in form as follows:\nLONDON, Sept. 25th, 1899.\n$1,200.00.\nThree months after date I promise to pay to the order of the Molsons Bank, at the Molsons Bank here twelve hundred dollars for value received.\n\u201cW. MANN & CO.\u201d\nIndorsed on the back was the name \u201cGeorge T. Mann.\u201d\nThen the position was this; George T. Mann, the present respondent, indorsed a note signed by W. Mann & Co., and payable to the Molsons Bank. It is contended that he was not an indorser and as such liable to the bank to whom the note so indorsed was delivered and by them discounted, Walter Mann receiving the proceeds.\nNext, what was the legal effect of this endorsement? Section 56 of the Bills of Exchange Act, 1890, provides that\nwhere a person signs a bill otherwise than as a drawer or acceptor he thereby incurs the liability of an indorser to a holder in due course and is subject to all the provisions of this Act respecting indorsers.\nThen when the bank took the note was it not entitled to the benefit of the respondent\u2019s liability as indorser? Certainly it was, for by force of the statute the indorsement operated as what has long been known in the French Commercial Law as an \u201caval\u201d a form of liability which is now by the statute adopted in English law.\nThe argument for the appellant as I understand it is that this indorsement at most amounted only to a guarantee and that there being no consideration expressed in writing the statute of Frauds would have been an answer if the bank had sued the respondent. Some colour is given to this argument by the case of Sanger v. Elliott as reported in 4 Times Law Reports, p. 524, but there the Bills of Exchange Act was not referred to and it appeared that the bill had not been negotiated. It is to be remarked that case is not to be found in the regular series of reports. Here however the note was negotiated and the bank were holders in due course and, consequently, the 56th section of the Act applies and creates a liability as indorser independently altogether of the principle of guarantee. If the section referred to is to have any effect it must apply in a case like this.\nThen as to the recital in the chattel mortgage. It declares the indorsement of the note to be the consideration and sets out the note itself which is surely a sufficient compliance with the requirement of the Act that the consideration should be recited. It is not necessary that the mortgage should state the legal effect of the facts set out as forming the consideration. It is sufficient to state the facts and leave the legal effect to be inferred.\nI agree with the reasons given by their lordships in the Court of Appeal for deciding this case in favour of the respondent, but I do not agree with Mr. Justice Osler who, I think, puts the case too favourably for the appellant when he says that the bank would have found it difficult to enforce the liability on the note against the respondent. In my opinion the respondent was clearly liable under the 56th section of the Bills of Exchange Act already referred to.\nThe appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ryckman, Kirkpatrick & Kerr.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Helmuth & Ivey\n[1] 2 Ont.

Summers v. The commercial union Assurance Company (6 Can. S. C. R. 19), followed.\nThe local agent of a fire insurance company was authorised to effect interim insurances, by issuing receipts countersigned by him on the payment of the premiums in cash. He employed a canvasser to solicit insurances, who pretended to effect an insurance on behalf of the company by issuing an interim receipt which he countersigned as agent for the company, taking a promissory note payable in three months to his own order for the amount of the premium.\nHeld, that the canvasser could not bind the company by a contract on the terms he assumed to make, as the agent himself had no such authority.\nHeld further, that even if the agent might be said to have power to appoint a sub-agent for the purpose of soliciting insurances, the employment of the canvasser for that purpose did not confer authority to conclude contracts, to sign interim receipts, nor to receive premiums \"for insurance.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench (appeal side), affirming the judgment of the Superior Court District of Ottawa which maintained the plaintiffs' action with costs.\nThe plaintiffs' claimed $5,000 for insurance on a factory in the City of Hull, the property of two of the plaintiffs (D'Amour and Charlebois), which was destroyed in the great conflagration on 26th April, 1900. On 2nd May, 1900, D'Amour and Charlebois assigned their interest in the insurance to Robinson the other plaintiff, to whom the insurance had been made payable as mortgagee. The application for insurance was made on 21st April, 1900, for twelve months, and, as plaintiffs alleged, an interim receipt was given by the company's agents on that date securing provisional insurance for thirty days from its date or until the issue of a policy or rejection of the risk. The plaintiffs further alleged that they gave a promissory note for the premium at the time of delivery of the interim receipt, payable in three months, which was accepted by the agents and afterwards duly paid.\nThe defendant denied that any authorised agent on its behalf had ever insured the property, or signed the interim receipt and contended that no contract of insurance had been entered into. It also denied receiving any valid consideration or premium, or that any promissory note had been given to or accepted by or paid to any of its authorised agents, and alleged that the person named Healy who signed the interim receipt as its agent at Ottawa had never been its agent nor held out by it as its agent, and had no authority to bind it in any manner. Defendant alleged that a number of blank receipts signed by the managing director in blank had been forwarded to one Smith who was its agent at Ottawa, entrusted to him and were not to be issued by any other person nor without his signature as agent; that in Smith's absence and without his consent, Healy unlawfully obtained possession of the interim receipt produced by plaintiffs while it; was still in the condition in which it left the head office; that the firm styled D'Amour and \"Charlebois, acting personally and through Healy, their agent had prior to this unsuccessfully sought to effect an insurance upon the property in question; whereupon Healy, acting for them, and with their knowledge, on the receipt falsely stated a payment of $200 when both he and they knew no money had been paid, and signed the same as defendant's agent at Ottawa when both he and they knew he was not such agent; that upon the application for insurance reaching the head office at Toronto, where it was not known that Healy had signed the interim receipt the manager there immediately telegraphed to Smith that the application was refused, and instructed him to take up the receipt, which he did; that the manager at Toronto had no means of knowing at the time that Healy had signed the receipt; that had he known such fact, he would have repudiated the right of Healy to act as its agent or to countersign its blank receipts and that he became aware of the fact of Healy's having signed the paper long after the fire; that when plaintiffs paid Healy the amount of the note given to him personally by them, both he and they knew that the company had repudiated the contract in question; and that, at the time of the fire, no premium had been paid and no consideration given to the company or to any one authorised to act for it.\nThe plaintiffs answered that the agents who effected . the insurance were duly authorised for that purpose, and that the receipt was not only signed by Healy but also by Smith and by the general manager; that the company had frequently recognised the validity of similar receipts; that the application had been received and forwarded by Smith who confirmed the acts of Healy; that the company knew that it had been customary for its agents to accept promissory notes in lieu of cash for the first premium; and that the note question was received by the company's agents and paid to them; that Smith knew that the receipt had been issued, and had approved of it; that, at the time it left his possession to be given to plaintiffs, it bore his signature, and that Healy's name was simply written over his which did not vitiate it, if such signature was at all necessary.\nThe trial judge after hearing the witnesses in court decided in favour of the plaintiff, and on appeal, the Court of King's Bench affirmed this judgment Hall and Boss\u00e9 JJ. dissenting\nForan K.C, and Lafleur K.C. for the appellant.

Commercial Union Assurance Co (1); In the Summers Case ([1]) the jury had found as a fact that the broker was employed by the local agent and had been authorised by him to sign interim receipts. In this case Healy never was in Smith's employ and had never been authorised to sign anything. In the Summers Case (1) the jury found that the general agents of the company had knowledge that the broker was acting as agent. Here the existence of Healy was not brought to the general agent's knowledge until after the action had been instituted The company never held out Healy as its agent; it could not do so; it did not know him. D'Amour knew from Healy's actions that Smith was the real agent, and that recourse was to be had to him when the question of accepting a note for the premium was mooted. D'Amour saw Smith's name on the receipt, consen1ed to it being erased by Healy, and accepted the receipt without Smith's signature. D'Amour gave Healy a note for the premium payable not to the order of the company, nor Smith, but to the order of Healy. Healy never indorsed the note but kept it. Smith told him he would not accept the note and never saw it. See Art. 2500 C. C. The agent cannot accept anything but money in payment of a premium.

Trafalgar Life Ins. Assoc. ([10]); Compagnie d'Assurance des Cultivateurs v. Grammon ([11]), Art. 4481 C. C.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE. There are in my opinion, four distinct grounds for allowing this appeal. First: Smith, if he did in fact delegate his authority as an agent for the appellants for the purpose of effecting policies of assurance to Healy, had no legal authority to do so.\nAt the opening of the appeal there was some discussion as to whether the authority of Smith to appoint a sub-agent depended upon the law of Ontario or Manitoba, the legal domicile of the company), or on that of Quebec and my brother Taschereau remarked that the law governing the contract must be presumed to be that of the lex fori, unless the lex loci was proved to be different. I agree in this and consider that the appeal must be determined by the law of the Province of Quebec.\nArticle 1711 of the Civil Code is as follows:\n1711. The mandatary is answerable for the person whom he substitutes in the execution of the mandate, when he is not empowered to do so; and, if the mandator be injured by reason of the substitution, he may repudiate the acts of the substitute.\nThis article 1711 deals only with the question of responsibility and it does not define the cases in which the mandatary may appoint a sub-agent The corresponding article of the French Code is 1994. The provision appears to apply in cases where the mandatary is neither empowered nor prohibited by the contract of mandate to appoint a sub-agent.\nThere can be little doubt although there is no express article to that effect, that the mandator may prohibit the delegation of his mandate by the mandatary to a third person, provided the prohibition is express. Then, surely there is nothing requiring that the prohibition to delegate should be express in its terms it may well be left to inference when the mandate necessarily implies trust and confidence in the person on whom it is conferred. Then in a case in this court Summers v. The Commercial Union Insurance Co. ([12]), an appeal from Ontario it was held that an agent of an insurance company, such as Smith was in this case, could not act through the medium of a sub-agent since the authority of the original agent involved trust and confidence and was in the nature of delectus person. It is therefore a case where the mandatary cannot legally discharge his duties by handing them over to another not selected by the mandator.\nThere is an arr\u00eat of a Belgian Court of Appeal to this effect. Grand, 26th, May, 1851; Pasicrisie, 1851, 2, 318.\nFor this reason I conclude that Smith had no legal power to substitute Healy for himself in making the contract of insurance with d'Amour and Charlebois.\nSecondly: Even if Smith had legal authority to substitute Healy, he, in point of fact, as appears from the depositions, never did so. Healy had apparently authority to get proposals for Smith, but Smith never empowered him to conclude contracts, to sign interim receipts or to receive premiums. It was incumbent on the plaintiff to establish this in proof by clear testimony but he has failed to do so. It does not appear that Healy was authorized to conclude a contract and to sign an interim receipt with d'Amour and Charlebois or with anyone else. This appears to have been his own view for he erased Smith's countersignature from the interim receipt, thus indicating that he had not authority from the latter. The very way the interim receipt he used came into the hands of Healy, militates against the pretention that he had, in fact, actual authority from Smith for Healy appears to have abstracted the receipt from a parcel containing blanks sent by the company's agent at Toronto, addressed to Smith and without having authority to do so from the latter. On the whole, it is not proved that Healy had de facto the authority he professed to exercise. This is further confirmed by the fact that he gave the interim receipt without receiving payment of the premium, taking for it a promissory note at three months payable not to Smith, but to himself, which note he did not hand over to Smith at once although after some time he offered to deliver it to the latter who refused to accept it. There certainly never was, in fact, any authority conferred by Smith to enter into a contract of insurance to be binding on the appellant on the terms and to be carried out in the manner this assumed contract was.\nThirdly: Even if it were granted that Smith could, in law, substitute a sub-agent and had, in fact, done so, there is a clause in article 1711 C. C. (not to be found in the French Code) which is conclusive as to the right of the appellant to disavow Healey's acts. The words of this clause are:\nIf the mandator be injured by reason of the substitution, he may repudiate the acts of the substitute.\nIf there could be a case in which a principal would be entitled to say he was injured by the acts of one who had assumed to act as the sub-agent of his mandatary, it is the present. Here we find this pretended sub-agent entering into a most improvident contract of insurance as regards the risk taken, not complying with the terms of the mandate as regards the interim receipt, and taking payment of the premium in a manner not warranted by anything the appellant had authorized, by a deferred promissory note payable, not to the appellant, or its agent, but to the sub-agent himself It is impossible to say if this could be in law and was in fact a substitution, that the appellant was not grievously injured by the way in which the substitute executed the mandate This therefore gives the company the right to repudiate the pretended contract. Lastly: .The powers of the sub-agent cannot exceed those of the principal agent. Smith, himself, had no power to enter into a contract in the terms of that which Healy pretended to make as his sub-agent with d'Amour and Charlebois. He could only effect an interim insurance binding on the company by an interim receipt countersigned by himself and on receiving himself the premium in cash. London and Lancashire Life Assurance Co. v. Fleming ([13]); Acey v. Fernie ([14]). These terms were not complied with and, therefore, on this last distinct ground, that on which Mr.Justice Hall's dissenting judgment proceeds, the respondent must fail.\nThe appeal is allowed and the action dismissed. The appellants must have their costs here and in both courts below.\nTASCHKREAU J. concurred in the judgment allowing the appeal with costs and dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nGWYNNE J \u2014.The appeal in this case must, in my opinion be allowed with costs.\nThe case in the Privy Council of The London and Lancashire Insurance Co. v. Fleming (1) is, in effect, an overruling of the judgment of this court in the case of The Manufacturers Accident Insurance Co. v. Pudsey ([15]), reported in the twenty-seventh volume of the Supreme Court reports.\nSEDGEWICK and DAVIES J J. also concurred in the judgment allowing the appeal and dismissing the action with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Foran & Champagne.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Aylen &.

He brought an action claiming damages and a mandamus for reinstatement in the ministry, but failed at the trial and in the Court of Appeal to obtain judgment.\nRiddell K.C. for the appellant. Plaintiff had a right to resort to the civil courts. Essery v. Court Pride of the Dominion[2].\nUnder its rules the Conference had no right to locate him after twenty-three years service. See Mulroy v. Knights of Honor[3].\nThe learned counsel also refered to Richardson Gardner v. Fremantle[4]. Bacon on Friendly Societies, (2 ed.) 101 et seq. Maclaren K.C. for the respondent was not called upon.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (Oral).\u2014I do not think we need call on counsel for respondent. Without putting it on the technical ground of our jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, we think it is a case in which we should not interfere. The evidence and documents shew that the conference has a right to superannuate a minister, using the word not as it may be used in some special sense in the rules of the conference, but in its general sense, and that justified that body in \u201clocating\u201d as it is termed, this minister as they did. As said by Mr. Justice Maclennan at the close of his judgment, we have no right to interfere in a matter clearly within the powers of the domestic forum and in which they have taken action.\nI cannot state the position better than by using the words of Mr. Justice Maclennan where he says:\nThe question whether a minister is unacceptable or inefficient is peculiarly one for the judgment of Conference, and by the discipline that body is made the sole judge on the subject. In the present case they had before them, and upon their records, the grounds upon which they proceeded. The domestic appellate court has declared that their proceedings were regular and I think the plaintiff has not made out any case for the interference of a court of law.\nProbably some of my brothers would like to add that what was done by the Conference was entirely justified by the facts. I do not myself proceed on any such ground.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Beatty, Blackstock & Nesbitt.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Maclaren, Macdonald, Merritt & Shepley.\n[1] 27 Ont.

His solicitor by inadvertence inscribed the case for revision in the name of the deceased defendant. The plaintiffs allowed a term of the Court of Review to pass without noticing the irregularity of the inscription but, when the case was ripe for hearing on the merits, gave notice of motion to reject the inscription. The executors of the deceased defendant then made a motion for permission to amend the inscription by substituting their names \u00eas qualit\u00e9, The Court of Review allowed the plaintiffs' motion as to costs only, permitted the amendment and subsequently reversed the trial court judgment on the merits. The Court of Kind's Bench (appeal side), reversed the judgment of the Court of Review on the ground that it had no jurisdiction to allow the amendment and hear the case on the merits, and that consequently, all the orders and judgments given were nullities.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, (Q. R. 10 K. B. 511), the Chief Justice and Taschereau J. dissenting, that the Court of Review had jurisdiction to allow the amendment and that, as there had been no abuse of discretion and no parties prejudiced, the Court of King's Bench should not to have interfered.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side ([1]), reversing the judgment of the Court of Review and restoring the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Rimouski, which maintained the plaintiffs' action with costs.\nThe circumstances under which the questions on this appeal arose are stated in the judgments reported.\nStuart K.C. for the appellants.\nPouliot K.C. and Orde for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE dissented from the judgment allowing the appeal.\nTASCHEREAU J. (diff\u00e9rant).\u2014Je d\u00e9bouterais cet appel.\nLes autorit\u00e9s invoqu\u00e9es par les appelants sur la pro c\u00e9dure et les r\u00e8gies \u00e0 suivre lorsqu'une des parties d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e8 dans le cours de l'instance, n'ont pas d'application. Ce n'est pas dans le cours de l'instance qu' Evan John Price, le d\u00e9fendeur originaire, est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 L'appel est une instance nouvelle, une action judiciaire en r\u00e9formation du jugement de premiere instance, comme le dit Poncet, et tout autant que l'aiournement devant les premiers juges, l'\u0153uvre directe de la partie, comme le dit Boncenne, 5 vol. page 216. Voir Bioche, Proc\u00e9d. v. Actions No. 116. C'est un acte attributif de juri diction, et non un acte de simple proc\u00e9dure dans une instance pendante. C'est pour cela que les r\u00e9pr\u00e9sentants d'un d\u00e9funt n'ont pas \u00e0 reprendre l'instance pour initier un appel ou inscrire en revision; ils inscrivent en appel ou en r\u00e9vision comme s'ils prenaient une nouvelle action. C'est pour cela qu'un procureur autre que celui qui a occup\u00e9 en premi\u00e8re instance, peut, sans la formalit\u00e9 d'une substitution, instituer l'appel ou inscrire en revision C'est pour cela que suivant la jurisprudence constante de cette cour un statut donnant ou restreignant le droit d'appel ne s'applique pas aux causes pendantes: Hyde v. Lindsay ([2]); quoi qu'un statut amendant la proc\u00e9dure s'y applique. Schwob v. The Town of Farnham ([3]).\nJe ne vois vraiment dans l'esp\u00e8ce qu'une question de fait. Le d\u00e9funt Evan John Price a-t-il jamais inscrit en r\u00e9vision du jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure? Impossible, il me semble de r\u00e9pondre oui. Il n'existait plus lorsque la cour sup\u00e9rieure a rendu son jugement. Et il n'a pu faire par procureurs c qu'il ne pouvait faire en personne. Il ne peut pas y avoir de mandat d'outre tombe, de mandataire sans mandant. La loi ne conna\u00eet pas plus les procureurs des tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s que de ceux qui ne sont pas n\u00e9s. La document pr\u00e9tendant inscrire en r\u00e9vision au nom d'Evan John Price apr\u00e8s sa mort, est nul, d'une nullit\u00e9 de non esse. Il n'y a pas eu dans le d\u00e9lai voulu d'inscription. La cour de r\u00e9vision n'avait donc pas juridiction; elle n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie de la cause Elle a elle-m\u00eame d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'elle n'a pas juridiction si le d\u00e9p\u00f4t requis par l'art. 1196 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fait dans les huit jours qui suivent la date du juge ment. Ringuette v. Ringuette ([4]); Leferri\u00e8re v. The Mutual Fire Ins. Co. of Berthier ([5]). Il doit en \u00eatre de m\u00eame il me semble, si l'inscription n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite dans le d\u00e9lai voulu. Et c'est de fait, ce que cette m\u00eame cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans Jamieson v. Rousseau ([6]), o\u00f9 l'inscription fut ray\u00e9e parce qu'elle n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 produite que le surlendemain du d\u00e9p\u00f4t. Ici, il n'y en a pas eu du tout aux yeux de la loi.\nMaintenant, la pr\u00e9tendue inscription faite au nom d'un d\u00e9funt pouvait-elle \u00eatre valid\u00e9e par la cour de r\u00e9vision, en substituant an nom du d\u00e9funt celui de ses ex\u00e9cuteurs testamentaires? La cour d'appel a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que non ([7]), et je suis d'avis qu'elle a eu raison. Il n'est pas possible de valider ce qui n'a jamais exist\u00e9. Si l'inscription \u00e9tait nulle d'une nullit\u00e9 de non esse, et je ne puis voir rien de plus nul qu'un acte fait au nom d'un d\u00e9funt elle n'a pu conf\u00e9rer juridiction \u00e0 la cour de r\u00e9vision. Or, si cette cour n'avait pas juridiction sur la cause, elle n'a pu donner la permission d'amender l'inscription. Elle n'a pu dire, ut ex tunc, qu 'Evan John Price \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par ses ex\u00e9cuteurs lorsque l'inscription n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en fait produite par eux. Une action prise au nom d'une personne d\u00e9funte ne pourrait \u00eatre amend\u00e9e en lui substituant ses h\u00e9ritiers comme demandeurs. Et sous la forme d'un amendement, c'est la substitution d'une nouvelle inscription au nom desex\u00e9cuteurs \u00e0 celle in t\u00e9rieurement faite an nom du d\u00e9funt que la cour de r\u00e9vision a permise. On plut\u00f4t c'est de fait une ins cription en revision plus de deux mois apr\u00e8s le juge ment de premi\u00e8re instance qu'elle a autoris\u00e9e, lorsqu'il n'y en avait pas en dans le d\u00e9lai requis. Et cette permission d'amender a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e sur la demande de tiers non parties \u00e0 l'instance. Quand la motion des ex\u00e9cuteurs pour permission d'amender l'inscription a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du d\u00e9fendeur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9nonc\u00e9 an dossier. Or comment sans reprendre l'instance, ont-ils pu subs\u00e9quemment \u00eatre admis \u00e0 faire une motion dans la cause sans m\u00eame produire le testament du d\u00e9funt qui les appointe? C'est ce que je ne puis comprendre. Dans la cause de Haggarty v. Morris ([8]) il y avait en une reprise d'instance, et c'est parce que cette reprise d'instance avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e le rapport ne dit pas si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e ou non, que la cour a refus\u00e9 de rejeter l'appel. Je ne vois l\u00e0 rien de contraire \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la m\u00eame cour six mois auparavant, dans la cause de Kerby v. Ross ([9]) qui est enti\u00e9rement conforme au jugement dont est appel. Une autre d\u00e9cision qui me semble militer bien forte ment contre le pouvoir d'amender l'inscription en question est celle dans la cause de McPherson v. Barthe ([10]) o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9:\nQu'une inscription pour r\u00e9vision, inscrivant pour r\u00e9vision du juge ment rendu en cette cause, par la cour sup\u00e9rieure, lorsque le jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par la cour de circuit sera d\u00e9charg\u00e9e sur motion \u00e0 cet effet, et le dossier renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la cour de premi\u00e8re instance, et qu'une motion pour amender l'inscription sera rejet\u00e9e.\nCette d\u00e9cision n'a pu \u00eatrebas\u00e9e que sur le motif qu'une inscription d\u00e9fectueuse ne peut conf\u00e9rer juridiction, et que cons\u00e9quemment la cour n'avait pas le pouvoir d'amender.\nLes appelants paraissent croire que la solution de la question devrait \u00eatre influenc\u00e9e par le fait qu'ils ont maintenant perdu leur droit d'appel \u00e0 la Cour du Banc de la Reine. C'est l\u00e0 une erreur. D'abord s'ils ont perdu leur droit d'appel, c'est parce qu'ils l'ont bien voulu. Ils avaient six mois pour ce faire et il n'y en avait pas deux depuis le jugement, lorsque les intim\u00e9s ont fait motion pour rejeter l'inscription Et d'ailleurs, ce fait ne peut affecter notre d\u00e9cision, qui doit \u00eatre la m\u00eame qu'elle aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre en cour de r\u00e9vision lorsque la motion des appelants pour amender a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. La cour d'appel a dit aux appelants que cet appel ad misericordiam ne pouvait pr\u00e9valoir. Elle leur a dit que c'est exclusivement \u00e0 la cour des commissaires que l'article 1253 du Code donne le pouvoir de juger suivant l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 et en bonne conscience. Et je crois qu'elle a eu raison. Les appelants oublient que leurs adversaires ont aussi des droits. Si l'inscription en r\u00e9 vision est nulle, ceux-ci ont un droit acquis au juge ment de la cour sup\u00e9rieure. Et les en priver serait une injustice. The judgment of the majority of the Court was delivered by:\nGIROUARD J.\u2014No vested rights are at stake in this appeal. Rights arising out of a pending suit cannot be considered as vested till they are finally settled and. adjusted by the highest tribunal having jurisdiction in the matter. This appeal involved only a question of procedure very injuriously affecting one of the parties and on several occasions we declared that we would not hesitate to interfere in cases of this character. Eastern Townships Bank v. Swan ([11]); Lambe v. Arm strong ([12]). To do otherwise would be to hold that, without a clear statutory enactment, courts of justice may serve to destroy substantial rights they are summoned to define and enforce.\nThe action was instituted by the respondents against the late Senator Price to recover lands upon which abutted certain wharves, and also damages. The Superior Court maintained the action in part. The case was inscribed in revision, but unfortunately Mr. Price having died pending the delib\u00e9r\u00e9, his counsel inscribed on the fourth day of December, 1899, not in the name of his executors, but in the name of the deceased defendant. The plaintiffs did not move at once or at the next term of the court, to reject the inscription; they appeared and nearly two months after the service of the inscription when the case was ready to be heard on the merits, on the 26th January, 1900 they served a motion to reject the inscription. The following day, the attorney for the executors of Mr. Price moved to amend by substituting their names, their counsel producing his affidavit that he had been fully instructed by them to inscribe, had received from them the deposit of money required by law, and that it was by inadvertence and error on his part that the inscription was not properly made. The two motions were heard at the same time, and on the 3rd of February following, the motion to amend was granted unanimously without costs (Casault C.J., Caron and Andrews JJ.), and the motion to reject the inscription was granted as to costs only. A few months later, the same judges, after having heard the parties, gave judgment on the merits, reversed the judgment of the Superior Court and dismissed the action against Mr. Price with costs.\nAn appeal was taken by the plaintiffs to the Court of Appeal who held (Boss\u00e9 J. dissenting) ([13]),that the Court of Review had no jurisdiction to amend the inscription in revision and to hear the case on the merits, and that all the judgments in review were null and void; and as a necessary consequence the judgment of the Superior Court against Mr. Price was allowed to stand as final. It must be added that when the motion to reject the inscription was made that judgment could have been appealed to the Court of Appeal, but that it was too late to do so when the Court of Appeal pronounced its decision.\nNo opinion of the judges upon the point of procedure has been transmitted to us, although very full notes upon the merits are given. Probably the learned judges thought that they were the best judges of the procedure of their own court.\nThe appellants were not however, without judicial authority when they offered their motion to amend. They had no less than four decisions of the Court of Appeal in support of the course they adopted and that was undoubtedly the reason why the learned judges in review took only four days to deliberate upon the point.\nIn September, 1874, in Haggarty v. Morris([14]), the Court of Appeal held that the defect of issuing a writ of appeal in the name of a dead party is not absolute and can be covered up by the allowance of a reprise d'instance, and that it is not competent to the respondent to move afterwards to quash the same. Article 1154 of the Code of Procedure then in force declared that proceedings in appeal may be brought by the legal representatives of a deceased party to a suit.\nIn 1883 in Clement v. Francis ([15]), Dorion C.J. speaking for the full court, said:\nThat the court in a previous case had already allowed the tutor to file the authorisation obtained but not produced (that is the authorisation of the family council to appeal), and he thought that the appellant (a curator) was also entitled to delay to obtain this authorisation.\nA similar arret was again rendered by the same court in 1889, in Laforce v. La Ville de Sorel ([16]). Articles 306 and 343 of the Civil Code enact that a tutor or curator cannot appeal without such authorisation, and it is a well known principle that prohibitive laws import nullity. (Art. 14 0. C.)\nAgainst this jurisprudence apparently settled by the highest authority in the province, there is one solitary precedent rendered previously, March 1874; I refer to Kerby v. Ross ([17]), where the majority of the Court of Appeal held that an appeal in the name of a dead person is absolutely null and cannot be corrected by allowing a reprise d'instance. Two of the learned judges (four in all), seem to have soon changed their views for six months afterwards they concurred in Haggarty v. Morris ([18]), above referred to. Moreover, Mr. Justice J. T. Taschereau dissented, being of the opinion that Art. 1154 of the Code of Procedure was merely facultative. This opinion finally prevailed, and the jurisprudence seems to be well settled, for nearly thirty years, by numerous decisions quoted above, that a defective appeal, such as in the above cases, is not so absolutely null and void that it cannot be remedied by subsequent proceeding or conduct, and especially by an amendment. See also Les Cuv\u00e9 et Marguilliers de l'\u0152uvre et Fabrique de Ste. Anne de Varennes v. Choquet ([19]); Sawyer v. The County of Missisquoi ([20]); Varin v. Gu\u00e9rin ([21]); Barrette v. Lollier ([22]).\nThe appellants had reason to rely upon that jurisprudence and the judges in review could not very well refuse to follow it. The present case is even more favourable than that of the tutor or curator which is governed by a prohibitive enactment. In this instance the law is merely permissive. Art 1193 of of the new code, reproducing Art. 1154 of the old one says:\nProceedings in review may be brought by the legal repr\u00e9sentatives, etc.\nI am not prepared to say that this article is imperative and \u00e0 pine de nullit\u00e9, especially as our code does not so enact, and for a very obvious reason; unquestionably an inscription in review may validly be taken in the name of a dead person, for instance, if his death is unknown to his attorney. Whether considered as a mere revision before the same court or an appeal (Arts. 40. 52 and 72), this case involves merely a point of practice which is left to the discretion of the court which deals with it. I am inclined to regard the jurisprudence of Quebec as not only just and reasonable but also sound in law. I certainly do not feel disposed to punish a party who has respected it by the for feature of his substantial rights.\nUnder the new Code of Procedure, which governs this case, the power of a court to amend has been greatly enlarged; it is almost unlimited. See articles 513 to 523. The commissioners charged with its confection, observe that all the provisions contained in the above articles are in conformity with the new principle they lay down in relation to exceptions to the form namely that formal defects do not entail nullity unless they are not remedied. They express the opinion that article 522 furnishes the only exception upon the power to amend, viz., the nature of the action cannot be changed. I find, however another wise limitation in article 520, viz., the opposite party must not be led into error. With these two exceptions, the power to amend is much larger than in France; it is practically as liberal as in England the State of New York and the Province of Ontario. The commissioners have even indicated the Codes and Judicature Acts in force in these states as the source of several articles of our new code. The cardinal rule seems to prevail in the courts of these countries that in passing upon applications to amend the ends of justice should never be sacrificed to mere form or by too rigid an adherence to technical rules of practice. No appellate court should undertake to reverse the action of the court below, unless it affirmatively appears that there was a plain abuse of discretion\u2014that the appellant was put to serious disadvantage or materially prejudiced thereby, or that some statutory provision or established rule of practice was violated. Ency. of Plead. & Prac. (2 ed.) vo. Amendments p. 464 I cannot see why these rules should not also guide the courts of Quebec under the new code. Can it be contended that the present case falls within any of the above exceptions?\nTo apply the limitations imposed by our own code, can it be said that the respondents have been led into error, or that the nature of their demand has been changed by the amendment? Nothing of the kind. Their rights, as set up in the issue between the parties, can be investigated as fully and effectively as if Mr. Price was still alive and a party in the cause. They are not prejudiced in the least, and the Court of Appeal had no right to interfere.\nThe appeal is therefore allowed with costs before this court and the court of Appeal and it is further ordered that the case be remitted to the Court of Appeal to be adjudicated upon the merits.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Caron, Pentland, Stuart & Brodie.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Pouliot & Drapeau.\n[1] Q.

the Honourable Sir Louis Napoleon Casault, of the City of Quebec, in the Province of Quebec, Chief Justice of the Superior Court of the said Province of Quebec; and the Honourable George Wheelock Burbidge, of the City of Ottawa, in the said Province of Ontario, Judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada.\"\nSend Greeting:\n\"Whereas, it was in and by the Act of the Parliament of Canada, 54-55 Victoria, chapter 6, and in and by an Act of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, 54 Victoria, chapter 2, and in and by an Act of the Legislature of Quebec, 54 Victoria, chapter 4, among other things, provided that for the final and conclusive determination of certain questions and accounts which had arisen, or which might arise, in the settlement of accounts between the Dominion of Canada and the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, both jointly and severally, and between the two provinces, concerning which no agreement had theretofore been arrived at, the Governor-General in council might unite with the Governments of the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec in the appointment of three arbitrators, being judges, to whom should be referred such questions as the Governor-General and Lieutenant-Governors of the Provinces should agree to submit;\n\"And whereas, we, the undersigned, John Alexander Boyd, Louis Napoleon Casault, and George Wheelock Burbidge, have been duly appointed under the said Acts, and have taken upon ourselves the burdens thereof;\n\"And whereas, it was provided in and by the said Acts that such arbitrators, or any two of them, should have power to make one or more awards and to do so from time to time;\n\"And whereas, by an agreement made on the tenth of April, 1893, on behalf of the Government of Canada of the first part, the Government of Ontario of the second part, and the Government of Quebec of the third part, it was, among other things, agreed by and between the said Governments, parties thereto, that the following questions, among others, mentioned in the order of the Governor-General in Council of the twelfth day of December, eighteen hundred and ninety, be, and they were thereby, referred to said arbitrators for their determination and award in accordance with the said statutes, namely:\n\"The ascertainment and determination of the amount of the principal of the Common School Fund, the rate of interest which should be allowed on such fund, and the method of computing such interest. \"In the ascertainment of the amount of the principal of the said Common School Fund, the arbitrators are to take into consideration, not only the sum now held by the Government of the Dominion of Canada, but also the amount for which Ontario is liable, and also the value of the school lands which have not yet been sold.\"\n\"And whereas it was also provided by the said agreement that all the accounts therein referred to should be brought down and extended to the thirty-first day of December, eighteen hundred and ninety-two inclusive;\n\"And whereas it is alleged and appears that at that date there remained to be collected by the Province of Ontario a large sum consisting of uncollected balances of the price of the Common School Lands theretofore sold;\n\"And whereas it is in substance claimed on behalf of the Province of Quebec that the amount of such uncollected balances should be ascertained, and that the Province of Ontario should be charged or debited, and the Common School Fund credited therewith, or with such proportion thereof as is right, fair and just;\n\"And whereas on behalf of the Province of Ontario it is objected that we, the said arbitrators, have no jurisdiction to entertain the claim so made on behalf of the Province of Quebec;\n\"And whereas we have heard the parties and what was alleged by them respectively;\n\"Now therefore we, the said John Alexander Boyd and George Wheelock Burbidge (the said Louis Napoleon Casault dissenting) proceeding upon our view of a disputed question of law do award, order and adjudge that we, the said arbitrators have no authority or jurisdiction to entertain the said claim. \"This award is made without prejudice to the rights and interests of the Province of Quebec in such uncollected balances and to its right to have the same saved and excepted in any final award made in the matters submitted to us.\n\"In witness whereof, we, the said John Alexander Boyd, Louis Napoleon Casault, and George Wheelock Burbidge have hereunto set our hands and seals this thirteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred.\n\"J. A. BOYD,\" [Seal.]\n\"L N. CASAULT,\" |Seal.]\n\"GEO. W. BURBIDGE.\" [Seal.]\n\"Signed, sealed and published in the presence of \"L. A. AUDETTE.\"\nThe reasons of the Honourable Chancellor Sir John A. Boyd and of Mr. Justice Burbidge in support of said award, were as follows:\nBOYD C.\u2014The Common School Fund is not composed in part of lands set apart for Common School purposes under Con. Stat. Canada, Cap. 26, nor is it in part composed of the uncollected proceeds of the sale of the said lands.\n\"It is entirely a fund represented by such moneys when collected by the Province of Ontario; but it consists of moneys in hand and not of claims to recover money by any right of action or other method of recovery.\n\"This und in hand is what is dealt with by the award of the first arbitratrators pursuant to the British North America Act, and in my opinion this board has no jurisdiction under the present deed of submission as to anything that does not form such fund.\n\"The submission to the board as to the amount of the Common School Fund for which Ontario is liable does not, as I read it, cover the case of outstanding moneys the proceeds of the price of such lands yet uncollected.\n\"I do not repeat what was said on a former occasion against any 'wilful default' clause being imported into the award of the first arbitrators contrary to the expressed terms of that award. But I see no reason to change what I then said on account of anything decided in the last appeal by the Supreme Court of Canada. I think Quebec should take nothing by its motion.\"\n(Sgd.) \"J. A. BOYD.\"\n13th June, 1900.\nBURBIDGE J.\u2014\"By the fourth paragraph of the deed of submission under which this arbitration is proceeding it is provided that all the accounts referred to therein shall be brought down and extended to the thirty-first day of December, eighteen hundred and ninety-two inclusive.\n\"On the sales of lands set apart for the purposes of the Common Schools of the late Province of Canada there remained at that time to be collected by the Province of Ontario sums amounting in the aggregate to something less than half a million of dollars. It is now claimed for the Province of Quebec that this amount should be ascertained by the arbitrators, debited to the Province of Ontario and credited to the Common School Fund as part of the principal thereof To that claim the Province of Ontario answers that this is a matter in respect of which the arbitrators have no jurisdiction.\n\"By the deed of submission the arbitrators are in general terms given jurisdiction among other things, in all matters of account between the two provinces. That is, I think, the effect of clause (f) of the second paragraph of the submission read in connection with what therein precedes it. Then follows the provision, omitting clause (g) which is not material to the question now under discussion:\u2014\n\"3. It is further agreed that the following matters shall be referred to the said arbitrators for their determination and awarded in accordance with the provisions of the said statutes, namely:\u2014\"\n\"(h) The ascertainment and determination of the amount of the principal of the Common School Fund, the rate of interest which should be allowed on such fund, and the method of computing such interest; (i) In the ascertainment of the. amount of the principal of the said Common School Fund the arbitrators are to take into consideration not only the sum now held by the Government of the Dominion of Canada; but also the amount for which Ontario is liable, and also the value of the school lands which have not yet been sold.\"\n\"Now it would appear that as there is a special submission of the question of the ascertainment and determination of the amount of the principal of the Common School Fund, it must be taken and understood that it was not the intention of the parties to submit that question by the more general reference and words preceding, and to which allusion has been made. That is made very certain, it seems to me, by the words with which the third paragraph opens: 'It is further agreed that the following matters shall be referred.' Showing clearly that it was in the minds of the parties that the general words preceding did not include this matter of the ascertainment of the amount of the principal of the Common School Fund.\n\"What then is the authority given to the arbitrators in respect to the ascertainment of this fund? They are to take into consideration:\n(1). The sum then held by the Dominion of Canada; (2). The amount for which Ontario was at the time liable; and\n(3). The value of the school lands that have not yet been sold.\n\"The value of the latter, it turns out, is not considerable, and one may be at some loss to see why it should have been thought necessary to refer this matter, and make no allusion to the large sum that represented at that date the uncollected balances in respect of lands that had been sold. But the reason or motive for the omission is not a matter with which the arbitrators should concern themselves. The important consideration is that they are not by the deed of submission given any power to value these uncollected balances. It is suggested, however, that the arbitrators may in effect do that by declaring and awarding that Ontario is liable for this amount, or for such a portion of it as may be thought to be fair and just. With that view I cannot agree. Up to the thirty-first day of December, 1892, beyond which date the arbitrators cannot go (at least without the agreement of parties) the Government of the Province of Ontario had, so far as the facts before us show, done nothing that would prevent them from collecting all of the portions of such moneys as would constitute the Province of Quebec's share therein, As to the share of the Province of Ontario, that being their own, the Government could, with the authority of the legislature, which they had, do what they thought best. Nor do I see any reason to believe that because of the delays that have taken place, these uncollected balances were at the time mentioned uncollectable. I do not think we have jurisdiction, by holding the Province of Ontario liable therefor, or for some proportion thereof, in substance and effect, to value these outstanding moneys, the parties themselves not having given us by their submission any such power. \"And I am confirmed in that view by the fact that the deed of submission having been executed on the 10th of April, 1893, the Legislature of the Province of Quebec on the 8th of January, 1894 (57 Vict. c. 3), and the Legislature of the Province of Ontario on the 5th of May, 1894 (57 Vict. c. 11) passed statutes in which, among other things, it was provided that the Governments of the two provinces might agree upon a price to be paid by the Province of Ontario for the acquisition by it of the uncollected balances of the price of the Common School Lands.\"\n(Signed) \"GEO. W. BURBIDGE.\nThe reasons of the Honourable Chief Justice Sir Louis Napoleon Casault in support of his dissent from said award were as follows:\u2014\nCASAULT C.J.\u2014\"By her claim bearing date the 9th December, 1899, Quebec asks:\n\"6. That the said uncollected balances, to wit, both of principal and interest, mentioned in said statement No. 6 ought to be and be deemed, held and treated, in all respects as moneys received by Ontario from and on account of the Common School Lands and as part of the principal of the Common School Fund or moneys in the hands of Ontario on the 31st December, 1892, at the latest, and for which Ontario then, was and still is liable with interest.\nThat in default of the honourable arbitrators determining that the said 31st of December, 1892, is a proper date by which said balances are to be deemed as part of the principal of the Common School Fund in the hands of Ontario, and for which she is liable, that they do fix and determine the proper date or dates at or by which Ontario ought to be considered to have received said balances\u2014Quebec alleging that Ontario ought to have collected in the said balances long prior to 1892,\" and concludes that her claim be maintained, as set forth, or that the arbitrators make such other award in the premises as law or equitable principles may authorise.\"\n\"Ontario objects that the claim of Quebec is not within the terms of the submission under which the Board of Arbitrators acquired jurisdiction.\n\"The submission as agreed by the Dominion and the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec referred 'the following questions, as mentioned in the order of the Governor General in Council, of the twelfth day of December, 1890,' namely:\n'1. All questions relating or incident to the accounts between the Dominion and the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec and to accounts between the two Provinces of Ontario and Quebec.\n'The accounts are understood to include the following particulars:\n(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) are omitted because they refer only to accounts between the Dominion and the provinces.\n'(f) All matters of account (1) between the Dominion and either of the two provinces, and (2) between the two provinces.\n'3. It is further agreed that the following matters shall be referred to the said arbitrators for their determination and award, in accordance with the provisions of the said statutes, namely:\n'(g) The rate of interest, if any, to be allowed in the accounts between the two provinces, and also whether such interest shall be compounded, and in what manner.\n'(h) The ascertainment and determination of the amount of the principal of the Common School Fund, the rate of interest which should be allowed on such fund, and the method of computing such interest.\n'(i) In the ascertainment of the amount of the principal of the said Common School Fund; the arbitrators are to take into consideration, not only the sum now held by the Government of the Dominion of Canada, but also the amount for which Ontario is liable, and also the value of the school lands which have not yet been sold.'\n\"It is true that 'The Common School Fund' under the statute 12 V. ch. 100, which gave it existence, and ch. 26 of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, was the moneys arising in principal and interest from the sale of the 1,000,000 acres of lands set apart for that object. But the reference itself shows that afterwards 'The Common School Fund' was meant to include moneys uncollected and even the unsold lands, since it directed that, in the ascertainment of the principal of the Common School Fund, the arbitrators were directed to take into consideration not only the sum then held by the Dominion, but also the amount for which Ontario was liable and the value of the lands not then sold. This direction makes it evident that the parties intended 'The Common School Fund' to mean and comprise not only the moneys received on the price of land sold, but also the uncollected balances and the lands unsold. And the statutes of Quebec, 57 V. ch. 3, and that of Ontario 57 V. ch. 11, both recognizing the fund to be composed of lands unsold, uncollected balances and amounts collected on price and interest of lands sold, leave, in my mind, no possible doubt upon that point.\n\"It appears, by the deposition of Mr. Hyde, that the uncollected balances on the school lands sold were, on the 31st December, 1892, $485,801.65, and the accounts and correspondence show that from the 31st of June, 1867, to the 20th of April, 1890, Ontario had collected $936,729.33, for which she had accounted to and been debited by the Dominion, on the 1st December, 1889, for a part, and on the 20th April, 1890, for the rest. From this latter date to the 20th of December following, date of the Order in Council mentioned in the fifth paragraph of the submission, the amount collected, if any, could have been but a trifle compared to the almost half million outstanding. Is it possible to suppose that the parties to the submission, and especially the representatives of Quebec, had only in view that trifle, and that other, the value of the 3,383 acres of land unsold, which is all that is proved by Mr. Hyde to have remained unsold on the 31st December, 1892, of the 1,000,000 acres, and not the half million of uncollected balances?\n\"If the possible amount collected by Ontario, after the 20th April, 1890, had been what the parties meant, they would have been written 'the sum now held by 'the Governments of the Dominion of Canada and of the 'Province of Ontario\" in lieu of, but also the amount for 'which Ontario is liable.'\n\"The word 'liable' is construed by the counsel for Ontario as meaning the moneys which that province had received and had in hand. I have just shewn that the parties to the submission did not attach that meaning to the use they made of that expression; but moreover under the law as it stood, it appears to me to have a larger one. Section 109 of 'The British North America Act' made, not only the lands situated in Ontario the property of that province, but also 'all sums then due and payable for such lands, subject to any trust existing in respect thereof and to any other interest than that of that province in the same.' The uncollected amounts then due for school lands were thereby made the property of Ontario subject to the trust in favour of the common schools of both Ontario and Quebec representing Upper and Lower Canada. Being made the owner of said uncollected amounts, Ontario became the debtor of the portion which was to be applied to the Common Schools of Ontario and Quebec, and liable towards the same. It is the view which the framers of the submission seem to have taken and the meaning which they have attached to the word 'liable' as comprising not only what Ontario had collected, but all sums then due and payable for the school lands which she was not entitled to retain for collection or otherwise.\n\"Quebec in claiming that we do award that said uncollected balances are moneys held and received by Ontario on account of the Common School Fund and moneys in her hands bearing interest from the 31st of December, 1892, or from such other date which we should decide, appears to me to be asking more than we are authorized to do, and we may so decide.\n\"But I cannot concur in the opinion expressed in the note which The Honourable Sir John Boyd has sent me, nor agree to the draft of award submitted and which appears to adopt the same idea.\n\"I have twice already expressed the opinion that in determining, under the reference, the amount of 'The Common School Fund' the arbitrators were bound to take in consideration those uncollected balances. I have not changed my opinion.\n\"Quebec, in the last paragraph of her claim, concludes that, if we do not allow what is her principal demand, we make such other award as in law and equity she may be entitled to, which means in relation to said uncollected balances.\n\"I think that this includes a request that, in the ascertainment of the amount of the principal of the said 'Common School Fund' we should take into consideration those uncollected balances. I am of opinion that so far we have jurisdiction, and I think that we should so award. I therefore think that in rejecting the part of the Quebec claim which demands that Ontario be debited of the said uncollected balances as of moneys which she had received on the 31st December, 1892, we should appoint the two provinces to proceed to the ascertainment of the amount of the said uncollected balances which, after deduction of five per cent for management and twenty-five per cent from such of them as are subject to the improvement fund, we should decide to form part of the principal of the said 'Common School Fund.'\n\"The statutes 57 Vict. ch. 11, of Ontario and 57 Vict. ch. 3 of Quebec do not appear to me to afford argument against that determination. The object of those two statutes is to establish the value of said uncollected balances, which is not within our powers, and to discharge Ontario from any further responsibility to Quebec for said balances and the unsold school lands, by making over to Ontario the interests of Quebec in the same, and that, for a consideration which the arbitrators have no right to fix or even to consider at present.\n(Signed), \"L. N. Casault.\"\nDuffy K.C. (Treasurer of the Province of Quebec), and Lafleur K.C. for the appellant.\n\u00c6. Irving K.C. and Shepley K.C. for the Province of Ontario, respondent.\nHogg K.C for the Dominion of Canada, respondent. The judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014In a judgment in a former appeal arising out of this arbitration relating to the Common School Fund, (reported in 28 Can. S.C.E. 609, at page 804), I have stated the nature of the questions submitted to the arbitrators relative to the fund in question. In proceedings before the arbitrators since that judgment was delivered, a question which a majority of them, (Mr. Justice Burbidge and Chancellor Boyd), have treated as a question of jurisdiction, has arisen and has been determined adversely to the Province of Quebec. The arbitrators having certified that they proceeded on a disputed question of law, the matter has been brought by appeal to this court.\nBy the agreement or submission of the tenth of April, 1890[1], amongst other matters referred were the following:\n(h) The ascertainment and determination of the principal of the Common School Fund, the rate of interest which would be allowed on such fund, and the method of computing such interest.\n(i) In the ascertainment of the amount of the principal of the said Common School Fund, the arbitrators are to take into consideration not only the sum now held by the Government of the Dominion of Canada, but also the amount for which Ontario is liable and also the value of the school lands which have not yet been sold.\nThe Province of Quebec having claimed that Ontario is liable; (1) for purchase money of lands sold which may have been remitted by the Province of Ontario to the purchasers; (2) for purchase moneys which might, if due diligence had been used, have been collected from the purchasers by Ontario, but which, owing to the neglect and default of the provincial officers, have not been collected but have been lost; (3) for lands which might have been sold but have not been sold; and (4) for all uncollected balances of purchase money, the majority of the arbitrators held that they had no jurisdiction under the submission to take cognizance of such claims and, for that reason, declined to entertain the question on the merits.\nAs intimated on the argument, a majority of the court consider the decision to be erroneous. The clear and distinct words of the reference, which require the arbitrators \"to take into consideration the amount for which Ontario is liable\" seem to us to make it impossible that a claim that Ontario is liable for uncollected balances of purchase moneys as well as for the wilful default and neglect of its officers can possibly be outside the terms of the reference.\nWhatever may be the result upon the merits, at least the Province of Quebec, when it asserts a claim for these moneys remitted and lost to the fund, or not realised, by the omissions of Ontario, is entitled to be heard and cannot be repelled in limine upon the pretention that there is a want of jurisdiction when in the very words of the submission it is referred to the arbitrators to ascertain the amount of Ontario's liability. In order to support the ruling of the arbitrators rejecting the claim without hearing the parties, it is not now competent for counsel for Ontario to travel into the merits of the case and show that, as a matter of law, upon the construction of the submission, of previous awards, and of legislative acts, the Province of Ontario cannot be made liable for these claims. Quebec has a right to urge this liability before the arbitrators in the first instance and this they have been prevented from doing by the denial of jurisdiction. We need not amplify these reasons for our decision as we agree in the arguments stated by Chief Justice Casault in his dissenting opinion so far as it bears on the question of jurisdiction.\nThe appeal is allowed and it is referred back to the arbitrators with a declaration that they have jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate upon the claims made by the Province of Quebec.\nGWYNNE J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal is made in assertion of a right on the part of the appellant to apply to the arbitration between the Provinces of Quebec and Ontario under the terms of a submission entered into by the provinces, a principle which the Court of Chancery applies and applies only in cases of accounts ordered to be taken between cestuis que trustent and their trustees having imposed on them a duty to collect, receive and apply to the uses of their cestuis que trustent moneys belonging to them; and between mortgagors and their mortgagees in possession. The appellant claimed before the arbitrators a right to have an inquiry made as to whether or not the Government of the Province of Ontario had by wilful default and neglect failed or delayed in collecting any money which when received would belong to the Common School fund in which both provinces have a common interest, and if it should appear that they had, then the appellant claimed to have the right to charge against the Province of Ontario in the arbitration, the amount which should be so ascertained as if in fact this money had been received by the Government of the province. The arbitrators declined to enter upon any such inquiry for the reason that in their judgment such an inquiry did not come within the terms of the submission under which they acquired jurisdiction. From that decision this appeal is taken. In the arguments before us the appellant, by its learned counsel, pressed upon us that it does not charge the Government of Ontario with having been guilty of any such wilful default or neglect, nor does it allege that any loss has accrued to the school fund by reason of any moneys not having been collected and reserved by the Province of Ontario\u2014that all that the appellant asked is an inquiry into the matter\u2014and of coarse consequential directions, as it should appear, and that the appellant insisted that not to allow the appeal would be, in effect, an adjudication in the negative upon the merits of the question, whether or not Ontario had been guilty of such unlawful default and neglect. I endeavoured to point out at the time what appeared to me to be, and what still appears to me to be, the fallacy of this contention. It needs no argument; all may be summed up in this short sentence\u2014it is difficult to understand how the declining to enter upon an inquiry into any subject for the reason of want of jurisdiction can be construed into a determination of the subject matter upon its merits either in the affirmative or the negative. This, however, was the sole argument used before us.\nRegarding then the question as it is, as one only of the construction of the submission to arbitration it is simply this: Did the Government of the Province of Ontario by the submission to arbitration, in which it has concurred with the Government of the Province of Quebec, submit to the judgment of the arbitrators the determination of the question whether or not it is liable to account as a defaulting trustee as being guilty by wilful default and neglect in not having collected money which when collected and received by the Government belongs to the school fund? The arbitrators have as I have said expressed their opinion that no such question is by the submission remitted to them to determine. In this opinion and in the reasons upon which it has been founded I concur, and I am therefore of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant: N. W. Trenholme.\nSolicitor for Ontario, respondent: \u00c6. Irving.\nSolicitor for Canada, respondent: W. D. Hogg.\n[1] 28 Can. S. C. R. 804.\n"}

S. Q.\u2014 Arbitration\u2014Condition precedent\u2014New grounds taken on appeal\u2014 Assessment of damages\u2014Interference by appellate court.\nA deed conveying a portion of the vendor's lands bordering on a stream granted the privilege of constructing dams, etc., therein, with the proviso that, in case of damages being caused through the construction of any such works, the vender or his successors in title to the adjoining lands should be entitled to have the damages assessed by arbitrators and that the purchasers should pay the amount awarded.\nHeld, that, under the deed, the purchasers were liable, not only for damages caused by the flooding of lands, but also for all other damages occasioned by the building of dams and other works in the stream by them; and, that the provisions of Art. 5535 R. S. Q., did not entitle them to construct or raise such dams without liability for all damages thereby caused.\nHeld, also, that an objection as to arbitration and award being a condition precedent to an action for such damages which had been waived or abandoned in the Court of Queen's Bench, could not be invoked on an appeal to the Supreme Court.\nOn a cross-appeal the Supreme Court refused to interfere with the amount awarded for damages in the court below upon its appreciation of contradictory evidence.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side), reversing the judgment of the Superior Court District of Terrebonne, and maintaining the plaintiffs' action for damages to the extent of $510, with costs.\nThe circumstances under which the action was brought and the questions at issue are sufficiently stated in the judgments now reported.\nThe defendants' appeal asked for the restoration of the judgment at the trial by which the action had been dismissed with costs. The plaintiffs by cross-appeal asked for increased damages.\nJ. A. N. Mackay K.C. and Alfred Mackay for the appellants. By the special terms of their title deed, as well as by the common and statute law, the appellants, having their mills in operation are entitled to use the waters of the stream and improve the water-power by the construction of the dams complained of, paying, however, such damages as might, on reference to arbitration, be awarded for injury to the lands bordering on the stream Art. 503 C C.; Art. 5535 R. S. Q.; C. S. L. C. ch. 51; Jones v. Fisher ([1]).\nThe vendor of the appellants was not a mill owner, but a farmer, and no mills, at the time. existed on the stream; the clause relating to damages was clearly intended to protect the farm lands in view of the extensive rights in the stream then conveyed to the manufacturers proposing to utilise the water power. The estimate of the experts as to damages covered alleged injury by the damming back of the water. This right was granted by the deed which, by its registration, was sufficient notice to respondents, who purchased subsequently, that this right was a prior charge upon the waters of the stream.\nThe court was not bound by the report of the\nexperts; Art. 409 C. P. Q.; Bell v. City of Quebec ([2]);\nArts 1013-1019 C. C.; City of Montreal v. Drum\nmond([3]). In any case the action is premature because both under the agreement and by the law relating to the improvement of watercourses, a reference to arbitration and award had thereon are conditions precedent. Guerin v. Manchester Insurance Co. ([4]).\nAtwater K.C. and Beauchamp K.C. for the respondents. Neither Art. 5535 nor the agreement as to arbitration can oust the tribunals of their jurisdiction. The cumulative remedy afforded thereby leaves the jurisdiction of the courts as it was before. Hardcastle on Statutes (3 ed.) pp. 130-136. By consenting to expertise the defendants waived arbitration, and they failed to ask it when served with the notarial protest in 1888.\nThe appellants have no special or exclusive rights either by virtue of the statute or under the agreement; they must in any case pay all damages caused by damming the stream whether it he by the flooding of the lands or by drowning the water-power above them. We rely upon Emend v. Gauthier ([5]); Jean v. Gauthier ([6]); Frechette v. Compagnie Manufacturi\u00e8re de St. Hyacinthe ([7]) remarks by Sir Arthur Hobhouse at pages 178-180; Megantic Pulp Co. v.

Germain ([13]); 2 Demolombe \" Contract \" No. 4.\nThe registration of appellants' deed has no effect upon our rights in the waters of the stream. Art. 2085 C. C.. Trainor v.

M\u00e9nard ([17]); Morrison v. City of Montreal ([18]); Lemoine v. city of Montreal ([19]).\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014The plaintiffs, respondents, who are owners of a lot of land and a dam across the North River, at Lachute, allege that the appellants who own a property and a dam across the said river a few hundred feet further down, have, in 1888, by raising their said dam and increasing thereby the volume of water backed up by it, overflowed the respondents' own dam, diminished the force of their water power flooded their land, and damaged trees and a quarry thereon, for which they claim $5,000 by this action.\nBoth parties derive their titles from one Peter Cruise, the appellants by a deed of 1876, the respondents by a deed of 1880, both duly registered.\nThe appellants pleaded to the action that by their deed of purchase of 1876, from Cruise, they had acquired, in addition to the land therein specified, the right to use the waters of the said river as they please wherever the said river flows past any of the land then bought by them, as well as wherever it flows past Cruise's land above it comprising the land since sold by said Cruise to the respondents and that consequently, they had the right to overflow the respondents' dam as they had done. The clause of their deed under which the appellants base their said claim to so dam the said river, whatever may be the effect of it on respondents' own dam further up the river reads as follows: The vendor sells assigns and transfers to Hamelin and Ayers, present appellants A certain piece or parcel of land lying, being and situated in the seigniory of Argenteuil forming part and being comprised in the quantity of land purchased by the seller as hereinafter stated, containing one acre in width running along the shore of the North River on the south side thereof, by an acre in depth towards the property of the seller in such a manner as to form the quantity of two acres m superficies of the property of the said seller, bounded in front by the waters of the said North River and in rear on both sides by the said seller, with all ways, water, watercourses, privileges, commodities, advantages, emoluments, appurtenances whatsoever in, over and upon that part of the said North River in and appertaining to the said premises as the said purchaser may choose to disturb, arrest, impede and cause to raise up by dams or other artificial means.\nThis deed however, contains another clause, which the respondents invoke as giving them the right to be indemnified for the damages which the appellants have caused to them by the overflowing of their (the respondents') land and the diminution of their water power by the appellants raising their own dam in 1888. This other clause reads as follows:\nIt being well understood between the said parties that should the said seller or his heirs or assigns at any time hereinafter sustain any damage or loss, for and by. reason of any work, construction or erection of dams or other fixtures or building by and on the part of the said purchasers or their heirs or assigns in and about the said premises that then and in that case such damages and losses shall be submitted to the award, order, arbitrament final end and determination of two persons indifferently chosen between them as arbitrators with power to the sail arbitrators to name an umpire or third arbitrator in case of a difference of opinion between them touching and concerning the matter so submitted to them, by either of the said parties hereunto, for final adjustment. The said parties hereunto agreeing to stand to, obey, abide, observe, perform, fulfil and keep the award, order, arbitrament, final end and determination of the said arbitrators or any two of them in and about all or any of the matters to be submitted to them, the whole under all costs, losses, damages and interests.\nThe appellants' contention is that this reserve of the right to claim damages is confined to damages to the land itself and cannot be construed as extending to damages caused by the use of the water power itself, which was sold to them together with the land. That contention was upheld by the Superior Court, but rejected by the Court of Appeal.\nThe appellants seem to me right in their contention that, by the deed of 1876, they have acquired the right to dam this river as they have done, and cause the waters to rise over the respondents' premises. I take that to be conceded by the respondents who by their protest in 1888, and by this action merely claim the damages resulting to them from the appellants' works under the clause of the deed to appellants by which they bound themselves to pay such damages, when arising.\nBut the appellants' further contention that they are not liable for all the damages caused to their seller (or to respondents, his representatives) but only for the damages caused to the land itself, by the erection of dams or other works on the property bought by them is, in my opinion, unfounded.\nTheir deed of purchase, as I read it, clearly says that if any damage whatsoever is later on sustained by Crusse or his representatives by reason of any dam or work erected by the appellants on the property purchased the amount of the said damages shall be ascertained by arbitration. I cannot see how such a general, unambiguous clause can by interpretation be restricted as applying exclusively to damages to the land. They purchased two acres of land, with in addition the right to cause the waters to back up and so destroy all the benefit that their seller could derive from that part of the river that flowed past the property he retained above the one sold for the sum of $60, and $60 only, because the damages to the seller could not then be ascertained, depended on an and the lesser or greater elevation of the dam the purchaser might build, and might never accrue; therefore not including them, hut reserving the amount thereof to be determined later on whenever they accrued, if ever they did. It is incumbent on the appellants who claim the exorbitant right of causing damage and not to pay for it to establish their contentions by an unequivocal title. And they have failed to do so. Indeed, they have proved the contrary. By their own title, they are liable for all dam ages without any reserve or restriction.\nThe fact that by Art 5535 of the Revised Statutes (Q.) the appellants might have had the right of raising their dam as they did on condition of paying all the damages resulting therefrom does not, that I can see, militate against the respondents' contention. Assuming that it might be so if the deed of 1876 were ambiguous as to the damages, its language is so clear that it cannot but be held to mean what it says. Moreover, though legal warranty, for instance, is implied by law without stipulation in a contract of sale it could not be contended that a stipulation amounting to nothing more in a deed of sale is to be read out of the deed. Likewise as to legal community, a clause in a contract of marriage stipulating it is not void because it is superfluous.\nThe appellants further contended that no damages recoverable in law had been proved by the respondents. The Court of Appeal allowed $500, being the depreciation of the value of their property resulting to them from the appellants' raising of their dam in 1885. That seems to have been a fair basis of the amount of damages in this case.\nAs to the arbitration being a condition precedent to respondents' action, that point must be considered as abandoned. There is no allusion whatever to it in the appellants' factum, and there was none in their factum in the Court of Appeal in whose formal judgment the point is consequently not alluded to. They cannot raise here an objection which they waived in the court appealed from.\nAs to the amount of damages, on the cross appeal Of the respondents, I do not see that there is any room for our interference. The evidence on this point is very contradictory. According to some of the wit nesses, the respondents would have suffered none at all.\nI would dismiss appeal and cross-appeal with costs.\nGWYNEE J. (dissenting).\u2014The plaintiffs in their declaration allege that the defendants are in possession of certain lands abutting on the North River at Lachute, in the Province of Quebec, which they purchased from one Peter Cruise in 1876 and 1880. That it was specially stipulated by the said deeds of sale that the said defendants, their heirs and assigns should be responsible for all loss or damage which should at any time be sustained by the said Peter Cruise, his heirs or assigns, by reason of the erection of a dam or other obstructions by the said defendants upon the said pieces of land. That the defendants erected a dam of five feet in height upon the said pieces of land. That subsequenly in 1886 one Robert Bannerman being then seized of a piece of land abutting on the North River, about 1,500 or 1,700 feet higher up the river than the piece sold by Cruise to the defendants which said piece of land the said Robert Bannerman also acquired by purchase from the said Cruise and that he con jointly with one J. C. Ireland who was proprietor of land at the other side of the North River, opposite to the piece of land purchased by Bannerman from Cruise, built upon their land a dam across the river. The declaration then alleges the death of the said Robert. Bannerman and the acquisition by the plaintiffs of the property of which he died seized, including the piece of land so purchased by him from Cruise, and the half of the said dam so constructed conjointly \"with Ireland across the river. The declaration then alleges that in the months of August and September, 1898, the defend ants increased considerably the height of the dam which they had erected across the river and thereby forced back the waters of the river to the prejudice of the plaintiffs' one-half interest in the said dam of five hundred dollars, and also thereby inundated the plain tiffs' land and destroyed divers trees growing thereon, and inundated a large quantity of valuable stones the property of the plaintiffs, and damaged a rope walk, &c. &c. To this declaration the defendants pleaded by way of peremptory exception that by article 5535 of the Revised Statutes of the Province of Quebec the plaintiffs' remedy for the causes of action stated is by arbitration as provided in that section, and not by an action and that moreover by deed of sale of the date of 4th of November 1876 from Cruise to the defend ants of part of the land whereon the defendants erected their dam he, Cruise, granted to the defendants the right and privileges of inundating the lands in question by reason of dams or otherwise, and that if any damage should be thereby caused to the said lands the same should be ascertained and determined by arbitration as therein provided. That the lands in respect of which the plaintiffs claim damages are some of which Cruise was proprietor at the time of the passing of the deed of the 4th November 1876, and which he subsequently by a deed of the 18th June, 1880, sold to the plaintiffs' auteur.\nThe defendants plead further that by the deed of 4th November 1876, they acquired all the water power and absolute right to. all the water power of the river as abutting on the land sold by Cruise to Bannerman as on that sold to the defendants They then plead that Ireland's interest in the same was sold to the defendants by deed dated the 25th February 1892. That this last mentioned dam whereof the plaintiffs are possessed in common with the defendants has never been used for any purpose. That it serves no useful purpose. That the plaintiffs have never expressed an intention of utilising it for any purpose whatever, and that up to the present day no use whatever has been made of it nor has there been any need of it for any purpose whatever.\nTo these pleas the plaintiffs answer in law to the peremptory exception, and as to the other pleas of the defendants they simply assert that the allegations of the defendants are in point of fact false.\nThe court having ordered the issues of fact to be tried before determining the issue in-law the case was brought down for trial before experts to whom these issues had been remitted by the court. In the reference to the experts several questions were submitted to them to inquire into and report upon. To only some of them will it be necessary to refer, but before doing so it will be proper here briefly to refer to the agreement between F. C. Ireland and Robert Bannerman in virtue of which the dam was erected of which the plaintiffs as they themselves claim and the defendants are now proprietors in common. That agreement is contained in a notarial deed bearing date the 31st day of July, 1886, whereby it was agreed that a dam should be abutted on the property of Ireland upon one side of the river and of Bannerman on the other; and that it should be constructed across the river in the form prescribed in the deed to the height of four feet and a half from lower water mark and when built should be maintained at the common and equal cost and charge of Ireland and Bannerman and of their respective heirs and assigns. Then follows the special provision following:\nShould the said dam require to be raised beyond the height herein above mentioned to furnish more power, or lowered on account of causing any damage to the water power above as hereinafter stipulated such works shall be performed at equal costs and expenses by the said parties but the said dam shall in no way interfere with the rights already accrued to other interested parties having water power above the said dam to be constructed by the said appearants. Should either of the said parties require to make additional works other than the dam proper such work shall be performed by one of the said appearants requiring the same, and should any such additional works other than the dam proper made by either of the said parties requiring the same for supply of water in any way, cause a leakage or damage to the said dam proper and lessen or interfere with the water power of the other it shall be repaired immediately by the one of the said appearants who shall have built the same on pain of all costs, damages and interest to the party suffering from the same. Each of the said appearants shall be the proprietor of the one half of the water furnished by the dam so intended to be erected as aforesaid.\nThe first two questions submitted by the court to the experts to report upon are as follows:\n1st. Have the defendants, by raising the height of the dam, inundated that of the plaintiffs and have they thereby caused the plain tiffs damage as alleged in the declaration?\n2nd. If such damage has bees caused to the plaintiffs what is the total amount of it?\nTo which the experts in their report reply\nthat the information given at the enqu\u00eate respecting damage caused to the said dam proper of the plaintiffs arising from the raising of the defendants' dam does not present any quality of certainty and does not rest upon any accurate observation\u2014that such damages can be established by the assistance of special tests; that under these circumstances the experts thought it to be their duty to rely more especially upon the results furnished by their own observations\u2014and so doing they arrived at the conclusion that the raising of the defendants' dam has not inundated the said dam proper of the plaintiffs, and so that there has been no damage upon that head.\n3rd. Is there at the foot of the said dam of the plaintiffs a fall in the water furnishing them with an additional height of about four feet and one-half or if not how much? To which they answer that\nfrom the foot of the dam to the surface of the still waters there is une d\u00e9nivellation superficielle which furnishes an equivalent to 2 feet 9\/100.\n4th. How much loss of horse-power has the raising of the defend ants dam caused to the dam of the plaintiff, and what value does such loss represent?\n7th. What is the value of one horse power at the place where the plaintiffs' dam is built?\n11th, Has the dam of the plaintiffs ever served any purpose of commerce or manufacture whatever and has it ever, up to the day upon which the present action was commenced, been of any use to the plaintiffs?\n12th. Has the dam of the plaintiffs lost value on the market or otherwise by the act of the defendants?\nI have grouped these questions together because they al relate to the plaintiffs' claim for damages alleged to have been caused to them at the dam.\nIn answer to the sixth question the experts, expressing their own opinion for there was no evidence before them on the subject, say that, in their opinion, the height of the fall at the plaintiffs' dam is to he measured from the height at the water above the dam to the surface of the water at the foot of a current which flows from the foot of the dam and so measuring that they find the penning back of the waters in the current below the dam to have diminished the disposable fall at plaintiffs' dam by two feet and one half.\nNow the dam of the plaintiffs is in a particular form prescribed by the terms of the deed in virtue of which it was erected namely in the shape of a [aVr] with its apex in the centre of the river; calling then the apex and the terminus of the leg on the plaintiffs' side of the river and that of the leg on the defendants' side and the current commencing at the foot of the dam at say the point marked c, and as the plaintiffs could never have any use of the water-power created by the dam unless the water should be drawn off on to their own land behind the point B it does not appear clear how the doing away with the current below the dam can diminish the fall of the water drawn off behind the point b. The experts however in estimating the value of an alleged diminution of power from such causes, say that in view of the topography of the places a manufactory could be placed upon the plaintiffs' property in such a manner as 10 use, as I understand them the whole of the plaintiffs' share in the water power created by the dam which by the terms of the deed in virtue of which the dam was erected was as we have seen one half of such water power; but the works in such manufactory for the operation of which the water from behind the dam should be conducted would naturally be above the surface of the waters in the river at the foot of the dam and why the height of the surface waters behind the dam should be measured to a point two feet and one half below the surface of the waters in the river at the foot of the dam and should be introduced as an element in determining the force of the water con ducted to such works for their operation no evidence was adduced or explanation offered; it may be more over, that the cost of erecting such manufactory and of conducting the water into it for the purpose of using such half of such water power would not justify a prudent person in incurring the expense; and it may be that herein can be found a sufficient reason to account for the fact that the water power never has been used by the plaintiffs or their predecessors in title for any commercial or useful purpose or by the plaintiffs for any purpose whatever save only that to which it has been applied in the present action, namely to base thereon a claim of right to prevent the defendants from using at their dam for manufacturing purposes the waters of the river up to the foot of the dam in which the plaintiffs have a half interest in common with the defendants.\nIn answer to the seventh question the experts say in substance that the evidence is so very contradictory that the only conclusion which can be drawn from it is that the value of a horse power is something between fifty (50) cents and thirteen dollars and fifty cents and they say that the conclusion they have drawn from this evidence aided by their own experience is, that a horse power is worth five dollars ($5) per annum, and they estimate therefore the loss of the 21\/2 feet in the fall mentioned in their answer to the sixth question at 53 horse power which at $5 per horse power makes $265 per annum.\nIn answer to the eleventh question they say that it does not appear in the evidence that the dam of the plaintiffs has ever served any purposes of commerce or manufacture whatsoever, and that up to the present time it has not been of any use whatever to the plaintiffs.\nThey answer the twelfth question by referring to their answers to the sixth and seventh questions, and say that the raising of the defendants' dam having diminished (according to their opinion) the plaintiffs' use of their share of the water power usable at the dam by 53 horse power the market value of the plaintiffs' share in the dam has been diminished. This answer simply amounts to this that diminution of water power at a dam by 53 horse-power necessarily diminishes the market value of the dam by the value of 53 horse power which in the present case the experts estimate at $5 per horse-power or $265 per annum, but this argument is based upon the assumption of a fact which is wanting in the present case namely that 371\/2\n[Page.548]\nwater-power for which since its creation in 1886 no use whatever has been found had a market value capable of being injuriously affected by the diminution of the power. Now from the report of the experts and the evidence taken before them it is established that the dam in which the plaintiffs have a share has never since its erection, nor the water power thereby created, been applied to any useful purpose whatever \u2014that the plaintiffs have never made any use of the dam save, as already observed, the use made of it in the present action\u2014 that the dam has not been damaged by the raising of the defendants' dam and that the plaintiffs have not sustained any actual damage whatever of the nature complained of in the plaintiffs' declaration, but that from the foot of the dam to the tranquil waters further down there was a current in the river having a fall of about 21\/2 feet (two and one half feet ) that this current has been done away with by the back waters caused by defendants' dam, and that in the estimation of the experts such change in the condition of the waters in the current has diminished the plaintiffs' share in the water power created by the dam which, although not made any use of by the plaintiffs hitherto could, in the opinion of the experts, be made use of if a manufactory should be erected on the plaintiffs' property at a point and in a manner observed by the experts as capable of using the whole of the \"plaintiffs' share in such water power but whether the cost of erecting such manufactory and of conducting the water into it for manufacturing purposes would justify any prudent man in incurring the necessary expenditure no evidence whatever has been produced upon which to form any opinion.\nThe only loss which the experts have suggested that the raising of the defendants dam has caused to the plaintiffs is the possible diminution theoretically conceived in the market value of a dam which since its erection to the present time has never served any useful purpose whatever and which for that reason may fairly be assumed to have had no market value. In estimating the marketable value of water power created by a dam there are many things to be taken into consideration besides an estimate of the cubic contents of the water used or capable of being used and of the height of the fall from the top of the dam where the water is drawn off for use to the place where the water is to be used. The cost of constructing a manufactory in which to use the water power and of conducting the water to the works in the manufactory must be taken into consideration, also the beneficial purpose to which the water power has been or can be applied, and the profitable character of such use based either upon experience by actual use of the water power or based upon some substantial material as to the profitable purpose to which the water power can be applied. None of those things have been taken into consideration by the experts in the present case, the estimate therefore which has been made by them is, in my opinion, not only theoretical, speculative and illusory and of no practical value but, in the present action, is irrelevant. The estimate is of a permanent diminution in value, by the act of the defendants, of the plaintiffs' share in the water power created by the dam, is purely theoretical, not based upon any practical experience in the use of the power, but it is as to the value of a permanent deprivatory of the plaintiffs of water power equivalent to 53 horse power but the plaintiffs do not by their action ask for any damages upon such a calculation\u2014they do not offer to surrender to the defendants the right to continue to deprive the plaintiffs of the water power if any there be by which the share of the plaintiffs in the water-power at the dam has been diminished by the defendants' dam of which diminution there is no sufficient evidence upon payment either of a sum calculated on the estimate of the experts nor upon payment of any sum nor would judgment for the plaintiffs in the present action have the effect of vesting in the defendants or of securing to them the permanent right forever of depriving the plaintiffs of the water-power, if any there be, of which the raising of the defendants' dam has deprived the plaintiffs. What the plaintiffs claim in their action, and what judgment in their favour therein would give them, would be compensation for whatever actual damages if any that they can shew they have already sustained, or nominal damages in case of infringement of a right without actual damages as yet sustained and judgment affirming their right to the continual enjoyment of the water-power if any there be of which they have been deprived, and to have the cause of such diminution of the water power removed and to restrain the continuance of the wrong if any there be which, as alleged in the declaration, has caused\u2014is causing and will continue to cause damage to the plaintiffs. Beyond this the court has no jurisdiction in the present action and it would be preposterous that the defendants should be compelled by the judgment of the court to pay to the plaintiffs the full value of the permanent deprivation of them of a thing the permanent retention of which the judgment cannot secure to the defendants.\nAs to the remaining heads of inquiry, namely, relating to damages alleged in the declaration to have been sustained by the plaintiffs\u2014by their land having been inundated a quantity of valuable stone flooded \u2014 a rope-walk damaged \u2014 and trees destroyed, it is sufficient to say that the experts report and that the evidence justifies such report that no damage whatever has been sustained by plaintiffs land by flood-waters backed from the defendants' dam\u2014no damage done to any stones or stone quarry, and no damage done to plaintiffs' rope-walk, and as to the damage claimed for tress alleged to have been destroyed they say that the evidence was wholly contradictory, and they set out in their report that evidence which on the plaintiffs' side consisted of the evidence of one of the plaintiffs who claimed that trees to the value of from $100 to $150 had been killed by the backwater\u2014 and of Peter Cruise who thought this too high an estimate and would go no further than $35, while five witnesses on the part of the defendants testified that there were no tress at all killed or damaged by back water and certainly it seems difficult to understand how trees could have been killed on plaintiffs' land by flood waters from the dam consistently with the finding that no damage was done to the plaintiffs' land from such cause although one of the plaintiffs swore that one half of the value of his land was destroyed by such cause. It would certainly seem that the evidence on the part of the plaintiffs as to the destruction of trees was as unreliable as that in relation to the flooding of their land; however the whole weight of the evidence was that no trees were damaged by back water and yet the experts in their report say that they were of opinion that damage to trees to the amount of $10 was caused by back water.\nUpon this report and the evidence referred to therein, the case came down before Mr. Justice H. T. Taschereau of the Superior Court who pronounced judgment therein allowing the answer in law to the peremptory exception and gave judgment in favour of the defend ants upon the residue of the issues joined in the action. Among the reasons upon which that judgment is founded the following are stated in the judgment: Considering that the report of the experts establishes that the defendants have not by the raising of their dam inundated that of the plaintiffs and that there is nothing due for damage upon that head, and that there has not been any inundation of the land of the plain tiffs nor damage caused to their manufacture (that is the rope walk claim), and that the plaintiffs have no claim for indemnity in respect of the pretended loss of a stone quarry.\nConsidering that the sole damage as ascertained by the experts has been caused to certain tress which the report values at ten dollars but that this opinion of the experts is not supported by the evidence and cannot be sustained by the court.\nAnd, considering that the plaintiffs' dam is of little value and has never been utilized, and that it is impossible upon the evidence to say that it ever can be advantageously made use of, and that a water power can only be valued in connection with a manufactory or manufacture already in existence with motive powers and that in the absence of such industry and of there motive powers the dam alone cannot have any appreciable mercantile value in prospect of the water which it may later on be employed to help more or less according to the industry and motive powers which may be connected with it, and so that the existence of a dam alone can give no more right to indemnity than the existence of the power of the water itself so long as it is not in active condition,\nand he concludes his judgment by saying:\nConsidering that from all the circumstances of the action disclosed by the enqu\u00e9te, the plaintiffs action appears vexatious and to have no legitimate foundation.\nUpon, a consideration of the whole case I can see no just ground of objection to these reasons upon which the learned judge has based his judgment. In my opinion, as already stated, there was no evidence whatever adduced from which an intelligent opinion can be formed of the market value of the plaintiffs' interest in the dam possessed by them in common with the defendants or of the value of any diminution of such value, if any such there be or which would justify the conclusion that in point of fact any diminution of the water power created by the dam, or any damage past, present or prospective, has in reality, been caused to the plaintiffs' share in the water rower created by the dam, by the raising of the defendants dam. From the judgment of the Superior Court the respondents appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench in Appeal, at Montreal l that court reversed the judgment of the Superior Court and pronounced judgment for the plaintiffs for $500 damages made up of $500 which the court estimated as representing the permanent loss of one-fourth of what the court estimated as being the full market value of the plaintiffs' interest in the dam, and $10 as the experts estimate of injury to trees.\nAs to the $500, although not as extravagant as the estimate of the experts it is nevertheless open to the same objections, namely, that it is not founded upon any sufficient evidence of any permanent or temporary damage past, present, or prospective, having been in fact occasioned to the plaintiffs' interest in the dam in question\u2014this estimate of total market value, and also of the one-fourth diminution of such value are also wholly arbitrary, unsupported by any sufficient evi deuce and moreover the judgment is also open to the same abjection as already alluded to in relation to the estimate of the experts, namely, that it awards the plaintiffs a sum of money estimated to be the full value of the permanent deprivation of the plaintiffs, of one fourth of the whole market value of the plaintiffs' interest in the dam while the judgment does not secure to the defendants the right to enjoy permanently the thing for which they are adjudged to pay unconditionally the estimated full value.\nAs to the ten dollars in respect of trees, that sum, as already shewn, was in the opinion of the learned judge of first instance and in fact not authorised by the evidence. The judgment of the Superior Court so adjudged, and I can see no reason for varying that judgment upon that point. There remains only the construction of the defend ants' title from Peter Cruise of the 4th of November 1876 which the defendants have in their plea insisted to be and still insist upon its being an absolute grant by Peter Cruise to the defendants, their heirs and assigns to pen back at their dam all the water in the river flowing along the whole extent of the land then owned by Cruise alongside of the river, of which he, by the deed of 4th November, 1876 sold a small piece to the defendants for the abutment of a dam then proposed to be erected by the defendants across the river.\nNow it may be admitted that in November, 1876, when Cruise sold that small piece of land to the defendants as he owned no land on the opposite side of the river and had consequently no mill site which he could then effectually use, the only damage which he contemplated as being possible to be done to him by the proposed dam of the defend ants was in respect of his land remaining to him being flooded by the backwater caused by the dam\u2014 the language of the deed, it is not disputed, secures to him that right but it is short of containing a grant as is contended by the defendants of all Cruise's interest in the water flowing past the whole of his land. On the contrary the words used literally pass only the small piece particularly described, including to the middle of the stream together with all the waters of the river passing along such small piece of land along side of the river A careful perusal of the sentence relied upon by the defendants shews that it is not very grammatically expressed but however read there is nothing in it I must say, which can, I think, warrant the contention of the defendants.\nIt was, I think, quite competent for Cruise notwithstanding his deed to the defendants, subsequently to acquire, on the opposite side of the river, a site whereon to abut on that side a dam to be built across the river to utilise any water-power available above the piece sold to the defendants, and Cruise's assignee, Robert Bannerman, would have the same right.\nJudgment therefore must be given against the defendants upon that plea; but this does not, except as to costs, affect the right of the defendants to judgment in the action which in my opinion, for the reasons already given, they ought to have. The appeal therefore of the defendants ought, in my opinion, to be allowed but without costs because of the defendants failing upon their plea of a grant from Cruise of the whole of the water-power in the river as aforesaid\nThe cross-appeal of the plaintiffs, the now respondents should be dismissed but without costs also for the reason that I do not think the costs have been appreciably increased by such cross-appeal.\nEach party should bear the costs of the appeal from the Superior Court to the Court of Queen's Bench, in appeal, for the reason that as I think the appellants there were only entitled to succeed in part namely, on the defendants' plea of grant from Cruise.\nThe plaintiffs should have costs incidental to the peremptory exception having been pleaded and all costs in the Superior Court incidental upon the plea of the grant of all the water in the river from Cruise and the defendants should have all the residue of the costs in the action.\nEach party should have the right of setting off one set of costs against the other\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: J.

J. and Taschereau, Gwynne, Girouard and Davies JJ.\nON APPEAL. FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nTitle to land\u2014Trespass\u2014Overhanging roof\u2014Right of view\u2014Evidence\u2014 Boundary line \u2014Waiver\u2014Servitude,\nIn 1844 the defendants constructed a toll-house close to or on the boundary of their land with windows overlooking an adjoining vacant lot and a roof projecting over it by about three feet. This was done with the knowledge and consent of persons who were then proprietors and was not objected to by them or any subsequent owner till after the purchase of the lot by the plain tiff in 1895 when he complained that the overhanging roof interfered with the gable of a house he was building upon it. He cut the roof to permit of the construction of the gable and defendants paid the costs of the necessary alteration. In .1900 the plaintiff instituted the present action against defendants to have the remaining projection of the roof demolished and the windows closed up. There was no evidence that there had ever been a division line established between the properties and the actual width of the land purchased and taken possession of by the plain tiff in 1895 was left in uncertainty.\nHeld,affirming the judgment appealed from, Strong C.J. dissenting, that the plaintiff had not satisfied the onus that was upon him of proving title to the strip of land in dispute and consequently that his action could not be maintained.\nHeld, further per Girouard J. following Delorme v. Cusson (28 S. C. R. 66) that, as the plaintiff and his auteurs had waived objection to the manner in which the toll-house had been constructed and per mitted the roof and windows to remain there, the demolition could not be required at least so long as the building continued to exist in the condition in-which it had been so constructed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, reversing the judgment of the Court of Review and restoring the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Quebec, which dismissed the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe questions at issue on this appeal are sufficiently stated in the head-note and in the judgements reported. It may be added that the defendants did not invoke title to the strip of land in dispute by pleading acquisitive prescription. There was a question raised, however, as to whether or not the action was an action p\u00e9titoire.\nPelletier K.C. for the appellant, cited Arts. 533-539, C. C.; Ferri\u00e8res, Coutume de Paris, vol. ii, p. 1521, tit. ix, Servitudes, Art. clxxxvi, no. 10; 2 Coquille, Coutume de Nivernois, Cap. 10, Art. 2 Egout.

The plaintiff produced with his action, for the purpose of qualifying his position a deed dated in 1895 in which his vendor declares his title to be under sheriff's deed which is not produced. It conveys thirty feet frontage on Grande All\u00e9e by sixty feet in depth. The defendants' title deed from the owner in 1843 describes the land sold as commencing 128 feet from the Quebec City limits. There never has been a regular bornage to establish the line between [the defendants' land and the lot purchased by the plaintiff between it and the city limits, and from the evidence, it is impossible to say whether or not the roof overhangs plaintiff's land, nor that the windows are within the distance prescribed by the Civil Code, Arts. 536, 537, 538. We deny any trespass; we claim to have built within our proper boundaries, and that the limits of plaintiff's title and possession are equivocal, by mere tolerance and promiscuous and insufficient to give him a right of action. Arts. 1064 to 1066 C. P. Q. We rely upon the following authorities viz.: Dali. Rep. \" Action Possessoire \" nos. 171, 175; 2 Aubry & Rau, 138, 159.\nThe plaintiff being the last comer by over forty-five years cannot maintain his possessory action without establishing such undisputed possession as to leave no doubt whatever that his possession was acquiesced in and had ousted that of the defendants.\nIt may be that the respondents tolerated encroachments or possibly joint possession of part of their land, but joint possession does not give rise to a possessory action.

Je suis d'avis, avec lui, de rejeter cet appel. Mais tout en partageant son opinion sur la question de droit qu'il a si savamment \u00e9lucid\u00e9e dans la cause de Delorme v. Cusson ([9]), dont il fait application \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente cause, je base la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle j'en suis venu dans l'esp\u00e8ce sur le motif que l'appelant n'a pas prouv\u00e9 le fait principal sur lequel repose son action celui de son droit \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des quelques pieds du terrain en litige. C'est \u00e0 ce fait que se borne toute la contestation entre les parties. Ce n'est pas un droit de servitude que les intim\u00e9s r\u00e9clament, c'est la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00eame de ces quelques pieds.\nIl incombait \u00e0 l'appelant de faire une preuve claire et positive de son principal all\u00e9gu\u00e9, savoir, que c'est sur son terrain que le larmier des intim\u00e9s d\u00e9verse les eaux pluviales, que c'est \u00e0 son terrain que s'\u00e9tend le droit de vue exerc\u00e9 par eux. Or, il m'est impossible de voir cette preuve au dossier Il n'y est pas, et il n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galement \u00e9tabli contradictoirement entre les parties, o\u00f9 commence et o\u00f9 finit la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelant, suivant leurs titres ou suivant la prescription acquisitive, s'il y a lieu. Et c'est l\u00e0, la question pr\u00e9judicielle. Il est autant possible que, par erreur commune, ce soit la maison de l'appelant et sa cl\u00f4ture qui empi\u00e8tent sur le terrain des intimes qu'il est possible que cc soit le pan est de la b\u00e2tisse des intim\u00e9s qui fasse la ligne de division entre eux et l'appelant.\nJ'attache peu d'importance \u00e0 ce que l'appelant dit s'\u00eatre pass\u00e9 entre lui et Burroughs en 1895, m\u00eame en supposant que Burroughs ait Pu lier les intim\u00e9s par ce qui se serait pass\u00e9 dans la circonstance. Que l'appelant place sa b\u00e2tisse l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il l'a fait leur \u00e9tait tout-\u00e0-fait indiff\u00e9rent mais si l'appelant leur e\u00fbt alors dit qu'il r\u00e9clamait le droit de leur faire reculer leur propre b\u00e2tisse, il n'aurait pas obtenu d'eux le consentement dont il voudrait se servir aujourd'hui comme une admission de son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 toute la lisi\u00e8re de terrain en question.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014Without expressing any opinion upon the question whether or not the action is possessoire or I am of opinion that assuming it to be une action p\u00e9titoire, as contended by the learned counsel for the appellant the appeal must be dismissed for default of the plaintiff to shew title.\nGIROUARD J. Toute la plaidoirie devant nous a roul\u00e9 sur le point de savoir si l'action de l'appelant est au p\u00e9titoire ou au possessoire. La cour d'appel n'y a vu qu'une action possessoire intent\u00e9e depuis l'ann\u00e9e du trouble. L'appelant soutient au contraire que c'est une action p\u00e9titoire. Sans m'arr\u00eater aux distinctions qui caract\u00e9risent ces deux actions, toujours difficiles dans ha pratique, je suis dispose a accepter ha pr\u00e9tention de l'appelant, sans d\u00e9cider qu'elle est bien fond\u00e9e.\nD'abord a-t-il prouv\u00e9 son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, ainsi qu'il l'all\u00e8gue? Mon savant coll\u00e8gue, M. le Juge Taschereau, vient de d\u00e9montrer qu'il n'a pas fait cette preuve et je concours enti\u00e8rement dans son opinion.\nMais supposons un instant que l'appelant soit propri\u00e9taire a-t-il donn\u00e9 un consentement au maintien des constructions dont il demande ha suppression? C'est sur ce dernier point que je me propose d'offrir quelques observations. Les faits de la cause ne sont gu\u00e8re contest\u00e9s. En 1843, les intim\u00e9s out construit sur leur terrain de la Grande All\u00e9e \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec une maison du p\u00e9age dont deux des fen\u00eatres dit l'appelant donnent vue sur l'emplacement voisin et aussi avec chapeau ou toit d\u00e9passant de trois pieds sur le m\u00eame immeuble qui \u00e9tait alors vacant Ces constructions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites au su et vu du propri\u00e9taire voisin, sans opposition de sa part, si l'on en juge par le t\u00e9moignage de son h\u00e9ritier. Elles sont rest\u00e9es dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tat sans plainte de la part de qui que ce soit jusqu'\u00e0 l'ann\u00e9e 1895, \u00e9poque o\u00f9 l'appelant acheta le terrain e n question pour le prix de $275.00 et y b\u00e2tit une maison, dont la fa\u00e7ade est en ligne avec la profondeur de celle des intim\u00e9s et dont le pignon ouest est aussi en ligne avec le pignon est de cette derni\u00e8re, et comme la projection du toit lui nuisait il en a sci\u00e9 et enlev\u00e9 le coin, avec l'autorisation du secr\u00e9taire des syndics qui lui en a pay\u00e9 le co\u00fbt, affirme l'appelant. dans le t\u00e9moignage qu'il offrit \u00e0 la] cour. Il pla\u00e7a en m\u00eame temps sur l'alignement de la rue une cl\u00f4ture jusqu'\u00e0 la maison des intim\u00e9s et a continuellement depuis utilis\u00e9 ce terrain comme parterre, sans aucune opposition de la part des syndics qui ont continue d'y avoir vue. L'appelant nous informe lui-m\u00eame de cet arrangement et il ajoute qu'il connaissait la situation des lieux, s'en \u00e9tant aper\u00e7u lorsqu'il acheta. Ce n'est que cinq ans plus tard, en 1900, qu'il porte plainte et intente son action en d\u00e9molition.\nL'esp\u00e8ce que nous avons donc \u00e0 d\u00e9cider est celle d\u2019un propri\u00e9taire qui a empi\u00e9t\u00e9 sur le terrain de son voisin, non seulement au vu et su de ce dernier mais m\u00eame de son consentement au moins tacite et de celui de tous les possesseurs subs\u00e9quents. Les faits que l'appelant invoque n'\u00e9tablissent-ils pas un consente ment m\u00eame formel de sa part sujet aux conditions qu'il posa et qu'il admet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies par les inti m\u00e9s? Or nous avons d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans la cause de Delorme v. Cusson ([10]), qu'un voisin ne peut exiger la d\u00e9molition dans le cas o\u00f9 il aurait autoris\u00e9 la construction soit express\u00e9ment, soit tacitement, an moins tant qu'elle durera. Je me contenterai de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux autorit\u00e9s qui sont cit\u00e9es dans le rapport de cette cause.\nJe suis d'avis de confirmer le jugement et de d\u00e9bouter l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nDAVIES J. concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: P.

Ducondu v. Dupuy App. Cas. 150) followed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the. Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side), reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Quebec, and ma n aining, with costs, the demande en garantie against the present appellant.\nThe respondent, principal plaintiff in the Superior Court, having purchased lot 513 of the Parish of St. Michel de Bellechasse, from Drouin, the appellant, on the 2nd of November, 1899, instituted a petitory action against one Mercier for the recovery of a part of the lot of which, it was alleged, Mercier had taken possession. Drouin had purchased the lot in question at sheriff's sale on the 7th of July. 1897. Mercier defended the action claiming a title to the parcel of land in dispute from an alleged previous owner, and that she had been in possession for over twenty years and that the land in dispute had been specially described as a separate subdivision on the cadastral plan of the parish as lot No. 513 A.\nThe principal plaintiff, constituting himself incidentally plaintiff in warranty, called his vendor, Drouin, into the action as his warrantor, to take up his fait et cause against Mercier, and to indemnify him against any condemnation in principal, interest or costs.\nThe appellant, defendant in warranty, pleaded amongst other defences to the demande en garantie, that he had sold to the respondent merely the rights in the lands described which he might have acquired under the sheriff's deed the risk of which respondent knew and assumed.\nThe trial judge construed the deed of sale to the respondent to be of the rights of property merely that had passed under the sheriff's sale and held that the appellant had given warranty only that he had obtained a title to certain rights of property acquired from the sheriff: that he had done nothing to impair or diminish the effect of that title and that he was not obliged to warrant against the adverse claim under prior title made by the principal defendant, Mercier. The demande en garantie was accordingly dismissed. The Court of Queen's Bench, by the judgment now appealed from reversed the decision of the trial court, Boss\u00e9 J. dissenting.\nThe questions at issue on the appeal sufficiently appear from the judgments reported. Pelletier K.C. for the appellant, cited Ducondu V.

(diff\u00e9rant).\u2014J'opine sans h\u00e9sitation pour le d\u00e9bout\u00e9 de cet appel.\nLe jugement \u00e0 quo qui condamne l'appelant \u00e0 prendre le fait et cause de l'intim\u00e9 comme son garant formel me para\u00eet inattaquable.\nLa pr\u00e9tention de l'appelant quo ce n'est pas l'immeuble en question qu'il a vendu \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, mais seule ment les droits qu'il avait acquis du sh\u00e9rif no repose que sur une subtilit\u00e9 Est-ce que tout vendeur d'une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 vend autre chose quo ses droits sur cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9? Or si vendre un immeuble c'est vendre ses droits \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de cet immeuble, il m'est difficile de comprendre sur quoi l'appelant peut se baser pour pr\u00e9tendre que vendre ses droits \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d'un immeuble. ce n'est pas vendre l'immeuble lui-m\u00eame. Il a vendu avec garantie des droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'ii repr\u00e9sente avoir acquis du sh\u00e9rif. Et il voudrait, car c'est \u00e9videmment \u00e0 cela que se r\u00e9duisent ses pr\u00e9tentions substituer les mots s sans garantie e aux mots a avec garantie \". Or il ne peut le faire. Il s'est bien et d\u00fbment porte garant de sa vente. Or, de quoi est-il garant? Pr\u00e9tendrait-il que c'est uniquement du fait qu'il a achet\u00e9 du sh\u00e9rif? Cela ne peut-\u00eatre car m\u00eame avec une clause expresse de non garantie, il serait garant de ce fait. Art. 1509 0.0. Il n'a achet\u00e9 du sh\u00e9rif que les droits que Martineau avait sur cet immeuble, dit-il. Sans doute, c'est bien l\u00e0 tout ce que le sh\u00e9rif pouvait vendre. C'est bien l\u00e0, tout ce que Martineau lui-m\u00eame aurait jamais Pu vendre. Je ne sache pas que personne puisse jamais vendre ce qui ne lui appartient pas, on transf\u00e9rer plus de droits qu'il n'en a lui-m\u00eame. Mais c'est la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 que le sh\u00e9rif avait saisie et lui a yen due. Et c'est ce que le sh\u00e9rif lui a vendu qu'il a revendu \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9; l'acte le dit express\u00e9ment. Et cette revente, il l'a faite avec garantie. Il a vendu avec garantie ses droits \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Or vendre des droits avec garantie, c'est garantir qu'on a des droits. Il a vendu un proc\u00e8s peut-\u00eatre, mais avec garantie. A quoi bon cette garantie, s'il n'\u00e9tait pas oblige de prendre le fait et cause de son acheteur dans ce proc\u00e9s? Il n'est pas possible, comme le pr\u00e9tendrait l'appelant, que les mots a avec garantie \" et les mots \" aux risques et p\u00e9rils de l'acheteur \" signifient la m\u00eame chose. Il n'est pas possible que celui qui se porte garant, ne garantisse rien.\nSi Martineau e\u00fbt lu--m\u00eame vendu avec garantie \u00e0 l'appelant tons ses droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans l'immeuble en question, est-ce que l'appelant, dans le cas o\u00f9 il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 inqui\u00e9t\u00e9 dans ses droits \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 par cette m\u00eame Dame Mercier, n'aurait pas eu un recours en garantie contre lui, Martineau? N'aurait-il pas pu lui dire: \" Vous m'avez garanti que vous aviez droit \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de cet immeuble. Or voici que Madame Mercier pr\u00e9tend que vous n'en aviez aucun; vous \u00eates tenu de me garantir contre ses pr\u00e9tentious.\"\nLe fait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par l'appelant que, lors de la vente l'intim\u00e9 connaissait les pr\u00e9tentions de Madame Mercier et le danger de l'\u00e9viction dont il est menace, f\u00fbt-il d'aucune importance dans l'esp\u00e8ce, n'est pas prouv\u00e9, et cons\u00e9quemment aucune allusion n'y est faite dans les consid\u00e9rants de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, non plus que dans ceux de la Cour d'Appel. La preuve par t\u00e9moins de ce fait n'aurait pu d'ailleurs \u00eatre l\u00e9galement faite. C'\u00e9tait l\u00e0 essayer \u00e0 prouver par t\u00e9moins que intim\u00e9 avait achet\u00e9 \" \u00e0 ses risques et p\u00e9rils \" \u00e0 l'encontre d'un acte qui dit express\u00e9ment qu'il a achet\u00e9 avec la garantie de son vendeur sans exception, c'est-\u00e0-dire, contre tous troubles et autres emp\u00eachements quelconques.\nLa Cour d'Appel a dit \u00e0 l'appelant que ses pr\u00e9tentions sur tous les points \u00e9taient insoutenables Elle ne pouvait en venir \u00e0 une autre conclusion.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014Il s'agit d'une action en garantie fond\u00e9e sur une vente d'immeubles. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure (Andrews J.) la renvoya, \u00e9tant d'opinion que la garantie invoqu\u00e9e n'existe pas. La Cour d'Appel a renverse ce jugement, M. le juge Boss\u00e9 diff\u00e9rant. Nous sommes d'avis avec M. le juge Boss\u00e9 et M. le juge Andrew qu'il n'y a pas de garantie contre le trouble que l'intim\u00e9 d\u00e9nonce\nPar l'acte de vente du 2 novembre 1899, l'appelant a vendu \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 a avec garantie e non pas certains immeubles, mais seulement tous les droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et autres qu'il a acquis en vertu de l'acte de vente du sh\u00e9rif du district de Montmagny ci-apr\u00e8s mentionn\u00e9 et date et qu'il poss de actuellement dans, savoir;\nsuit la description de deux immeubles formant 179 arpents en superficie. Puis, le vendeur ajoute \" que les immeubles lui appartiennent,\" non pas en vertu de bons et valables titres selon la formule banale, mais\npour les avoir acquis du sh\u00e9rif pour le District de Montmagny, suivant vente dat\u00e9e de Ia ville de Montmagny le 7 juillet 1897, enr\u00e9gistr\u00e9e sousle no. 27,308.\nL'appelant a done vendu avec garantie contre l'\u00e9viction de la chose vendue, c'est-\u00e0-dire, de ses droits dans les immeubles achet\u00e9s du sh\u00e9rif et rien de plus; art. 1508 0. C. La d\u00e9nonciation de ce titre informait de suite l'acheteur que le vendeur n'avait que les droits du saisi. L'article 780 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure d\u00e9clare en effet que\nl'adjudication est toujours sans garantie quand \u00e0 la contenance de l'immeuble mais elle transf\u00e8re tous les droits qui y sont inh\u00e9rents et que le saisi pouvait exercer.\nL'intim\u00e9 devait conna\u00eetre cette disposition de la loi. D'ailleurs le titre du sh\u00e9rif l'informe en toutes lettres de tous ces effets du d\u00e9cret. Or l'action en garantie d\u00e9nonce un trouble r\u00e9sultant d'un acte de vente qui remonte au 24 ao\u00fbt 1873 et auquel l'appelant tait tout \u00e0 fait \u00e9tranger.\nL'intim\u00e9 soutient que Ta d\u00e9claration du vendeur\u2014 que les immeubles lui appartiennent\u2014comporte qu'il vendait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 enti\u00e8re et absolue des deux immeubles, et la garantissait. Cette interpr\u00e9tation n'est pas possible en face des termes de l'acte; il n'a vendu que les droits qu'il a acquis du sh\u00e9rif et \u00e9videmment s'il manque une parcelle de terre, dans l'esp\u00e8ce un arpent sur dix \u00e0 la profondeur, son acqu\u00e9reur n'a pas plus de garantie contre lui que ce dernier n'en avait contre le sh\u00e9rif. Ducondu v. Dupuy ([6]), n'est pas sans analogie. Ici le Conseil Priv\u00e9 a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 one le concessionnaire d'une limite \u00e0 bois acquise sous l'autorit\u00e9 des Status Refondus du Canada, ch. 23, n'est pas tenu de garantir contre l'\u00e9viction d'un concessionnaire ant\u00e9rieur, malgr\u00e9, la garantie stipul\u00e9e \" de tous troubles g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement quelconques,\" et qu'il n'y eut aucune r\u00e9serve ni d\u00e9claration que le vendeur ne vendait que ses droits parceque cette concession ant\u00e9rieure est prot\u00e9g\u00e9e et par la loi et par le contrat de concession (timber i cense).\nD'ailleurs, le plaidoyer de l'appelant et la preuve faite nous donnent l'explication des terms de l'acte. L'acheteur connaissait parfaitement, lors du contrat, les causes d'\u00e9viction dont il se plaint. Il l'admet formellement dans son t\u00e9moignage. Il ajoute que le vendeur a verbalement promis de le garantir de ce trouble, ce que l'appelant nie, et son t\u00e9moignage est corrobor\u00e9 par le notaire qui repr\u00e9senta \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 qu'il n'avait rien \u00e0 craindre. L'opinion du notaire \"peut \u00eatre bien ou mal fond\u00e9e; c'est ce que les tribunaux auront \u00e0 d\u00e9cider sur l'action principale. Voici ce que dit l'intim\u00e9 :\u2014\nQ. Quand il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question lorsque vous avez eu des pour parlers avec monsieur Drouin pour acheter cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9-l\u00e0, est-ce qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question entre vous et monsieur Drouin des drotts que les Mercier (savoir les auteurs du trouble) pr\u00e9tendaient avoir l\u00e0?\nR. Oui.\nQ. Qu'est-ce que vous vous \u00eates dit entre vous deux \u00e0 ce sujet-la?\nR. J'ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 monsieur Drouin: v vous me vendez un morceau -de terre avez-vous bien le droit de le vendre?\"\nIl dit, \"certainement, je l'ai acquis du sh\u00e9rif.\"\nQ. Vous aviez des doutes que monsieur Drouin avait droit de vendre le terrain do Mercier?\nR. Comme de raison, dans le temps j'avais entendu parler que monsieur Drouin les avait emp\u00each\u00e9 de bucher depuis trois ans. Je lui ai demand\u00e9 si monsieur Drouin avait droit ...s'il avait bien droit de me vendre ce morceau de terrain-l\u00e0 et il m'a dit: \"certaine ment je l'ai acquis du sh\u00e9rif.\" J'ai dit: \"je ne voudrais pas avoir aucun trouble pour cette affaire-l\u00e0.\" Il dit: v vous n'en aurez pas non plus \" Il dit: \"si vous venez \u00e0 recevoir quelque papier pour cette affaire-l\u00e0 vous viendrez me trouver et je d\u00e9fendrai \u00e7a.\nEt plus loin :\u2014\nQ. Dans ces temps-l\u00e0, vous connaissiez les pr\u00e9tensions des Mercier sur le terrain lorsque vous l'avez achet\u00e9?\nR. Je l'ai entendu dire que depuis trois ans monsieur Drouin les avait oppos\u00e9s de bucher, et qu'ils avaient perdu leurs droits parce que c'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu par le sh\u00e9rif deux fois, et je pensais que c'\u00e9tait une afffaire finie.\nEt l'appelant de son cot\u00e9 jure:\nIl (intim\u00e9) m'a demand\u00e9 Si j'avais le droit de vendre. Je lui adit: \"j'ai acquis du sh\u00e9rif et je vendrai tel que j'ai acquis du sh\u00e9rif.\" Je n'ai pas fait de garantie. On a pris nos conventions devant le notaire de vendre et on a \u00e9t\u00e9 chez le notaire on a fait dresser le contrat tel qu'on l'avait \u00e9crit. Lorsqu'est venu le temps de la signature du contrat monsieur Morissette a interrompu Ia lecture du contrat en me demandant si je me porterais garant s'il \u00e9tait troubl\u00e9 par les Mercier. Je lui ai dit: \" si tu est troubl\u00e9 par les Mercier tu te d\u00e9fendras \u00e0 tes d\u00e9pens comme je me d\u00e9fendrais Si j'avais \u00e9t\u00e9 attaqu\u00e9 dans le temps.\" Je l'avais poss\u00e9d\u00e9 pendant trois ans et je n'ai pas \u00e9t\u00e9 troubl\u00e9 par les. Mercier. C'est de m\u00eame que \u00e7a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, c'est nos pr\u00e9tentions qu'on avail.\nVoici la version du notaire Forgues :\u2014\nLorsqu'il s'est agi de signer l'acte et que l'en ai fait la lecture, l'acqu\u00e9reur, monsieur Morissette, a fait la remarque que les Mercier, la famille Mercier, avaient des pr\u00e9tentions sur une partie de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 num\u00e9ro cinq cent treize (513). Alors, \u00e0 cette remarque, j'ai observe \u00e0 monsieur Morissette qu'il9 n'avaient aucun droit sur cette-partie-l\u00e0 de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, parce que leur titre n'\u00e9tait pas enregistr\u00e9 et qu'ils n'avaient pas fait d'opposition \u00e0 la vente, lors de la vente du sh\u00e9rif. Sur ce il n'a pas insist\u00e9 pour demander des garanties \u00e0 monsieur Drouin le vendeur au cas o\u00f9 il serait trouble dans la-possession du lot num\u00e9ro cinq cent treize (513 \u2022\nCe qui est certain c'est que la cause du trouble \u00e9tait connue et qu'\u00e0 dessein il n'y a pas eu de convention ou stipulation particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Partant, m\u00eame Si la garantie et la vente \u00e9taient aussi \u00e9tendue que l'intim\u00e9 le pr\u00e9tend, il pourrait tout au plus r\u00e9clamer une r\u00e9duction du prix,\u2014ce qui n'est pas l'objet de sa demande\u2014mais il ne peut exercer l'action en garantie. C'est ce qui r\u00e9sulte de l'article 1512 de notre Code Civil. Les codificateurrs observent que cet article ne se trouve pas dans le Code Napol\u00e9on et qu'ils ont voulu introduire une exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l'article 1511. us r\u00e9f\u00e9rent \u00e0 Pothier et \u00e0 Delvincourt qui en effet se prononcent en faveur de cette exception. En France en l'absence d'un texte pr\u00e9cis elle divise la jurisprudence et les commentateurs. Sous l'empire du Code de Qu\u00e9bec, le doute n'est pas permis. Allan v. Price ([7]); Sirey, Code Civil annot\u00e9, art. 1626 \u00e0 1630; 24 Laurent, n. 259.\nPour ces deux raisons, nous sommes d'avis d'accorder l'appel et de r\u00e9tablir le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. L'action en garantie de l\u2019intim\u00e9 est donc renvoy\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens devant toutes les cours.\nDAVIES J. concurred in the judgment, allowing the appeal with costs, and dismissing the action in warranty with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Drouin & Pelletier.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Belleau & Belleau.\n[1] 9 App, Cas. 150.\n[2] 6 Can.

The two lessors were principal shareholders in the company and while the lease was in force one of them, at a meeting of the directors moved, and the other seconded, that a by-law be passed authorizing the company to make an assignment which was afterwards done the lessors executing the assignment as creditors assenting thereto.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal (1 Ont. L.R. 172) that the lessors and the company were distinct legal persons and the individual interests of the former were not affected by the above action. Salomon v. Salomon & Co. ([1897] A.C. 22) followed.\nThe assignee of the company held possession of the leased premises for three months and the lessees accepted rent from him for that time and from sub-lessees for the month following.\nHeld, also reversing the judgment appealed from, that as the lessors had claimed the six months accelerated rent under the forfeiture clause in the lease and testified at the trial that they had elected to forfeit; as the assignee had a statutory right to remain in possession for the three months and collect the rents; as the evidence showed that the receipt by the lessors off the three months rent was in pursuance of a compromise with the assignee in respect to the acceleration; and as the months rent from the sub-tenants was only for compensation by the latter for being permitted to use and occupy the premises and for their accomodation; the lessors could not be said to have waived their right to claim a forfeiture of the lease.\nMortgagees of the premises having notified the sub-tenants to pay rent to them the assignee paid them a sum in satisfaction of their claim with the assent of the lessors against whose demand it was charged.\nHeld, that this also was no waiver of the lessors\u2019 right to claim a forfeiture.\nQu\u0153re. Was a covenant by the company to supply steam and power to its sub-tenants anything more than a personal covenant by the company or would it, on surrender of the orriginal lease have bound the lessor and a purchaser from him of the fee?\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendant.\nThe questions to be decided on the appeal sufficiently appear from the above head-note and are fully stated in the judgment of the Court.\nRitchie K.C. and Ryckman for the appellant. The findings of fact by the trial judge should not have been disturbed by the Court of Appeal. Village of Granby v.

The forfeiture clause is divisible, Graham v. Lang[6] and the case is governed by the principle of the decision in Linton v. Imperial Hotel Co.[7]\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\u2014\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014Up to January, 1898, Fane and Lavender, two of the defendants in this action, had carried on business for the manufacture of bicycles in partnership. On the tenth of January, 1898, a joint stock company was formed under the provincial statutes of Ontario in which Fane and Lavender became shareholders. The name adopted as the designation of this company was that of \u201cThe Comet Cycle Company.\u201d\nOn the eleventh of January, 1898, Fane and Lavender made a lease of the premises on which they had previously carried on their partnership business, to the company. This lease was made by indenture and was for a term of five years to be computed from the first of October, 1897, at a yearly rental of three thousand dollars, and it contained the following clause:\nIf the term hereby granted shall at any time be seized or taken in execution of an attachment by any creditor of the said lessee, or if the said lessee shall make any assignment for the benefit of creditors, or becoming bankrupt or insolvent, shall take the benefit of any Act which may be in force for bankrupt or insolvent debtors, six months rent shall immediately become due and payable and the said term shall immediately become forfeited and void.\nOn the twenty-fifth of February, 1899, the company made by indenture a sub-lease to the respondents, Littlejohn and Vaughan, (the plaintiffs in the action and respondents in this appeal,) of a portion of the premises contained in the first mentioned lease, for a term of two years from the fifteenth of March, 1899, with an option to the lessees of renewal for a further term of three years at a rental of thirty dollars per month. This sub-lease contained the usual covenant for quiet enjoyment and also a covenant in the following words:\nThe said lessors agree to supply the said lessees with heating and sufficient live steam for heating water, wax tables and pots and steam drying tables, and the said lessors for this agree to supply the said lessees whenever required with power up to ten horse at and for the sum of twenty-five dollars per month, payable in advance, the said live steam and power to be furnished between the hours of seven o\u2019clock in the morning and six o\u2019clock in the evening.\nOn the twenty-ninth of April, 1899, the company made an assignment pursuant to the statute to James Langley as assignee for the benefit of creditors.\nFane and Lavender, as creditors, assented to and executed the deed of assignment in the character of creditors of the company.\nThe assignee took possession of that part of the premises comprised in the original lease to the company which were not included in the sub-lease to Littlejohn and Vaughan and remained in such possession until the twenty-sixth of April, 1899.\nThe assignee gave no notice to the lessors within one month of the assignment, or at any time, declaring his election to retain the premises as provided by R.S.O. (1897), ch. 170, sec. 34, sub-section 2. On the 30th of May, 1899, Fane and Lavender filed with the assignee a claim verified by the affidavit of Fane for rent, including six months rent in advance amounting to $1,500, from the date of the assignment under the provisions in that behalf contained in the lease and before set forth.\nFrom the evidence contained in the depositions of witnesses examined at the trial it appears to me to be plain that immediately after the assignment Fane and Lavender in addition to the claim for rent gave verbal notice to the assignee that they would insist on the forfeiture under the terms of the lease. The finding of the trial judge is to this effect and I adopt his finding as being a proper conclusion from the evidence.\nCertain mortgagees of the premises having given notice to Littlejohn and Vaughan to pay the rent reserved by the sub-lease to them, an arrangement was made by which, on the twenty\u2011sixth of June, 1899, the assignee paid over to the mortgagees a sum of seven hundred and fifty dollars in satisfaction of their demand and thereupon the latter withdrew their claim to rent. This payment was charged against the claim of Fane and Lavender and was paid with their assent.\nOn the twenty-seventh of July, 1899, the assignee gave up possession of the company\u2019s part of the premises to Fane and Lavender and made no further claim to rent from Littlejohn and Vaughan who had, whilst the assignee remained in possession, paid the rent under the sub\u2011lease, including that for the power, to him. This payment was insisted upon by the assignee. It is not found that Fane and Lavender assented to these payments.\nOn the fifteenth of August, 1899, Fane and Lavender sold the premises to the appellant Soper, and a written agreement having been entered into, it was registered on the sixteenth of August. On the twenty-second of August, 1899, a deed was executed by Fane and Lavender conveying the premises to the appellant. Fane and Lavender supplied steam and power in accordance with the terms of the sub-lease and were paid by the respondents rent therefor up to the first of September, 1899.\nOn the thirty-first of August the appellant demanded possession of the respondents, which was refused.\nOn November, 1899, the respondents brought this action against the present appellant and Fane and Lavender for breach of the covenant for quiet enjoyment, and for refusing to supply steam and power. The defendants insisted on the forfeiture of the respondent\u2019s lease, and the present appellant counter-claimed for the delivery of possession.\nThe action was tried before Mr. Justice Meredith who gave judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action with costs, and directing that upon the counter-claims, the appellant Soper should recover possession and mesne profits up to the first of January, 1900, and that Fane and Lavender should recover $72.50 for mesne profits and services up to the thirtieth of October, 1899.\nThis judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal, the ground of reversal being that the forfeiture was waived and that there was, by operation of law, a surrender of the original term to Fane and Lavender which under the statute made them liable upon the covenants of the company contained in the sub-lease; that the appellant Soper, as assignee of the reversion was also bound by these covenants, which together with the sub-lease were valid and subsisting against him; and that the respondents were entitled to recover certain damages to be ascertained by a reference\nI may say at once that I have great doubts as to whether the covenant to supply steam and power to the respondents was anything more than a personal covenant by the company. I doubt if it would, on the assumption of a surrender by operation of law, have bound Fane and Lavender under the statute and whether the burthen of it would have run with the reversion so as to bind the appellant Soper. I assume, however, for the purposes of the judgment, that Fane and Lavender as well as Soper would have been so bound. Then it is as well to point out here that there is nothing in the pretence that Fane and Lavender having been shareholders in the company, they must, as regards their individual interests as lessors, be affected by the acts of the company. Fane and Lavender and the company were undoubtedly distinct legal persons, and the acts and conduct of one cannot have any effect on the other. This appears from the case of Salomon v. Salomon & Co.[8] Any objection founded on the connection of Fane and Lavender with the company resolves into a criticism of the law which permits the establishment of companies with such consequences and is not a ground for any judicial action.\nThen the first proposition of the appellants is that there was a forfeiture of the lease. As concluding this point, I cannot do better than quote from the judgment of Meredith J. who says:\nIt is contended that there was no forfeiture, because the assignee did not go out of possession until three months after the making of the assignment, and because, after that the lessors accepted from him and from the sub-lessees the amount of the rent under the lease and the sub-lease, the former for the three months during which the assignee was in possession, and the latter for the month of August, that is, the month following the going out of possession by the assignee.\nThat the term ended is not denied. There is no contention, no suggestion on either side, that it still subsists in either the company or the assignee. For the defendants, it is said, it ceased by forfeiture. For the plaintiffs, it is said to have ceased by surrender.\n* * * * * * *\nNow, there was the forfeiture clause contained in the lease, coupled with the provision for payment of the six months\u2019 unearned rent. There is the probability that the lessors would avail themselves of the provisions of this clause. Why would they not? It was altogether in their interests to do so. There was a claim made for the six months\u2019 rent unearned, showing a determination to have the benefit of this clause, to act under it; and there is the positive testimony of the lessor, Fane, in support of the election to forfeit, not denied by the assignee, but rather supported, I think, by his testimony, and without contradiction by any one. The acts relied upon by the plaintiff as indicating an intention not to forfeit are all, I think, entirely consistent with the assignee\u2019s right to possession under the statute, notwithstanding the landlord\u2019s election in favour of the forfeiture, and so consistent with the testimony in proof of that election.\nThen the learned judge further finds that on the conflicting testimony as to the acquiescence of Fane and Lavender in the assignee\u2019s claim to hold possession under the statute and to keep the sub-lease subsisting there was no acquiescence on the part of the lessors.\nUpon the evidence and upon the findings of the trial judge, who was in a better position than an appellate court to determine, upon the credit of witnesses, and the weight of evidence, that there was a forfeiture which the lessors Fane and Lavender declared their election to insist upon immediately after the assignment was executed, we are bound to hold that the forfeiture took effect. I think too little weight, has been attached to the statutory rights of the assignee and the line of conduct pursued by him in exercise of those rights. Had the assignee not had a paramount right under the statute to retain possession, including therein the receipt of rent from the sub-lessee and, notwithstanding the forfeiture clause, for the three months following the assignment, the case would have been very different Then, it might have been difficult to account for the omission to enforce delivery up of possession and the receipt of rent, upon any hypothesis consistent with an election to forfeit. The effect of the statute, however, was to compel the lessors to await the termination of the statutory three months during which the assignee thought fit to keep things in uncertainty.\nI am of opinion, therefore, that there was a completed forfeiture communicated to the parties. How anything ex post facto could do away with the effect of this forfeiture I am at a loss to see; therefore, on this point of law, the appellant\u2019s case is conclusively established. But, even if the evidence and the finding of the learned judge had been different, I should have difficulty in attributing waiver to any of the acts relied on as proving it.\nThe payment to the mortgagee has no bearing; he had a right over-riding that of the parties and all the lessors did was to let the assignee pay him off, charging the amount paid against the rent coming to them.\nThe receipt of the three months rent from the assignee is obviously no waiver sufficient to do away with a forfeiture already consummated, and is explained moreover as having been based on a compromise with the assignee and was the only payment in full which the assignee was bound to make, whatever rights the lessors may have had to prove against the insolvent estate for the balance of six months rent.\nThe receipt of the August rent from the respondents was manifestly by way of compensation for use and occupation permitted, for the accommodation of the sub-tenants and which they did not treat in any other way. It is impossible to say that by this the lessors intended to renounce the absolute title they had acquired under their election to forfeit, even if in law it could have had that effect. The receipt of this August rent, moreover, could not have effected the appellant since his equitable title under the agreement preceded the receipt by the lessors.\nOn the whole the judgment of Mr. Justice Meredith appears to be right and should be restored. It may be a very hard case but that cannot affect the decision. It is much to be regretted that the fair and liberal offer of the appellant, Soper, was rejected. The judgment of the Court of Appeal must be reversed and that of the Divisional Court restored. The record must be remitted to the High Court with directions to carry on the account of mesne profits up to the time the appellant shall recover possession and to enforce payment of the same.\nThe appellant Soper and the defendants Fane and Lavender must have their costs in all the courts below as well as in this court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ryckman, Kirkpatrick & Kerr.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Thomson, Henderson & Bell.\n[1] 1 Ont.

C.\u2014Arts. 1269 et seo, and 1309 et seq. M, S. Q.\nDuring the term of a license to cut timber on ungranted lands of the Province of Quebec the local Crown Lands Agent made a sale of a part of the lands covered by the license and issued location tickets or licenses of occupation therefor under the provisions of Arts. 1269 et seq. of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, respecting the sale of Crown Lands Subsequently the timber license was renewed, but at the time the renewal license was issued there had not been any express approval by the Commissioner of Crown Lands of the sales so made by the local agent as provided by Art. 1269 R. S. Q.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from, Taschereau and Davies JJ. dissenting, that the approval required by Art. 1269 R. S. Q. was not a suspensive condition the fulfilment of which would have retroactive effect from the date when the sales by the local agent were made and that at the time of the issue of the renewal license, the lands in question were still ungranted lands of the Crown for which the timber license had been validly issued.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench (appeal side), reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Gasp\u00e9, and maintaining the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe plaintiff claimed to be proprietor in possession for several years previous to the trespass charged against the defendant, under a renewal of his license from the Department of Crown Lands of the Province of Quebec, dated 3rd May, 1899, covering the year then following, of the right to cut timber on certain timber berths or limits known as \": Limits A and B \" on the Bonaventure River, in the county of Bonaventure, Province of Quebec. By the action, which was commenced by saisierevendication, the plaintiff claimed a quantity of logs alleged to have been unlawfully cut by the defendant, during the autumn and winter of 1899-1900, upon lots covered by the license and a further sum for damages suffered through the defendant's trespass.\nThe defendant denied the trespass and alleged that the logs in question had been cut by him, upon lots nos. 23 and 24 of the Township of Hamilton, with the permission of the owners, Bourque and Arbour, who held these lots under location tickets issued to them on the 18th and 22nd of December, 1898, respectively, by the local agent of the Department of Crown Lands, prior to the renewal of the plaintiffs license, and which were, in consequence, withdrawn and excepted from the lands covered by the license under which the plaintiff claimed the right to the timber The defend ant contended that as Bourque and Arbour were settlers upon the lots which they so held in good faith, they had the right to assign their rights to the timber thereon and that the lots had been inadvertantly and by error included in the renewal of the plaintiffs license of the 3rd of May, 1890, and that the license, in so far as it assumed to affect the lots in question, was, under the statute then in force, null and without effect.\nBy his answer, the plaintiff contended, among other things that the location tickets conferred no rights upon the holders, Bourque and Arbour, because they had been issued by the local agent subject to the approval of the Commission6r of Crown Lands which approval had never been formally given, but had been withdrawn and impliedly refused when the lots were included in the renewal of his timber license on the 3rd of May, 1899\nThe plaintiff's license contained clauses providing that the licensee had the right to cut timber on the lands therein mentioned during the term of the renewal but that\u2014\" tous les lots vendus on mis sous la location par l'autorit\u00e9 du Commissaire des Terres de la Couronne avant la date de la pr\u00e9sente sont retires de cette licence, et aussi les lots ainsi vendus on mis sons location subs\u00e9quemment \u00e0 l'\u00e9mission de telle licence cesseront d'y \u00eatre sujets apr\u00e8s le 30 avril suivant, et dans chaque cas o\u00f9 la vente on la location d'aucun des dits lots sera annul\u00e9e ces lots seront ins\u00e9r\u00e9s de nouveau dans cette licence \"\nDuring the hearing the defendant admitted having cut 722 logs on the plaintiff's timber berth beyond the limits of the lots held under the location tickets and the trial judge DeBilly J., maintained the attachment for this quantity of timber only, dismissing the action as to the rest of the plaintiff's demande and releasing the remainder of the logs from seizure. By the judgment now appealed from, the Court of King's Bench modified and reformed the trial court judgment and maintained the action in revendication of all the timber seized with costs against the defendant\nPelletirr K.C. for the appellant. The appellant's auteurs hold the lands by titles prior to the plaintiff's license which have the effect of withdrawing them, by the mere operation of the statute, from the license to cut timber which can only apply to ungranted lands belonging exclusively to the Crown at the date of the license. Arts. 1269, 1270, 1273, 1309 E. S. Q. The Commissioner of Crown Lands must be assumed to have approved of the sales of lots 23 and 24 to Bourque and Arbour at the time the local agent's report of the sales reached the department in January, 1899, and, although the local agent received such notification only upon the 22nd of May, 1899, the approval related back to the dates when the sales were made in December 1898 and validated them from those dates. Art. 1085 0. 0. The plaintiff's license is, therefore, subject to the exception made by the statute and by its own express terms. Arts. 1244 1310, 1343, R.S.Q.\nThe sales were complete when and as made by the local agent, subject only to the condition that the Commissioner of Crown Lands might have disallowed them for some special reason, and this was never done. See 63 Vict. ch. 14 (Que.)\nWe rely also upon the following authorities, viz,: 1 Proudhon, Trait\u00e9 du Domaine nos. 96, 97, 182; 1 Gandry, Trait\u00e9 du Domaine, nos. 53, 54, 58; 2 Gaudry, Trait\u00e9 du Domaine, no. 323; Rochelean v. Lacharit\u00e9 ([1]), at page 538 per Boss\u00e9 J.\nChase-Casgrain K.C. for the respondent. The mere act of the book-keeper claimed to have been an approval of the sales is not a compliance with the statute. The approval contemplated is a judicial act which can only be effectual when performed by the Commissioner of Crown Lands in person. The effect of the statute is delectus person\u0152 and the commissioner cannot delegate the powers conferred upon him as such. Arts. 1269, 1283 R. S. Q. The effect of Art. 1273 R. S. Q. is merely to validate sales made by a local agent after this formal approval has been duly given. The Act 63 Vict. ch. 14, amending Art. 1269 R. S. Q., can only affect this case as showing that our contention is based upon the correct construction of that article as it stood at the time of Our license. The statute is in restraint of alienations of the public domain and must be strictly construed as against delegation of powers or tacit approval. We refer to Rochelean v. Lachafit\u00e9 ([2]); Lanigan v. Gareau ([3]).\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE. I am of opinion that this appeal ought to be dismissed. Then the license of the 3rd of May, 1899, was granted to the respondent, the sales to Bourque and Arbour had not been approved by the commissioner. Prim\u00e2 facie therefore the licenses were valid.\nI cannot agree that article 1085 0. 0. (similar to article 1179 Code Napoleon) applies. We cannot, I think, treat the inchoate sales made by the agent Maguire as sales made under a suspensive condition, namely, the condition that the commissioner should approve of the sales, and that consequently when at some date between the 3rd of May, 1899, the date of the license, and the 22nd of the same month the date at which the approval of the commissioner was communicated to Maguire there was, by reason of the commissioner\u2019s act approving the sales a retroactive effect to be attributed to the approval destroying the condition and making the sales by relation absolute from the dates of the respective location tickets issued by Maguire. Whatever may be the operation of the article referred to in the case of ordinary contracts I cannot regard the statutes as meaning anything other than this: that if there should be no absolute and completed sale at the date of the issue of the license to cut timber the license should in law be unconditionally good and effectual. The statutes therefore, I think, exclude the operation of the provision of the code. This alone would be sufficient to dispose of the case. Even if the article 1085 C. C. ought to be held to apply I could not come to the conclusion that it annulled the license. According to the Roman law ([4]), and to English law also, retroactive operation is regarded as a fiction which is held not to take effect to the prejudice of the rights of third persons acquired intermediately. This, however, I must admit is, in the opinion of some of the commentators on the Code Napoleon, especially Laurent and Huc, not the effect of the article 1085 C. C. ([5]). They hold that the condition being put an end to in the case of a sale all intermediate dispositions of the property fall with the condition and that the sale is by relation good ab initio. Older and other commentators are of a different opinion But treating the first mentioned view of the law as sound even those who insist upon it admit a distinction in favour of acts of administration which, though subsequent to a sale subject to a suspensive condition afterwards ratified by the performance of the condition, are conserved. Even Laurent is of this opinion. Then the timber license in question was not a sale of the land but a mere act of administration and, as such, a disposition which ought to be upheld.\nI cannot concur in upholding the objection that the commissioner's personal approval was essential. The approval of sales made by a local agent is a ministerial not a judicial duty imposed on the commissioner the performance of which may be delegated.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J. (diff\u00e9rant).\u2014Cet appel devrait, \u00e0 mon avis \u00eatre allou\u00e9. Comme le jugement de la cour doit \u00eatre en sens contraire il me suffira de dire en peu de mots les motifs sur lesquels je me fonde pour en diff\u00e9rer. La cause a perdu de son importance pour le public et l'administration des terres de la Couronne par. le fait que les dispositions statutaires qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu au conflit entre les parties ont depuis \u00e9t\u00e9 amend\u00e9es.\nLe demandeur, intime, invoque comme son titre \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du bois en question, une licence on permis de coupe de bois sur les lots en litige en date du 3 mai, 1899. Ce permis lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 octroy\u00e9 par l'agent des Terres de la Couronne \u00e0 New-Carlisle, sous l'autorit\u00e9 de la section 1309 des Statuts Refondus de Qu\u00e9bec, qui donne le droit au Commissaire d'\u00e9mettre un tel permis, mais exclusivement sur les terres publiques non conc\u00e9d\u00e9es.\nEt le permis de l'intim\u00e9 comporte d'ailleurs la stipulation expresse\nQue tous les lots vendus ou mis sous location par l'autorit\u00e9 du Commissaire des Terres de la Couronne, avant la date des pr\u00e9sentes (le 3 mai, 1899) sont retir\u00e9s de cette licence.\nLes lots en question avaient-ils \u00e9t\u00e9, avant le 3 mai 1899, conc\u00e9d\u00e9s ou vendus on mis sous location par l'autorit\u00e9 du Commissaire des Terres? C'est l\u00e0, dans l'esp\u00e8ce, toute la question. Le jugement \u00e0 quo d\u00e9cide que non, et que cons\u00e9quemment la licence de l'intim\u00e9 lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galement octroy\u00e9e. Avec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je crois que ce jugement est erron\u00e9.\nIl appert, et il est d'ailleurs admis, qu'en d\u00e9cembre; 1898 plusieurs mois avant l'octroi \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de sa licence de coupe de bois, l'appelant (par ses auteurs) avait achet\u00e9 les lots en question de l'agent des Terres de la Couronne qui lui avait accord\u00e9, non pas un billet de location sous la section 1269 des Statuts Refondus, mais ce que je consid\u00e9rerai en premier lieu comme un permis d'occupation comportant vente sous la section 1270. Or cette section 1270 d\u00e9cr\u00e8te express\u00e9ment que le porteur d'un tel permis, acheteur de la terre y d\u00e9crite. Dent en prendre possession et l'occuper. Le permis de l'appelant sur ce terrain, il est vrai, r\u00e9 serve au Commissaire le pouvoir d'en r\u00e9voquer la vente. Mais il n'est question dans la cause d'aucune telle r\u00e9vocation; il n'est pas pr\u00e9tendu qu'il y en ait jamais eu. Et ce permis n'\u00e9tait pas sujet \u00e0 l'approbation du Commissaire, comme le pr\u00e9tend l\u2019intim\u00e9. Ce n'est que l'octroi fait sous la section.1269 qui soit sujet \u00e0 cette approbation. La section 1270 para\u00eetrait \u00e0 elle seule, n'accorder le droit d'octroyer un tel permis qu'au Commissaire lui-m\u00eame. Mais la section 1273 d\u00e9cr\u00e8te express\u00e9ment que le permis \u00e9mis par l'agent des Terres de la Couronne conf\u00e8re les m\u00eames droits que s'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis par le Commissaire lui-m\u00eame.\nJ'en conclus que tant aux termes du statut qu'\u00e0 ceux de la licence elle-m\u00eame de l'intim\u00e9, les lots en question n'ont Pu \u00eatre inclus dans la dite licence parce qu'ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 vendus \u00e0 l'appelant plusieurs mois avant son \u00e9mission.\nMaintenant, en supposant que le titre, date en d\u00e9cembre 1898 de l'appelant soit un billet de location sous la section 1269 je ne puis admettre avec l'intim\u00e9 que la Couronne ait pu l\u00e9galement, cinq mois plus tard, pendant que ce billet de location \u00e9tait en vigueur, lui donner une licence de coupe de bois sur un terrain qui \u00e9tait sorti de son domaine, et dont l'appelant \u00e9tait en possession \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire. Car, il avait cette possession, \u00e0 ce titre, tant en vertu du droit public de la province, d'apr\u00e8s lequel toute vente ou cession d'un terrain par la Couronne en transmet ipso facto et eo instanti la possession, the seizin, que d'apr\u00e8s les articles 1025 1472 et 1493 du Code Civil et les termes m\u00eames de son billet de location en vertu duquel il s'est mis de suite en possession active de ce terrain. La Couronne n'aurait pu de plein droit vendre ce terrain \u00e0 un tiers; elle ne peut pas plus qu'aucun de ses sujets c\u00e9der des droits dont elle s'est d\u00e9partie. L'agent qui a vendu ce terrain a d\u00fbment remis au d\u00e9partement, \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, em janvier 1899, le montant du prix de vente re\u00e7u de l'appelant, avec son rapport mensuel, exig\u00e9 par le d\u00e9partement, constatant qu'il avait vendu ces lots en d\u00e9cembre 1898. Sur ce rapport l'entr\u00e9e a de suite \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement faite de cette vente dans les r\u00e9gistres du d\u00e9partement comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment faite, ut ex tunc en d\u00e9cembre 1898; et il est en preuve que telles ventes ainsi entr\u00e9es sont, et ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9, consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des lors approuv\u00e9es par le Commissaire.\nLe Commissaire lui-m\u00eame a d\u00fb, suivant la section 1240, certifier \u00e0 la municipalit\u00e9 du comt\u00e9 de Bonaventure, qu'il avait vendu ces lots en d\u00e9cembre 1898, omnia pr\u0153sumuntur rite esse acta. Et ces lots, d'apr\u00e8s la m\u00eame section sont devenus sujets aux taxes municipales \u00e0 compter de d\u00e9cembre 1898. Et l'intim\u00e9 soutiendrait que l'appelant n'\u00e9tait pas propri\u00e9taire, quoiqu'il f\u00fbt sujet aux taxes. S'il \u00e9tait sujet aux taxes, c'est il me semble, que la Couronne n'\u00e9tait plus propri\u00e9taire. Et si la Couronne n'\u00e9tait pas propri\u00e9taire apr\u00e8s d\u00e9cembre 1898, c'est l'appelant qui l'\u00e9tait. Et la Couronne n'avait aucun droit d'octroyer subs\u00e9quemment une licence pour coupe de bois sur ce terrain. La licence octroy\u00e9e \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 est donc nulle.\nMais dit l'intim\u00e9, par la section 1269 du statut,\nle billet de location de l\u2019appelant \u00e9tait sujet \u00e0 l'approbation du Commissaire lui-m\u00eame, et cette approbation n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e lorsque j\u2019ai obtenu ma licence.\nCette partie de l'argumentation de l'intim\u00e9 ne me parait reposer que sur un jeu de mots. Quand le billet de location de l'appelant dit \" if sale not disallowed by the Commissioner\", n'est-il pas conforme au statut qui d\u00e9cr\u00e8te que tel octroi est sujet \u00e0 l'approbation du Commissaire? Les mots \" if not disallowed by the Commissioner \" veulent bien dire il me semble, sujet \u00e0 la d\u00e8sapprobation du Commissaire.\" Or, quand le Commissaire ne d\u00e9sapprouve pas, n'est-ce pas parce qu'il approuve? Et ces mots du statut s sujets \u00e0 l'approbation du Commissaire \" n'ont pas suspendu la vente. Ils ne comportent qu'une condition potestative r\u00e9solutoire, le pouvoir de d\u00e9sapprouver et r\u00e9silier. Et tant que le Commissaire n'a pas r\u00e9sili\u00e9, la vente est parfaite; l'acheteur est propri\u00e9taire. Puis comme le statut ne fixait aucun d\u00e9lai au Commissaire pour faire option approuver ou d\u00e9sapprouver, lapprobation pouvait \u00eatre donn\u00e9e en aucun temps comme elle l'a \u00e8t\u00e8 le 23 mai 1899; art. 1082 0.C. ut ex tunc avec effet r\u00e9troactif jusqu'\u00e0 la date de la vente par l'agent, art. 1085 C.C. C'est l\u00e0 il est en preuve et le billet de location donn\u00e9 a l'appelant le constate, l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que le d\u00e9partement a toujours lui-m\u00eame donn\u00e9e au statut alors en force et cette interpr\u00e9tation \u00e9tait raisonable. Le seul changement que le statut 63 V. c. 16 a apport\u00e9 l\u00e0-des sus, c'est de limiter \u00e0 quatre mois le temps durant lequel le Commissaire a maintenant le pouvoir de d\u00e9sapprouver une vente faite par son agent.\nIl m'est impossible de donner au statut avec le jugement \u00e0 quo, une interpr\u00e9tation qui laisserait \u00e0 la Couronne la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du terrain vendu par l'agent tant que le Commissaire n'a pas en termes formels lui-m\u00eame approuv\u00e9e la vente. Le billet de location en question en termes non \u00e9quivoques, consid\u00e8re la vente comme parfaite du jour qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, car c'est dans six mois de sa date que l'acheteur est tenu de prendre possession.\nDe plus, il est statu\u00e9 par la section 1273 que toute personne \u00e0 qui un billet de location a \u00e9t\u00e9 octroy\u00e9 a les m\u00eames droits que si elle avait obtenu du Commissaire lui-m\u00eame un permis d'occupation sous la section 1270. Or cette section 1270 donne \u00e0 un acheteur \u00e0 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 octroy\u00e9 un tel permis le droit de prendre possession et d'occuper \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire, avec r\u00e9serve de tout permis de coupe de bois pourvu qu'il soit ant\u00e9rieur \u00e0 sa date. Et le permis de coupe de bois de l'intim\u00e9 est post\u00e9rieur \u00e0 l'achat de l'appelant. Le titre de l'appelant doit donc pr\u00e9valoir. La Couronne n'a pu transmettre \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 en mai, 1899, des droits qu'elle n'avait pas.\nJe vois qu'il a \u00e8t\u00e8 question en cour d'appel de la section 1343. Il doit y avoir eu l\u00e0 un malentendu dont les parties sont probablement responsables. Il n'est pas fait mention au dossier d'une r\u00e9serve de bois par la Couronne sur le. terrain en litige telle qu'autorise par la section 1339. Et je ne puis y voir la preuve que l'intim\u00e9 avait une licence de coupe de bois sur ce terrain avant le 3 mai 1899.\nL'intim\u00e9, dans son factum, me semble exciper large ment des droits de la Couronne et se constituer le protecteur du domaine public qui dit-il ne peut \u00eatre ali\u00e9n\u00e9 que suivant toutes les formalit\u00e9s rouisses par le statut. Et c'est sur ce point-l\u00e0 exclusivement qu'il parait avoir r\u00e9ussi devant la cour d'appel. Mais vrai ment je ne puis voir comment dans l'esp\u00e8ce la Couronne a pu souffrir on m\u00eame ait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 en danger de souffrir, des actes de son agent ou du d\u00e9parte ment La vente n'a \u00e8t\u00e8 faite \u00e0 l'appelant que sous la r\u00e9serve expresse du pouvoir absolu du Commissaire do la r\u00e9silier \u00e0 son gr\u00e9 et quand il le voudrait. A mon point de vue, il n'y a qu'une question dans la cause. La licence du 3 mai 1899 qu'invoque l'intim\u00e9, lui a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 octroy\u00e9e sur un lot de la Couronne alors en vente ou bien sur un lot qu'elle avait ant\u00e9rieurement conc\u00e9d\u00e9? Il n'est gu\u00e8re possible de dire que ce lot n'avait pas \u00e8t\u00e8 conc\u00e9d\u00e9. La licence de l'intim\u00e9 est donc nulle.\nGWYNEE and GIROJARD, JJ. Concurred in the judgment dismissing the appeal with costs. DAVIES, J. (dissenting.)\u2014I concur generally in the reasons of Mr. Justice Taschereau for allowing this appeal but I desire to place my concurrence on the ground that the appellant's title was the location ticket which he obtained from the Crown Lands Agent under section 1259 R.S.Q.\nThis location ticket was, no doubt, subject to the approval of the Commissioner of Crown Lands. I agree with my brother Taschereau that such approval was given and that, when given, it confirmed the action of the agent and validated the location ticket from its date when the sale was made by the agent and the ticket issued.\nUnder section 1273 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec location ticket holders have conferred upon them the same rights, powers and privileges, m respect of the lands for which such tickets have been issued by the Crown Lands Agent, and in my opinion, from the time when so issued, as are conferred upon persons obtaining licenses of occupation from the Commissioner under section 1270. I cannot accede to the argument that these rights only attach after the approval of the Commissioner is formally given.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSollicitors for the appellant: Drouin, Pelletier & B\u00e9langer.\nSollicitors for the respondent: Riopel & Lavery.\n[1] Q.

The company afterwards failed.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (27 Ont. App. R. 396) that as there was no agreement in writing for the payment of the difference by money\u2019s worth instead of cash under sec. 27 of The Companies Act M. & C. were liable to pay the balance of the price of the shares to the liquidator of the company. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment at the trial against the defendant Code, reversing that in favour of the defendant W.D. Morris and affirming that in favour of the defendant Mary A. Morris.\nThe plaintiff bank, as a creditor of the Anderson Trading Co. in liquidation under The Winding-up Act, brought action against the defendants to recover from them respectively the amount alleged to be unpaid on shares of the company purchased by the defendants W.D. Morris and Code. Mary A. Morris was sued with her husband as liable in case it should be held that the latter\u2019s shares had been validly transferred to her.\nThe facts respecting the purchase of the shares were stated by Mr. Justice MacMahon at the trial as follows:\nW.D. Morris was in Toronto about the last of April or the first of May, 1894, and had a conversation with Mr. Barr, who was then connected with the company as one of its officers. Barr wanted Morris to purchase fifty-two shares of the Anderson Trading Company\u2019s stock, which, at its par value, would represent $5,200. Morris, according to his own evidence and that of Barr, made an offer of $3,000 for the stock representing the sum named. The transaction was not then carried out, and Barr visited Ottawa, where Morris was residing and carrying on business, and, according to Morris\u2019s statement, he had consulted with his solicitor, Mr. Code, and from the opinion received from him he found that the offer made by Morris to Barr, of the payment of $3,000 for $5,200 of stock might not be regarded as a legal transaction, that is, if carried out Morris might still be liable to pay the difference between the $3,000 and the $5,200. The difficulty which was to be overcome was stated by Morris quite openly, for he says he told Barr that he was to have paid-up shares, and it was then agreed that Morris should purchase thirty-four shares, the par value of which was $3,400 and for this he was to pay $3,400 and he was to be repaid by the company the sum of $1,400 for services to be rendered in connection with the Merchants\u2019 Supply Company, which was being formed by the directors of the Anderson Company to supply merchants with cash registers at a rental, and designed to assist the Anderson Company, whose business was the manufacture of such registers. Barr said he was to give his services towards securing financial aid in Ottawa for the Merchants\u2019 Supply Company, but he was not called upon to perform any services in connection with it, because the Anderson Trading Company had failed to make cash registers that could be guaranteed, or would be accepted by merchants.\nThe eighteen shares, to make up the whole of the fifty-two shares which Barr had offered to sell Morris, were taken by Mr. Code, who is a barrister and solicitor in Ottawa, and at the interview at which Barr, Morris and himself were present, the matter was discussed, and Morris\u2019s services were spoken of, and also the services that Mr. Code could render to the company, by obtaining from the Customs Department some modifications in the customs regulations so as to protect the Canadian company, against a company in Cleveland that had the whole of the market in Canada to itself.\nMorris says that it was arranged that he should pay for the thirty-four shares by his cheque for $3,400 and that he was to get back from the company $1,400, for the services to which I have referred. Mr Code says he was to pay the $1,800 for his shares, and that the arrangement that had been made with Barr as to the payment for the services was that he should receive $800, and that was to be immediately upon payment by Code of the $1,800.\nThe agreement so made was carried out in its entirety, as evidenced by the cheques which were filed, and which appear to have been on blank cheques supplied at Ottawa during Barr\u2019s visit on the agreement as to the purchase of the shares being concluded. Now the way that the return of the $800 to Code and the $1,400 to Morris was arranged was this: the company passed a resolution granting to Mr. Anderson, the president of the company, a sum of $2,300, purporting to be for services rendered by him to the company. That amount was credited in Anderson\u2019s account. Mr. Barr, as one of the officers of the company drew cheques on the bank at which the Anderson company kept its account for these two several amounts. Anderson derived no benefit whatever from the moneys voted by the company, except to the extent of about $100, and he was an assenting party to the money being so paid to Code and Morris. In fact, what Code and Morris received back was part of the moneys derived from their cheques which had been deposited to the credit of the company in the Union Bank.\nBetween May and August, Morris, having possession of his stock certificate, put it in an envelope and handed it to his wife, saying that he was giving it to her because he thought she was entitled to it, she having lent him money at the time of their marriage in 1882. The certificate so handed to her she says she looked at but did not read. She returned it to the envelope and handed it back to her husband, just after looking at it to see what it was; she did not know perhaps its value, and did not certainly know, unless her husband told her, what the nature of the certificate was. After it was handed back by Mrs. Morris to her husband, he instructed Mr. Code to deliver up the certificate to be cancelled, and to obtain new certificates in his wife\u2019s name, who, he then told Mr. Code, was the owner of the stock. In compliance with these instructions, Mr. Code procured from the company the issue of the seven certificates in the name of the defendant, Mary A. Morris, representing the thirty-four shares that had originally belonged to her husband.\nI find as a fact that Mrs. Morris had lent to her husband in 1882 the sum of $700. There were some other items which she claimed formed an indebtedness by her husband to her, but I consider that no valid claim could be found to exist as to those. The legal liability as to the $700 would have been barred by the statute. Mr. Morris regarded it as a moral obligation to return to his wife that which he had received from her some twelve years before, with interest thereon which I understand he said he had not made up.\nIn the action against Code judgment was given for the plaintiff bank. In the other action both defendants succeeded, the learned judge holding that W.D. Morris had transferred the shares to his wife and that she was a purchaser for value without notice and so not liable. Code appealed from the judgment against him and the bank also appealed in the other case. The Court of Appeal dismissed Code\u2019s appeal and allowed that of the bank against W.D. Morris holding that there was no legal transfer to his wife. As against the latter the judgment at the trial was affirmed. Code and W.D. Morris then appealed to the Supreme Court and the bank as a precaution in case the latter should succeed appealed from the judgment in favour of Mrs. Morris.\nWatson K.C. for the appellants, Morris and Code and respondent Mrs. Morris. The stock held by Morris was part of the new issue and the first issue was never fully paid. His stock therefore was illegally issued and he cannot be liable on it. Page v. Austin[2]; In re Ontario Express and Transportation Co.[3]\nThe shares of both appellants were fully paid for in cash and the payment cannot be affected by other transactions. In re Harmony and Montague Tin and Copper Mining Co.; Spargo\u2019s Case[4]; In re Paraguassu Steam Tram-Road Co.; Ferrao\u2019s Case[5]; and the contract for fully paid-up shares can only be rescinded by putting the appellants in their original positions. North West Electric Co. v. Walsh[6]; In re Johannesburgh Hotel Co.[7]\nAs to the effect of sec. 27 of the Companies Act see In re Almada and Tirito Co.[8] approved by House of Lords in Oregum Gold Mining Co. v. Roper[9]; Welton v. Saffery[10].\nHellmuth and Saunders for the respondent, the Union Bank. Page v. Austin2; was decided under a statute passed in 1864 containing very different provisions from those in the present Companies Act, R.S.C. ch. 119.\nThe learned counsel referred to Re Government Security Fire Ins. Co.; White\u2019s Case[11]; In re London Celluloid Co.[12]\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014It is impossible in the teeth of the statute which requires that when shares are contracted to be paid for, not in money, but in money\u2019s worth, there must be an agreement in writing, to do otherwise than to dismiss these appeals. I may add however, that I have no doubt whatever on the evidence that, as the appellants have claimed, these shares were honestly paid for by the services rendered to the full amount of their value at least.\nSince the case of McCraken v. Mclntyre[13] there have been great changes in the statute law affecting shareholders\u2019 liability. At the time McCraken v. Mclntyre13 was decided, companies incorporated, as that company was, were corporations pure and simple. They were not (to use the expression of Lord Justice Lindley) like that statutory hybrid between a partnership and a corporation, a joint stock company. They did not partake in any way of the character of a partnership. There was no winding up process. Therefore creditors of the company had nothing to do ab initio with the agreements between the company and its shareholders. The only remedy afforded to creditors as regards unpaid shares was that an execution creditor who got a return of nulla bona was subrogated to the rights of the company in respect of unpaid liabilities for shares. Now all is different; the Winding Up Acts entitle the creditors to insist on payment for shares in cash, or (subject to the statute requiring an agreement in writing) for money\u2019s worth, and the companies can no longer, as they could when mere corporations, make special agreements with shareholders respecting the payment for their shares. Even if the first statute mentioned above had not been passed the change wrought by the Winding Up Act would by itself have been a difficulty in the appellants\u2019 way, but as it is we cannot, however honest and upright the intention of the appellants was, and I believe it to have been, avoid giving effect to the peremptory language of the statute.\nThe appeals must be dismissed with costs.\nIn the case of The Union Bank v. Morris the appeal is dismissed with costs for the reasons given by the Court of Appeal.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014In all of these cases I am of opinion that the judgments in the courts below should be affirmed and the appeals be dismissed with costs for the reasons given in the judgments in the courts below, which in my opinion are conclusive upon the points in issue.\nSEDGEWICK and GIROUARD JJ. concurred in the dismissal of the appeals.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for W.D.

In that year the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench decided that this practice was irregular and in the following session the legislature passed an Act providing that \u201c in the case of a County Court judgment, an application may be made under rule 803 or rule 804, as the case may be. This amendment shall apply to orders and judgments heretofore made or entered, except in cases where such orders or judgments have been attacked before the passing of this amendment.\u201d\nHeld, Sedgewick J. dissenting, that the words \u201corders and judgments\u201d in said clause refer only to orders and judgments of the Queen\u2019s Bench for sale of lands on County Court judgments and not to orders and judgments of the County Courts.\nHeld further, reversing the judgment of the King\u2019s Bench (13 Man. L. R. 419) Davies J. dissenting, that the clause had retroactive operation only to the extent that orders for sale by the Queen\u2019s Bench on County Court judgments made previously were valid from the date on which the clause came into force but not from the date on which they were made.\nHeld, per Sedgewick J., that the clause had no retroactive operation at all.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of King\u2019s Bench for Manitoba ([1]) affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs. The only question to be decided on this appeal was whether or not the Act of the Manitoba Legislature, 60 Vict. ch. 4, set out in the head-note, made valid an order for sale of lands under a judgment of a County Court and proceedings thereunder, made and done before the Act came into force. The facts are fully stated in the opinions published herewith.\nAylesworth K.C. and Phillips for the appellants.\nJ. Stewart Tupper K.C. for the respondent.\nThe CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014The appellant Peter Schmidt being seized in fee of the lands for the recovery of which this action was brought, sold and conveyed the same for valuable consideration to the appellant Diedrich Froese. Subsequently one Russell having recovered a judgment in the county court against Schmidt it was registered and afterwards an order was summarily made and entered in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for the sale of the land in satisfaction of the judgment and it was sold accordingly and purchased by the respondents who, having obtained a vesting order, brought this action.\nIt having been held by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in Manitoba that it was not within the jurisdiction of that court to make an order for sale of lands founded on a county court judgment the legislature altered the law by passing the following amendment to the existing law :\u2014\nIn the case of a county court judgment an application may be made under rule 803 or 804 as the case may be. This amendment shall apply to orders and judgments heretofore made or entered except in cases where such orders or judgments have been attacked before the passing of the amendment.\nThis enactment came into force on the 30th of March, 1897, after the completion of the sale to the respondents. The question which has been raised by the appeal is whether the amendment has a retrospective operation sufficient to make valid not only the order of the Queen\u2019s Bench upon which the sale proceedings were founded but also all the subsequent proceedings upon the order including the sale.\nThe Court of King\u2019s Bench have attributed such a retrospective effect to the statute and have held that it covers all objections on this head to the respondents\u2019 title.\nI agree with the Court of King\u2019s Bench and with my brother Davies in the opinion that the words \u201c orders and judgments \u201d in the amending clause refer not to county court orders and judgments but to orders and judgments of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench made summarily or by plenary proceedings for the sale of lands in satisfaction of county court judgments, the word \u201c orders \u201d referring to summary proceedings and \u201cjudgments \u201d to formal judgments for sale obtained as the result of proceedings in the Queen\u2019s Bench based on recoveries in the inferior tribunal. I need not repeat the reasoning upon which I reach that conclusion as it is the same as that of the Chief Justice of Manitoba in his judgment in the court below, and of my brother Davies in this court.\nThe question is however how far does the statute when thus interpreted have a retroactive effect? I am constrained upon this point to differ from the court below. I do not think the amendment has any retrospective effect except in so far that from the date at which the Act came into force, the 30th March, 1897, any orders for sale previously made by the Queen\u2019s Bench founded on county court judgments, were from that date to be held valid, if it had been intended to make such orders valid ab initio, that is from the dates at which they were made, the language of the legislature should have been in explicit terms, namely, such orders should have been declared to have been valid from the time at which they were made, which is certainly not the import of the words in which the new law is actually expressed. Further, even if the legislature had shewn an intent to go beyond the limited retrospective operation I have indicated and had declared that the orders should be taken to have been valid from the date at which they were actually made and entered, that would not, in my opinion, have been sufficient to confirm previous sales under orders made without jurisdiction.\nThe well known rule that retrospective statutes, especially such as divest vested rights, are to receive a restrictive construction is too well established to permit any larger interpretation than that which I attribute to the words according to their strict grammatical construction.\nThat the legislature had demonstrated an intention to enact retrospectively to a certain extent is not sufficient to warrant a retroactive operation carried beyond the meaning of the terms used strictly construed.\nThat the presumption against retroactive operation is to be applied so as to confine language to some extent expressly retroactive to the case indicated, appears from the judgment of Bowen L. J. in the case of Reid v. Reid ([2]) when he says :\nNow the particular rule of construction which has been referred to but which is valuable only when the words of an Act of Parliament are not plain is enbodied in the welI known trite maxim omnis nova constitutio futuris forman imponere debet non pr\u0153teritis; that is that except in special cases the new law ought to be construed so as to interfere as little as possible with vested rights. It seems to me that even in construing an Act which is to be a certain extent retrospective and in construing a section which is to be to a certain extent retrospective we ought nevertheless to bear in mind that maxim as applicable whenever we reach the line at which the words of the section cease to be plain. That is a necessary and logical corollary of the general proposition that you ought not to give a larger retrospective power to a section even in an Act which is to some extent intended to be retrospective, than you can plainly see the legislature meant.\nIt is said that to restrict the latter part of the amending clause to legalising orders for sale previously made and entered only from the date of the Act coming into force is to attribute to it a very insignificant modicum of relief; the answer must be that that is the very intent of this rule of interpretation, designed to prevent injustice resulting from interference with rights of property except in cases where the unmistakable language of the legislature demands an ex post facto construction.\nThe appeal must, in my opinion, be allowed and the action dismissed with costs to appellants here and also in the court below.\nTASCHEREAU and GIROUARD JJ. concurred.\nSEDGE WICK J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed. As I go further than some of my brothers as to the construction of the amendment in question, it is proper that I should shortly give expression to the grounds of my judgment.\nI am willing to admit that the framers of the enactment intended that it should have a retroactive effect and work out as the Court of King\u2019s Bench has found, but there has been an extraordinary failure to give expression to that intention.\nWhile courts are bound to give effect to legislation, no matter how flagitious or confiscatory it may be, when its purpose is apparent and the legislature, whether explicitly or by necessary implication, has given expression to that purpose, it is not their privilege or function to claim the law-making power or by conjecture or guess to give effect to even an admitted intention, not actually declared in the enactment itself. That condition has arisen here.\nThe Queen\u2019s Bench Act, 1895, contains six sections or rules creating a summary method of procedure for the realization of Queen\u2019s Bench registered judgments and orders for the payment of money. Rules 803 and 804 authorise the making of the application by or on behalf of the judgment creditor or other party entitled and nothing more. The three remaining rules specify the procedure to be followed and expressly give jurisdiction to the court and judges to adjudicate upon the application and, if a case is made out, to make an order for sale of the lands charged by the registered judgment or order.\nNow, the amendment in question, so far as this point is concerned, while, of course, relating to the Act as a whole, does not purport to be an amendment to rules 803 and 804. They remain unchanged. But it is made to form a new rule, (807a), \u201c In the case of a County Court Judgment\u201d it says :\nAn application may be made under rule 803 or 804 as the case may be\nand there it stops. It absolutely fails to indicate what is to be done upon the application or to give the court jurisdiction to deal with the application by making an order for sale. In other words, it has not made the jurisdictional clauses a part of it. Had it amended rules 803 and 804 by inserting, after the word \u201c order\u201d in the second line of both, the words, \u201cof the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench or County Court,\u201d or if it had proceeded to add words to the effect that \u201cupon such application such proceedings shall be had and orders made as specified in rules 805, 806 and 807,\u201d then there would have been such a sufficient expression, a statement of the legislative intent, as to make the amendment capable of being applied,\nHow can a court supply or read into the amendment these or similarly effective expressions ? That, I think, would be legislation and not interpretation.\nAnd there does not appear to be much excuse for this \u201cill expressed\u201d and \u201cslovenly\u201d legislation, (the adjectives are those of the court below). For the very Act amended contains numerous instances of how legislation of this character should be drafted. There is the creation of the litigants\u2019 rights, the jurisdiction of the judicial tribunal, and the machinery requisite for the enforcement of its judgments; (see rules 5, 86, 317, 318, 643, 754-758 and these six sections themselves).\nI do not propose to cite authorities to shew that in this case this amendment cannot have any effect. It is perfectly clear that a distinct and unequivocal enactment is required for the purpose of either adding to or taking away from the jurisdiction of a superior court of law and the amendment, not complying with this elementary principle, is wholly inoperative.\nI proceed to my second ground.\nAssuming that I am wrong about my first proposition, I think there is error in the judgment below in the meaning it places upon the word \u201corders\u201d. It does not mean orders for sale made in the Superior Court, but orders for the payment of money made in the County Court.\nThe learned Chief Justice of the court below wholly based his argument in support of the other construction, upon the alleged fact that there was no statutory provision for the registration of an order of the County Court. I say it with all deference, but it seems to me quite clear that there is such provision, which I demonstrate as follows : Section 96 of the County Courts Act (U.S.M. ch. 33), provides that \u201c any party who has obtained a judgment in any County Court for a sum exceeding $40, may, at any time, obtain a certificate from the clerk of such court * * * which certificate shall, on the request of the party obtaining the same, be registered under the \u2018Registry Act\u2019 in any Registry Office * * * and such registration shall bind all interest or estate of the defendant or defendants in lands and hereditaments situate within the registration district * * * in which such office is situate * * * the same as though the defendant or defendants had in writing under his or their hand or hands and seal or seals charged the said lands and hereditaments with the amount of the said judgment,\u201d the proceeding thereafter being a suit in equity for the purpose of realizing the amount of the judgment by the sale of the lands so charged. Then the Judgments Act (Ch. 80, R.S.M.), section 3, enacts that\ndecrees and orders in equity and rules and orders at law, whether of a court or a judge for the payment of money, costs, charges or expenses, shall constitute judgments and shall have all the force and effect of judgments at law, * * * and the expression \u2018judgment,\u2019 when used in this or any other Act, unless the context shows otherwise, shall include any such decree, judgment or order.\nSec. 4. It shall not be necessary in any case to make a judge\u2019s order for the payment of money a rule of court before issuing execution thereon, but upon filing the order it shall, constitute a judgment, and executions and certificates of judgments may thereon issue as on a regular judgment obtained in the ordinary way.\nThis Act is, I think, applicable to County Courts and upon general principles the interpretation clause, as well as the clauses just set out, may be read into the County Courts Act.\nI do not overlook sections five and six of the Act which only apply to the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench judgments and orders. There is there provision made for the registration of such judgments and orders, but it is only doing for such judgments and orders what the County Courts Act as supplemented by the general provisions of the Judgments Act, has done for the County Court judgments and orders.\nI take it, therefore, to be reasonably clear that County Court orders for the payment of money may be registered so as to bind lands in the same way as similar Queen\u2019s Bench orders may be registered.\nReturning to the amendment here, and, having in view the fact that, at the time of its passing, County Court orders were subjected to registration as being statutory judgments, we are able to give it a natural and reasonable meaning. The object was to put County Court judgments (including orders for the payment of money), in the same position as regards their summary enforcement as similar Queen\u2019s Bench judgments and orders, the word \u201corders\u201d being inserted in the retroactive and enlarging clause of the amendment, in the same way as they were inserted (several times), in the clauses which were the subject of the amendment merely ex abundanti cautela.\nThe court below gave a construction to the word \u201c order,\u201d thinking, under the statute law, it was capable of that construction only. Had they thought that County Court orders were capable of registration, as I think they were, they would have doubtless adopted what I submit is the proper view.\nFinally, if I am wrong on this branch of the case, I adopt the reasoning of the learned Chief Justice as to the limited retroactivity of the amendment, accepting as authority and as applicable here, the judgment of Lindley J., in Lauri v. Renad ([3]).\nThe action in my view should be dismissed with costs in all the courts. DAVIES J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Manitoba in favour of the respondents in an action brought by them for the recovery of possession of land. The questions raised upon the appeal involved the proper construction to be placed upon a statute of the Manitoba Legislature, 60 Vict. ch. 4, purporting to extend the rules 803 and 804 of \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Bench Act, 1895\u201d, of that province, so as to cover County Court judgments and applying the amendment to orders previously made.\nThe amendment in question is one of a number of amendments made to the Act of 1895, and reads as follows :\nRule 807. By inserting the following rule after rule 807. Rule 807 (a). In the case of a County Court judgment an application may be made under rule 803 or rule 804, as the case may be. This amendment shall apply to orders and judgments heretofore made or entered, except in cases where such orders or judgments have been attacked before the passing of this amendment.\nThis enactment came into force on 30th March, 1897, after the completion of all the proceedings upon which the respondents rely for title.\nThe questions raised and argued before us on the appeal were : First. Whether the amendment applied to orders made previously to its passing on County Court judgments under sections 803 and 804; and, secondly : Assuming that it did, whether it was broad and comprehensive enough to cover the proceedings including the sale which followed the orders.\nI am of the opinion that the amendment does apply to orders previously made by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, on applications to sell lands on judgments obtained in the county court.\nThe reasoning of the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Bain, who delivered the judgment of the court below, appear to me on this point conclusive. In point of fact, every judge of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Manitoba, before whom the question has come, including the late Chief Justice Taylor, reached the same conclusion.\nThe history of the amendment may well be referred to in placing a construction upon it. It appears that the court had for some time assumed that they had jurisdiction to make orders under the rules in question on County Court judgments, for the sales of lands, and these orders were treated as valid until an objection to the jurisdiction of the court to make them was sustained in Proctor v. Parker ([4]). It seems clear that the amendment in question was passed in consequence of that decision and was intended to remove all doubts as to the power of the court to have made or to make orders for sales on County Court judgments..\nThe question is : Has the legislature clearly expressed: its intention ?\nIt was argued by Mr. Aylesworth that the word \u201c orders \u201d in the amendment must have reference to orders of the County Court for the payment of money and not to orders under the rules embodied in the Queen\u2019s Bench Act, 1895, which were being amended, but, as is pointed out by Chief Justice Killam, this cannot be so because the rules which are amended only give power to proceed upon registered judgments and orders and there was no provision for the registration of County Court orders. Besides, the latter part of the section, exempting orders or judgments which had been \u201c attacked,\u201d from its operation clearly shewed; that what the legislature must have referred to were such orders as had been made by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in the past on County Court judgments and against the validity or legality of which proceedings had been taken. By no reasonable construction could such language be applied to orders in the County Court for the payment of money. In my opinion the true construction of the amendment, which is admittedly obscurely worded and badly drawn, is to extend the jurisdiction of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench under rules 803 and 804 to County Court judgments and further to confirm past proceedings under such rules on County Court judgments taken when it was supposed jurisdiction existed.\nThe first part of the section relates to future applications to be made, and extends as well to existing as to future County Court judgments. The latter part relates to previous applications made and was doubtless intended to have a retroactive affect and to confirm them It is argued, however, that while the latter part of the section has a retroactive effect so as to confirm these disputed orders for sale, it does not confirm the proceedings taken upon and subsequent to the orders. But this part of the amendment does not pretend simply to validate any particular order or proceeding. It applies the first part of the amendment which extends the jurisdiction of the court to County Court judgments to orders theretofore made and by doing so declares the court to have had jurisdiction to hear the applications and make the orders in the past which the court had held it did not possess.\nIt is in my opinion a declaratory enactment so far as its latter part is concerned making its first part, which gave the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench jurisdiction to make orders for sale of land on County Court judgments, apply retroactively to orders already made under such rules on such judgments.\nA proper provision was made exempting from the operation of this retroactive legislation such orders as had been \u201cattacked\u201d before the passing of the amendment. The effect of this declaratory legislation was not only to validate the orders themselves but all proceedings taken under or in pursuance of them. Any other construction would defeat what I hold to be the declared intention of the Legislature.\nIf in the case now before us the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench had power and jurisdiction under the amendment to hear the application and make the order for the sale of the land in question, then the necessary proceedings directed by the order or the rules to be taken to give it effect must also be held to be confirmed.\nOnce it had full jurisdiction given to it, or had its jurisdiction declared and confirmed, over the subject matter, than all the provisions of the rules became applicable to enable the court to carry out its order.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Cameron & Phillips.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Tupper, Phippen & Tupper.\n[1] 13 Man.

As advocate of the execution creditor, he delivered to the deputy sheriff a requisition to charge lands then registered in the name of the execution debtors in the Northern Alberta Land Registration District, as their interest might appear, and the lands were accordingly charged by the sheriff under the provisions of the Territories Real Property Act, as amended by 51 Viet. ch. 20, sec. 94, and advertised for sale under the execution. Subsequently, certain transferees of the lands so charged and advertised registered their deeds of conveyance, which were dated prior to the execution, and served notices upon the sheriff forbidding the sale. At the time the jurisprudence of the territorial courts was considered as settled by the decision In re Rivers ([1]), which had not then been reversed, and on being informed by the sheriff of the notices served, the appellant advised him to continue the sale proceedings, notwithstanding the notices, on the ground that the unregistered transfers were inoperative as against the execution lodged in the lands registration office. The transferees then brought actions against the execution creditor and the deputy sheriff to restrain the sale proceedings and to have the execution cancelled and removed from the register as a cloud upon their titles. The appellant appeared in these suits as advocate for both the execution creditor and the deputy sheriff and pleaded a joint defence, without interpleading for the sheriff, but alleging that the sheriff of the district, and not the deputy sheriff, had charged the lands and contending that the deputy sheriff had been improperly joined as a defendant in the actions. The appellant also moved in the trial court to have the name of the deputy sheriff struck out as a defendant, but the trial judge (Rouleau J.), dissolved the injunction and entered judgment for the defendants without making any order on the motion to strike out the deputy sheriff's name. On appeal to the full court, the trial court judgment was reversed, and a motion, renewed by the appellant before the court en banc, to have the deputy sheriff's name struck out was refused with costs.\nThe deputy sheriff did not appeal from the judgment en banc and brought the present action against his advocate to recover certain fees and charges for matters in which he had taken proceedings for clients in the sheriff's office and also to recover, as damages on the ground of negligence and misconduct, the costs incurred by him in the above mentioned suits, alleging also that the appellant had impliedly and expressly obliged himself to indemnify the plaintiff against any liability for costs or damages in consequence of the proceedings which had been taken.\nIn his defence, in addition to the general issue and other pleas, the defendant (present appellant), counter-claimed, first, for alleged overcharges made by the sheriff in bills previously paid to him for fees and charges in respect of matters in the sheriff's office in which his clients had been interested parties, and, secondly, for his costs in defending the deputy sheriff in the suits brought by the transferees, but of which no signed bill had been rendered before the filing of the defence.\nThe trial court declared that the plaintiff was entitled to be indemnified for the amount of the costs awarded against him in the actions by the transferees, less $147.42 which sum was allowed the defendant for a portion of his counter-claim for over-charges.\nOn appeal to the full court by the defendant against the trial court judgment in so far as it favoured the plaintiff, and cross-appeal by the plaintiff from that part of the judgment which allowed a portion of the counterclaim, the Supreme Court of the North-west Territories, en banc, dismissed the appeal by the defendant and allowed the cross-appeal of the plaintiff with costs.\nJ. Travers Lewis and Smellie for the appellant. Throughout all the transactions in question in the case the appellant acted solely as the advocate of the execution creditor; he was an agent and his principal was known, consequently he incurred no personal liability. He carefully limited his requisition to the sheriff as to charging the lands only so far as the debtor's interest might appear and incurred no liability on account of the sheriff exceeding his authority and attempting to charge and levy on the fee. No express contract by appellant to indemnify the sheriff has been proved and certainly no such indemnity can be implied from anything appellant may have done in discharging his duty towards his client and by his special authori-sation seeking to secure for him the fruits of his judg- ment. See Smith v. Keal ([2]) per Lindley L. J. at page 354; Levi v. Abbott ([3]); Hallett v. Mears ([4]); Jarmain v. Hooper ([5]); Childers v. Wooler ([6]); Robbins v. Bridge ([7]).\nThere is no evidence of any misconduct on the part of appellant nor of anything which might constitute actionable negligence. The plaintiff, respondent, knew and approved of every step taken by the appellant in the suits against him. When appellant advised as to the unregistered transfers being inoperative as against the registered execution he was justified and bound by the decision In re Rivers ([8]) which was then the established jurisprudence of the North-west Territories on that question. In any event, crassa negligentia has not been proved. Blair v. The Assets Company ([9]); Purves v. Handell ([10]); Hart v. Frame ([11]); Kemp v. Burt ([12]); Swinfen v. Chelmsford ([13]).\nThere could be no objection to appellant acting for both the sheriff and the execution creditor in the actions brought against them and it was so found by the trial judge. The sheriff could not withdraw the notification by which he had charged the lands in the Lands Registration Office and he was properly joined in all the defences pleaded.\nThe appellant insists that his counterclaim is well founded and that he should recover on both heads. The rule requiring an advocate to render a signed bill of costs one month before suit does not prevent the amount of his costs being set up by way of counter claim although this formality may have been omitted. Brown v. Tibbits ([14]); Lester v. Logarus ([15]); Irving v Wilson ([16]); Umphelby v. McLean ([17]). The practice followed was in conformity with the best precedents of pleading; see Bullen & Leake, (4 ed.) page 944.\nWe also refer generally to Hebb v. Pun Pong ([18]); Lee v. Everest ([19]); Boyle v. Busby ([20]); Smith v. Broadbent & Co. ([21]); Ford v. Williams ([22]); Rascorlla v. Thomas ([23]); Lampleigh v. Braithwait ([24]); Snow v. Hix ([25]).\nChrysler K.C. for the respondent. There is an implied indemnity under the circumstances of this case which makes the appellant liable to the sheriff. Heugh v. Abergavenny ([26]); Bennett v. Bayes ([27]); Ontario Industrial Loan & Investment Co. v. Lindsey ([28]); Jellett v. Wilkie et al. ([29]). As the sheriff acted by direction of the appellant and by his act occasioned injury to the rights of a third party, not evidently illegally but honestly and bona fide in compliance with the direction, the party giving the direction is under an implied agreement to indemnify the party acting upon it. Addison on Contracts (9 ed.) 423; Evans, Principal and Agent, 416 et seq.; 12 Campbell's Ruling Cases, \"Indemnity,\" 838. There is no evidence that appellant acted as agent for Jellett in directing the sheriff. As solicitor for Jellett he had no implied authority to give such a direction. Re McPhillips ([30]); Keal v. Smith ([31]) affirmed sub. nom. Smith v. Keal ([32]); Burrell v. Jones ([33]); Wallbridge v. Hall ([34]); Muirhead v. Shirreff ([35]). There is no evidence of express authority. The direction given was personal the words \"Advocate for the Plaintiff\" being merely descriptive. Hall v. Ashhurst ([36]); Lennard v. Robinson ([37]); Scrare v. Whiltington ([38]); Parker v. Winlo ([39]); Watson v. Murrell ([40]) ; Hutcheson v. Eaton ([41]); Story on Agency, secs. 269, 270, 278; Evans Prin. & Agent, 245; 359. There appears to be a stronger inference in favor of personal liability in the case of an attorney or professional agent than in the case of others. The ratification by Jellett claimed in argument, but not established by the evidence would not relieve appellant from liability; see Woolen v. Wright ([42]); Kenedy v. Patterson ([43]); The general statement, that ratification transfers both rights and liabilities to the ratifying principal, is subject to the limitation that the agent is released only if he is not liable ex directo on the contract, but only on his implied warranty of authority ; he is not released if he is liable ex directo on the contract by virtue of the terms thereof as, it has already been submitted, is the case here.

Wright ([44]); Ruling cases, Vol. II, Agency 484.\nBut in truth, the law of principal and agent has no application at all to the present action, which is not based on contract but on general principles of equity. See DeColyar on Guarantees, pp. 305 et seq., and 7 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law (2 ed.) tit. \"Contribution and Exoneration,\" pp. 326, et seq. The cases from Pasley v. Freeman ([45]); Derry v. Peek ([46]); both annotated in 12 Campbell's Ruling Cases, tit. \"Fraud\" settles the law that wilful falsehood, or reckless disregard of truth is an essential element in an action for deceit, and the rule deducible is that where A. asserts the ownership of property to be in a particular person, and where if such assertion be true, he may lawfully give a direction to B. (either as being his special mandatary or as holding a public office) to do an act regarding such property, B. if he does the act by the direction of A. or at his request, and it turns out that A.'s assertion was in fact false and the real owner recovers damages against B., is entitled in an action in the case alleging the direction or request and the falsity of A.'s assertion to recover damages by way of indemnity against A., whether A. be acting on his own behalf or not.

Lovering ([54]); Moodie v. Dougall ([55]).\nThe evidence establishes an express agreement to indemnify Robertson. There is undoubtedly a direct conflict of evidence upon this point, but the conclusion should, it is submitted, be in respondent's favour. See Pollock on Contracts (5 ed.) pp. 233, 439, 440; Smith v. Hughes ([56]); Birrell v. Dryer ([57]); Knox v. Munro ([58]). Appellant ought to have declined to act for the sheriff while acting for Jellett, their interests being in conflict, inasmuch as the sheriff was entitled to be indemnified by Jellett, if Jellett authorized the direction on which he acted, and, in any case, by the appellant himself. Under the circumstances appellant was guilty of breach of duty and misconduct for the consequences of which he is liable. 3 Am. and Eng. Ency. Law (2 ed.) pp. 295, 299, 300, 379, 380, 387. Taylor v.

Dinner ([70]).\nThe court has inherent power to protect its own officers, independently of the. Interpleader Acts, which extend to goods only, and on application to that effect proceedings have been stayed till indemnity was given, and a withdrawal of the execution directed, if indemnity were not given. 22 Am. & Eng.

The deputy sheriff would have been protected had he refrained from contesting and set up his true position in a separate Statement of Defence. The course actually pursued by attempting to have his name struck out was clearly wrong on principle and authority, apart even from the claim of injunction, it being clear on the authorities already cited that, notwithstanding his official capacity, he was liable. Had he either by interpleader action, or by motion or by separate defence made his claim for protection merely, he would undoubtedly have been protected and escaped being charged with costs. Neuman v. Godfrey ([80]); Jones v. Wiggins ([81]); Bullen & Leake (1 ed.) p. 457; Odger on Pleading, (2 ed.) p. 201; Seton on Decrees pp. 213; Clark v. Wilmott ([82]). It is not necessary, in order that these principles should apply, that there should be a formal disclaimer. Wansley v. Smallwood ([83]).\nSo far as the counterclaim relates to the bill of costs in the actions, the grounds on which the plaintiff is entitled to judgment on his claim at the same time disentitle the appellant to his costs. As to the rest of the counterclaim the Judicature Ordinance No. 6 of 1893, sec. 538, (now rule 536, C. O. 1898,) affords an answer in law. There is no pretence that any of its provisions have been complied with. The form of action is immaterial; notice is necessary, though the form of action is for money had and received. Greenway v. Hurd ([84]); Selmes v. Judge ([85]); Waterhouse v. Keen ([86]); Midland Railway Co. v. Withington Local Board ([87]). A further answer is that the sums were all paid voluntarily under a mistake of law. The judgment of the court was delivered by:\nDavies J.\u2014This was an action brought by the respondent Robertson, Deputy Sheriff at Edmonton, against his solicitor or advocate, the appellant Taylor, in which it was claimed that Taylor was bound to indemnify Robertson for costs incurred by him in the defence of certain actions brought against him and one Jellatt by Wilkie and others, on the grounds of an alleged express or of an implied indemnity from Taylor, or alternatively, against such parts thereof as were incurred by the breach of duty, misconduct or negligence of Taylor.\nThe appellant, Taylor, denied, as a matter of fact, having given any express indemnity or that, under the facts, any implied indemnity from him arose. He also denied all charges of breach of duty or negligence and counter-claimed: First, for the amount of his costs in defending Deputy Sheriff Robertson in the actions brought against him, and; Secondly, for certain alleged overcharges made by Robertson as sheriffs fees, in cases which the appellant, Taylor, had placed in his hands and in which Taylor was advocate or solicitor.\nThe facts out of which the proceedings arose are not disputed. One Jellatt had obtained a judgment against The Edmonton and Saskatchewan Land Company and, on the twenty-ninth May, 1893, Taylor, as his advocate, placed an execution on this judgment in the hands of Robertson, as Deputy Sheriff of the Northern Alberta Judicial District, and at the same time in writing, directed the sheriff to charge the interest of the company in certain lands with the said judgment and execution. The direction or requisition was entitled in the suit, was signed by Taylor, as advocate of Jellatt, the plaintiff, and was as follows: Requisition to Charge Lands.\nMR. SHERIFF,\u2014Required the following lands to be charged, under the Territories Real Property Act, as to the defendant's interest, as the same may appear. (Here follows the description of the several parcels of land required to be charged.)\nThere was another requisition delivered by Taylor, as Jellatt's advocate, to Robertson, at the same time affecting other lands, but as these other lands were not the lands of any of the plaintiffs in the consolidated suits against Jellatt and Robertson, out of which the present proceedings arose, it has no bearing upon the case.\nCopies of this execution and requisition were, on being received by the deputy sheriff, duly delivered by him to the registrar of the district within which the lands were situate, pursuant to the 94th section of the Territories Real Property Act, as amended by 51 Vict. ch. 20, and the registrar entered a memorandum thereof in the register.\nAt this date all these lands were registered in the name of The Edmonton and Saskatchewan Land Company.\nIn April, 1894, the deputy sheriff advertised the lands for sale and, on the 27th of June, 1894, the deeds to Wilkie and others of these lands, which had been delivered before the registration of the execution, were registered and notices served upon the deputy sheriff forbidding him to sell.\nThere is a dispute as to whether the appellant Taylor, who was the execution creditor's advocate, actually directed the lands to be advertised by the sheriff, or whether the latter did it without express orders in the ordinary discharge of his duties. But, in the view I take of the appellant's position, and duty, it does not matter which contention is correct. There is also some difference of opinion as to what was said by Taylor at the time the deputy sheriff came to him with the notices of the deeds having been registered and forbidding further proceedings upon the sale. It may be assumed from the evidence that Taylor made light of them and told Robertson to pay no attention to them. His client Jellatt, the plaintiff in the action, had determined to go on with the sale and not withdraw his execution, relying upon a previous decision of the Supreme Court of the Territories, In re Rivers ([88]). Taylor would be fully justified in telling the deputy sheriff of this determination and it would be his duty to do so.\nOn the fourth of July following, Messrs. Wilkie and others, the grantees of the Edmonton and Saskatchewan Land Company, whose several deeds had now been registered, commenced their actions against Jellatt, the execution creditor, and Robertson, the deputy sheriff, to restrain them from proceeding with the sale under the execution which had been issued and registered against The Edmonton and Saskatchewan Land Company on the ground that the execution was a cloud on their titles and asked that the entry of the execution should be cancelled and removed from the register and that an injunction should be issued restraining the sale of the lands and for damages.\nTaylor, the appellant, appeared as solicitor for both defendants, Jellatt and Robertson, being expressly retained by them and defended the suit on the ground that the deeds of the plaintiffs, being unregistered at the time of the registration of the execution against the grantors, they were inoperative as against the execution.\nIn pleading, he joined both parties in the same defence and, it is now contended, on the part of Robert- son, the deputy sheriff, that in doing so, he was guilty of such negligence as made him liable in this action for the damages sustained by Robertson.\nIn pleading as he did, he followed the usual forms prescribed by the best pleaders, and it is difficult to see how he could have put in any other defence, or wherein his negligence lay.\nHe certainly could not have interpleaded for the sheriff and, if he had severed in his defence, his plea could not be materially different from the one he put in for the execution plaintiff and the sheriff jointly. But he did not stop there. Shortly after the actions were begun he applied to one of the judges of the North-West Territories court to have the name of the deputy sheriff Robertson struck out of the writ and the subsequent proceedings. The learned judge who heard the application, unfortunately died before giving his judgment thereon, and Taylor, at the trial of the action before Judge Rouleau, renewed his application, but, as the action was dismissed by Mr. Justice Rouleau and the injunction dissolved, he does not appear to have thought it necessary to accede to the motion and strike out Robertson's name. At any rate, his name was not struck out and the case went up by appeal to the Supreme Court of the North-west Territories, when Taylor appears again to have renewed his argument to have Robertson's name struck out. The application was not successful and the Supreme Court of the Territories reversed the judgment of the trial judge, declared the execution to be clouds upon the plaintiff's titles, ordered the registrar to remove from the register of the lands in question the entries made by him of the execution and enjoined the deputy sheriff from selling the lands. The Deputy Sheriff Robertson was thus made liable for costs of the trial and of the appeal. He accepted the judgment and declined joining in the appeal to this court. Such an appeal was, however, taken by Jellatt his co-defendant, the execution creditor, and was dismissed, the judgment of the Supreme Court of the North-west Territories being sustained. It is for the costs incurred by Robertson on the trial before Judge Rouleau and on the appeal to the Supreme Court of the North-west Territories, that he now brings this action against Taylor, his advocate and solicitor.\nI have already said that I do not see on what possible ground Taylor can be condemned for negligence. So far as his pleading was concerned, I think, with every respect to the learned judges of the Supreme Court of the Territories, that he was right and he certainly shewed zeal and persistence in endeavouring to get his client's name struck out of the action. At the time the actions against Jellatt and Robertson were brought and up to the delivery of the judgment therein by the Supreme Court of the Territories, the case of Re Rivers ([89]) was supposed to have correctly declared what the law was as to the effect of registered executions upon unregistered deeds. Mr. Justice Rouleau, who was himself a party to the judgment in re Rivers, in giving judgment on the trial of the case now before us in appeal says:\nIn re Rivers, the language of the court as expressed by Wetmore and McGuire JJ., is unequivocal. It was held that an unregistered transfer did not pass or affect land and that an execution registered against the registered owner [had priority and that such transfer could not be registered afterwards, except subject to such execution.\nFeeling himself bound by that judgment and having been himself a party to it, he dismissed the action.\nAnd yet it is contended Taylor should be liable for actionable negligence because, as was said by Lord Davey, in the case of Blair v. Assets Company ([90]) he gave advice to his client which involved the assumption that a recent and unanimous decision of the very judges before whom the question would come was correct.\nAs to the question of indemnity, the learned judges in the court below assume Taylor and Robertson to be joint wrongdoers in registering execution against the lands of The Edmonton and Saskatchewan Land Company and hold that Taylor was liable upon an implied indemnity to Robertson, arising out of the written requisition or instructions he had given him to register that execution.\nI am of opinion that neither position is sound. I do not think that either the advocate Taylor or the deputy sheriff Robertson was a tort feasor in causing that execution to be registered against the lands of the company, nor do I think that any implied indemnity from the solicitor to the sheriff arose out of it. Each one was, in my opinion, only discharging his duty. It was the clear duty of the solicitor to do everything in his power to gather for his client Jellatt the fruits of his judgment. No question arises as to his authority to act. What he did was with the full authority and consent of Jellatt. He appears to have acted with great caution, for he carefully required the sheriff to charge the lands specified under the \"Territories Real Property Act\" as to the defendant's interest therein as the same may appear. \"What was the defendant's interest in the land? At that time as far as Taylor or Robertson knew or had notice and as far as the register shewed their interest was that of owner.\nHow could Taylor justify himself if, being charged by Jellatt his client to reap for him the fruits of his judgment, he had neglected to notify the sheriff of these lands which, as far as he knew or had means of knowledge, belonged to the defendant land company, and if as a consequence the lands were subsequently conveyed away by the land company? The cases cited in the judgment below, and at the bar, of solicitors going beyond and outside of their duty and officiously pointing out to the sheriff specific personal property as that of the defendant and requiring him to sell are not in point. Taylor here was acting strictly within and in discharge of his duty to his client and the lands which he directed the deputy sheriff to register his execution against, were lands registered in the name of the defendant company and which, being so registered and without notice to the contrary, he had every reason to assume they were the owners of.\nIt was not until the end of June in the following year, 1894, that he received any notice to the contrary. He was not therefore an officious solicitor going outside of his duty and taking upon himself personal responsibilities which did not properly belong to his position as solicitor, but one discharging a duty which, under the circumstances, was incumbent on him and directing the sheriff to do that which was apparently his duty.\nSection ninety-four of the \"Territories Real Property Act,\" as amended by 51 Vict. ch. 20, directs the sheriff to deliver a copy of every writ or process affecting lands which he may have had delivered to him, together with a memorandum in writing of the lands intended to be charged to the registrar within whose district the lands are situate and declares that no land shall be bound by any such writ unless such copy or memorandum has been so delivered. It became clearly his statutory duty after receiving the requisition designating the lands intended to be bound to see if they were registered in the name of the execution defendant and if they were to deliver a copy of both writ and memorandum to the registrar. In the present case he found the lands designated were registered in the name of the execution debtor and in giving the registrar the copy of the writ and memorandum he was only discharging his statutory duty. In the like manner when, in April following, eleven months afterwards, he advertised the land, he was only doing his duty and was in no sense a tort-feasor.\nThe holders of the unregistered deeds had them in their pockets and only produced and registered them on the twenty-seventh of June, 1894, nearly two months after the lands were advertised. Jellatt, the execution creditor, being then notified of these deeds and their registration refused to withdraw the execution, claiming that it took precedence, whereupon the proceedings were taken which rightly determined that the Territories Real Property Act does not give the execution creditor any superiority of title over prior unregistered transferees, but merely protects lands from intermediate sales and dispositions by the execution debtor. See judgment of Chief Justice Strong in Jellatt v. Wilkie, et al ([91]). But in that very case the Chief Justice says, at p. 292:\nNo doubt, if the sheriff had sold and the purchaser had registered his transfer, the Act would apply, and would in that case, invalidate prior unregistered transfers made by the execution debtor before the registration of the execution.\nAnd so it seems to me that the execution creditor was perfectly right in registering his execution against the lands standing in the name of the judgment debtor and in advertising such lands and continued in the right until at least the unregistered deeds were registered. His refusal to recognize these deeds after registration as taking precedence of his judgment and insisting upon going on to sale compelled the grantees to take the proceedings they did and made him liable for their costs. It may have also created a relationship between him and the sheriff from which an implied indemnity to the latter might be assumed. But how could such an indemnity be assumed against the solicitor? His action throughout was taken as solicitor. His notice or requisition to the sheriff was so signed His principal was known from beginning to end and, unless therefore some express indemnity was given by him, he is not liable. See Lewis v Nicholson ([92]); Collen v. Wright ([93]); Cherry v. The Colonial Bank of Australasia ([94]). See also Ford v. Williams ([95]).\nAs regards the alleged \"express indemnity\", the court below say that the evidence is conflicting and that in view of the conclusion they have reached upon the implied indemnity\nit was unnecessary to inquire whether there was, in fact, any express promise to indemnify.\nNeither the trial judge nor the court in banc found that any express indemnity was given.\nIt is true that Judge McGuire says he\nthinks, if it was necessary to connect the defendant with the advertisement, he was aware of it and approved of it.\nThat may well be so, but such knowledge or approval falls very far short of an express indemnity. There certainly never was any written indemnity, and the existence of any verbal contract was hardly urged upon us at the argument. From a careful perusal of the evidence, I have come to the conclusion that there is not sufficient evidence to justify this court in finding that an express binding promise was made. The deputy sheriff (respondent), does no doubt say that Taylor, more than once, promised him\nthat he would guarantee him from all damage and harm.\nHe says that these promises were made at or about the time he was being sued and after the suit was begun. The appellant Taylor, on the other hand, emphatically denies that anything was said about indemnity, or that the idea of indemnity was ever brought up, except in the summer of 1895, presumably after the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Territories which was delivered 13th June, 1895, and when an appeal to this court was being considered. He further states that he never indemnified or guaranteed any one for their costs in the whole course of his profession, and that Robertson approved of the application being made to have his name struck out as a defendant, and that it was impossible that anything could have been said about indemnity. Mr. H. C. Taylor, the appellant's law partner, says that he was in constant attendance at the office during the years when these proceedings were going on; that he knew nothing of any indemnity to be given Robertson and never heard Robertson mention it. He further says:\nI can't recall any specific conversation with Robertson but have no doubt I was present when there was any conversation between S. S. Taylor (the appellant), and Robertson.\nThe evidence is conflicting, but I do not entertain any reasonable doubt that no express indemnity was ever given by Taylor or intended to be given. I think a good deal of the confusion or misunderstanding on the part of the respondent, Robertson, arose out of the conversations with respect to the proceedings having for their object the striking out of his name from the action, and the subsequent negotiations to induce him to join in the appeal to this court which he declined doing.\nThere remains only to be considered the counter-claim. With respect to the second part, to recover back certain alleged overcharges for work done by respondent as sheriff, that clearly cannot be allowed as the moneys, if recoverable at all, do not belong to Taylor, but to his clients. \"With respect to the first part of the counterclaim, viz., the costs of defending Robertson in the suit, it was objected that no signed bill had been delivered by Taylor pursuant to the statute. But it is clear from the authorities that such an objection does not apply to a set-off or counter-claim. The court below dismissed this part of the case with the statement that as they found against Taylor on the implied indemnity, if the counter-claim was allowed it would simply go to increase the amount which they held Taylor was bound to indemnify Robertson against. In my view of the case however, there was no such indemnity express or implied and Taylor is entitled on his counter-claim to judgment for what are reasonable charges.\nThe appeal should, in my judgment, be allowed with costs in all courts, and judgment entered for the defendant on his first counter-claim for such an amount as the proper officer may tax the costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: H.

L.R. 73) that neither of the parties to the contract had a right to cancel it against the will of the other during the renewed term.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendant.\nThe question to be decided on this appeal was whether or not, under the above recited provisions of a contract for lighting the Russell House in Ottawa, the defendant, as lessor of the said hotel premises, had a right to cancel the contract during a renewed term of his lease. The Electric Company appealled from a judgment of the Court of Appeal deciding that the provision for cancellation after 36 months was in force after the renewal. G.F. Henderson for the appellant.\nHogg K.C. and F.A. Magee for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014The Standard Electric Co. of Ottawa, to whose rights in the premises the appellant Company has succeeded, entered into a contract with the respondent on the 5th November, 1892, to supply the Russell House, of which the latter was lessee, with electric light. The period during which this supply was to, or might, continue, was fixed by two clauses, the interpretation of which is the question involved here. The first clause is as follows:\nThis contract is to continue in force for not less than 36 consecutive calendar months from the date of first burning, and thereafter until cancelled in writing by one of the parties thereto.\nThere is no dispute about this clause. The light was furnished and paid for during the three years therein specified. It so happened that the lease under which Mr. St. Jacques held the Russell House had at the time of the agreement three years to run, and it is conceded that he period of supply fixed upon was mainly influenced by that consideration, and that the clause itself had reference only to then present conditions.\nThe second clause reads:\nSpecial conditions, if any, * * * This contract to remain in force after the expiration of the said 36 months for the term that the party of the second part renews his lease for the Russell House, and should he fail to renew his lease, the parties of the first part will not remove their wires from the Russell House, providing the new tenant does not wish to use electric incandescent lights, but if the new tenant does wish to use electric incandescent lights and not take them from the parties of the first part, they will expect to be paid for the wiring the sum of five hundred dollars, and if this contract is renewed for five years, the wiring is to belong to the Russell House. About the period of the expiration of the lease under which the property was held in 1892, a renewal lease was entered into at a higher rental and for additional property, the term therein specified being for a period of five years to be computed from the 1st November 1895. On the 1st December, 1897, the defendant, St. Jacques, gave notice of cancellation of the contract, to take effect from the date of notice, and required the company to disconnect the wires connecting the Russell House with the main line. The question is: Was this cancellation effective for the purposes of putting an end to the agreement between the parties? The learned Chancellor before whom the case was tried, in attempting to give effect to both clauses, and having stated that they were not repugnant or contradictory, thus interprets the contract:\nIt is to be enforced for 36 months and thereafter for the term that St. Jacques renews his lease, until cancelled in writing by one of the parties;\nand this construction was adopted by the Court of Appeal. In my view however, but with great deference, this is not the proper construction. Both of the learned judges who dealt with the case below admit the principle that effect must, if possible, be given to every stipulation of a contract, no one part being rejected unless absolutely repugnant to some other part. And they were apparently of opinion that there no repugnancy between the two clauses or any difficulty in giving them both a clear and definite meaning.\nI agree with this, but the effect which they gave to the second clause had the effect of eliminating is altogether from the agreement. If, as the learned Chancellor says, it was to be in force for 36 months and thereafter for the term that St. Jacques renewed his lease until cancelled in writing by one of the parties, then he could have cancelled it immediately upon the expiration of the 36 months, independently of the fact whether he renewed or did not renew his lease, so that the insertion of the clause respecting the rights and obligations of the parties upon a renewal of the lease was rendered absolutely futile and unnecessary. The agreement, so far as its duration was concerned, had reference first to the existing term and secondly, in respect to a non-existing but contingent term to be determined by the parties subsequently. The second clause had relation to rights of the parties only upon and in the event of the contingency happening, in which case certain new rights and liabilities would arise. Mr. St. Jacques was under no obligation to renew the lease, but, (and we must assume that the provision was as much in his interest as in the interest of the appellants) he would seem to have been anxious to secure light for his hotel should he remain its tenant after its termination, and it was, I imagine, with that end in view that this special provision was inserted. It had no reference whatever to the condition of affairs during the first three years, but it was a definite and unambiguous arrangement securing his supply of light for a definite period of time thereafter should he in the future elect to renew his lease. In other words, the appellant company undertook to deliver to him and he undertook to pay for during the period of five years from the commencement of the term created by the new lease, all such light as he might require for the purposes of his hotel. I have not been able to appreciate any argument which justified the respondent in attempting behind the company\u2019s back and without their consent, to put an end to the agreement at the time and in the manner he did. The moment that Mr. St. Jacques became tenant for a renewed term of the Russell property then for the first time the second clause took effect, and in so far as the duration of that extended lease was concerned, the time was a part of the contract between the lighting company and the lessee of the hotel. It rendered certain the duration of the contract which up till then had been uncertain, as depending upon the contingency as to whether a renewed term would ever be created, and its effect was to give to the lessee an absolute right to five years\u2019 supply of light at contract prices, and to the company payment therefor for the same period. If the new lease had itself contained any provisions for the shortening of the term from five years to a lesser period, or had given an option to the lessee to terminate it at any time, or had stipulated for a forfeiture, of which there is nothing of the kind here, I am not prepared to say that such provisions would not have to be read into the contract, but I repudiate the idea that in circumstances like the present, any one party to a contract can annihilate or even prejudice the rights of another party by some secret or voluntary agreement which the former may make with a third party. Lord Dynevor v. Tennant[2].\nThe respondent\u2019s counsel endeavoured to make a point under the Statute of Frauds. We disposed of that at the argument, it appearing that there was no change made in the agreement sued on either verbally or in writing, the alleged change in the method of computing the price being for convenience only, and legally subject either to alteration or to a return at any time to the original manner of ascertaining the monthly consumption.\nThe appeal, in my judgment, should be allowed with costs in all the courts, and judgment entered for the plaintiffs with the usual reference to the Master to ascertain the damages sustained by the plaintiffs between the 1st day of December, 1897 and the 31st day of October, 1900. Upon payment of these damages the Russell House will be entitled to retain possession of the electric fixtures in the pleadings mentioned, and the money paid into court either returned to the defendant or credited upon any judgment which may be recovered against him, as the Master may determine.\nGIROUARD J. (dissenting)\u2014I agree with the court below. I believe we should give effect to the two clauses and we do so by holding that during the first 36 months no cancellation of the lease can take place, but that it can be done after by either of the parties.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: MacCracken, Henderson & McDougal.\nSolicitors for the respondent: O\u2019Connor, Hogg & Magee.\n[1] 1 Ont.

Brown (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1901: November 7, 26.\nPresent: Taschereau, Gwynne, Sedgewick, Girouard and Davies JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nNegligence.\u2014Findings of jury.\u2014Contributory negligence.\nIn an action founded on personal injuries caused by a street car the jury found that defendants\u2019 negligence was the cause of the accident and also that plaintiff had been negligent in not looking out for the car.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal (2 Ont. L.R. 53) that as the charge to the jury had properly explained the law as to contributory negligence the latter finding must be considered to mean that the accident would not have occurred but for the plaintiff\u2019s own negligence and he could not recover.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of the Divisional Court in favour of the defendant and ordering a new trial.\nThe facts in this case are as follows:\nThe plaintiff was a mechanic returning from work to his home, about half-past five in the evening. He came to the corner of Colborne and Dundas Streets, in the City of London (Dundas Street being the main thoroughfare of the city, largely travelled, and shaded at this section with shade trees). Before starting across the road, going south, the plaintiff looked to his left (being towards the east) for a car and saw none. He then started to cross the street, diagonally, towards the south-west, being unable to go directly south owing to repairs and obstructions in the highway. He had just reached the track when he was struck by a car of the defendant Company.\nOn the second trial of the action against the Street Railway Company for damages there was contradictory evidence as to the rate of speed at which the car was going at the time of the accident and also as to whether or not the bell was rung so as to warn the plaintiff of its approach. The jury\u2019s findings were as follows:\nI. Were the defendants guilty of negligence? Yes.\nII. If so, in what the negligence consist? Running at too high a rate of speed and not properly sounding the gong, also not having the car under proper control.\nIII. If the defendants were negligent was the injury to the plaintiff caused by their negligence? Yes.\nIV. Was the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence? Yes.\nV. If so, in what does negligence consist? In not using more caution in crossing the railway tracks.\nVI. Might the defendants\u2019 servants, after the position of the plaintiff became apparent, by the exercise of reasonable care have prevented the accident? No.\nVII. At what sum to you assess the plaintiff\u2019s damages? Six hundred dollars.\nOn these findings the trial judge, Meredith C.J., ordered a verdict to be rendered for the defendants which was afterwards affirmed by the Divisional Court. The Court of Appeal reversed the latter judgment and set the verdict aside ordering a third trial of the action. The defendant company appealed to this court.\nHellmuth for the appellant.\nGibbons K.C. for the respondent.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014In my opinion this appeal should be allowed. GWYNNE J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, reversing a judgment rendered in favour of the defendants upon a trial before Meredith C.J. and ordering another trial of the case to be had. The case had been brought down to trial before when the jury having been unable to agree were dismissed and a second trial was ordered, at which trial, judgment having been entered for the defendants in accordance with the finding of the facts by the jury, the defendants insist that they are entitled in law to retain that judgment.\nThe action is for an injury sustained by the plaintiff occasioned, as he alleges, by the negligence of the defendants\u2019 servants in managing a street railway car running on Dundas street in the City of London, when the plaintiff was crossing the street on foot.\nThe plaintiff, having been examined as a witness on his own behalf, said that on the twentieth of July, 1899, he was going home from his work as a carpenter, and walked down the east side of Colborne street to where that street is crossed at right angles by Dundas street. That when he reached the curb-stone there at the north-east angle of Dundas and Colborne streets he stepped on to the street and looked round and saw no car on the railway and heard no bell, and that although within fourteen feet of the railway track on the ordinary footpath across the street in continuation of the sidewalk on Colborne street which he had come down he immediately started to cross Dundas street diagonally to the south-west corner of Dundas and Colborne streets, and that when he had proceeded but half way, that is to say, about forty-five or fifty feet, he was struck on the left shoulder by a street railway car proceeding from east to west.\nAnother witness, called by the plaintiff, named Joseph Waugh, was engaged in dumping gravel on the side- walk at the said north-east corner, when the plaintiff arrived there. This witness saw him enter on the street from the curb-stone and proceed diagonally across Dundas street. Witness immediately, while dumping his gravel, heard some one exclaim \u201cthey have killed a man.\u201d Whereupon witness turned and saw the plaintiff down on the street. Witness says that until then he heard no gong but that then the gong began to ring vigourously. Witness said that a car had just before passed going from the west to the east and that he heard no gong from it either, although he had passed close to it when hauling the gravel to the said north-east corner. He said also that the car which struck the plaintiff was running very fast, at a rate which he judged to be eighteen or twenty miles an hour. He said that his reason for saying that rate was the distance the car ran after the accident before it was stopped, which distance, he says, was the whole length of a block, where it reached a house called the Gustier House. Being asked how far the place where the car was stopped was from the place where the plaintiff was struck, he said, he would judge it to be one hundred and fifty or may be, two hundred yards, (that is to say, from four hundred and fifty to six hundred feet). Now, another witness called for the plaintiff, named John McLean, testified that he was standing at the sidewalk on the north-west corner of Dundas and Colborne streets when the plaintiff stepped from the curb stone on to the street at the north-west corner; that while the plaintiff was there, a street car passed coming from the west, ringing its gong, and went on east, and at the same time, witness saw the car coming from the east; that the plaintiff, immediately upon his entering on to the street from the curb-stone, proceeded diagonally across the street and just as he reached the centre of Dundas and Colborne streets and was about to put his foot upon the railway, he was struck by the right hand corner of the car which the witness had seen coming from the east; had one step been then withheld, the accident could not have happened. The gong, he says, of that car may have been ringing before the plaintiff was struck but witness was very much excited, as he said, and did not notice it, but when the plaintiff was struck it was ringing violently. This witness also judged of the speed at which the car was running, to be from fifteen to eighteen miles an hour, from the distance which it ran before it was stopped, which the witness also put near the Gustier House, which he estimated to be probably, three hundred feet from where the accident had occurred.\nAnother witness called by the plaintiff testified that he also was at the north-east angle of Dundas and Colborne streets when he saw the plaintiff start diagonally across the street. Witness immediately turned to pick up his dinner bucket and, as he did so, saw the car coming and, instantly, he heard the crashing of tools, (in a bag which the plaintiff carried on his shoulder). He says he did not hear the gong until he heard the crash of the tools.\nFrom all this evidence it is clear that the plaintiff was struck almost instantaneously after his starting from the curb-stone on the north-east corner of Dundas and Colborne streets, during which time the car, as testified to by McLean, was plainly visible, coming from the east.\nNow, on the part of the defence, the motorman and the conductor both swore that the gong was rung when the car had reached within from seventy-five to one hundred feet of Colborne street, and the motorman added that the car was going at the ordinary rate of about eight miles an hour and that it was stopped within three cars length; that is, within one hundred feet from his applying the brakes.\nA witness named Carrie Grantham, who lived on Dundas street and knew, as she said, the locality well, and was on the car at the time, testified that as the car approached Colborne street the gong was ringing and that, immediately before the accident, it was ringing vigourously and, while it was so ringing, she felt the shock of the accident. Of this she entertained no doubt. She also testified that she observed the place where the car stopped, and that this was a long distance east of the Gustier House and that, as well as she could judge, the car had not gone quite a quarter of a block from where the accident occurred until it was stopped. What the length of the block was, was not asked and did not appear.\nNow, upon this evidence the jury, upon a charge to which the plaintiff has no just ground of complaint, have found that the injury suffered by the plaintiff was due to negligence of which the defendants were guilty in running at too high a rate of speed and not properly ringing the gong and not having the car under proper control, and that the plaintiff himself was guilty of contributory negligence in not using more caution in crossing the railway tracks and that the defendants\u2019 servants could not, after the position of the plaintiff became apparent, have by the exercise of reasonable care prevented the accident.\nThe finding of the jury, upon the question of the plaintiff\u2019s own negligence having contributed to the accident, is much more in accord with the evidence than was their finding upon the question as to the defendants\u2019 negligence, the evidence offered upon which question was, it must be admitted, of a most contradictory and not very satisfactory character. Upon the above findings the learned Chief Justice rendered judgment for the defendants dismissing the action.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario has reversed that judgment and ordered another trial, upon the ground, that they thought the finding of the jury upon the question of the contributory negligence of the plaintiff not satisfactory.\nNow, that question, and what would constitute contributory negligence, appears in nearly two hundred pages of printed matter in the case before us to have been so very fully and clearly explained by the learned Chief Justice to the jury in a charge to which the plaintiff can have no reasonable ground of complaint, that we can see no reason to doubt that the jury in finding the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence meant that the plaintiff was guilty of negligence without which, notwithstanding the negligence of which they found the defendants guilty, the accident could not have occurred, and in so finding, they were acting in accordance with the explanation of the term \u201ccontributory negligence\u201d as explained to them by the learned Chief Justice, in his charge.\nThat finding was, we think, most fully justified by the evidence, and with a finding of the jury in perfect accord with the evidence upon that point, we do not think that the defendants should be remitted to the third trial in this case.\nThe appeal must therefore be allowed with costs and the judgment of the learned Chief Justice at the trial restored.\nSEDGEWICK and GIROUARD JJ. concurred in the judgment allowing the appeal. DAVIES J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario directing a new trial of the action and reversing the judgment of Chief Justice Meredith before whom the cause was tried, who had ordered judgment to be entered for the defendant. The action was brought for the recovery of damages for injuries sustained by the plaintiff owing to the alleged negligence of the appellants when attempting to cross the street railway track in the City of London.\nThe learned Chief Justice submitted to the jury a series of questions all of which were answered, and it was upon these answers that he directed the verdict to be entered for the defendants, the now appellants.\nThe questions and answers were as follows:\n1. Were the defendants guilty of negligence?\nA. Yes.\n2. If so, in what did the negligence consist?\nA. Running at too high a rate of speed and not properly sounding the gong, also not having the car under proper control.\n3. If the defendants were negligent was the injury to the plaintiff caused by their negligence?\nA. Yes.\n4. Was the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence?\nA. Yes.\n5. If so, in what does his negligence consist?\nA. In not using more caution in crossing the railway tracks.\n6. Might the defendants\u2019 servants, after the position of the plaintiff became apparent, by the exercise of reasonable care, have prevented the accident?\nA. No.\n7. At what sum to you assess the plaintiff\u2019s damages?\nA. Six hundred dollars.\nThe learned judges of the Court of Appeal in Ontario thought that the findings of the jury were inconsistent.\nMr. Justice Osier in his opinion, in which Mr. Justice Moss concurred, says:\nThe express finding of the jury that the plaintiff\u2019s injury was caused by the specific acts of negligence of which the defendants were guilty makes it to my mind almost impossible to attribute to their further finding that the plaintiff should have used more caution in crossing the track the legal result of a finding of contributory negligence;\nwhile Mr. Justice Lister found the finding of the jury \u201cconfused and unsatisfactory.\u201d\nBut if there is an apparent confusion and uncertainty or even of repugnance in the several findings of the jury, it will be found I think on a closer examination that it is only apparent and not real, and that it is to some extent inseparable from all findings, both of negligence on the defendants\u2019 part and contributory negligence on the plaintiff\u2019s. It would have perhaps been more satisfactory if the jury had pointed out more specifically the want of caution shewn by the plaintiff in crossing the track, but read as the answer must be in light of the evidence given at the trial and of the charge of the learned judge, there cannot be any doubt as to its meaning.\nThe findings of the jury on the whole amount to this, that while the accident would not have happened but for the negligence of the appellants, neither would it but for the negligence of the respondent, the plaintiff below. The learned Chief Justice in a comprehensive charge to the jury, in which he minutely reviewed all the facts, pointed out to them the nature of contributory negligence and its effect upon the plaintiff\u2019s action if found. The jury found specifically on evidence, which I think warranted the finding, that the plaintiff had been guilty of contributory negligence, and in answer to the next question say it consisted in want of caution in crossing the tracks. Read in the light of the facts as disclosed in the evidence, there can be no doubt as to the meaning of these answers. They find in effect that the plaintiff in crossing the track was careless and negligent, and did not take such ordinary precautions as a reasonable and prudent man under the circumstances should have taken. It is equally true as found by them that the appellants were guilty of negligence in the running of their cars at the time and that but for such negligence the accident would not have occurred. But the rule of law in all such cases is too firmly established to admit of any doubt. Even if the accident is attributable in the first instance to the defendants\u2019 negligence, if it would not have occurred but for the negligence of the plaintiff himself he cannot recover.\nThe questions were peculiarly those proper for the consideration of a jury. They have found as stated above, after a full and fair trial and after having had the benefit of a carefully considered explanation of the law on the subject from the learned trial judge, a charge, the correctness of which, too, is not now challenged. I can see therefore no justification for sending the case back for further trial.\nThe case of Rowan v. Toronto Railway Co.[2] referred to in the judgments below, does not seem to me to have any special application to the case now under review for the simple reason that in that case there was no finding of the jury specifically of contributory negligence as there is here.\nThe respondent\u2019s counsel, both in his factum and in his oral argument before this court, pressed very strongly the contention that the sixth question could have been put in an altogether different form and that the evidence shewed the negligence of the defendants\u2019 servants to have been so gross that no exercise of care on their part could have prevented the accident after the plaintiff\u2019s position on the track was discovered and that they therefore must be held liable. In support of this proposition he relied upon a statement made by Mr. Smith in his book on the law of negligence. But for this statement no authority was cited by Mr. Smith, and it does not seem to me at any rate applicable to a case such as this where the jury have really found that the accident would not have occurred but for the plaintiff\u2019s negligence. If any such doctrine could be invoked to destroy the legal consequence of a negligent act or want of action which was the proximate cause of the injury complained of, it would go far to destroy the doctrine of contributory negligence altogether.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment of the learned Chief Justice restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Hellmuth & Ivey.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Gibbons & Harper.\n[1] 2 Ont.

Sayward\" by being run into and sunk while at anchor by the \"Reliance\" the decision mainly depended on whether or not the lights of the lost schooner were burning as the admiralty rules required at the time of the accident. The local judge gave judgment against the \"Reliance.''\nHeld, that though the evidence given was contradictory, it was amply sufficient to justify the said judgment which should not, therefore, be disturbed on appeal. Santanderino v. Vanvert (23 Can. S. C. R. 145), and The Village of Granby v. M\u00eanard (31 Can. S. C. R. 14), followed.\nAppeal for a decision of the local judge for the Nova Scotia Admiralty District of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], in favour of the plaintiffs, owners of the \"Carrie E. Sayward.\"\nThe facts are fully stated in the judgment of the court. Harris K. C. for the appellant. The burden of proving negligence is upon the plaintiff; Morgan v. Sim[2], per Lord Wensleydale at page 312. See also Harris v. Anderson[3]; Wakelin v. London & South Western Railway Co.[4]; The Catherine of Dover[5]; The Ligo[6]. Marsden on Collisions at Sea (4 ed.) p. 2. The plaintiff, in order to recover entire damages, must prove both care on his part, and want of it on the part of defendant; The Clara[7]; his light was burning and could be seen; The Florence P. Hall[8]. Where the evidence is conflicting, and there is reasonable doubt as to which party is to blame, the loss must be sustained by the party on whom it has fallen. The Agda[9]. See Stockton's Admiralty, p. 565.\nThere is no obligation upon the master to be on deck if it is in charge of competent men; The Obey[10]. We refer also to Marsden on Collisions at Sea (4 ed.) p. 49, 64, 71, 72, 331, 332, 333, 423, and Canadian cases there cited; Emery v. Cichero; The Arklow[11]; Ocean SS. Co. v.

At the worst both vessels were in fault and it is submitted that if the evidence shews any fault whatever on the part of the defendant, it also shews an equally serious one on the part of the plaintiffs' ship, and in that case the damages will be divided; The Lapwing[16]; and there should be no costs to either side in such a case.

The learned judge held that the Sayward was not in any respect to blame, and that the collision was caused by the negligent and careless navigation of the Reliance. The facts of the case are stated by him as follows:\u2014\nThe Carrie E. Sayward, a fishing schooner of the Port of Province-town, United States of America, while in pursuit of her fishing voyage was at anchor on Bank Quero, about one hundred miles east of Sable Island on the morning of the 6th September, 1900. The schooner had a crew of twelve men all told and had nearly completed her cargo of fish, when about three o'clock on the morning of the day mentioned she was run into by a schooner afterwards ascertained to be the Reliance of Nova Scotia, also fishing on the Bank Quero. The result of the collision was that the Carrie E. Sayward sank at her anchors, and the vessel and cargo were totally lost. The wind was blowing about a three or four knot breeze from the W. S. W. or S. W. The Carrie E. Sayward had occupied the berth at which she was anchored when the collision took place for about a fortnight, and three other fishing vessels, the Lottie Burns, A. K. Damon, and the Hattie Western were anchored southerly from her at distances varying from half a mile to a mile and a-half. The Reliance had also been fishing in the neighbourhood for some weeks at a distance of three or four miles from the Carrie E. Sayward, and having resolved to change her berth her master was, when the collision occurred, sailing through and among the vessels anchored in the immediate neighbourhood of the Carrie E. Sayward. Some hours before the collision the Reliance had passed and spoken the Lottie Burns while sailing N. N. W. or N. W. on the port tack, and having tacked was sailing a course near south and on the port tack when the collision occurred. At the time of collision the Reliance had all her sails set and was making between two and one half and three miles an hour speed. It is generally admitted on both sides that during the early part of the night of the 5th September the weather was fine, the sea smooth with a slight ground swell, a bright moonlight and clear starlight. The moon sank about 2 a.m. on the 6th September, and there is much discrepancy as to the state of the atmosphere after the moon had disappeared, one party alleging that the night became dark and cloudy, while the others declare that it continued fine and clear till the collision took place. There is no question that the Reliance struck the Carrie E. Sayward a square blow about midships, and that from the effects of that blow the latter vessel with her cargo sank about two hours after the collision, after every effort had been made to save her by pumping. The only question for discussion therefore, is that raised by the defendant vessel in her preliminary act, namely:\nThe fault or default attributed to the Carrie E. Sayward is as follows:\n(a) She was carrying no light at all.\n(b) The light, if any, carried by her was very dim and indistinct, and not in accordance with the regulations for preventing collisions at sea.\n(c) The light was not so constructed as to show a clear or uniform unbroken light, nor was the same visible at a distance of at least one mile, but was a very dim and indistinct light, and was only visible a few feet from the said ship.\nThe appellant contends, first, that the burden of proving negligence lay upon the plaintiff, the Say ward, and that if in the end the case is left in \"even scales\" and does not satisfy the court that the loss was occasioned by the neglect or default of the Reliance, the plaintiff cannot succeed. He further contends that the fault was solely that of the Sayward, and that at the worst both vessels were in fault and the damages should be divided.\nThis court has time and again laid down the rule that the decision of the trial judge on disputed questions of fact will not be reversed unless it is clearly shown that the evidence is against the finding. Santandarino v. Vanvert[34]; Village of Granby v. Menard[35].\nSuch a rule is peculiarly applicable to cases of collision at sea, where there is almost invariably a great conflict of testimony and the judge must necessarily be largely influenced by the demeanor and conduct of the witnesses when examined. The contention of the appellant as to the onus of proof is admitted. The court before condemning the defendant must be first satisfied that the loss was occasioned by his neglect and further that the plaintiff was not guilty of any breach of the regulations which by possibility could have contributed to the collision. As to these legal propositions, there is no dispute.\nThe sole and only questions in this case are of fact and they turn mainly, if not altogether, upon the single question whether, on the night and at the time in question, the Carrie E. Sayward exhibited such a light as the statute requires of a vessel lying at anchor. If she had and displayed such a light, then it cannot be argued that the navigation of the Reliance was not unskillful or careless, and did not cause the accident. On this crucial question the finding of the trial judge is clear and explicit. He says:\nThe evidence of the master and crew of the \"Carrie E. Sayward\" is very clear and positive as to the sufficiency of the light during the whole voyage up to the time of the collision,\nand after giving a few of the more important parts of that evidence he goes on to say:\nThis evidence of those on board the vessel, who have best opportunity of learning and knowing the facts as to which they testify, has not in my opinion been seriously, if at all, shaken or impugned by testimony on the part of the defendant vessel, while it is corroborated very strongly indeed by the evidence of those on board the schooners in the immediate neighbourhood of the Carrie E. Sayward, on the night of the collision, and as to the general character of the light on board the Carrie E. Sayward not only on the night and morning of the collision, but during the whole period of her voyage on the banks. These witnesses are Brier, master of the Lottie Burns; Silver, master of the Ada K. Damon; Marshall, master of the Hattie Western; and Gasper, a fisherman on the Ada K. Damon.\nThe contention of Mr. Harris, for the appellant, that the evidence does not justify this finding, he based upon two distinct grounds, one, that the lantern itself was defective, having been carelessly or badly repaired during the fishing voyage and after the vessel had left her port of departure, and the other, that even if the lantern was a good and efficient one, the light was insufficient and not up to the regulations on the particular night in question, and especially at and for some time previous to the moment of the collision.\nOn the first point it seems sufficient to say that the learned Chief Justice had the lantern in court at the trial before him and therefore had the best possible opportunity of deciding whether it was as alleged leaky and otherwise defective. But in addition to that the evidence shows that the crew of the Reliance took possession of the lantern, which belonged to the Sayward, at the time of the collision, produced it in court for a time, and then took it away and have since retained it. If it was leaky or otherwise inherently defective, they surely would have given positive evidence on the point either from experiment or by ocular demonstration. The presumption against them from their not having done so, is to my mind conclusive. Then on the question whether the light was insufficient on the night in question and not up to that prescribed by the regulations, I think the findings of the learned Chief Justice fully justified by the evidence. It is true there is conflicting evidence. There generally is under the like circumstances. But while the three men who were on the deck of the Reliance testified that the light was not seen by them until just before the collision, it must be borne in mind that this is purely negative testimony and that it comes from witnesses who may fairly be classed as interested. On the other hand, not less than seven or eight witnesses testified positively that at the time or immediately before the collision took place they saw the light of the Sayward and that it was burning clearly and distinctly. While several of these witnesses belonged to the crew of the Sayward and might also be classed as interested, at least three of them were wholly disinterested and belonged to the vessels Lottie Burns, Ada K. Damon and Hattie Western, which were riding at anchor some distance from each other and at a distance of about a quarter of a mile, a mile and a mile and a half respectively from the Sayward. The overwhelming weight of testimony therefore establishes the fact that on the night in question and at the time of the collision the Sayward had her light burning and that it complied fully with the regulation. That fact being once established, the negligence and carelessness of the Reliance in running into the Sayward follows as of course. The conclusion is then irresistible that the latter vessel was so negligently navigated as to have caused the collision.\nIt was however contended that just before the Reliance ran into the Sayward, the look-out, or some one of the latter vessel, shouted out \"keep her off,\" and that the look-out man of the Reliance repeated the order, which the steersman of the Reliance immediately acted upon by starboarding the helm, whereas if the order or shout had been to luff the two vessels would or might have cleared or at most met side to side. Whether the predicted result would have followed the suggested order to \"luff\" is little more than conjecture, it might perhaps be correctly called a pious hope. As a matter of fact the Reliance does not appear to have answered much, if any, to the starboarding of her helm, and there is no good reason to believe she would have answered more readily to it had it been ported. But leaving all such speculations aside, we find that the vessels were at that moment in immediate peril of collision, only in fact a few yards apart. The exclamation, shout, or order, whatever it may be termed, was one given in presence of an immediate and pressing danger, a natural cry coming from the lips of some one unknown at the moment, when it was evident the vessel he was aboard of was in immediate peril of being run down. To ask this court to hold that such a cry was under the circumstances an order for which the owners of the Sayward should be held responsible as they would be for an improper order given by a person in authority, when navigating his own ship, is to ask something in support of which I venture to say no principle or authority could be cited. As a matter of fact the immediate order in which the helmsman of the Reliance acted when he starboarded his helm came from the look-out man of the Reliance. He says he took it up and repeated it from the cry he heard from the Sayward. But he was surely in as good a position to judge of the proper order to be given as was the unknown man aboard the Sayward, and if the order was a wrong one and contributed to the collision, those navigating the Reliance have themselves to blame.\nOn all the material disputed facts the learned Chief Justice has found in favour of the Sayward, and in my opinion his findings are fully justified by the evidence.\nThe appeal therefore should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Harris, Henry & Cahan.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Borden, Ritchie & Chisholm.\n[1] 7 Ex.

The Queen[4], by which we are bound, and which governs the decision in this case, the appeal must be dismissed with costs. GWYNNE J. (dissenting.)\u2014The terms \"Indian lands\" and \"the title\" of the Indians to lands in the late Province of Upper Canada and in the late Province of Canada have always from the earliest period been well understood without any doubt or fluctuation of opinion whatever, to consist in this that by the pledge of the Sovereign no sale of lands should be, or ever has been, made by the Crown unless nor until the Indian title has been surrendered by a treaty entered into between the Sovereign and the Indian nations claiming title to the lands and upon surrender the Indian title consists in the honour of the Sovereign being pledged to a faithful observance of the conditions upon the faith of which the Sovereign procured each surrender to be made. This foundation of the Indian title to lands in British North America was originally designed perhaps as a reward for faithful services rendered in the early wars upon this continent by the Indian allies of the British Crown as certainly the tract of country known as the Grand River reservation was set apart for the Six Nations; but whether the concession be regarded as a reward for services rendered, or as proceeding ex grati\u00e2 et mero motu of the Sovereign apart from any claim for services rendered all treaties entered into between the Sovereign and the North American Indians have always been regarded by the British Sovereigns and observed by them as inviolable as treaties entered into with foreign civilized nations, and the Indians themselves have always been regarded and treated as wards of the Crown and the management of their affairs was retained by the Imperial Government and was conducted through the Lieutenant Governor of the Province acting under instructions from the Sovereign and through an officer called the Chief Superintendent of Indian Affairs, appointed by the Lieutenant Governor, approved by the Imperial Government, to whom through the Lieutenant Governor the Chief Superintendent reported from time to time. In the case of lands surrendered by the Indians upon condition that they should be sold and the purchase monies invested for their benefit the sale of those lands has invariably been made by the Chief Superintendent of Indian Affairs and not by the Commissioner of Crown Lands, and the purchase moneys accruing from those sales were always received and invested by the Chief Superintendent and accounted for by him to the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury in England.\nThe distinction between the terms \"public lands\" and \"Indian lands\" has always been well understood and recognised in Acts of the Legislature. On the 17th of May, 1838, the royal assent pronounced by proclamation was given to an Act numbered chapter 118, of 7, Wm. 4th, intituled \"An Act to provide for the disposal of the public lands in this province and for other purposes therein mentioned\" which had been reserved by Sir Francis Bond Head, the then Lieutenant Governor of the late Province of Upper Canada for the royal assent. A reference to the several clauses of that Act clearly shews that the term \"public lands\" was applied solely to lands placed under the control of the Commissioner of Crown Lands for sale for the public purposes of the province consisting of Crown Lands, Clergy Reserves and School Lands, in all of which the province had an interest, but nothing in the Act had any relation to lands surrendered by the Indians upon condition that they should be sold and the proceeds invested for their benefit, the sale of which as already observed was maintained under the control of the Chief Superintendent of Indian Affairs, who as also already shewn was under the control of the Imperial Government exercised through the Governor as representative of the Sovereign. The like distinction is maintained in the statutes 2 Vict. c. 14 and 15, passed in 1839, so also in the following statutes of the late Province of Canada, 4 & 5 Vict. ch. 100. intituled \"An Act for the disposal of public lands,\" 12 Vict. ch. 200. intituled \"An Act to raise an income of one hundred thousand pounds out of the public lands of Canada for Common School education,\" by which it was enacted that all moneys that should arise from the sale of any of the public lands of the Province should be set apart for the purpose of creating a capital which should be sufficient to produce a clear sum of one hundred thousand pounds per annum which said capital and the income to be derived therefrom should form a public fund to be called the Common School fund. It is clear that Indian lands came not under this Act, 13 & 14 Vict, c. 42 and 74, the former of which is intituled \"An Act for the better protection of the lands and property of the Indians in Lower Canada\", and the latter is intituled \"An Act for the protection of the Indians of Upper Canada from imposition and the property occupied and enjoyed by them from trespass and injury;\" 14 & 15 Vict. c. 59 and 116, 16 Vict. c. 159 intituled \"An Act to amend the law for the sale and settlement of the public lands.\"\nThe distinction between \"the public lands\" of the provice and \"Indian lands,\" the former of which were under the management of the Commissioner of Crown Lands, and the latter under the management of the Chief Superintendent of Indian Affairs is conspicuously apparent in this Act and also in 22 Vict. ch. 22 of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada, A.I). 1859.\nThen in 1860 were passed two statutes which maintain the distinction in a most unequivocal manner. The first was passed on the 23rd of April, intituled \"An Act respecting the sale and management of the public lands'' and the second intituled \"An Act respecting the management of the Indian lands and property\" having passed beth houses of the legislature were reserved by the Governor General, Sir Edmund Head, for the signification of Her Majesty's pleasure. The royal assent thereto was published by proclamation in the Canada Gazette of the 13th of October, 1860.\nThis Act was the outcome of negotiations which had been carried on for some years between the Imperial Government and the Governor General with the view of devising a measure whereby the Imperial Government should be relieved from the expense of maintaining the department for the management of Indian affairs, as it was thought that the Indian property had then reached such a value as to warrant its having imposed upon it the whole cost of the maintenance of the department having charge of its management. Accordingly a bill was prepared under the direction of Sir Edmund Head, and was submitted to, and passed by, both houses of the legislature and reserved for the signification of Her Magesty's pleasure and the royal assent was given thereto as above said.\nThis Act maintained the office of Chief Superintendent of Indian Affairs as formerly, but instead of the private secretary of the Governor General who had for some years filled that office it declared in its first section that in future the Commissioner of Crown Lands should be \"Chief Superintendent of Indian Affairs.\" By the second section it was enacted that all lands reserved for the Indians, or for any tribe or band of Indians or held in trust for their benefit, should be deemed to be reserved and held for the same purposes as before the passage of the Act By section 3, that all moneys or securities of any kind, applicable to the support and benefit of the Indians or of any tribe or band of Indians, and all moneys accruing or to accrue from the sale of any lands reserved or held in trust as aforesaid should (subject to the provisions of the Act) be applicable to the same purposes, and be dealt with in the same manner as they might have been applied to, or dealt with before the passing of the Act. Then by section 7 it was enacted that\nthe Governor in Council might from time to time declare the provisions of the Act respecting the sale and management of the public lands passed in the present session, or of the twenty-third chapter of the Consolidated Statutes of Canada intituled \"An Act respecting the sale and management of timber and public lands\" or any of such provisions to apply to Indian lands or to the timber on Indian lands, and the same shall thereupon apply and have effect as if they were expressly recited and embodied in this Act.\nNow this Act declares the terms upon which Her Majesty the Queen assented to the transfer of the management of Indian affairs from under the direct supervision of the Imperial Government, and it is thus in plain terms declared upon the authority of an Act of the Legislature, that all lands reserved for the Indians, (and the ordinary mode of making such reservations was by treaty with the Indians) should after the passing of the Act be still held as reserved for the benefit of the Indians, as before the passing of the Act they had been by the pledged word of the Sovereign and that lands surrendered upon condition that they should be sold and the proceeds invested for the benefit of the Indians should after the passing of the Act be still held, as they always had been by the Crown, in trust for the benefit of the Indians. The title of the Indians which had been always rested upon the pledge of the Crown while the Imperial Government maintained control of the Indian Department was upon the transfer of that department to the provincial authorities made to rest upon an Act of the legislature which without the assent of the Crown could not be repealed. This Act clearly shews that Indian Reserves, or lands held by the Crown in trust for the Indians were never deemed to be \"public lands\" of the province, or land \"belonging to the province,\" or lands in which the province had any beneficial interest or any power of interference, save as regards the legislative authority over the property of the purchaser of any of such lands.\nThis was the condition of things as existing between the Crown and the Indians in relation to Indian affairs and the Indian title to lands in Canada when the British North American Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick had conferred upon them by our Most Gracious Sovereign our late beloved Queen the previously unknown privilege of devising and framing their own constitution which after a thorough consideration and approval of its terms by the legislatures of the respective provinces and after a final agreement upon those terms concluded between delegates appointed by the Provincial Governments and Her late Most Gracious Majesty's Imperial Government was without alteration adopted by the Imperial Parliament and reduced into legislative form in the British North America Act.\nIn judicially construing a constitution so framed I feel myself bound, upon any question arising, to endeavour to arrive at a construction conformable to my conviction of what, haying regard to the previous status and condition of the particular subject under consideration was the intention of the founders and framers of our constitution as expressed in the constitutional charter so framed by them, and with the greatest deference due to those from whom it is my misfortune to differ in the present case, I must say that I cannot entertain a doubt that when the framers of our constitution provided, among other things, that the subject of \"Indians and lands reserved for the Indians\" should be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Parliament of the Dominion they meant, and that the legislatures of the provinces, when deliberating upon and taking part in framing the constitutional charter of the Dominion, meant, that the word \"exclusive\" as there used, should have its precise ordinary meaning and should exclude all ideas of any right of interference direct or indirect being possessed by or vested in the legislatures or governments of any of the provinces of the Dominion in relation to the Indians or to their title to lands reserved for their benefit in any part of the Dominion; and that when in section 91 they provided that the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada should be exclusive over \"Indians and lands reserved for the Indians,\" and in section 109 that\nall lands, mines, minerals,\" &c., &c., belonging to the several Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick at the Union should belong to the several Provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in which the same are situate\ntheir intention was thereby to maintain the distinction between \"lands belonging to the several provinces\" and \"Indian lands,\" which in the Acts already referred to had always been maintained between the \"Public lands\" of the province and \"Indian lands,\" and to preserve and maintain the Indian titles as secured, by parliamentary sanction first, in 23 Vict. ch. 151, so as to secure and maintain inviolate in all parts of the Dominion with perfect uniformity the rights of the Indians as had always been conceded in practice by the grace and pledge of the Sovereign and as had been secured by parliamentary sanctions to the Indians in the Province of Canada by 23 Vict. c. 151; thus maintaining the Indians in the enjoyment of the benefit and conditions of all treaties already entered into between them and the Sovereign or which should thereafter be entered into between them through the Governor General as representing the Sovereign.\nThat such was beyond all doubt the understanding of all parties concerned appears from an Act of the Parliament of Canada which has never been called in question passed in its first session, 31 Vict. ch. 42, intituled \"An Act providing for the organization of the Department of the Secretary of State of Canada and for the management of Indian and Ordnance lands.\" In the fifth section of this Act it is enacted that:\nThe Secretary of State shall he the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs and shall as such have the control and management of the lands and property of the Indians in Canada.\nThe sixth and seventh sections are identical with sections 2 and J of 23 Vict. ch. 151, as applied to this Act of 31 Vict. ch. 42.\nSections. 8, 9, 10 & 11 introduce into 31 Vict. ch. 42 the provisions of sections. 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of 23 Vict. ch. 151. In 1869, was passed by the Parliament of Canada 32 & 33 Vict. ch. 6, by the thirteen section of which the Governor General in council is authorised, on the report of the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, to order the issue of letters patent granting life estates to Indians in certain cases in land allotted to them within a reserve.\nOn the 3rd May, 1873, was passed by the Parliament of Canada an Act intituled \"An Act to provide for the establishment of the Department of the Interior.\" By the third section of that Act, 36 Vict. ch. 4, it was enacted that the Minister of the Interior shall be the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, and, by section eight, that the several clauses of 31 Vict. ch. 42 relating to the management of Indian affairs and lands, shall govern the Minister of the Interior in the matters to which they relate, and that wherever the words \"Secretary of State,\" or \"Department of the Secretary of State\" occur in those clauses the words \"Minister of the Interior,\" and \"Department of the Interior\" shall be deemed to be substituted therefor.\nNow in October, 1873, a treaty, called the North-west Angle Treaty, was entered into between the Saulteaux Tribe of the Ojibbeway Indians and all other Indians inhabiting the country therein described, and Her Majesty the late Queen acting through the intervention of three gentlemen (of whom the Lieutenant Governor of the province of Manitoba and the North-west Territories was one) who were specially appointed as commissioners for that purpose by the Governor General in accordance with the practice which had always prevailed in making upon behalf of Her Majesty a treaty with the Indians; and, by that treaty, the Indians surrendered to Her Majesty a vast tract of country comprising about fifty-five thousand (55,000) square miles more or less. The treaty contains the following undertaking upon behalf of Her Majesty:\nAnd Her Majesty the Queen hereby agrees and undertakes to lay aside reserves for farming lands, due respect being had to lands at present cultivated by the said Indians: and also to lay aside and reserve for the benefit of the said Indians, to be administered and dealt with for them by Her Majesty's Government of the Dominion of Canada in such a manner as shall seem best, other reserves of land in the said territory hereby ceded, which said reserves shall be selected and set aside where it shall be deemed most convenient and advantageous for each band or bands of Indians, by the officers of the said Government appointed for that purpose, and such selection shall be made after conference with the Indians: Provided, however, that such reserve whether for farming or other purposes shall in no wise exceed in all one square mile for each family of five, or in that proportion for larger or smaller families; and such selection shall be made if possible during the course of next summer or as soon thereafter as may be found practicable, it being understood, however, that if at the time of any such selection of any reserves as aforesaid there are any settlers within the bounds of the land reserved by any band, Her Majesty reserves the right to deal with such settlers as she shall deem just so as not to diminish the extent of land allotted to the Indians; and provided also that the aforesaid reserves of lands or any interest or right therein or appurtenant thereto may be sold, leased or otherwise disposed of by the said Government for the use and benefit of the said Indians with the consent of the Indians entitled thereto first had and obtained.\nThe lands designated in the treaty as reserves have been marked out and set apart for the use and benefit of the Indians as provided in the treaty.\nBy a despatch from the Chief Commissioner the then Lt. Governor of the Province of Manitoba and the North-west Territories addressed to the Governor General accompanying the treaty, it appears that it was made a special condition upon the faith of the fulfilment of which the treaty was agreed to by the Indians that the Indians should enjoy the benefit of all minerals, if any should be found upon any portion of the tract reserved for their benefit.\nIt was, as appears by the despatch and papers containing a report of the proceedings at the negotiations with the Indians for the treaty, that it was upon the Indians' undoubting faith in the fulfilment of this pledge, promise or condition, whichever it may be called, that about thirty-four millions of acres of land were surrendered unaffected by any trust or condition in favour of the Indians. The Indians have, it is true, in the treaty the pledge of the Crown for the payment of certain annuities and other benefits annually to the Indians, but the pledge for the payment of these annuities and other benefits stands upon precisely the same foundation as the pledge as to the Indians retaining the benefit to accrue from all minerals, if any should be found in the lands reserved for them by the treaty. As to those lands surrendered to the Crown unaffected by any trust or condition in favour of the Indians, it has been held by the Privy Council in the St. Catharines Milling & Lumber Company v. The Queen[5] that the Province of Ontario is bound to indemnify the Crown and the Dominion from all obligations assumed by Her Majesty in the treaty containing the surrender. That these lands so surrendered to the Crown unaffected by any trust or condition in favour of the Indians became vested in the Crown in trust for the public purposes of the Province of Ontario in so far as such lands were within the Province of Ontario is not a matter in dispute in the present action.\nIn view of the never violated pledge of the Crown that no lands should be sold until a surrender of the Indian title should be made by the Indians to the Crown, the Province of Ontario cannot be said to have acquired any usufructuary interest in these lands until the surrender, and a beneficial interest so acquired must more properly be said, I think, to rest upon the treaty of surrender than upon anything in the British North America Act, and for the benefit so obtained by the province by the treaty of surrender the province alone should in justice bear the burthen of the obligations assumed by Her Majesty and the Dominion to obtain the surrender of those lands as was held in the St. Catharines Milling & Lumber Co. v. The Queen (1) but as to the lands reserved for the Indians, the retaining of which, together with all the minerals therein, by Her Majesty forthe use and benefit of the Indians, having been a condition upon the faith of the fulfillment of which the thirty-four million acres of land, unaffected by any trust or benefit in favour of the Indians, were surrendered, those lands, and it is with a portion of them we are now dealing (unless the entering into a treaty with the Indians by Her Majesty through Her representative the Governor General in the serious, grave and earnest manner appearing in the report of the Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba to the Governor General accompanying the treaty, is a delusive mockery), should be regarded, as all lands in like circumstances have always been regarded ever since the proclamation of 1763, namely as lands vested in Her Majesty in trust for the sole use and benefit of the Indians upon the terms and conditions agreed upon as those upon which the trust was accepted by Her Majesty; and, as I have already said it was, in my opinion, for the purpose of maintaining unimpaired a continuance of that condition of things that the subject \"Indians and lands reserved for the Indians\" was placed under the exclusive legislative authority of the Dominion Parliament.\nIn 1880 that parliament, in exercise of the authority thus vested in it, passed the Act 43 Vict. ch. 28, intituled \"An Act to amend and consolidate the laws respecting the Indians,\" and in 1882, the Act 45 Vict. ch. 30, intituled \"An Act to further amend the Indian Act, 1880,\" and in 1884 an Act 47 Vict. ch. 27, intituled \"An Act further to amend the Indian Act of of 1880,\" and on the 2nd of June, 1886, an Act intituled \"An Act to expedite the issue of Letters Patent for Indian Lands,\" all of which Acts are consolidated in ch. 43 of the Revised Statutes of Canada of 1886 intituled \"An Act respecting Indians.\"\nNow by these Acts so consolidated it was among other things enacted, that there should be a Department of the Civil Service of Canada called the Department of Indian Affairs, which should have the management, charge and direction of Indian affairs, presided over by a Chief Superintendent of Indian Affairs who should be the Minister of the Interior or the head of any other department appointed for that purpose by the Governor in Council \u2014 that the expression \"reserves\" in the Act means any tract or tracts of land set apart by treaty or otherwise for the use or benefit of, or granted to, a particular band of Indians, of which the title is in the Crown and which remains a portion of the said reserve and includes all the trees, woods, timber, soil, stone, minerals, metals and other valuables thereon or therein\u2014that the Governor General might appoint a Deputy Governor who should have the power in the absence of or under instructions of the Governor General to sign Letters Patent for Indian Lands, and that the signature of such Deputy Governor should have the same force and virtue as if such Letters Patent were signed by the Governor General; sec. 8, s.s. 4. That all reserves for Indians or for any band of Indians? or held in trust for their benefit should be deemed to be reserved and held as before the passing of the Act 43 Vict. ch. 28, but should be subject to the provisions of the Act; sec. 14.\nThat if any railway, road, or public work should pass through or cause injury to any reserve belonging to, or in possession of any band of Indians or of any act occasioning damage to any reserve should be done under the authority of an Act of Parliament or of the legislature of any province compensation should be made to them therefor in the same manner as is provided with respect to the lands or rights of other persons and that the Superintendent General should, in any case in which an arbitration should be had, name the arbitrator on behalf of the Indians and should act for them in any matter relating to the settlement of such compensation, and that the amount awarded in any case should be paid to the Minister of Finance and Receiver General for the use of the band of Indians for whose benefit the reserve is held and for the benefit of any Indian who has improvements thereon; (sec. 35).\nThat no reserve or portion of a reserve should be sold, alienated or leased until released or surrendered to the Crown for the purposes of the Act (sec. 38), and no release or surrender of a reserve held for the use of the Indians of any band should be valid or binding except on condition;\n1st. That it should be assented to by a majority of the male members of the band at a meeting or council of the band summoned for that purpose according to the rules of the band and held in the presence of the Superintendent General, or of an officer authorised to attend such council by the Governor General in Council or by the Superintendent General.\n2ndly. That such release or surrender should be submitted to the Governor in Council for acceptance or refusal, (sec. 39).\nThat all Indian lands which are reserves or portions of reserves surrendered or to be surrendered to Her Majesty shall be deemed to be held for the same purposes as before the passing of the Act and should be managed, leased and sold as the Governor in Council should direct subject to the conditions of the surrender and the provisions of the Act (sec. 41).\nThat every patent for Indian lands should be prepared in the Department for Indian Affairs and should be signed by the Governor General or the Deputy Governor appointed under the Act for that purpose and should have the great seal of Canada thereto affixed as provided in sec. 45.\nThat the proceeds arising from the sale or lease of any Indian lands or from the timber, hay, stone, minerals or other valuables thereon or on a reserve shall be paid to the Minister of Finance and Receiver General to the credit of the Indian fund, (sec. 71). There are many other sections of the Act which, clearly I think, show the title of the Indians to lands reserved for their use by treaty or otherwise, or surrendered by them to the Crown for the purpose of being sold for their benefit, to be real and substantial and not purely illusory, but the above sections seem to me to be sufficient for the purpose of the present appeal.\nNow in the month of October, 1886, a band of the Indians who had signed the above north-west angle treaty in 1873 called the \"Rat Portage Band of Indians\" who were in possession of a portion of the reserves in the treaty mentioned as their allotment being desirous of surrendering the same to the Crown fur sale for their use and benefit in accordance with the terms of the treaty in that behalf and with the special condition as above mentioned as to any minerals therein, and with the promise made in that behalf upon the faith of the fulfilment of which the treaty was made, by a deed duly executed in accordance with the above provisions of the statute in that behalf surrendered their said portion of said reserves to Her Majesty the then Queen, her heirs and successors\nin trust to sell the same to such person or persons and upon such terms as the Government of the Dominion of Canada may deem most conducive to the welfare of our people, and upon the further condition that all moneys received from the sale thereof shall, after deducting the usual proportion for expenses of management be placed at interest, and that the interest money, accruing from such investment shall be paid annually or semi-annually to us and our descendants forever.\nThis surrender was duly accepted by the Governor General upon the terms thereof in accordance with the above statutory provisions in that behalf.\nNow by letters patent issued under the great seal of the Dominion of Canada in accordance with the provisions of the statute in that behalf above cited and bearing date the 29th day of March, 1889, thirty-five acres of the portion of reserve so surrendered by the \"Rat Portage Band of Indians\" to Her Majesty in trust for sale, together with all minerals, precious or base, which should be found therein, were in consideration of the sum $175.75 paid in hand to the Chief Superintendent of Indian Affairs by one Albert C. McMicken, and the reservation of a royalty of four per cent to be paid upon all minerals produced therefrom granted to the said Albert C. McMicken, his heirs and assigns forever; and by like letters patent bearing date the 30th April, 1889, thirty five other acres, other portion of the said reserve so surrendered by the \"Rat Portage Band of Indians\" to Her Majesty in trust for sale together with all minerals therein were in consideration of $175 paid in hand to the Chief Superintendent of Indian Affairs by one George Heenan, and of a like reservation of a royalty of four per cent to be paid upon all minerals produced therefrom, granted to the said George Heenan, his heirs and assigns forever; and by like letters patent bearing date respectively the 2nd day of September, 1889, and 23rd day of July, 1890, forty other acres, other part of the said portion of reserve so surrendered by the said \"Rat Portage Band of Indians\" to Her Majesty in trust for sale together with all minerals therein were, in consideration of the sum of $200 paid in cash to the Chief Superintendent of Indian Affairs by one Hamilton G. McMicken, and of the like reservation of a royalty of four per cent on all minerals produced therefrom, granted to the said Hamilton G. McMicken his heirs and assigns forever; and these several parcels of land were subsequently sold and conveyed by the said Albert C. McMicken, George Heenan, and Hamilton G. McMicken, respectively, to the appellants in fee simple. The Government of the Province of Ontario on the 9th of January, 1899, assumed to grant by letters patent issued under the great seal of the Province of Ontario the said several parcels together with other lands and the minerals therein to the respondents as tenants in common in fee simple subject however to the condition following:\nThis grant is made and is accepted by the grantees subject to the rights, if any, of the Government of the Dominion of Canada in respect of the lands or the minerals, ore or metals thereon or therein -contained, it being hereby declared that the said grantees, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns shall have no recourse against us or our successors or against the Province of Ontario or the Government thereof should our title to the said lands, mines or minerals be found to be defective, or should these presents be found to be ineffectual to pass such title.\nThe respondents having asserted title under the said letters patent so issued to them, this action was instituted by the appellants in assertion of title under the letters patent so as aforesaid issued by the Dominion Government, which letters patent the courts below have held to be null and void\u2014hence our present appeal.\nNow unless the proclamation of 1763 and the pledge of the Crown therein that no lands in any of the colonies or plantations in America should be sold until they should be ceded by the Indians to, or purchased from them by, the Crown, are to be considered now to be a dead letter having no force or effect whatever; and unless the grave and solemn proceedings which ever since the issue of the proclamation until the present time have been pursued in practice upon the Crown entering into treaties with the Indians for the cession or purchase of their lands are to regarded now as a delusive mockery; and unless the provision in the constitutional charter of the Dominion that the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada shall have exclusive legislative authority over all matters coming within the subject \"Indians and lands reserved for the Indians\" is quite illusory and devoid of all significance; it does appear to me to be free from doubt that all the provisions of the statutes of the Dominion Parliament above cited in relation to the Indians and their property, the management of all their affairs, the maintenance of their revenues for their sole use and benefit, and the sale by the Crown of their reserves or of such parts thereof as should be surrendered to the Crown upon trust to be sold for their benefit are within the exclusive legislative authority of the Dominion Parliament.\nThe Province of Canada at the time of the Union had no property in any \"lands reserved for the Indians.\" Neither the Canadian statute, 9 Vict. ch. 114, to which the royal assent was given in virtue of the Imperial statute, 10 & 11 Vict. ch. 71, nor the Imperial statute 15 & 16 Vict. ch. 39, intituled \"An Act to remove doubts as to lands and casual revenues of the Crown in the Colonies and Foreign Possessions of Her Majesty\" had the effect of vesting in the Province of Canada any property \"in lands reserved for the Indians\" so as to constitute them to be within section 109 of the British North America Act \"lands belonging to Canada at the time of the Union.\"\nThe words in 9 Vict. ch. 114 for transferring the Crown revenues to the province are:\nAll territorial and other revenues now at the disposal of the Crown arising in the province.\nThe words in the Imperial Act, 15 & 16 Vict ch. 39,. are contained in the first section of that Act as follows:\n1. The provisions of the said recited Acts in relation to the hereditary casual revenue of the Crown shall not extend, or be deemed to have extended, to the moneys arising from the sale or other disposition of the lands of the Crown in any of Her Majesty's colonies or foreign possessions, or in anywise invalidate or affect any sale or other disposition already made, or hereafter to be made of such lands, or any appropriations of the moneys arising from any such sales or other dispositions which might have been made if such Acts or either of them had not been passed.\nNow as, by force of the proclamation of 1763, no sale could be made of any lands of the Crown in Canada until a cession or surrender of the Indian title therein should be made by the Indians to the Crown, it seems to follow that until such cession or surrender the Crown could have no territorial casual revenue arising out of such lands which, by force of either of the said acts, could have passed to the province so as to have become property belonging to the province at the union. It is for this reason that I have said that the title of the Province of Ontario to the lands surrendered by the North-west Angle Treaty of 1873 which are not subjected to any right or interest reserved and retained in the Crown for and on behalf of the Indians, seems to me to be due rather to the surrender than to any thing in the British North America Act.\nBut as to the lands in question in the present suit which are lands specially reserved by the treaty and retained by the Crown as lands reserved for the sole use and benefit of the Indians to be dealt with by the pledge of the Crown in accordance with the terms agreed upon, and upon the Indians implicit faith in the fulfilment of which, the thirty-four million acres, or thereabouts, of lands unaffected by the reservation of any charge in favour of the Indians were surrendered, it appears to me to be free from doubt, that in the distribution of legislative jurisdiction between the Dominion Parliament and the Provincial Legislatures there is nothing whatever in the constitutional charter of the Dominion, which is also the charter of its provinces, which qualifies the exclusive legislative authority vested in the Dominion Parliament over \"lands reserved for the Indians\" which the lands under consideration in the present case undoubtedly are.\nIt has been contended that the judgment of the Lords of the Privy Council in the St. Catharines Milling Company v. The Queen[6] is conclusive upon the question now under consideration, but I have shewn, I think, that lands reserved by treaty with the Indians and retained by the Crown as the lands in question here were upon a trust accepted by the Crown for the exclusive benefit of the Indians in accordance with a practice instituted by the Crown from which there never had been any deviation are in a wholly different position from the lands under consideration in the St. Catherines Milling Company's Case (1) which were lands forming part of the thirty-four million acres surrendered by the Northwest Angle Treaty unaffected by any trust or interest therein reserved for the Indians.\nUnder these circumstances I can see no ground whatever for the contention that the judgment in the St. Catharines Milling Company's Case (1) governs the present case and I must say that I can see nothing in the judgment of the Privy Council in that case which would justify, much less which calls for, the withholding of the expression of my firm conviction that the maintaining of the judgment now under consideration in this appeal would be subversive of the scheme of Confederation as designed by the founders and framers of the constitution of the Dominion of Canada and of their clear intention, as expressed in sec. 91, item 24 of the British North America Act, the provision of which would thereby, in my opinion, be rendered wholly illusory and absolutely devoid of all significance.\nThe contention therefore of the appellants should, in my opinion, prevail and the appeal should be allowed with costs. The letters patent under which the appellants claim should be declared to be valid, and the letters patent under which the respondents claim should be declared to be null and void in so far as they purport to affect the said several lands and the minerals therein which are claimed by the appellants.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Laidlaw, Kappelle & Bicknell.\nSolicitor for the respondent, Johnston: S.

An order was claimed against the bank for the payment of the amount to be levied under the executions.\nThe courts below held that as there was good consideration for the mortgage and, as it was given under pressure, that it should not be set aside, although it comprised the whole of the debtor's property and was given at a time that the mortgagor was in insolvent circumstances to the knowledge of the mortgagee and that the mortgage had the effect of depriving other creditors of their remedy. It was also held that the mortgage, which had been made by the directors without proper authority, had been legally ratified by a subsequent resolution of the shareholders of the company.
