In an action instituted for infringement a disclaimer was filed as to nine of the fourteen claims, the plaintiff relying on the one feature of placing at right angles, instead of diagonally as in other grip treads patented, the chains connecting the side chains of the grip treads.\nHeld, Mignault J. dissenting, that the remaining claims shewed that the invention was intended to consist of the entire grip tread and not the right-angled feature only; that all of the elements of this invention were old and well known and it had been anticipated by prior patents and prior user; and that the patent was properly declared void.\nAll the parts of the plaintiffs' grip tread were imported the only work done in Canada being to put them together by a simple operation that could be performed by any person.\nHeld, Mignault J. dissenting, that this was importation of the invention forbidden by section 38 of \"The Patent Act\" and the work done in Canada was not the manufacture required by that section.\nPer Mignault J.\u2014Placing the cross chains at right angles was a combination, previously unknown, of old elements and, as such, was a patentable invention.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court (17 Ex. C.R. 255, 38 D.L.R. 345); affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing an action for damages by infringement of the plaintiffs' patent and declaring the patent void.\nThe material facts are stated in the above head-note. Russell Smart for the appellants.\nTilley K.C. and J. G. Gibson for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant, as the assignee of a patent obtained by one Weed, a resident of New York State, on the 20th December, 1904, in response to a petition praying for the grant thereof, for an alleged\nnew and useful improvement in grip treads for pneumatic tires,\nsought in the Exchequer Court to restrain respondent from infringing its alleged rights under said patent.\nIt was met by two defences amongst others; first, that the said patent if ever valid had been rendered null by reason of failure to comply with the requirement of section 38 of the \"Patent Act\" rendering it obligatory upon a patentee to manufacture the article covered by a patent; and instead of doing so importing said article into Canada; and secondly, that the patent had always been void. Both of these defences have been, as I think rightly, maintained by the learned trial judge, Sir Walter Cassels, and the action dismissed.\nAs I agree entirely with the reasons assigned by the learned judge I only desire now to add thereto a few remarks suggested by the course of the argument here\nAnd what I am about to say I intend to apply to and cover, so far as applicable thereto respectively, each of the said defences.\nCounsel for appellant claimed that the obligation relative to manufacture had been complied with by an assembling of the chains imported and fitting them together with the hook fastenings which required only the application of an ordinary tool and very little labour, evidently an infinitesimal fraction of what is involved in the manufacture of the grip tread for pneumatic tires.\nIt seems to me the determination of the question thus raised must turn upon the nature of the patent and what the alleged inventor claimed to have invented and covered in his application for a patent, and especially by the terms of the specifications therein.\nOriginally there were fourteen specifications in Weed's application of what he\nclaimed and desired to secure by letters patent.\nThe majority of them were disclaimed by the appellant filing a disclaimer on the 2nd November, 1917, over six months after this action had been initiated and the pleadings were at issue.\nOf those remaining, counsel selected, in argument here, the tenth as that upon which he felt he might with most safety rely. It reads as follows:\u2014\n10. A reversible trip tread for elastic tires comprising two paralle lengthwise chains composed of comparatively short links, and paralle cross chains at right angles with and linked to the lengthwise chains.\nI pointed out to him that by these very terms the patented article so described as a \"reversible grip tread for elastic tires,\" etc., seemed to be a thing capable of manufacture in Canada and thus fitted to complete and render imperative the obligation imposed by section 38, on pain of nullification of the patent.\nThe answer made was that it was only an improvement upon what was well known in the market that in fact was now claimed.\nAnd then, in reply as to what the improvement consisted of, counsel pointed out the fitting of the cross chains so that they would run at right angles across the tire instead of diagonally as in accordance with the specification in an application made by someone else for an earlier patent granted by the United States. It does not seem to me, however ingenious that this gets the appellant out of its difficulties on the score of non-manufacture.\nIt is not as an improvement that the invention is claimed in a single line of its specifications. It is a complete whole that they each and all aim at a definition of.\nAnd the very obvious purpose of the application was to claim an invention of the whole.\nThe objects of the invention are set out as follows:\u2014\nThe object of my present invention is to provide a flexible and collapsible grip or tread composed entirely of chains linked together and applied to the sides and periphery of the tire, and held in place solely by inflation of the tire, and which is reversible so that either side may be applied to the periphery of the tire, thus affording double wearing surfaces.\nThese grips or auxiliary treads are adapted to be applied to the traction or driving wheels of automobiles, and one of the important objects is to enable any one, skilled or unskilled, to easily and quickly apply the auxiliary tread when needed by partially deflating the tire and then placing the grip thereon, and finally, reinflating the tire to cause the transverse chains to partially imbed themselves into the periphery of said tire, whereby the auxiliary tread or gripping device is firmly held in operative position against circumferential slipping on the tire.\nAnother object of equal importance is to construct the auxiliary grip or tread in such a manner that it may be collapsed into a minimum space when not in use to be carried in .the vehicle, and owing to the fact that it is constructed of chains with comparatively short links, it will be apparent that it may be compressed into a very small space, and therefore can be placed under the seat or in any other available receptacle in the vehicle.\nSome minor objects in drawing details are given which in no way help appellant in this regard.\nNor does the usual introduction, common to all such applications, of \"certain new and useful improvements\" help.\nThere is in short nothing than can be said to point specifically to any improvement on old grip treads as the purpose of the inventor. And this is not the case of an application for a patent of a combination of old, well-known devices being applied to a new object, and an improvement of that character.\nThe only claim either expressly or impliedly made in way of combination is that made in the 7th specification, which is a combination of the specified grip tread with the pneumatic tire.\nNor can the combination to be patented be found, as has been found in some cases, by a consideration of the scope and purpose of the whole application, to be either expressly or impliedly in a claim for a mere improvement.\nIt is a claim for the whole article as a new invention that is made and hence not of an improvement that is entitled to be protected by a patent.\nI would refer to Terrell on Patents, 4th ed., under the heading of \"The Complete Specification\" and the cases cited therein, and especially the language of Mr. Justice Buckley in The British United Shoe Company v. Thompson[2], quoted therein, pp. 155 and 156, for I venture to think the pith of the relevant law necessary for us to consider is well summed up in the last sentence of that so quoted, as follows:\u2014\nThe whole is summarized in a few words by saying that the patentee must shew what is the new thing that he claims.\nAssuredly the patentee in this case has failed entirely in shewing that the new thing he claims is the alleged simple improvement counsel is reduced by force of circumstances to contend for.\nIf that had been all that had been claimed and specified as his claim, a very nice question might have arisen as to what, if anything, had to be manufactured in Canada. And another nice question as to whether it was not so impalpable as to be impossible of definition or when defined so evidently simple in its character as to render it impossible to claim it as a novelty.\nI repeat it is, with tiresome reiteration, made manifest by the fourteen claims set forth in the original specifications that what the alleged inventor had in mind was a whole article, easily capable of manufacture in Canada, and nothing of that kind having been attempted within the prescribed time, the patent should be held null.\nThe argument so fully and forcibly set forth in appellant's factum founded upon the extensive use of the article and the attendant prosperity arising therefrom, I respectfully submit, appears most fallacious when we use that common knowledge we are permitted to resort to relative to the recent advent of the automobile and its remarkably rapid progress in becoming an article of common use.\nThat, and not this adoption of the right angle crossing of a gripping chain, is the result of the expansion of trade in and manufacture of such devices as the patentee claimed.\nCommon knowledge again tells us that in manifold ways the parallel lines of ridges on a wheel, crossing it at right angles when intended to furnish it with a gripping capacity, was older than automobiles and in common use in many mechanical applications of the use of power.\nIt was not the need of inventive faculty that prevented that exact adaption of a well-known gripping device such as a ridge across a wheel, but the application thereof by means of metal across a rubber wheel in such a way as not to destroy the rubber that was the thing that was wanted.\nThe chain device of the Parsons' patent, which I take the liberty of thinking the patentee here in question appropriated, because that was not patented in Canada. and made the foundation of his patent got here in question, furnished what was really needed.\nThe fact that Maxim's attempt to construct a leather grip for a bicycle a few weeks anterior to the patent in question was tried transversely and, I imagine, more nearly at right angles than the grip in question, shews how naturally the mind turned that way would resort to the parallel right angle traversing the wheel in solving what was in question.\nIt was the choice of material and the least hurtful mould thereof that really was the puzzle, and that was solved by Parsons' ample demonstration anticipating and destroying any foundation for the claim in question.\nHe, however, apparently had the accomplishment of some other objects in view as well as the gripping, as his specifications plainly shew, and hence the diagonal shape he specified instead of the usual transverse ridge for the chains running.\nThere was nothing left for the alleged inventor here in question except to copy two old things. Indeed, everything he used or claimed to use had long been in one form or another anticipated; and of a patentable combination he never had the faintest conception.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014The material facts of this case appear sufficiently in the report of the judgment of the learned judge of the Exchequer Court[3], from which the plaintiff appeals. Although the claims in the Weed patent remaining after full effect is given to the disclaimer filed by the plaintiff, on the 2nd November, 1917\u2014Nos. 4, 7, 9, 10 and 12\u2014as I read them cover much more than the mere disposition of parallel cross chains at right angles with and linked to the lengthwise chains,\nmentioned in claim No. 10, the appellant now would limit the patented invention solely to this arrangement of the cross chains at right angles to the side chains. I assume, that this feature is claimed by the phrase\nextending transversely the shortest distance across the tread of the tire\nin claim No. 4, and by the words\nextending from anchor to anchor directly across the periphery of the tire\nin No. 7. In No. 9, however, there is not even a veiled reference to the right-angled arrangement of the cross chains. They are described merely as\ncross chains parallel with each other and connecting the lengthwise chains.\nThey might be at any angle\u2014right, acute, or obtuse\u2014 provided all were at the same angle to the side chains. In No. 12 the description is\ncross chains disposed at substantially right angles to the lengthwise chain.\nIn a very recent case, Betts v. Reichenberg[4], Mr. Justice Younger held a patent void because the particular idea or device relied on as the novelty was not set forth in two of the seven claims and the specification in some of its descriptions of the patented articles\u2014in that case a wrist watch strap\u2014also omitted it. Here the right angle feature is only mentioned once in the specification and then not in the vital part of it but merely in a paragraph descriptive of a figure said to be shewn as demonstrating or illustrative of \"the practicability of my invention.\" Reading the specification as a whole, the right angle feature would appear to be quite unessential and a mere accident in the illustration and the idea that that was the real invention claimed certainly would not occur to one.\nThe patentee declares that,\nThe object of my present invention is to provide a flexible and collapsible grip or tread composed entirely of chains linked together and applied to the sides and periphery of the tire, and held in place solely by the inflation of the tire, and which is reversible so that either side may be applied to the periphery of the tire, thus affording double wearing surfaces.\n*****\nAnother object of equal importance is to construct the auxiliary grip or tread in such a manner that it may be collapsed into a minimum space when not in use to be carried in the vehicle, and owing to the fact that it is constructed of chains with comparatively short links, it will be apparent that it may be compressed into a very small space, and therefore can be placed under the seat or in any other available receptacle in the vehicle.\n*****\nThe end links at one side of the (lateral) chains are of special construction.\nFlexibility in all directions, reversibility, and compactness were the objects.\nMr. Justice Cassels has pointed out other features of the invention of importance as described in the patent which have been wholly discarded. Claims No. 7 and 9 are as follows:\u2014\n7. In combination with a pneumatic tire, a reversible gripping device comprising endless anchors disposed at opposite sides of the tire and flexible circumferentially, and flexible members extending from anchor to anchor directly across the periphery of the tire and secured to said anchors.\n9. A reversible grip tread for elastic tires comprising two parallel lengthwise chains, and additional cross chains parallel with each other and connecting the lengthwise chains.\nHow is it possible in view of these claims to maintain that the disposition of the cross chains at right angles to the side chains is the entire invention patented, or even an essential feature of it? In my opinion the invention claimed end for which the patent stands is much wider and covers the entire grip-tread. The idea of confining the patent to the feature of right-angled connections between the cross and side chains was purely an afterthought resorted to in an attempt more ingenious than ingenuous to meet the difficulty presented by non-manufacture and importation of the invention as described by the patentee in the specification and in the claims which his disclaimer did not remove from the patent.\nConfessedly, however, this feature of cross chains at right angles to the lateral or anchor chains is the only novelty to which the patentee could lay even the semblance of a fair claim in view of the Parsons' patents (British and American) for a grip-tread consisting of side chains with transverse chains attached thereto. Although Parsons in the specification of his United States patent described the cross chains as passing \"diagonally across the tire,\" the claims of that patent are not confined to that construction. Under them the cross chains might be placed at any angle to the side members. In his British patent the cross chains are described merely as\nfitting loosely over the periphery of the tire and passing from side to side across the tire.\nIn his illustrative figures shewing \"modes of construction and classifications\" the cross chains appear as passing diagonally across the tire. In both patents, however, he distinctly says:\u2014\nI do not limit myself to any particular construction of chains.\nThe defendant's chief witness, Prof. Carpenter, speaking of the Weed patent, says that,\na departure not exceeding 10 or 15 degrees from the right angle would not be a practical variation.\nYet it would be within the Parsons' patent.\nHaving regard to all these facts, I am of the opinion that the plaintiff's patent is impeachable on the grounds of want of novelty and anticipation, as well as for failure to disclose and claim as the invention patented the feature which is now solely relied on. I express no opinion on the question whether the arrangement of cross chains at right angles to the side chains was a patentable invention.\nI also think the defendant's patent has been avoided under clause (b) of section 38 of the \"Patent Act\" by importation.\n(b) If, after the expiration of twelve months from the granting of a patent, or an authorized extension of such period, the patentee or patentees, or any of them, or his or their or any of their legal representatives, for the whole or a part of his or their or any of their interest in the patent, import or cause to be imported into Canada, the invention for which the patent is granted, such patent shall be void as to the interest of the person or persons so importing or causing to be imported. 3. Edw. VII. ch. 46, sec. 4.\nIn United Telephone Company v. Dale[5], Pearson J. is reported, at page 782, to have said:\u2014\nIf there was a patent for a knife of a particular construction, and an injunction was granted restraining a defendant from selling knives made according to the patent, and he was to sell the component parts so that any school boy could put them together and construct the knife, surely that sale would be a breach of the injunction.\nIn Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. v. Mosely[6], at page 280, Vaughan Williams L.J. approves of this statement of the law, adding:\u2014\nIf you are in substance selling the whole of the patented machine, I do not think that you save yourself from infringement because you sell it in parts which are so manufactured as to be adapted to be put together.\nIn E. M. Bowden's Patents Syndicate v. Wilson[7], a sale of all the component parts of a patented brake was held to be a violation of an injunction protecting the patented invention. I find the observation of Pearson J. in the Dale Case (1), cited with approval in Frost on Patents, vol. 1, at page 377, and Fletcher Moulton on Patents, at page 161. The importation of all the component parts of the patented invention ready to be put together by some very simple process would, in my opinion, constitute an infringement of the patent quite as much as would the sale of the same parts. The importation of them by the holder of the patent would entail its avoidance under Clause (b) of section 38 of the \"Patent Act.\" See also Fisher and Smart on Patents, pp. 148 et seq. But without condemning it, I wish especially to guard myself against being committed to an indorsement of the first paragraph on page 152, expressing the personal view of the authors of the work last cited as to the effect of the importation of\nanything on which labour has been done to particularly adapt it to use in the invention.\nThe decision of Burbidge J. in Anderson Tire Co. v. American Dunlop Tire Co.[8], is an authority against their view.\nBut we are dealing not with a case of the importation of one or more of the component parts of the patented article, but with the importation of all the component parts\ntogether in such a form that they can easily be made into the combination.\nI have not overlooked the cases of Sykes v. Howarth[9], and Townsend v. Howarth[10]. The Townsend Case (3), was not a case, such as this is, of supplying all the component parts of the invention\u2014parts specially manufactured according to specifications in sizes and lengths and with appropriate attaching fittings, the whole as manufactured being suitable and suitable only for the making of the patented invention. The Sykes Case (2), is merely authority for the general proposition that selling articles to persons to be used for the purpose of infringing a patent is not an infringement of the patent.\nHere, according to the evidence, the side chains with hooks attached, and the cross chains with hooks attached, all made to order and of particular sizes\u2014\"manufactured to the proper lengths\"\u2014 being all the component parts of the plaintiff's chain tire grip were imported \"adapted to be put together\" by a simple process which \"any school boy,\" if endowed with sufficient strength, could apply. All that was done in Canada was the insertion of the hooks of the cross chains in the links of the side chains and the clamping or nipping of these hooks together by the use of a heavy pair of pincers. That this, if not actually inconsistent with his specifications was, at least, not regarded by the patentee as an essential operation in constructing his invention is shewn by the following extract from the specification:\u2014\nI also contemplate detaching the cross chains from one or both of the parallel chains by making an open link or hook connection, as seen on the left hand side of Fig. 3, in which case the ends of the parallel chains might be permanently connected.\nWhether what was done in Canada amounted to construction or manufacture sufficient to satisfy clause (a) of section 38 of the \"Patent Act,\" even if the patent could be confined to the disposition of the cross chains at right angles with the side chains, is, to say the least, very doubtful. But if the patent claimed is wider, as I think it is, there was nothing approaching construction or manufacture in Canada of the patented article.\nOn the grounds that I have indicated, I would affirm the judgment of the Exchequer Court and dismiss the appeal.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I am in favour of dismissing this appeal for the reasons given by my brother Idington. Mignault J.\u2014The whole question here is whether the Weed Canadian patent, No. 90650, for alleged new and useful improvements in grip treads for pneumatic tires, now belonging to the appellant, is a valid and subsisting patent. If so, the action taken by the appellant against the respondent for infringement should be maintained, if not, it must be dismissed.\nThe appellant having taken proceedings against the respondent for infringement, the latter asked for the dismissal of the action on three grounds:\u2014\n1. The patent is not a valid invention within the meaning of the \"Patent Act.\"\n2. The patent is void because the owners of the patent did not within two years from the date thereof commence, and, after commencement, continuously carry on in Canada the construction or manufacture of the invention patented, as required by section 38 of the. \"Patent Act.\"\n3. The plaintiff, after the expiration of twelve months from the granting of the patent, imported into Canada the alleged invention.\nThe learned trial judge in the Exchequer Court, Sir Walter Cassels, maintained these three grounds of defence, and dismissed the plaintiff's action, and the latter now appeals to this court.\nI am, with deference, of the opinion that the second and third grounds of defence are not made out. Section 38 of the. \"Patent Act,\" which provides for both, is in the following terms:\u2014\nEvery patent shall, unless otherwise ordered by the Commissioner as hereinafter provided, be subject, and expressed to be subject, to the following conditions:\u2014\n(a) Such patent and all the rights and privileges thereby granted shall cease and determine, and the patent shall be null and void at the end of two years from the date thereof, unless the patentee or his legal representatives, within that period or an authorized extension thereof, commence, and after such commencement, continuously carry on in Canada, the construction or manufacture of the invention patented, in such a manner that any person desiring to use it may obtain it, or cause it to be made for him at a reasonable price, at some manufactory or establishment for making or constructing it in Canada;\n(b) If, after the expiration of twelve months from the granting of a patent, or an authorized extension of such period, the patentee or patentees, or any of them, or his or their or any of their legal representatives, for the whole or a part of his or their or any of their interest in the patent, import or cause to be imported into Canada, the invention for which the patent is granted, such patent shall be void as to the interest of the person or persons so importing or causing to be imported.\nAs to non-manufacture in Canada, the requirement is that the patentee or his legal representatives shall within two years from the date of the patent or an authorised extension thereof\ncommence, and after such commencement, continuously carry on in Canada the construction or manufacture of the invention patented, in such a manner that any person desiring to use it may obtain it, or cause it to be made for him at a reasonable price, at some manufactory or establishment for making or constructing it in Canada.\nThe alleged invention consists of a lateral chain around the wheel or tire of an automobile or other similar vehicle, to which are attached several cross chains crossing the tire so as to prevent the wheel from skidding when the automobile is being driven along a slippery road.\nThe evidence shews that both the lateral and cross chains were, during the two years, manufactured in the United States and imported into Canada, where, at a small establishment at Bridgeburg, Ontario, they were fastened together so as to be ready to be fitted on the tires. When orders were received, and they were not very numerous during the first years, specifications were sent to the manufacturers of the chains, and then chains of the required lengths were made, sent to Canada, and were there fastened together in the manner required by the patent of invention.\nI cannot escape the conclusion that this was at least a construction of the patented invention in Canada, for the whole invention consisted of fastening the cross chains to the lateral chains, so that they could be fitted on the tires. Moreover, it was such a construction of the invention patented that, in the words of section 38, \"any person desiring to use it\" could\nobtain it or cause it to be made for him at a reasonable price at some manufactory or establishment for making or constructing it in Canada.\nConsequently, in my opinion, the defence of non-manufacture fails.\nThe same reason disposes of the defence of importation into Canada of the alleged invention. What the patentee imported into Canada was the chains, which could have been used for other purposes, and not the invention. The latter, as I have said, was constructed in Canada.\nThere remains the first ground of defence, whether the alleged invention was, at the date of the patent, a valid subject-matter for a patent of invention. On this ground, after serious consideration, I have come to the conclusion that this defence also fails and that the judgment of the Exchequer Court should be set aside.\nThe case, I must frankly say, is one of considerable difficulty, and I have not felt entirely free from doubt. Such a device as Weed patented comes very close to the border line which separates invention from no invention. I have very briefly described it, and the only novel feature that the appellant claims has been achieved, the placing of the cross chains at right angles to the lateral chains.\nThe question now is whether this arrangement of the cross and lateral chains has sufficient novelty to entitle it to a patent of invention. To answer this question I will briefly give the history of this particular\nart.\nThe evidence made as to the prior art shews that several devices had been manufactured and were subsequently patented with a view to prevent the skidding of rubber tires. The really pertinent alleged anticipations are those of Maxim and Bardwell, 1901, and of Parsons, 1903, these dates being those of the above patents, and the appellant's patent having been granted in 1904.\nThe Maxim and Bardwell device was made of leather or other tough, pliable material, and consisted of side or lengthwise members to which were attached cross members or straps, some of which were arranged to be strapped around the tires so as to hold the whole appliance firmly in place. The cross members were placed at right angles to the side members. Mr. Maxim, one of the inventors, examined as a witness at the trial, stated that the invention did not prove a success, for it was impossible to strap on the appliance tightly enough to keep it in place, and, moreover, the leather would become wet, and then it would stretch, lose its strength and finally break. He says that the straps could not be put on otherwise than at right angles, adding that\nthe general idea seemed to be that we must have something diagonal across the tire, and it was the general opinion that this was necessary, but when it came to leather the proposition was different owing to the flexibility of the leather to have it across the tire at right angles, and by fastening it down very tightly.\nThe difficulty as to other materials was that it was then considered that the use of metal instead of leather would injure the tire, so the Parsons' patent was a distinct advance in the art, for he used metal cross chains attached to a lateral ring made out of wire or of chains (the English patent mentions both wire and chains, the American one merely wire or wire rope or other suitable material). But following the prevailing idea mentioned by Mr. Maxim that the cross members should be placed diagonally and not at right angles to prevent skidding, Pardons' cross chains were so placed and described in his specification, although his claims and especially the claims of the American patent, merely state that the cross chains extend across and around the periphery of the wheel. These claims, however, should be construed to mean the form of construction specified, that is to say, the diagonal arrangement of the cross chains.\nThe evidence shews conclusively to my mind that the then prevailing idea that the cross members should be placed diagonally and not at right angles to prevent skidding was a fallacy. It was thought the diagonal position would arrest an incipient skidding movement, but it was found that once the skidding had commenced, Parsons' device would not stop it, so that practical experience shewed that the desired end was not obtained by the Parsons' grip tread. This device, had, however, a creeping effect which was useful to prevent the wearing of the tire.\nIt was under these circumstances that Weed designed a grip tread made of chains like Parsons', with lateral and cross chains, but the latter were placed at right angles to the lateral chains, and this arrangement was found to produce the desired effect, for the right-angle position of the cross chains altogether prevents incipient skidding. Moreover, although the inventor appears not to have foreseen this result, there was the same creeping effect as with the Parsons' grip tread, and, like the latter, Weed's device was reversible.\nThe evidence shews that, after the fallacy of the diagonal arrangement of the cross chains had been demonstrated by actual experience, the success of the Weed device was conspicuous and lasting, and while at first a very small establishment was sufficient, to-day there is an immense manufactory of Weed's device at Niagara Falls, Ont., representing an investment of half a million dollars for the building and equipment, and of an equivalent amount for material and stock, and the Parsons' grip tread has been driven out of the market by the Weed invention.\nThis success of the appellant's patent, as well as the history of the art which I have very briefly traced, have convinced me that there is here sufficient invention to sustain the patent. I think that Weed, contending, as he did, against a prevailing fallacy, evolved something really new, and based on different principles as to skidding prevention devices. One of the best tests of patentability is the fact that the alleged invention has supplied a long-felt need which previous devices had failed to satisfy. Commercial success,. of course, is not the only test, and may in some cases be an insufficient one, of invention, but it certainly goes very far to prove that an invention has really been made. Referring to the evidences of invention, Fletcher Moulton, in his work on Letters Patent for Invention, page 23, says:\u2014\nOne class of such evidence is of extreme importance. If the development be one of great utility, and one which has satisfied a long-felt want in the trade, the evidence is almost overwhelming that it required inventive ingenuity or it would have been made before, that is presuming that there has been no material change in the conditions of the trade, such, for example, as a new demand caused by a change of fashion.\nIt is suggested that the popularity of the Weed grip treads may have been caused by their lightness as compared to the Parsons' appliance, but even this would be a merit in a matter of this kind.\nAnd should it be said that all the elements here are old and were well known, I would consider that as furnishing no insurmountable objection to the patent, if these old elements are brought or combined together in a new form and have satisfied a long felt need of the trade.\nOf course the question of the novelty of an invention is in each case a question of fact, so that other cases, where other matters and problems were involved, are not always a very secure guide. However, I think that I can rely on the statement of Lord Halsbury in Taylor v. Annand[11], at pages 62 and 63, with regard to the principles governing the class of cases where a very useful improvement has been made meeting the needs of the trade, but involving nothing more than the combination of old and well-known elements.\nThe learned trial judge expressed the opinion that under the evidence the Weed device with the cross chains at right angles would be an infringement of the Parsons' patent, the cross chains of which would still be diagonal if placed at so small an angle from the right angle as fifteen degrees. It must, however, be observed that Parsons, not having obtained a patent in Canada, no question of infringement of his patent here can arise. Moreover, the learned counsel of the appellant stated at the hearing that his clients owned the Parsons' patent in the United States, so they could not be considered as infringers there. I may add that the criterion of novelty and that of infringement are not the same. A device improving a patent can be patented, although it might be an infringement of the original patent. Frost on Patents, 4th ed., vol. 1, p. 349. Of course, the patentee of the improvement would not have the right to use the original invention, but this would not affect his patent for the improvement. \"Patent Act,\" sec. 9. Since writing what precedes, I have had the advantage of reading the opinion of my brother Anglin, and I will merely say that I have not overlooked the question discussed at bar with regard to the claims of the patent sued on. During the pendency of these proceedings in the court below, the appellant filed a disclaimer of certain claims contained in Weed's patent, and, as I understand the respondent's contention, as stated in its factum, it is that the claims retained were restricted to the placing of the cross chains at right angles, and that there is no originality in this form of construction. I do not find that the respondent raised any question whether the remaining claims, as restricted to the right-angle arrangement, were too wide to support a patent for such an arrangement, assuming that there is sufficient originality in this arrangement of the cross chains. And as I feel constrained to decide that the right-angle arrangement of the cross chains is an advance on the prior art, and that by means of this arrangement the patentee has successfully solved the problem of discovering an effective anti-skidding device, I would not deem myself justified in setting aside this very useful patent for the reasons now urged in connection with the disclaimer and the remaining claims.\nFor these reasons, I slate as my opinion that the appellant's patent is a valid patent of invention. The appeal should, therefore, be allowed with costs in this court and in the court below.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants; Fetherstonhaugh & Co.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Gibson & Gibson.\n[1] 17 Ex.

In 1917 the Board of Railway Commissioners made an order allowing the Ontario Government to carry a highway across the railway on a part of said lands, finding as a fact that there were ho highways in the district prior to 1901, and ordered a crossing to be constructed and maintained at the expense of the company. On appeal from this latter part of the order:\u2014\nHeld, Brodeur and Mignault JJ. dissenting, that in view of the finding that there were no highways in the district when the railway company acquired title the condition in section 2 of the Act must be construed as meaning \"the rights of the public existing at the date hereof in common and public highways,\" and as including rights in highways to be laid out under the reservation for roads by the order-in-council of 1866. Therefore, as these potential highways existed before the crossing the company being the junior occupant was properly charged with the expense. APPEAL from an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada directing that a highway crossing over its railway in the Township of Kirkpatrick be constructed and maintained at the expense of the railway company.\nThe head-note states the facts on which the appeal depends. The orders-in-council and statutes invoked are contained in the opinions of the judges.\nTilley K.C. for the appellants.\nBayly K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an appeal from the order of the Board of Railway Commissioners authorising the construction of a highway across the appellants' railway in the Township of Kirkpatrick, Ontario, and directing that the expense of construction and maintenance of the crossing should be borne by appellants.\nThe leave to appeal was granted by the Board upon the following question of law, namely,\nWhether upon the facts found by the Board the title of the railway company is subject to a prior right reserved in the Crown, to construct and maintain a public crossing over the railway company's right-of-way, as applied for by the Department of Public Works for the Province of Ontario herein.\nThe issue between the parties to the appeal is one confined to the expense of construction and maintenance of the crossing which the Board had in their previous order decided should be borne by the railway company.\nThe facts found by the Board, subject to which the question is to be answered are: (1) That the company's railway through the township in question was constructed in the year 1883, and the right-of-way in which it was constructed was conveyed to the railway company under and by virtue of an order-in-council of the Province of Ontario made in 1901, and issued under the authority of the statute of the Province, 59 Vict., ch. 11; (2) that no highway was actually laid out across the said railway before title to its right-of-way was acquired and that under the terms of the said order-in-council such title was expressly made subject to the conditions and limitations contained in section 2 of the said provincial Act, which reads as follows:\u2014\nSuch transfer shall be deemed to be subject to any agreement, lease or conveyance affecting the same made by the Government of Ontario before the passing of this Act, as well as to the limitations and conditions, if any, in the order-in-council making the transfer, and the order-in-council shall not be deemed to have conveyed or to convey the gold or silver mines in the lands transferred, or to affect or prejudice the rights of the public with respect to common and public highways existing at the date thereof, within the limits of the land hereby intended to be conveyed.\n(3) That under the terms of an order-in-council made by the Government of Canada, before Confederation, in 1866 relating to the surveying and patenting of lands on the northerly shores of Lakes Huron and Superior, which include those now in question and declaring, amongst other things,\nthat many years will elapse ere the townships enjoy the benefits of municipal corporations and it is necessary to make provisions for the establishment of roads in the meantime,\nit was provided\nthat an allowance of 5% of the acreage of lands be reserved for roads *' * * and that a clause be inserted in letters-patent for the land accordingly, also reserving the right of the Crown to lay out roads where necessary.\nI confess that if I had to answer the question submitted to us without regard to the findings on the questions of fact of the Railway Board, I should hesitate a good deal before answering in the affirmative. The language of the section of the statute quoted above, under which the railway company acquired the title to their right-of-way; is open to two constructions neither of which would be unreasonable.\nI do not, however, under the facts as found, have any difficulty in answering the question submitted to us in the affirmative.\nThe fact that the order-in-council of 1866 reserved out of the lands crossed in the township named by the company's railroad\nan allowance of 5% for roads,\nand that at the date when the statute under which the company acquired its title to the roadbed was passed there were no public or common highways actually laid out enables me to place a construction upon the statute which, I think, under the facts proved, is a reasonable and proper one.\nIf there were no public or common highways laid out at the date the statute was passed, it would be without meaning or effect unless it was held to apply to potential highways which might be opened from time to time under the reservation of the five per cent. area provided for in the order-in-council of 1866. If there are two meanings which may be given to the language of a public statute one of which would render the statute meaningless and ineffective for the purposes it was meant to cover and the other which would give effect to the statute, I take it the latter must be adopted.\nI construe, therefore, under the proved facts, the language of the second section of the statute, 59 Vict., ch. 11, authorising the transfer from the Government of Ontario to that of the Dominion of any lands theretofore taken by the railway company for its roadbed, etc., to mean that such transfer\nshall not affect or prejudice the rights of the public with respect to the only common and public highways which were in existence at that time, namely, those potentially existing in the 5% acreage reserved in all Government lands by the order-in-council of 1866. If the language of the statute had been slightly transposed, as I submit in order to give it any meaning or effect at all it must be, it would read,\nshall not be deemed to affect or prejudice the rights of the public existing at the date hereof with respect to common or public highways within the limits of the lands, etc.\nIn the last analysis the question turns upon the meaning of the words, \"existing at the date hereof,\" which, in the light of the facts that there were no actual highways then existing, I think must refer to potential highways which, up to the reservation of 5%, could be any day called into existence.\nI answer the question in the affirmative and would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014I am of the opinion that the language of the statute in question, though of dubious import, is capable of the interpretation and construction put upon it by the majority of the Board appealed from, and therefore do not see my way to allow the appeal.\nAnglin J.\u2014The Board of Railway Commissioners has allowed the appellants, the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., to submit to the court under section 56 (3) of the \"Railway Act\" a question of law stated in these terms:\u2014\nWhether upon the facts found by the Board, the title of the railway company is subject to a prior right reserved in the Crown, to construct and maintain a public crossing over the railway company's right-of-way, as applied for by the Department of Public Works for the Province of Ontario, herein.\nThe order of the Board recites its finding, That no highway was laid out across the said railway before its right-of-way was acquired under the order-in-council dated October 31st, 1901.\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway Co. acquired its title under a patent from the Dominion Government which made it subject to\nthe limitations and conditions and the reservations set forth in the order-in-council of the Lieutenant-Governor of our said Province of Ontario, dated the 31st day of October, 1901.\nThis order-in-council transferred the tract of land in question from the Province to the Dominion pursuant to the direction of the Ontario statute, 59 Vict., ch. 11 (1896),\nsubject to the limitations and conditions specified in section 2 of the said Act.\nSection 2 of the statute reads as follows :\u2014\nSuch transfer shall be deemed to be subject to any agreement, lease or conveyance affecting the same made by the Government of Ontario before the passing of this Act, as well as to the limitations and conditions, if any, in the order-in-council making the transfer, and the order-in-council shall not be deemed to have conveyed or to convey the gold or silver mines in the lands transferred, or to affect or prejudice the rights of the public with respect to common and public highways existing at the date hereof within the limits of the lands hereby intended to be conveyed.\nAt bar there was not a little discussion upon the proper construction of this section, the appellant maintaining that the well-known grammatical rule \"adproximum antecedens fiat relatio\" requires that the phrase \"existing at the date thereof\" should be read as qualifying \"common and public highways,\" and the respondent, while conceding the force of this rule of grammar, contending that it is not so rigid or inflexible as a rule of construction that it should not, under the circumstances of this case, be held to yield to another principle of statutory construction, that a statute will not be held to operate so as to take away existing rights unless its terms expressly, or by necessary implication, so provide, especially where such a construction would involve an unexplained and improbable change in the previous policy of the law and would entail consequences seriously inconvenient to the public.\nBy an order-in-council passed in 1866, under the authority of Con. Stat. Can., ch. 22, sec. 7, which had the force of a statute, it was provided in the case of lands on the northern shores of Lakes Huron and Superior that since road allowances had not been laid out, municipal corporations would not be established for many years and it was necessary to make provision for the establishment of roads in the meantime,\nan allotment of 5% of the acreage of lands be reserved for roads, as is done in Lower Canada, and that a clause be inserted in letters patent for the land accordingly, also reserving the right of the Crown to lay out roads where necessary.\nThis order-in-council has never been repealed. As existing law it was continued in force by section 129 of the \"British North America Act.\" There is nothing to indicate that there was any intention on the part of the Legislature of Ontario in 1896 to depart from the policy which had been thus established. The lands in question admittedly lie within the territory to which it applied, and the 5% reservation has not been exhausted.\nIn my opinion the effect of this order-in-council was to render the lands covered by it subject to a reservation of 5% for the purpose of public highways to be located within them either by the Crown, or, when they should come into existence, by municipal authorities clothed with the right to do so. Such highways existed in posse from the date of the order-in-council making the reservation, and when duly located may, quoad the rights of subsequent grantees of the lands which they traverse, be deemed to have existed de jure from that date just as if they had been then shewn as road allowances on official surveys of those lands made under the system which prevailed in the older parts of Ontario.\nIn view of the finding of the Board, stated in its order-in-council, that no highway had been laid out across the right-of-way before its transfer to the appellant company in 1901, \"the common and public highways\" mentioned in section 2 of the Act of 1896 almost certainly mean such highways in posse as I have indicated. If not, the inference would seem to be irresistible that the phrase \"existing at the date hereof\" must be referable to \"the rights of the public.\"\nAn omission to follow the direction for the insertion of a clause of reservation in any patent (or transfer) issued after 1866 would not relieve the land thereby granted from the reservation, whatever other rights the patentee might have as against the Crown, should a portion of his land be afterwards required for highway purposes.\nIt is almost inconceivable in face of such a declared policy as is evidenced by the order-in-council of 1866, that the Legislature of Ontario should have intended in 1896 to transfer to the Dominion, in order that it should become vested as a right-of-way in the Canadian Pacific Railway Co., a strip of land stretching across this entire territory wholly free from the reservation provided for by the order-in-council of 1866, with the result that rights of highway across it would have to be acquired from that company by the province, or by the municipal corporations which it should create, as they should be needed in order to open up roads for the public convenience. I agree with Mr. Bayly that any construction of which its language reasonably admits should be placed on section 2 of the statute of 1896 that will prevent such a consequence\u2014that will harmonise it with, and will obviate the necessity of implying a repeal ad hoc of, the order-in-council of 1866. See In re Norman's Trusts[1], Eastern Counties and London and Blackwell Railway Co. v. Marriage[2] at p. 64, per Pollock C.B., at p. 44, per Channel B. Thellusson v. Woodford[3], at pp. 392-3, per Macdonald L.C.B., and cases collected in Maxwell on Statutes (5th ed., pp. 3 and 30). That result will, in my opinion, be attained by treating the phrase \"existing at the date hereof\" as referable to \"rights of the public\" rather than to \"common and public highways.\"\nThe facts that the grant is by the Crown and is gratuitous, and that owing to the non-existence of municipal organisation the right to open highways was reserved by the order-in-council of 1866 to the Crown itself, which was also the custodian of the rights of the public, afford additional reasons for a construction favourable to the respondent if the terms of the statute of 1896 admit of it, as I think they do.\nI am, for these reasons, of the opinion that the question submitted should be answered in the affirmative and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J. (dissenting)\u2014This is an appeal from the Railway Board on a question of law, under the provisions of section 56 of the \"Railway Act.\"\nThe question which the Board has given leave to submit reads as follows:\u2014\nWhether upon the facts found by the Board the title of the railway company is subject to a prior right reserved in the Crown to construct and maintain a public crossing over the railway company's right-of-way, as applied for by the Department of Public Works for the Province of Ontario herein.\nIn order to fully understand the bearing of that question, it is necessary to state briefly what are the facts and the circumstances which have given rise to the present appeal.\nIn 1883, the Canadian Pacific Railway was built in the north-western part of Ontario. When the Township of Kirkpatrick in which the crossing in issue in this case is situated was surveyed in 1884 no highways existed in that Township.\nThe lands on which the company built its line belonged to the Province of Ontario.\nIn 1896, the Legislature of Ontario passed an Act to authorise the transfer of the lands occupied by the Canadian Pacific Railway. By section 2 of that statute it was provided that the transfer should be made in such a way as not to\naffect or prejudice the rights of the public with respect to common and public highways existing at the date hereof within the limits of the lands hereby intended to be conveyed.\nThe transfer was made with the stipulation required by that statute concerning the highways.\nHaving found it necessary to open a highway in the Township of Kirkpatrick, the Department of Public Works of Ontario applied to the Railway Board for an order directing the Canadian Pacific Railway Co. to construct and maintain a public crossing over their right-of-way in connection with that highway.\nThe company agreed that the highway was necessary and should be opened but objected to being bound to construct and maintain the crossing.\nThe Board came to the conclusion that the company should build and maintain the highway crossing on the ground that the proviso contained in the law of 1896 referred to the reservation for highways authorised by an order-in-council passed in 1866.\nThe question of law above quoted has been submitted to this court by way of appeal from the decision of the Board.\nThe first question which presents itself, according to my mind, is whether the statute of 1896 had reference simply to existing highways or to the reservation for highways mentioned in the order-in-council of 1866.\nIf we construe it according to the ordinary grammatical rule, \"ad proximum antecedens fiat relatio,\" I should say that the words\nrights of the public with respect to common and public highways existing at the date hereof\nmean, not rights then existing with respect to highways but rights of the public with respect to highways then existing. The participle \"existing\" qualifies not the substantive \"rights\" but the substantive \"highways\" because it is nearer the latter than the former.\nIt is true that there were no highways in the Township of Kirkpatrick; but nobody would suggest that from the District of Nipissing to the western boundary line of Ontario there were not hundreds of highways existing when the law of 1896 was passed.\nI may, in that respect, refer to the revised statutes of Ontario of 1887, ch. 46, sec. 1 and secs. 45 and 48, and ch. 7, sec. 15, sub-secs. 79 and 80, which shew that the territory mentioned in that law of 1896 was organised for municipal and judicial purposes and formed part of two electoral districts.\nThe Dominion legislation then in existence referred also to the settlements of that region: R.S.C. 1886, ch. 6, sub-sec. 73 of sec. 2.\nThe legislation had in view the protection of the rights that the public had in the highways then actually existing in that territory.\nIf the legislature wanted to refer to the highway reservation provided in the order-in-council of 1866, it would certainly have expressed itself differently. It would have been so easy to mention specifically that order-in-council.\nWhat is the meaning of that order-in-council? It is a recommendation or order to the executive authority having to deal with the Crown lands that\nan allowance of 5% of the acreage of the lands be reserved for roads, as is done in Lower Canada, and that a clause be inserted in letters-patent for the lands accordingly.\nPerhaps, as there is a specific reference to the Lower Canada legislation, it might be of interest to see what that legislation contemplated.\nIt is embodied in an order passed under Lord Dorchester on the 30th of October, 1794. By his instructions, Lord Dorchester had the power, in laying out townships, to make reservations for public use (Constitutional Documents, Doughty and McArthur, 1791-1818, p. 21); and it is in execution of these powers that the order of the 30th October, 1794, was passed.\nIt provided that each lot in a township would contain 210 acres instead of 200, in order to provide for an allowance of 5% for highways. That legislation was the one in force in Lower Canada in 1866, when the order-in-council concerning Upper Canada was passed.\nThose two orders-in-council are intended to oblige the settlers to give without indemnity 5% of their acreage for the use of highways. They have no reference to the rights-of-way of a railway company.\nI fail to see then that the order-in-council of 1866 is referred to in the statute of 1896. I have come to the conclusion that the question submitted to us should be answered in the negative.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J. (dissenting)\u2014The Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada has granted to the appellant leave to appeal to this court on a stated question of law,. from its order No. 26,393, authorising the appellant to construct and maintain at its own expense a highway crossing over the railway on the line between lots 8 and 9, concession 5, in the Township of Kirkpatrick, District of Nipissing, and Province of Ontario. In this order the Chief Commissioner, Sir Henry L. Drayton K.C. and the Assistant Commissioner, Mr. D'Arcy Scott, concurred, while Mr. Commissioner S. J. McLean dissented. The order granting leave to appeal states the facts found by the Board and the question to be answered, and obviously, in answering this question, no facts other than those found by the Board can be considered.\nThese facts are:\u2014\n1. The company's railway through the township in question was constructed in the year 1883, and the right-of-way on which the said railway was constructed conveyed to the railway company, by an order-in-council made by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council of Ontario, dated October 31st, 1901, and issued under the authority of a statute of the province, 59 Vict., ch. 11.\n2. No highway was laid out across the said railway before title to its right-of-way was acquired under the said order-in-council.\n3. The company's title was, under the terms of the said order-in-council dated October 31st, 1901, made expressly subject to the conditions and limitations contained in section 2 of the said provincial Act, which said section provides * * * (see text further on).\n4. Under the terms of the order-in-council made on the recommendation of the Commissioner of Crown Lands, dated August 6th, 1866, it was provided that an allowance of 5% of the acreage of lands be reserved for roads, as is done in Lower Canada, and that a clause be inserted in letters-patent for the lands accordingly, also reserving the right of the Crown to lay out roads where necessary.\nThe question to be decided is as follows:\u2014 Whether upon the facts found by the Board, the title of the railway company is subject to a prior right reserved in the Crown, to construct and maintain a public crossing over the railway company's right-of-way, as applied for by the Department of Public Works for the Province of Ontario herein.\nThe question before the Board was who should bear the cost of the crossing. According to the established practice, this liability for cost is determined by reason of the \"seniority\" either of the railway or of the highway. Where the railway is senior, that is to say, where it was established before the highway, the expense of the crossing is borne by the municipality or other public authority opening the highway. Conversely, if the railway comes after the highway, it must pay for the crossing. In the present case the majority of the Board, Mr. McLean dissenting, decided the question of seniority in favour of the highway.\nAs the statement of facts shews, the question submitted involves the construction of section 2 of the Ontario statute, 59 Vict., ch. 11, and in connection with this section it is proper to consider the provisions of the order-in-council of the 6th August, 1866, passed by the Government of Canada before Confederation.\nThe statute in question, 59 Vict., ch. 11, sanctioned the 7th April, 1896, is entitled\nAn Act to authorise the transfer of certain provincial lands occupied by the Canadian Pacific Railway.\nThe first section authorises the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council in his discretion to transfer to the Dominion of Canada any lands theretofore taken and occupied by the Canadian Pacific Railway for the road-bed, stations, station grounds, and other purposes of the railway, and included in its plans, the same being so transferred to enable the Government of Canada to fulfil its obligations to the said company in that behalf with respect to the railway. Section 2; the construction of which is in question, reads as follows:\u2014\nSuch transfer shall be deemed to be subject to any agreement, lease or conveyance affecting the same made by the Government of Ontario before the passing of this Act, as well as to the limitations and conditions, if any, in the order-in-council making the transfer, and the order-in-council shall not be deemed to have conveyed or to convey the gold or silver mines in the lands transferred or to affect or prejudice the rights of the public with respect to common and public highways existing at the date hereof, within the limits of the lands hereby intended to be conveyed.\nThe italics are mine.\nThe final section of the statute declares that such transfer shall be as binding on the Province of Ontario as if the same were specified and set forth in the Act of the legislature.\nThe lands mentioned in this statute were transferred to the Government of the Dominion of Canada by an order-in-council adopted by the Government of Ontario on the 31st October, 1901,\nsubject to the conditions and limitations specified in section 2 of the said Act.\nSubsequently, the Dominion of Canada granted a patent of the lands to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, subject to the same conditions and limitations.\nThe order-in-council of August 6th, 1866, referred to in the statement of facts of the Railway Board, was adopted by the Government of Canada, comprising then Upper and Lower Canada, and is in the following terms:\u2014\nOn a report, dated 2nd instant, from the Honourable the Commissioner of Crown Lands, stating that, in surveying the lands on the northerly shore of Lakes Huron and Superior, the United States system of meridianal lines has been adopted, as it possesses the decided advantage of uniformity, regularity and economy.\nThat by this system the townships are laid out six miles square, a more convenient size for municipal purposes than that of the older townships, which are generally ten miles square. That the township boundaries are drawn on the true meridian, and at right angles thereto, each township being subdivided, by lines drawn parallel at its outlines, into thirty-six sections of one mile square containing 640 acres each. These sections are subdivided into quarters by posts planted on the outlines.\nThat in these surveys no road allowances are laid out on the surveyed lines as formerly, the rugged and broken nature of the ground making them unfit for sites of roads. That the intention being to follow the American system with regard to the roads as well as the subdivisions of the lands, the roads there are laid out by the municipal authorities in the most suitable sites, and the proprietors of the lands over which they pass receive such compensation for the lands taken as the authorities consider just and reasonable. That, owing to the inferior quality of the lands generally on the northerly shore of Lakes Huron and Superior and the large blocks which have been taken up as mineral locations, many years will elapse ere the townships enjoy the benefits of municipal corporations, and it is necessary to make provisions for the establishment of roads in the meantime, he, the Commissioner, therefore recommends that an allowance of 5% of the acreage of lands be reserved for roads, as is done in Lower Canada, and that a clause be inserted in letters patent for the lands accordingly, also reserving the right of the Crown to lay out roads where necessary.\nThe committee submit the recommendation of the Commissioner of Crown Lands for Your Excellency's approval.\nThe recommendation of this order-in-council, adopted by the Government, was that an allowance of 5% of the acreage of lands be reserved for roads, and that a clause be inserted in letters patent for the lands accordingly, also reserving the right of the Crown to lay out roads where necessary.\nMr. Tilley, for the appellant, argued that this order-in-council merely adopted a policy which should govern grants of lands on the northerly shores of Lakes Huron and Superior, which policy was to be given effect by the insertion in letters patent of any of these lands of a reservation of 5% of the acreage of the land for roads, and also of the right of the Crown to lay out roads where necessary.\nUpon due consideration, I do not think this construction an unreasonable one, for if a grant of lands were made by the Crown without this reservation I fail to see how the order-in-council could be relied on to restrict an absolute and unqualified grant.\nNo letters-patent were issued for the lands in question, which were transferred by the Government of Ontario to the Government of Canada by the order-in-council of the 31st October, 1901, without any other instrument of title, and this order-in-council does not contain a reservation of 5% for roads, or a reservation of the right of the Crown to lay out roads where necessary. The only reservation made\u2014excluding one concerning Indian reserves and concerning previous grants made without a reservation of the right-of-way, stations, station grounds, and other purposes of the Canadian Pacific Railway, which is not pertinent to the present inquiry\u2014is to subject the transfer to the conditions and limitations of sec. 2 of 59 Vict., ch. 11. The construction of this section, therefore, determines the answer that should be given to the question submitted. To repeat the language of the statute, the order-in-council making the transfer shall not be deemed\nto affect or prejudice the rights of the public with respect to common and public highways existing at the date hereof, within the limits of the lands hereby intended to be conveyed.\nThe expression, \"rights of the public\" (there is no reservation of the rights of the Crown as distinguished from those of the public) is extremely vague. Giving this expression, however, full effect, the \"rights of the public\" seem to be those with respect to common and public highways existing at the date of the order-in-council.\nIt is suggested that what was intended was to reserve the existing rights of the public with respect to common and public highways, and not merely their rights to existing highways. This seems to be a forced construction, for if it was intended to reserve existing rights and not rights to existing highways, if really the public can be said to have existing rights to non-existing highways, the legislature could have used apt language to make this intention clear, and in the absence of anything plainly indicating such an intention, I would not feel warranted in giving to the language of the statute any other construction than the natural and grammatical one. It therefore appears tome that the rights of the public are reserved merely as to highways which existed on the 31st October 1901. The statement of facts of the Board is that no highway was laid out across the railway before title to its right-of-way was acquired under the order-in-council.\nIt is also suggested that no highways existed across the lands transferred by virtue of the statute, and that therefore the language of section 2 would be meaningless if it be restricted to the then existing highways. This fact, however, is not among the facts found by the Board as applied to the large tract of land transferred under the statute, which is described as being\nthe lands lying between the terminus of the Canada Central Railway near Nipissing, known as Calander station, and the western boundary of the Province of Ontario, near Rat Portage (Kenora), and between the junction at Sudbury on the main line of the Canadian Pacific Railway for the Algoma Branch and the River Saint Mary.\nI cannot therefore assume that there were no existing highways in this large tract of land covering several hundred miles\u2014the contrary assumption would be much more reasonable\u2014and therefore the construction which I feel constrained to place on the language of section 2 does not, in my opinion, render this language meaningless.\nI would further think that if existing rights of the public to highways are to be considered as being protected by the statute, the order-in-council of the 6th August, 1866, standing by itself, and in the absence of a reservation of 5% of the acreage for roads in the order-in-council of the 31st October, 1901, or of the right of the Crown to lay out roads where necessary, would not vest any such rights in the public with respect to highways then not laid out or planned. The language of the order-in-council of 1866 would indicate that at least some roads had been then laid out by the municipal authorities, but the Board has found as a fact\nthat no highway was laid out across the said railway before its right-of-way was acquired.\nI therefore think that the question submitted should be answered in the negative. I would consequently allow the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: E. W. Beatty.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E. Bayly.\n[1] 3 DeG.

Christie (Plaintiff) Respondent\n1918: October 16, 17; 1919: February 4.\nPresent:\u2014Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA.\nCompany \u2014 Contract \u2014 Rescission \u2014 Shareholder \u2014 Subscription \u2014Condition precedent or subsequent\u2014Collateral agreement\u2014Surrender of shares\u2014Ultra vires of company. C.'s action is for the rescission of an agreement to take shares of the capital stock of the appellant company and for the return of the purchase price on the ground of non-fulfilment of a term of his subscription. The sale of the shares was authorized by the directors, but no formal allotment was made to C.; no notice of allotment was given to him, but notices of meetings were sent. His name was not entered in the register of shareholders but appeared in a ledger account. Four months after full payment of shares, certificates were issued and sent to C. during his absence, which were retained by him for two years. C. never attended any meeting of the company, but filled and sent proxies to the president and promoter of the company who had obtained his subscription.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that, under these circumstances, C. must be regarded as having become a de facto shareholder.\nHeld also, that, even if the term alleged by C. had been precedent to his subscription, he would have waived it by becoming, and exercising rights of, a shareholder; but, upon the evidence, it was a condition subsequent or a collateral agreement and its fulfilment was ultra vires of the appellant company as involving an unlawful reduction of its capital.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, 12 Alta. L.R. 445, 38 D.L.R. 488, reversed, Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Simmons J.[2], and maintaining the plaintiff's action. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nR. McKay K.C. for the appellant.\nA. H. Clarke K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is what is generally known as and called a very hard case and I regret greatly feeling myself compelled to reverse the judgment of the appellate court and to refuse to the respondent Christie the relief he has sought in the action.\nI have given the case much consideration. The reasons for judgment of my brother Anglin and the authorities cited by him seem to me conclusive, and as I cannot usefully add anything to what he has said I will concur with him and allow the appeal with costs and restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The respondent declined to sign the ordinary application for shares in appellant company. He never was in due form allotted such shares. Nor was he ever placed upon the register as a shareholder which, by so many provisions in the Companies Ordinance, ch. 20 of 1901, is made the test of what constitutes membership in any company incorporated thereunder as appellant was; for example, by secs. 25, 27, 34, 37, 40 and 42.\nIt is incorrectly stated, as I read the exhibits referred to, in support of the statement, that respondent's name appears on the register.\nThe ledger account, kept apparently with numbers, does not appear to me to constitute part of the register. It contains what one might expect to find in relation to a conditional subscription of the character respondent's contention might require. It was not exactly an ideal ledger for that purpose, but where we meet so many irregularities as prominently appear on the part of the appellant, a trifling matter of that kind is not very surprising.\nLet us assume for a moment that upon such a register and record of the transactions here in question, there had arisen a contest as to the respondent's right to vote, could his doing so have been properly entertained for a moment?\nAnd let us go further and assume that upon its having been challenged, respondent had applied, under sec. 40 of the ordinance, to the court or judge designated therein to have his name entered on the register, with nothing more in support thereof than all the material placed before us herein, and such application stoutly opposed, could such court or judge properly order rectification and, against the will of the shareholders, properly on the register, direct respondent's name to be entered thereon? I think not.\nMuch has been made of the issue by the president and secretary of certificates of shares to respondent, \"and of his signing, when asked, proxies to Pollock, the president, to vote.\nNothing is shewn of what (if any) use was made of such proxies beyond requesting and reporting them. I wholly disapprove of respondent's conduct in that regard and hope it can be attributed to nothing more than carelessness.\nBut testing the weight of such a series of acts, by the test I have suggested, as to the strength thereof, in supporting the supposed application on his part to be put upon the register, could he gain any support therefrom on such an application by the mere existence of such proxies and such report as made thereof? I cannot think so unless much more were shewn to have been done.\nIt is, I repeat, the question of membership which I am keeping in view.\nMoreover, the conditional nature of his subscription clearly pointed to its being, when accepted, in the informal way it was, a contract that could neither constitute him a member, nor be entered into in such a sense as to have that effect unless and until the condition had been fulfilled.\nIt was quite competent for the parties to have so contracted as respondent swears he thought the contract was, for him to pay ten thousand dollars to be used until the steel-making branch, among the objects for which the appellant was incorporated, had become practicable, and then be applied in payment of shares.\nIn this view it is unnecessary for me to follow the many well presented arguments on either side.\nI may add, however, that I by no means assume that respondent could be so treated in the case of a winding-up of the company and by reason of insolvency the creditors' claims had to be met, and respondent had been placed on the list of contributories.\nNor if the case had been one of misrepresentation of which respondent had complained and he had acted in the same way, after the full disclosure to him thereof, do I think he could claim relief.\nIt is the contractual nature of that which was done, with presumably an honest purpose on either side which, so long as membership not created and the provisions thereof were competent to be entered into that induces me to hold that the purpose thereof ought not to be lightly set aside or defeated.\nThe lapse of time might, under other conditions than those springing from a war which forbade building unless demanded by dire necessity, have led to other inferences tending to defeat respondent.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiff sues for the rescission of an agreement to take 100 shares of the capital stock of the defendant company, and for a return of the purchase price thereof, $10,000, paid by him in instalments, and, in the alternative, for damages. He bases his action on the non-fulfilment of a term of his subscription\u2014that the company would proceed to erect a steel plant at the city of Medicine Hat. The learned trial judge dismissed the action on the ground that by becoming, and exercising rights of, a shareholder, the plaintiff had waived this condition of his subscription[3]. This judgment was reversed in the Appellate Division[4], that court holding that the non-fulfilment of what was in its opinion a condition subsequent, which had not been waived, entitled him to the relief of rescission and a return of his money. The facts so far as not hereinafter stated may be found in the reports cited.\nIf the terms relied on by the plaintiff should be regarded as a condition precedent, I would be disposed to concur in the dismissal of the action upon the ground taken by the learned trial judge. But, while the language of the plaintiff's letter of subscription and of the defendants' letter of acceptance might be open to that construction, the conduct of the parties makes it perfectly clear that this was never intended to be its character, or, if it was, that by mutual consent it was converted into a condition subsequent or a collateral agreement. Taking all the circumstances in evidence into account, my view of the legal effect of the arrangement made is that the term relied upon partook of the nature of a condition to the extent that if the erection of a steel plant should become impossible or if the company should definitely evince its purpose not to proceed with it while the contract was still in fieri\u2014before the plaintiff had become a shareholder\u2014he would be entitled to withdraw his subscription and demand a return of his purchase money, but that if such a state of facts should arise only after the plaintiff had acquired the status of a shareholder the term invoked would be enforceable, if at all, only as a collateral agreement by the company thereupon to accept a surrender of his shares and to return whatever money he had paid on account of their purchase.\nAt the close of the argument I was satisfied that the subscription of the respondent for shares in the appellant company was given subject to the term that the company would erect a steel plant, that it was so accepted and that there was never any abandonment by him of whatever rights the non-fulfilment of that term gave him. Its non-fulfilment is indisputable. The only defence which, in my opinion, calls for consideration is the contention that such repayment would involve an illegal depletion or reduction of the company's capital and therefore cannot be demanded\u2014that because the term attached by the plaintiff to his subscription contemplated such a withdrawal of capital it is void as ultra vires of the company, and since he attained and acquiesced in his holding the position of a shareholder he must be treated as if his subscription had been absolute and unqualified. This defence involves two important questions of law: Did the respondent ever actually become a shareholder? If he did, is the condition attached to his subscription, which must in that event operate, if at all, as a collateral agreement, valid and enforceable?\nThe material facts bearing on the first question appear to be that although the sale of the shares in question, as part of a large quantity of stock, was authorised by the directors, there is no direct evidence of a formal allotment of shares to the respondent, nor of any notice of allotment having been sent to him. The sending of notices of meetings, however, probably supplied the latter omission. Traders Trust Co. v. Goodman[5]. Moreover, the respondent's name was not entered in the list or register of shareholders kept and produced by the company. It appears, however, in a ledger account in the book which contains elsewhere what purports to be the list or register of shareholders. He is debited in this account with $10,000, the price of 100 shares, and is given credit for the several payments which he made, amounting in all to $10,000. While the share register was not kept in the form required by section 27 of the Companies Ordinance (1901, ch. 20; Con. Ord. N.W.T., 1915, ch. 61), its deficiencies would probably not be fatal to its evidentiary value. East Gloucestershire Railway Co. v. Bartholomew[6]. Other authorities are collected in Lindley on Companies (6th ed.), p. 76.\nBy section 25 of the Companies Ordinance:\u2014\nEvery person who has agreed to become a member of the company under this ordinance and whose name is entered on the register of members shall be deemed to be a member of the company.\nThe statute does not proceed, however, as did the English Act, 19 & 20 Vict., ch. 47, see. 19, to declare that no other person should be deemed to be a share- holder. Under such an Act as this latter, or under an Act making the register conclusive evidence of membership or non-membership, registration would, of course, be essential. But by section 40 of the ordinance now under consideration the Supreme Court is empowered to correct the register even in winding up (Winstone's Case[7]), and by section 42 it is only made prim\u00e2 facie evidence of any matters directed to be inserted therein. A person whose name appears on it may shew that it ought not to have been there (Waterford, Wexford, Wicklow & Dublin Railway Co. v. Pidcock[8]), and it may likewise be shewn that a person whose name does not appear on it was in fact a member. Portal v. Emmens[9]; Reese River Silver Mining Co. v. Smith[10], per Lord Westbury. The inconsistent dictum of Fry L.J. in Nicol's Case[11], cited by Mr. Clarke, cannot be successfully invoked against such eminent authority.\nNicol's Case (5) was decided on the great lapse of time\u2014\nfourteen years after the holders of all the shares (25,000) had been shewn on the register,\nin which the names of the persons sought to be held as contributories did not appear. There had been a new allotment of shares from which they were excluded. In re Macdonald, Sons & Co.[12], also cited by Mr. Clarke, is likewise distinguishable. The persons whom it was there sought to hold as contributories were not only not registered but they had never\ndone anything as shareholders, and the transaction was therefore never a completed transaction. It was in my opinion competent for the applicants,\nsays Lord Davey, at p. 107,\nto revoke the authority to place their names on the register. An admission of a shareholder that he is such is in itself sufficient proof of his membership.\nOn the other hand, on the 26th of September, 1914, some four months after the respondent had made his final payment, three certificates\u2014one for 25 shares, dated the 31st October, 1913, another for 25 shares dated the 31st December, 1913, and the third for 50 shares dated the 1st of February, 1914\u2014were sent to him. They reached his office in his absence. While there is no evidence to shew how these certificates came to be issued or that the respondent actually received them, in view of the retention of them for two years and his other acts as a shareholder, the only reasonable inference seems to be that he knew of their existence and presence amongst his papers. Under section 36 of the statute a certificate is prim\u00e2 facie evidence of the title of a member to the stock it represents. I do not overlook the fact that this section proceeds on the assumption that the holder named in the certificate is a member of the company. Although he never personally attended a meeting of the company, the respondent admits having received notices of such meetings accompanied by proxies which he filled in and sent to Mr. Pollock, the president and promoter of the company, who had obtained his subscription. He candidly states in his evidence that he regarded himself as a shareholder during 1914 and 1915 and up to August, 1916. He adds that he would have expected to be paid dividends had they been declared, but that he nevertheless thought that if the company decided to abandon the steel project it would cancel his shares or he could withdraw. Under these circumstances I have no doubt that he would have been made a contributory on winding up (Levita's Case[13], Spackman v. Evans [14]; Fisher's Case[15]; Challis's Case[16]), and, notwithstanding the more favourable position which a person whom it is sought to hold as a shareholder occupies before there is a winding up, I think the plaintiff must be regarded as having become a shareholder. His retention of the share certificates and his giving of proxies to vote upon his shares are consistent only with his being a de facto shareholder. The condition annexed to his subscription being not precedent but subsequent, it was his intention to become a shareholder in presenti. That he may have thought himself entitled to withdraw afterwards does not prevent his having acquired that status. In re Railway Time Tables Publishing Co.[17]; Re Jas. Pilkin & Co. Ltd.[18]. The case falls within the principle of Bridgets Case[19]; Elkington's Case[20], and Thomson's Case[21], rather than within that of Pellatl's Case[22], or Rogers' Case[23]. Pellatt's Case (9), appears to be the strongest authority in the respondent's favour on this branch of the case.\nThe register is only evidence of an application for shares and its acceptance, or of an allotment in the nature of an offer and its acceptance, constituting in either case membership: Lindley on Companies, 6th ed., p. 77. It is the contract that creates the membership not the registration. Allotment is no doubt essential in the ordinary case. But the entry of it in the directors' minutes is merely evidentiary. The absence of such an entry and of a formal notice of allotment are not conclusive against membership. The evidence they would afford may be supplied, as I think it was in this case, by the issue and delivery of share certificates and the sending of notices of meetings followed by the giving of proxies. Fisher's Case[24] was decided in 1885, two years before the House of Lords reversed the decision of the Court of Appeal in Trevor v. Whitworth[25], and the suggestion cf Fry L.J., at p. 128, relied on by the respondent, can scarcely be regarded as now entitled to weight. The same observation applies to a remark of Giffard L.J. in Crawley's Case[26], decided in 1869.\nMy conclusion on this branch of the case is that under all the circumstances in evidence the plaintiff de facto became a shareholder of the defendant company. We must, therefore, proceed to consider the validity and effect of the term which he attached to his subscription and subject to which, as far as the directors could bind it to do so, the company accepted him as a shareholder.\nAs already stated, this term was not a condition precedent. The conduct of the plaintiff as well as of the company's officers makes this perfectly clear. If it were a condition precedent it would have been abandoned by the plaintiff's acceptance of membership. As a condition it ceased to be operative when the plaintiff became a shareholder. Thereafter it could operate, if at all, only as a collateral agreement entitling him to surrender his shares and demand the return of the money paid for them.\nIs such an agreement intra vires of the defendant company? I think not.\nIn Guinness v. Land Corporation of Ireland[27], Lord Justice Cotton, after referring to section 38 of the English \"Companies Act\" of 1862, corresponding to section 47 of the Consolidated Ordinance of 1915, said:\u2014\nFrom that it follows that whatever has been paid by a member cannot be returned to him. In my opinion it also follows that what is described in the memorandum as the capital cannot be diverted from the objects of the society. It is, of course, liable to be spent or lost in carrying on the business of the company, but no part of it can be returned to a member so as to take away from the fund to which the creditors have a right to look as that out of which they are to be paid.\nThis passage is quoted with approval in Trevor v. Whitworth[28], by Lord Herschell, at p. 419, and by Lord Macnaghten, at p. 433. The defendant company in accepting a surrender of the plaintiff's shares could have only one of two purposes, either to extinguish them\u2014an unlawful reduction of capital, or to re-issue them\u2014an unlawful trafficking in its shares, an illegal use of its capital.\nThe law on these points as laid down in Trevor v. Whitworth28, has been consistently followed ever since. The Companies Ordinance contains very strict provisions as to the conditions on which and the methods by which the capital of a company subject to it may be reduced\u2014sections 78 et seq. There is, of course, no pretence of compliance with these provisions. As put by Lord Macnaghten in a passage of his speech in Trevor v. Whitworth28, at p. 437, quoted by Lord Herschell in British and American Trustee and Finance Corporation v. Couper[29] :\u2014\nWhen parliament sanctions the doing of a thing under certain conditions and with certain restrictions, it must be taken that the thing is prohibited unless the prescribed conditions and restrictions are observed.\nIn Bellerby v. Rowland & Marwood's Steamship Co.[30], it was held that:\u2014 A surrender of shares in a limited company, the company releasing the shareholders from further liability in respect of the shares, is equivalent to a purchase of shares by the company and is therefore illegal and null and void on the principle of Trevor v. Whitworth[31].\nThe court was there dealing with shares partly unpaid. The surrender of fully paid-up shares with a return of the money paid therefor is, of course, equally obnoxious. Both alike involve reduction of capital. While a surrender of shares which involves no reduction of capital may be supported (Rowell v. Jno. Rowell & Sons, Ltd.[32]), a surrender involving such a reduction, not made under circumstances which would have justified a forfeiture, clearly cannot be unless effected under sections 78 et seq. of the Consolidated Ordinance. How strictly the right of forfeiture, and of surrender to take its place, is viewed is illustrated in the recent case of Hopkinson v. Mortimer, Harley & Co. Ltd[33].\nIf then a return of the capital subscribed by the plaintiff is ultra vires what is the result? I fear it must be the dismissal of this action. That the plaintiff made a mistake as to the legal effect of what he did cannot entitle him to relief. Ex parte Sandys[34]; Re James Pilkin & Co. Ltd[35]. Having paid his money as the purchase price of shares in the company and become a shareholder he cannot now require that the money so paid should be treated as a loan made to the company to be applied in the purchase of shares if and when it should erect a steel plant, or should it fail to do so, to be returned to him. That in effect is the position he seeks to take. But that was not his contract.\nWhile it was the obvious purpose of the parties that the stipulation invoked by the plaintiff should operate as a condition subsequent or collateral agreement, non-fulfilment of which would give rise to a right of withdrawal on his part, it was not their intention that the company should bind itself to erect a steel plant or to pay damages for its failure to do so. The plaintiff's evidence of his understanding that if the company should decide to abandon the steel project it could cancel his shares or he could rescind and withdraw puts that beyond doubt. Moreover, whether any damage actually resulted to him from that abandonment would seem to be a question so problematical as to be almost, if not quite, a matter of pure speculation. But it is not necessary to enter on that field. Breach of a contract to erect a steel plant entitling the plaintiff to damages has not been established. Breach of a collateral agreement that upon its failure to erect such a plant the company would accept a surrender of his shares and repay the money which it received from him undoubtedly has. But that agreement is unenforceable because ultra vires.\nI would allow the appeal with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division and would restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I would allow this appeal for the reasons given by my brother Anglin.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Laidlaw, Blanchard & Rand.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Short & Fraser.\n[1] 12 Alta.

Such right is one of enjoyment only, essentially temporary in its nature and does not endure beyond the life of the grantee. Idington and Cassels JJ. dissenting.\nThe right to catch fish in alieno solo cannot be assimilated to the \"profit \u00e0 prendre,\" a term found in the common law of England but unknown to the civil law of France and Quebec. Idington and Cassels JJ. dissenting.\nPer Anglin and Mignault JJ.\u2014The renewal of the registration of a right to fish after the official cadastre was put in force, was not required by article 2172 C.C.: La Banque du Peuple v.

(dissenting).\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs. Agreeing, as I do in the substantial parts thereof with the reasons of Mr. Justice Pelletier in the court below, I need not elaborate or needlessly repeat or indicate in detail minor matters of little importance wherein I might differ therefrom. I only desire to make clear in connection therewith my own point of view.\nIt seems to me this appellant's argument fails, as I have so often had occasion to remark in other cases, to recognise what the parties concerned in the several transactions in question were engaged in, or to realize the nature of the business they were about.\nIf we would first fully comprehend the facts relevant thereto and then seek for the relevant law properly applicable thereto, we should have some hope of reaching a correct conclusion.\nWe have presented here an exchange deed whereby one Blais ceded to Sir George Stephen all the rights of fishing in the river Metapedia opposite a certain lot, and got therefor from him an irregularly shaped but definite piece of land, bounded as described and a right of drainage thereof or therefrom.\nI should have much preferred to have been told something of the value of that so given rather than much of that elementary law which is assumed as of course to be applicable.\nIf one knew the value of what was so given, then he might be able to appreciate properly what the parties in truth intended by a deed which may possibly be of doubtful import.\nSeeing that Sir George Stephen, 18 months later, for then he had become Lord Mount Stephen, sold what he had got from Blais together with the like rights on three other lots got from another man for thirty-five thousand dollars according to the deed in the record and I am inclined to suspect it was not a mere personal right for the life of Mount Stephen that was being bargained for.\nThis circumstance, of course, is of no value in aiding in the interpretation or construction of an ambiguously worded deed. I only use it to illustrate the possibilities that lay in an accurate and yet comprehensive knowledge of the basic facts in question and the need, or at least desirability, of being seized thereof.\nIf the said deed from Blais was only intended andcan only be held in law to convey a personal right of use, then it is clear no more can be claimed.\nBut because such rights or personal servitudes do exist in law and cease with the life of the grantee that is no reason for holding and determining that in law a proprietor of land, or river, or stream, is restricted to the limitations of such a personal grant in bargaining for the sale of a fishery to whomsoever he pleases. There is no prohibition in law against his dismembership of his property in any way or shape he chooses. Some prohibitions against the creation of a particular form of tenure which has been found to work injuriously to society in general have been enacted in divers countries.\nI am unable to find any such prohibition in this country or in the law of Quebec in relation to an owner dealing in any way he sees fit with the proprietorship of the whole or part of a private stream non-navigable and non-floatable as the one in question is.\nThe sole question in this appeal save that of the possible want of conformity with the registry laws, is whether or not Blais intended to convey and did convey rights of fishing in perpetuity.\nIt is difficult to say why, if he did not, the exchange deed should contain the following:\u2014 Au moyen de quoi les parties se d\u00e9ssaisissent respectivement de ce que dessus par elles c\u00e9d\u00e9 en \u00e9change et en contre \u00e9change et s'en saississent r\u00e9ciproquement, ainsi que leurs repr\u00e9sentants l\u00e9gaux.\nBut for the mode of thought which appellant's factum presents I should have said there could be no doubt of the reciprocal intention which this evidences by each grantor to vest in the other a right of property in perpetuity and hence that Sir George Stephen was getting something much more than a personal servitude.\nAs to the registration question which only becomes important by virtue of holding that it was a jus in re that passed to Stephen, I may add to what has already been said below, that it does not occur to me that the widow Blais purchased or sold to appellant \"the same property\" (that is within the meaning of art. 2098 C.C.) as appellant now claims when he attempts to reach out and become possessed of the fishery gone forever to another.\nThe article, so far as necessary to consider herein, reads as follows:\u2014\n2098. All acts inter vivos conveying the ownership of an immovable must be registered at length, or by memorial.\nIn default of such registration, the title of conveyance cannot be invoked against any third party who has purchased the same property from the same vendor for a valuable consideration and whose title is registered.\nRegistration has the same effect between two donees of the same immovable.\nAll he got was what the curator of the Blais bankrupt estate had acquired and was authorized to sell, and that was bereft of the rights of fishing. He could sell no more than the insolvent possessed and passed to him.\nAnd the purpose of that conveyance was made evident by the express exceptions made in the first paragraph descriptive of the properties being passed, which reads as follows :\u2014 Mais sauf les parties d\u00e9j\u00e0 ali\u00e9n\u00e9es par baux emphyt\u00e9otiques ou autrement avant la faillite du dit R. A. Blais.\nThis exception is used again in the deed from Mr. Blais to the appellant and hence he never got anything more than the curator had.\nWhat can it mean but the exception of that right of fishing which is now in dispute?\nAnd why, if anything else, is the like exception not made in regard to the next three parcels conveyed by the same deed to her?\nMore than that it is to me most significant that the notary drawing it should have thought of an emphyteusis or such like form of lease. True that does not, perhaps, with absolute accuracy in all the details express the legal nature of what was given Sir George Stephen, but much more accurately than does the personal servitude conception of which we have heard so much.\nThe draftsman hit more nearly the mark by the whole phrase\npar baux emphyt\u00e9otiques ou autrement avant la faillite\nthan anything we have heard argued as being expressive of what the parties concerned had in view.\nThe late Chief Justice of Quebec, in his judgment, seemed to assume that for all practical purposes the appellant had failed and hence he leaves in doubt the result of the distinction he makes.\nHis opinion is, therefore, not necessarily in conflict with the conclusions reached by Mr. Justice Pelletier, which in light of the formal judgment of the court must be held to have been concurred in by others and, I suspect, by all.\nI cannot see why we should reverse a result so accordant with common sense and good law as I conceive to be the correct interpretation and construction of the deeds in question. Anglin J.\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the judgments to be delivered by my brothers Brodeur and Mignault, and I concur in their opinion and the reasons on which they base it that the grant of fishing rights to Sir George Stephen (now Lord Mount Stephen), although effectively assigned to the respondent club, cannot endure beyond his lifetime. If this case had arisen in one of our provinces where the English law of property prevails I should probably have reached the same conclusion as my brothers Idington and Cassels. But I share my brother Mignault's view that this case must be determined by the civil law of the Province of Quebec and that recourse to English authorities dealing with fishing rights in alieno solo as profits \u00e0 prendre is apt to be more misleading and confusing than helpful. At all events English cases cannot properly be invoked as authorities until it is first established that the principles of the English law bearing upon the subject under consideration are the same as those of the civil law of Quebec. That may not be assumed.\nUnlike the profit \u00e0 prendre of the English law\u2014a term which, notwithstanding its obvious Norman origin, is unknown to the civil law of France and Quebec\u2014the right of fishing in streams non-navigable and non-floatable, which belongs to the riparian owner, whose title extends to the middle of the stream, MacLaren v. Attorney-General for Quebec[1], cannot be severed in perpetuity from the alveus of the river of which it is une d\u00e9pendance indivisible; Fuzier Herman Rep. Vbo P\u00eache Fluviale, Nos. 25 and 26: An indefinite grant of fishing rights in such a stream must therefore be treated either as a lease (Bourgeois v. Bourdin)[2], or as creating a restricted usufruct or une servitude personelle et \u00e0 titre de droit d'usage restreint;\n6 Baudry Lacantinerie et Chauveau (1905) \"Des Biens,\" pp. 806-7. It can never constitute a real servitude. 3 Aubry et Rau (5 \u00e9d.), 109-10. Compare Fuzier Herman, Rep. (1902), Vbo P\u00eache Fluviale, Nos. 114-118, 125, 127. Indeed there is some authority for the view that the right created is not even a personal servitude but a mere right of enjoyment\u2014a restricted use or usufruct. 44 Pand. Fr. Vbo P\u00eache Fluviale, No. 131. Planiol (Droit Civil vol. 1. p. 527 (1901)) makes this statement:\u2014\nIl est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement admis que le droit de chasse et le droit de P\u00eache, qui ne peuvent pas constituer des servitudes pr\u00e9diales, peuvent \u00eatre \u00e9tablis, non-seulement au moyen d'une location, mais comme droits r\u00e9els au profit d'une personne; ils forment alors une sorte particuli\u00e8re d'usages viagers. Aubry et Rau, II, p. 61 texte et note 5; Demolombe T. XII, No. 686; D. 91, 2, 48.\nBut whether it be regarded as purely a right of enjoyment (restricted usufruct or use) or as a personal servitude, the right of fishing (s\u00e9par\u00e9 du fonds) is essentially temporary (viager) and, if no shorter term for its duration be fixed by the instrument creating it, must come to an end with the life of the person on whom it is conferred. Pothier (Bugnet), vol. 1, Introduction au Titre XIII \"Des Servitudes R\u00e9elles,\" art. 1, Nos. 1 & 2; 4 Huc, Nos. 165 & 253. The French legislation of 1898 which established the rights of riparian owners in the alveus of non-navigable and non-floatable streams in nowise affected the indivisibility of the right of fishing from the property (fonds). Labori, Rep. Enc. Supp. vol. 2 Vbo. P\u00eache Fluviale, No.3, p. 514.\nNo doubt the concession of the fishing rights now held by the respondent club carries with it as an accessory such enjoyment of the bank and bed of the stream belonging to the grantor as may be necessary to their exercise. Arts. 459, 552 and 1499 C.C. No grant of the alveus is therefore necessarily implied in the conferring of these fishing rights and as none is expressed in the deed to Sir George Stephen none passed by it. Mr. Justice Pelletier conceded that unless the grantee took title to the alveus he acquired merely un droit d'usage.\nAlthough the issues raised by the defendant's plea are confined to averments of the non-transferability of the right granted to Sir George Stephen, that that right existed only as against the grantor and does not bind transferees of his property, who took title without reservation, and that it cannot affect them because not duly registered, the argument of counsel for both parties was chiefly addressed to the nature and duration of the right granted to Sir George and both seemed desirous that we should determine these questions with which the provincial courts had dealt. Moreover, one of the consid\u00e9rants of the judgment of the Superior Court which declared that the plaintiffs held\na real right or right of property in the nature of a profit \u00e0 prendre\nwas not explicitly set aside by the judgment of the Court of King's Bench. I say this in explanation of my discussion of an issue not directly raised on the pleadings and perhaps not necessarily involved in the disposition of the present action.\nWith my brother Mignault, I fear that such confusion and uncertainty as to titles would result from any departure from the construction put upon art. 2172 C.C. by the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench in La Banque du Peuple v. Laporte[3], that we should not now hold that renewal of registration of the rights asserted by the respondent was required by that article.\nNor does the statute of 1881 (44 & 45 Vict. ch. 16) in my opinion affect it. That Act is intituled,\nAn Act to provide for the registration of customary dowers and servitudes in certain cases not provided for by law.\nThe grant of the right of fishing to Sir George Stephen, because a restricted right of use or usufruct rather than a servitude, is probably not within the Act at all. It is certainly not a real servitude and therefore not within sec. 5 prescribing original registration of real servitudes. Notwithstanding the striking difference of the language in section 7, which has to do with renewal of registration, I cannot but think that it also was intended to deal with real servitudes only. The use of different terms in the same statute to describe the same subject is an all too familiar instance of unskilful draftsmanship.\nIn my opinion while the judgment maintaining the action should be upheld it should be modified by inserting a declaration that the rights of the respondent will terminate on the death of Lord Mount Stephen.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Il s'agit dans cette cause de savoir si le droit de p\u00eache jusqu'\u00e0 Peau m\u00e9diane dans la Rivi\u00e8re M\u00e9tapedia vis-\u00e0-vis le lot \"C\" du premier rang de Causapscal est la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du d\u00e9fendeur appelant ou du demandeur intim\u00e9.\nEn 1890, Lord Mount Stephen achetait d'un nomm\u00e9 R. A. Blais, qui \u00e9tait alors propri\u00e9taire du lot \"C\" ce droit de p\u00eache. Cet acte de vente \u00e9tait enregistr\u00e9.\nEn 1892, il vendait ce droit de p\u00eache au \"Restigouche Salmon Club;\" et cet acte de vente \u00e9tait \u00e9galement enregistr\u00e9. En 1905, le \"Restigouche Salmon Club'' c\u00e9dait \u00e0 son tour plusieurs droits de p\u00eache au \"Matamajaw Salmon Club,\" l'intim\u00e9 en la pr\u00e9sente cause, et entr'autres, les droits de p\u00eache qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 acquis par Lord Mount Stephen vis-\u00e0-vis du lot \"C.\"\nCe dernier acte fut enregistr\u00e9, mais par une erreur assez singuli\u00e8re, la partie de \"l'acte qui d\u00e9crivait le droit de p\u00eache du lot \"C\" ne fut pas transcrite.\nDans l'intervalle, savoir en 1899, le cadastre avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait et mis en force dans cette division d'enregistrement suivant les dispositions des articles 2166 et suivants du Code Civil.\nLe Club Matamajaw n'a renouvel\u00e9 l'enregistrement de son titre d'acquisition qu'en juin 1915, c'est \u00e0-dire plus d'un an apr\u00e8s que le d\u00e9fendeur appelant e\u00fbt achet\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question (le lot \"C\") et e\u00fbt r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement fait enregistrer son titre.\nEn 1905, savoir plusieurs ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s avoir c\u00e9d\u00e9 son droit de p\u00eache \u00e0 Lord Mount Stephen, R. A. Blais faissait cession de ses biens; et ses curateurs vendaient \u00e0 Madame Blais toute la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \"C\" sans en exclure les droits de p\u00eache; et, en 1914, Mde. Blais vendait \u00e0 l'appelant en la pr\u00e9sente cause la m\u00eame terre, sans en exclure non plus les droits de p\u00eache. Ces titres \u00e9taient r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement enregistr\u00e9s.\nNous avons alors \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si le d\u00e9faut de renouvellement de l'enregistrement du titre d'acquisition des droits de p\u00eache fait perdre \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 ces droits au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du d\u00e9fendeur appelant.\nAfin de d\u00e9cider cette question, il faut d\u00e9terminer quelle est la nature d'un droit de p\u00eache dans un cours d'eau qui, comme la Rivi\u00e8re M\u00e9tap\u00e9dia, n'est ni navigable ni flottable.\nLe demandeur intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que c'est un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 absolu qui peut \u00eatre ali\u00e9n\u00e9 \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9 et dont il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de renouveler l'enregistrement.\nLe d\u00e9fendeur appelant, au contraire, pr\u00e9tend que c'est un droit d'usufruit ou de servitude personnelle qui s'\u00e9teint \u00e0 la mort de l'usufruitier et dont l'enregistrement apr\u00e8s la mise en force du cadastre doit \u00eatre renouvel\u00e9.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu l'action du club, mais n'en a pas accord\u00e9 cependant toutes les con-, clusions. En effet, il demandait \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 non seulement propri\u00e9taire du droit de p\u00eache, mais aussi du lit de la rivi\u00e8re; et il n'a obtenu gain de cause que pour le droit de p\u00eache. Comme il n'y a pas eu d'appel quant \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du lit de la rivi\u00e8re, il y a sur ce point res judicata.\nLa Cour d'Appel n'a pas accept\u00e9 les motifs du jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, mais elle en a tout de m\u00eame confirm\u00e9 le dispositif en d\u00e9cidant que le droit de p\u00eache conc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 Lord Mount Stephen \u00e9tait transf\u00e9rable et que le renouvellement de l'enregistrement du titre n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire. Mais la cour n'a pas cru devoir d\u00e9cider si ce droit de p\u00eache pouvait \u00eatre transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9 ou s'il \u00e9tait simplement viager; ou, en d'autres termes, s'il constituait un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou un droit d'usufruit.\nLes juges de la Cour d'Appel \u00e9taient \u00e9videmment divis\u00e9s sur ce dernier point; car le regrett\u00e9 Juge-en-Chef, Sir Horace Archambeault, \u00e9tait d'avis que c'\u00e9tait un droit d'usufruit, qu'il \u00e9tait viager, et qu'en cons\u00e9quence il ne devait subsister que pendant la vie de Lord Mount Stephen. L'Hon. Juge Pelletier \u00e9tait d'opinion, au contraire, que la vente \u00e0 Lord Mount Stephen \u00e9tait une ali\u00e9nation de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 immobili\u00e8re comportant la cession d'un droit de co-propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans le lit de la rivi\u00e8re. Les autres juges n'ont pas \u00e9crit d'opinion sur cette importante question.\nJ'en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que le droit de p\u00eache est un droit d'usufruit; et, en cela, je concours dans l'opinion exprim\u00e9e par Sir Horace Archambeault ; mais je diff\u00e8re cependant d'avec lui sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 du renouvellement de l'enregistrement.\nIl m'est alors impossible de me rallier aux vues de l'Honorable Juge Pelletier. D'abord, le demandeur ayant accept\u00e9 le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure sur la question de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du lit de la rivi\u00e8re, et, cette question \u00e9tant d\u00e9finitivement jug\u00e9e, la Cour d'Appel ne pouvait plus le d\u00e9clarer co-propri\u00e9taire du lit de la rivi\u00e8re. De plus, les droits d'usufruit, d'usage et d'habitation sur des immeubles donnent \u00e0 leurs d\u00e9tenteurs le pouvoir d'en recueillir les fruits; et dans l'exercice de ces droits, ils sont oblig\u00e9s de passer sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Il ne s'ensuit pas, cependant, qu'ils aient des droits de propri\u00e9taire dans la nuepropri\u00e9t\u00e9. Demolombe, vol. 9, No. 526. Fuzier Herman, vol. 3, verbo P\u00eache No. 25.\nUne personne qui a le droit de cueillette de certains fruits ou bien le droit de couper du bois dans une for\u00eat a bien des droits d'usufruit ou d'usage; mais ces droits ne sauraient lui donner un titre \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'immeuble sur lequel elle a ces droits de cueillette ou de coupe. A raison de cela, je ne puis partager l'opinion de l'honorable Juge Pelletier.\nVoici maintenant, suivant moi, les principes qui doivent nous guider dans la d\u00e9cision de cette cause.\nLes droits que nous avons sur ou dans une chose se divisent en trois grandes cat\u00e9gories; ou a sur les biens ou un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, ou un simple droit de jouissance, ou seulement des servitudes \u00e0 pr\u00e9tendre (art. 405 C.C.). Un immeuble comprend les cours non navigables ni flottables qui les traversent; et s'il est simplement riverain d'un de ces cours d'eau, alors il comprend le lit de ces cours d'eau jusqu'\u00e0 l'eau m\u00e9diane (usque ad medium filum aqu\u00e6). Ce principe est formellement admis par les partiesen cause.\nLe droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d'un immeuble situ\u00e9 sur un de ces cours d'eau comprend par droit d'accession tous les fruits du lit de la rivi\u00e8re (art. 409 C.C.) parmi lesquels se trouvent, suivant moi, le droit de p\u00eache.\nProudhon, au vol. 2 de l'Usufruit, p. 457, apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les fruits naturels sont ceux que la terre produit spontan\u00e9ment et que le produit des animaux entre dans la m\u00eame classe, ajoute:\u2014\nAinsi le produit des ruches \u00e0 miel, celui d'une garenne, celui d'un colombier, la p\u00eache d'un \u00e9tang sont \u00e9galement des fruits naturels aux termes de la loi.\nCertaines expressions relev\u00e9es dans les auteurs fran\u00e7ais ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 cr\u00e9er dans cette cause beaucoup de confusion et une certaine incertitude, parce qu'on n'a pas toujours tenu compte de la l\u00e9gislation qui r\u00e9gissait la mati\u00e8re \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 ils \u00e9crivaient. Un court, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de cette l\u00e9gislation pourrait nous \u00eatre utile pour bien comprendre ces auteurs et la port\u00e9e de leurs expressions.\nAvant la r\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise, les seigneurs avaient, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, sur les cours d'eau non navigables ni flottables, soit un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, soit au moins un droit de haute justice. La r\u00e9volution a supprim\u00e9 ces droits comme entach\u00e9s de f\u00e9odalit\u00e9 (Dalloz, R\u00e9pertoire Pratique, vbo. Eaux, No. 677). Mais le Code Napol\u00e9on, qui devenait en force quelques ann\u00e9es plus tard, \u00e9vitait de dire \u00e0 qui ces cours d'eau appartiendraient; et alors les auteurs se sont divis\u00e9s: les uns pr\u00e9tendant que les cours d'eau \u00e9taient res nullius; d'autres disant qu'ils appartenaient aux propri\u00e9taires riverains; d'autres enfin d\u00e9signant l'Etat comme propri\u00e9taire.\nEn 1898, on a mis fin \u00e0 cette diff\u00e9rence d'opinion en d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant que les lits des rivi\u00e8res appartiendraient aux riverains par droit d'accession.\nLa question \u00e9tait tranch\u00e9e: mais elle a dans tout le si\u00e8cle dernier donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 beaucoup de discussions.\nLe droit de p\u00eache dans les cours d'eau avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9 par la loi de 1829, qui avait d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait une d\u00e9pendance de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 riveraine. La situation \u00e9tait assez peu claire. Vous aviez, en effet, le lit de la rivi\u00e8re qui, jusqu'en 1898, \u00e9tait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement reconnu comme res nullius, tandis que le droit de p\u00eache \u00e9tait un accessoire de l'h\u00e9ritage riverain. La situation \u00e9tait plus claire dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec comme je le d\u00e9montrerai plus loin.\nJe remarque que l'Honorable Juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure d\u00e9clare que le droit de p\u00eache doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un droit r\u00e9el de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la nature du profit \u00e0 prendre du sol.\nL'expression profit \u00e0 prendre du droit anglais ne se trouve pas dans nos lois et il est toujours dangereux de recourir \u00e0 une l\u00e9gislation \u00e9trang\u00e8re pour d\u00e9terminer les principes de notre propre l\u00e9gislation. D'ailleurs, le profit \u00e0 prendre du droit anglais serait une servitude (Halsbury, vol. 11, p. 336) et l'enregistrement d'une servitude, ainsi que son renouvellement, sont requis par nos lois. Il vaut donc mieux alors se baser sur notre jurisprudence et notre loi dans les cas surtout o\u00f9 les lois \u00e9trang\u00e8res sont diff\u00e9rentes. Voyons notre loi.\nCette question de savoir si les lits des rivi\u00e8res non-navigables appartenaient aux propri\u00e9taires riverains avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec par la d\u00e9cision de la Cour Seigneuriale qui avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les h\u00e9ritages bordant les cours d'eau non-navigables ni flottables s'\u00e9tendaient jusqu'au milieu de ces cours d'eau. Questions. 28 et 30.\nDans une cause de Boswell v. Denis, jug\u00e9e par la Cour d'Appelen 1859[4], il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les rivi\u00e8res non-navigables et non-flottables sont la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e des propri\u00e9taires riverains et que ces derniers ont le droit exclusif d'y faire la p\u00eache. Vide Tanguay v. The Canadian Electric Light Co.[5]; McLaren v. Attorney-General[6].\nCes d\u00e9cisions consacrent le principe que le propri\u00e9taire d'un immeuble riverain est en m\u00eame temps le propri\u00e9taire du lit de la rivi\u00e8re; et, comme accessoire, en tant que propri\u00e9taire du lit de la rivi\u00e8re, il a la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du dessus et du dessous (arts. 409 & 414 C.C.) et a droit aux fruits qui s'y trouvent, et notamment au poisson. Il pourrait vendre et ali\u00e9ner le lit de la rivi\u00e8re; et alors le droit de p\u00eache, comme accessoire, passerait \u00e0 l'acqu\u00e9reur. Ce serait l\u00e0 une ali\u00e9nation \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9.\nMais si, comme dans le cas actuel, il ne conc\u00e9de que le droit de p\u00eache, alors il ne dispose que d'un droit accessoire, que d'une partie des fruits que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 produit; mais il demeure toujours propri\u00e9taire du fonds. C'est un droit d'usufruit qu'il c\u00e8de \u00e0 un tiers; et ce dernier doit en jouir conform\u00e9ment aux droits des usufruitiers.\nA ce sujet une question se pr\u00e9sente de savoir si un usufruit peut toujours durer.\nL'usufruit est le droit de jouir d'une chose dont un autre a la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Il n'y a pas de doute que, dans l'ancien droit fran\u00e7ais et sous le Code Napol\u00e9on, l'usufruit prend fin par la mort de l'usufruitier. Nos codificateurs nous d\u00e9clarent qu'ils ont suivi l'ancienne jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise et les r\u00e8gles adopt\u00e9es par le Code Napol\u00e9on (DeLorimier, vol. 3. p. 584); et ils nous renvoient pour l'\u00e9tude des principes qui gouvernent cette mati\u00e8re \u00e0 Marcad\u00e9, aux Pandectes fran\u00e7aises et \u00e0 Maleville.\nCes auteurs nous enseignent comme principe \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire que l'usufruit est essentiellement temporaire.\nMarcad\u00e9, au volume 2, no. 545, p. 529, dit:\u2014\nL'usufruit finit souvent avant la mort naturelle de l'usufruitier; mais il ne peut jamais durer audel\u00e0 et ne peut pas \u00eatre transmissible aux h\u00e9ritiers de cet usufruitier. C'est qu'en effet l'usufruit an\u00e9antissant pendant sa dur\u00e9e la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du bien * * * ne pouvait pas \u00eatre permis perp\u00e9tuellement ou pour une trop longue dur\u00e9e. En cons\u00e9quence, le Code, conform\u00e9ment aux principes de l'ancienne jurisprudence et du droit romain, ne l'autorise que pour la dur\u00e9e de la vie de l'usufruitier; et l'usufruit qu'on aurait constitu\u00e9 pour une personne et ses h\u00e9ritiers n'en serait pas moins restreint \u00e0 la vie de cette personne.\nNos codificateurs, en r\u00e9digeant l'article 479 C.C., se sont guid\u00e9s sur le Code Napol\u00e9on; mais il ont ajout\u00e9 trois mots qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 une divergence d'opinion.\nLe Code Napol\u00e9on dit (art. 617):\u2014\nL'usufruit s'\u00e9teint par la mort naturelle et par la mort civile de l'usufruitier; par l'expiration du temps pour lequel il a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9.\nLe Code civil de Qu\u00e9bec dit (art. 479):\u2014\nL'usufruit s'\u00e9teint par la mort naturelle de l'usufruitier s'il est viager; par l'expiration du temps pour lequel il a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9. * * *\nCes mots \"s'il est viager\" ne veulent pas dire que l'usufruit est perp\u00e9tuel s'il n'y a pas de date fix\u00e9e, car cela serait absolument contraire \u00e0 la nature de l'usufruit. Mais les codificateurs ont probablement eu en vue la discussion qui se faisait alors en France sur la port\u00e9e du Code Napol\u00e9on quant au droit du cr\u00e9ateur de l'usufruit de fixer une date qui d\u00e9passerait la vie de l'usufruitier. Mais je crains que l'addition des mots \"s'il est viager\" n'ait pas rendu la situation plus claire. De fait, les commentateurs de notre Code sont \u00e9galement partag\u00e9s d'opinion. Langelier, vol. 2, p. 228 et Mignault, vol. 2, p. 624. Ces commentateurs sont cependant unanimes \u00e0 dire que s'il n'y a pas de temps de fix\u00e9 pour la dur\u00e9e de l'usufruit, il s'\u00e9teint a la mort de l'usufruitier.\nSuivant mon opinion, le droit de p\u00eache accord\u00e9 \u00e0 Lord Mount Stephen \u00e9tant un droit d'usufruit ne doit pas d\u00e9passer sa vie. Il en serait autrement si'le lit de la rivi\u00e8re avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu en m\u00eame temps. S'il y avait eu un terme stipul\u00e9, la question pourrait se pr\u00e9senter de savoir s'il durerait m\u00eame apr\u00e8s sa mort, pourvu que le terme ne f\u00fbt pas expir\u00e9. Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider ce point parce qu'il ne se pr\u00e9sente pas. La r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans le contrat \u00e0 ses repr\u00e9sentants l\u00e9gaux ne saurait avoir pour effet de rendre l'usufruit perp\u00e9tuel, vu que ce serait une stipulation contraire aux principes \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires qui r\u00e9gissent la mati\u00e8re. Marcad\u00e9, vol. 2, p. 524.\nLe droit de p\u00eache \u00e9tant un droit d'usufruit accessoire du lit de la rivi\u00e8re, il s'ensuit qu'il ne peut \u00eatre perp\u00e9tuel; et dans le cas actuel il s'\u00e9teindra au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de l'usufruitier.\nHais je vais plus loin; et je suis d'opinion que ce droit ne peut pas \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 contre l'appelant parce que l'enregistrement de l'acte d'acquisition n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9.\nPothier, Edition Bugnet, vol. 1, p. 312, dit:\u2014\nIl y a deux principales esp\u00e8ces de servitudes; les personnelles et les r\u00e9elles.\nLes droits de servitudes personnelles sont ceux qui sont attach\u00e9s \u00e0 la personne \u00e0 qui la servitude est due, et pour l'utilit\u00e9 de laquelle elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 constitut\u00e9e, et finissent par cons\u00e9quent avec elle. Les droits de servitudes r\u00e9elles qu'on appelle aussi servitudes pr\u00e9diales sont ceux qu'a le propri\u00e9taire d'un h\u00e9ritage sur un h\u00e9ritage voisin, pour la commodit\u00e9 du sien. On les appelle r\u00e9elles ou pr\u00e9diales parce qu'\u00e9tant \u00e9tablies pour la commodit\u00e9 d'un h\u00e9ritage, c'est plut\u00f4t \u00e0 l'h\u00e9ritage qu'elles sont dues qu'\u00e0 la personne.\nLes servitudes personnelles requi\u00e8rent et une personne pour en jouir et un fonds servant. Dans le cas de servitudes r\u00e9elles il faut et un fonds dominant et un fonds servant (art. 499 C.C.).\nJe me fais conc\u00e9der le droit de passer sur une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 sans que j'aie de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dans le voisinage; c'est l\u00e0 une servitude personnelle. Je suis propri\u00e9taire d'une terre et pour l'exploiter j'ai besoin de passer chez mon voisin; c'est l\u00e0 une servitude r\u00e9elle, parceque mon fonds devient le fonds dominant; et comme la servitude est \u00e9tablie pour son usage, il devient perp\u00e9tuel sans enregistrement dans le cas o\u00f9 il serait apparent (2116a C.C.).\nNotre code ne parle pas des servitudes personnelles. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 entra\u00een\u00e9 dans cette voie \u00e0 la suite des r\u00e9dacteurs du Code Napol\u00e9on qui, au sortir de la r\u00e9volution, n'osaient pas mentionner le nom de servitudes personnelles.\nTout de m\u00eame, les servitudes personnelles existent dans notre droit, comme elles ont continu\u00e9 d'exister dans le droit fran\u00e7ais; et parmi ces servitudes personnelles se trouvent les droits d'usufruit, d'usage et d'habitation.\nBaudry Lacantinerie, apr\u00e8s avoir dit qu'il y a deux esp\u00e8ces de servitudes, les r\u00e9elles et les personnelles, dit au No. 431, Des Biens:\u2014\nLa servitude personnelle est celle qui existe sur une chose au profit d'une personne d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. Attach\u00e9e \u00e0 la personne elle meurt avec elle et parfois avant elle. La servitude personnelle est donc temporaire.\u2026 La servitude r\u00e9elle est celle qui existe sur un fonds au profit d'un autre fonds. La servitude r\u00e9elle cr\u00e9e un rapport entre deux fonds, aussi de sa nature est-elle perp\u00e9tuelle comme les fonds dont elle est inh\u00e9rente.\n[Notre code indique trois servitudes personnelles: J usufruit, l'usage et l'habitation.]\nAu No. 1070, il dit:\u2014 En pratique, la difficult\u00e9 s'est \u00e9lev\u00e9e \u00e0 l'occasion des droits de chasse et de p\u00eache.\nCes droits peuvent, sans aucun doute, \u00eatre \u00e9tablis comme droits personnels et faire l'objet d'un bail; c'est m\u00eame l'hypoth\u00e8se la plus habituelle. Mais rien n'emp\u00eache, croyons-nous, de les consentir comme servitudes personnelles, et \u00e0 titre d'usages restreints.\nLaurent, au vol. 7, no. 147, dit:\u2014\nIl ne peut y avoir d'autres servitudes personnelles que celles que le Code maintient sous le titre d'usufruit, d'usage et d'habitation.\nAubry & Rau, 5\u00e8me \u00e9dition, vol. 3, p. 110; Duranton, vol. 4, p. 292; Pardessus, vol. 1er, no. 11; Demolombe, vol. 9, p. 626; Maroad\u00e9, art. 686, Nos. 1 & 2; Toullier, vol. 3, No. 382, \u00e9noncent tous le m\u00eame principe.\nCes servitudes personnelles d'usufruit, d'usage et d'habitation doivent-elles \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9es, et leur enregistrement doit-il \u00eatre renouvel\u00e9?\nPar l'article 2172 C.C., il est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'enregistrement de tout droit r\u00e9el sur un lot de terre doit \u00eatre renouvel\u00e9 apr\u00e8s la mise en force du cadastre. La Cour d'Appel en 1874 a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans une cause de La Banque du Peuple v. Laporte[7] \u2014\nThat the renewal of registration of any real right required by art. 2172 of the Civil Code has reference only to hypothecs or charges on real property and not to the rights in or to the property itself.\nCette cause avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par une majorit\u00e9 de la Cour seulement et elle n'a pas paru avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillie bien favorablement, car on voit qu'on a refus\u00e9 de la suivre dans les causes de Poitras v. Lalonde[8], et de Despins v. Deneau[9].\nLa l\u00e9gislature est elle-m\u00eame intervenue en 1881 pour d\u00e9clarer que l'enregistrement des servitudes r\u00e9elles, contractuelles, discontinues et apparentes devrait \u00eatre renouvel\u00e9. Statuts de Qu\u00e9bec, 44 & 45 Vict. ch. 16, sec. 15. Dans la section 7 du m\u00eame statut, on a d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 formellement que dans les deux ans de la mise en force du cadastre et dans les deux ans de l'adoption de cette loi, l'enregistrement de toute servitude conventionnelle doit \u00eatre fait et renouvel\u00e9.\nLa disposition de l'article 5 de ce statut de 1881 a \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9 dans le Code Civil par les Commissaires de la Refonte des Statuts en 1888 et forme maintenant l'article 2116a C.C. La section 7 qui avait trait \u00e0 la servitude conventionnelle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 reproduite dans le code. Mais par contre elle n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9e et elle est encore en force (S.R. Qu\u00e9bec, 1888, Appendice A. p. X).\nToute servitude conventionnelle doit donc \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9e et on doit en faire le renouvellement lorsque le cadastre devient en force.\nIl \u00e9tait donc du devoir de Lord Mount Stephen ou du club intim\u00e9 de renouveler l'enregistrement de son droit de p\u00eache. Alors Duchaine, qui a un titre valable \u00e0 toute la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 lot \"C\" peut invoquer ce d\u00e9faut de renouvellement et r\u00e9clamer qu'il est propri\u00e9taire de toute la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, y compris le droit de p\u00eache ou le droit d'usufruit qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 originairement c\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 Lord Mount Stephen.\nL'appelant doit donc r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 faire renvoyer l'action du demandeur intim\u00e9.\nSon appel devrait \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens de cette cour et des cours inf\u00e9rieures.\nMignault J.\u2014This appeal raises very important questions of law which have received my most serious consideration. A short statement of the facts concerning which there is no dispute, will be more intelligible if presented in chronological order.\nBy a writing dated the 22nd April, 1889, Joseph Pinault sold to Rodolphe Alexandre Blais tous les droits, titres, int\u00e9r\u00eats et r\u00e9clamations qu'il a et peut pr\u00e9tendre tant en loi qu'en \u00e9quit\u00e9, ou qui pourraient lui \u00e9cheoir et appartenir \u00e0 l'avenir dans et sur tout le terrain ci-apr\u00e8s d\u00e9sign\u00e9, situ\u00e9 dans le comt\u00e9 de Rimouski, contenant en superficie 90 acres, plus ou moins, et consistant en le lot lettre \"C\" dans le premier rang du canton Causapscal.\nThis lot \"C\" fronts for a distance of four or five acres on the Metapedia river, admitted to be a non-navigable and non-floatable river, and it is common ground between the parties that, under the law of the Province of Quebec, the title of the owner of this lot extends to the centre of the stream.\nOn 6th September, 1890. Blais and Sir George Stephen, Baronet (now Lord Mount Stephen), entered into a deed of exchange before Napoleon Michaud, notary, whereby, in exchange for a certain piece of land, Blais ceded to Sir George Stephen\ntous les droits de p\u00eache dans la rivi\u00e8re M\u00e9tap\u00e9dia vis-\u00e0-vis le lot du c\u00e9dant, situ\u00e9 au premier rang du canton Causapscal et connu sous la lettre \"C,\" tel qu'il appert au plan de John Hill, Ecr., arpenteur, lequel reconnu v\u00e9ritable par les parties et sign\u00e9 d'elles et de nous dit notaire ne varietur reste annex\u00e9 aux pr\u00e9sentes pour en faire partie et y avoir recours en tout cas de besoin, avec droit par le dit Sir George Stephen de passer sur le dit lot, tant \u00e0 pied qu'en voitures, pour l'exercise du dit droit de p\u00eache.\nAt the close of this deed of exchange it is stated:\nAu moyen de quoi les parties se dessaisissent respectivement de ce que dessus par elles c\u00e9d\u00e9 en \u00e9change et contre-\u00e9change en s'en saisissant r\u00e9ciproquement, ainsi que leurs repr\u00e9sentants l\u00e9gaux.\nIt should be observed, however, that this general clause does not really add anything to the rights of the parties under this deed, for they must be held to have stipulated for themselves, their heirs and legal representatives, unless the contrary is expressed, or results from the nature of the contract (art. 1030 C.C.). Whether the rights in question would go to the heirs of Sir George Stephen, in other words, whether their duration is restricted of the li e of Sir George Stephen, is the principal question involved under this appeal. This deed of exchange was duly registered on the 1st October, 1890.\nBy deed passed before M. de M. Marler, notary, on the 3rd March, 1892, and duly registered on the 20th March, 1892, Lord Mount Stephen sold to the Restigouche Salmon Club, a body politic and corporate, among other things:\u2014\nAll the fishing rights in the said river Metapedia opposite the lot letter \"C\" in the first range of the township of Causapscal and the rights of passage over said lot acquired by the vendor under a deed of exchange between him and Rodolphe-Alexandre Blais, passed before N. Michaud, notary, on the 6th of September, 1890, registered in the said registry office on the 1st of October following, under No. 3918.\nBy indenture made in duplicate on the 31st May, 1905, the Restigouche Salmon Club sold to the Matamajaw Salmon Club Ltd., the respondent, among other things, the above described fishing rights, the sale being made without warranty of any kind, the purchaser accepting the lands, property, fishing rights and rights of way, easements, privileges and franchises at its own risk and without recourse against the vendor for restitution of money for any cause.\nThis deed was registered on the 6th November, 1905, but in transcribing it the clause relating to the fishing rights opposite lot \"C\" was omitted, although the deed itself was entered in the index to the immovables. The Restigouche Salmon Club having\u2014to satisfy a requirement of its charter\u2014obtained the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province of Quebec in Council of its purchase of the fishing rights from Lord Mount Stephen, entered into a deed with the respondent, dated 10th June, 1915, J. A. Dorais, notary, whereby it confirmed its sale to the respondent of 31st May, 1905, and so far as necessary sold these rights to the respondent. This deed was duly registered on 16th June, 1915. Prior to the last mentioned deed, Rodolphe Alexandre Blais had become insolvent, and Messrs. Lefaivre & Taschereau had been appointed curators to his estate, and on the 30th December, 1905, the curators sold with judicial authority, by deed passed before M. P. Laberge, notary, to Dame Laura Brochu, widow of Raoul Mathias Blais, among other properties, lot \"C\" du cadastre officiel du rang sud du canton de Causapscal, tel que le tout est actuellement, circonstances et dependances, mais sauf les parties d\u00e9j\u00e0 alienees par baux emphyt\u00e9otiques ou autrement avant la faillite du dit R. A. Blais.\nThis deed was registered on the 27th January, 1906. On 25th April, 1914, by deed before the same notary, the appellant, described as being a farmer residing in the parish of Saint G\u00e9d\u00e9on du Lac Saint Jean, purchased from Mrs. Blais the above mentioned lot \"C,\"\nmais sauf la partie de la dite terre d\u00e9j\u00e0 vendue \u00e0 Joseph Brassard et les parties lou\u00e9es \u00e0 Xavier Bacon, Joseph Simard, N. Pich\u00e9 et fils et un nomm\u00e9 Benoit et leurs repr\u00e9sentants.\nIt does not appear whether these parts of lot \"C\" were those described in the deed to Mrs. Blais as\nles parties d\u00e9j\u00e0 ali\u00e9n\u00e9es par baux emphyt\u00e9otiques ou autrement avant la faillite du dit R. A. Blais,\nnor does it appear what emphyteutic leases had been granted. The appellant alleges that this deed was registered on 2nd June, 1914.\nThe appellant, having by a protest served on the respondent on 15th June, 1916, disputed the latter's right to fish opposite his property, the respondent instituted this action against the appellant praying for a declaration that the respondent is the sole legal and lawful proprietor of all that part of the Metapedia river that fronts upon and flows on, over and opposite lot \"C,\" and of the bed thereof, which forms part of said lot, and for a declaration that the respondent is the owner of the fishing rights therein and that the appellant be condemned to give up the possession thereof to the respondent.\nThe appellant contested this action, alleging that Sir George Stephen had acquired no more than a personal servitude, not assignable, and which could only be set up against R. A. Blais. He admitted that he had fished and allowed others to fish opposite his lot, but asserted that he had the right to do so, being the owner of the bed of the stream to the middle thereof. He also claimed that the respondent's title could not be set up against him for want of proper registration and also because its registration had not been renewed since the official cadastre came in force.\nThe evidence shews that there is a valuable salmon pool in the Metapedia river opposite lot \"C.\" The membership of the respondent's club is restricted to ten members, but each member has the right to bring one guest. The fishing lasts continuously from 1st June to 15th August.\nThe Superior Court (Mr. Justice Roy) maintained the respondent's action, holding that the fishing rights acquired by Sir George Stephen were real rights and rights of ownership\nde la nature d'un profit \u00e0 prendre du sol sur lequel coulent les eaux.\nThe learned judge also holds that the registration of the respondent's title did not require renewal after the official cadastre came into force, and that the sale from Sir George Stephen to the Restigouche Salmon Club had been properly registered. The judgment, therefore, grants the prayer of the respondent that it be declared owner of the fishing rights in the river Metapedia opposite lot \"C\" and condemns the appellant to restore the possession of these rights to the respondent, with costs.\nOn an appeal by the appellants to the Court of King's Bench, the latter court confirmed the judgment of the Superior Court for the reason that the fishing rights sold by Blais to Sir George Stephen were assignable, that the deeds of sale by the latter to the Restigouche Salmon Club, and by that club to the respondent, were legal and valid contracts, and transferred the said fishing rights to the Restigouche Salmon Club and to the respondent, and that the registration of these deeds of sale did not require to be renewed after the official cadastre was put in force in this registration division.\nI have carefully read and considered the learned and elaborate opinions of Mr. Justice Roy in the trial court and of Mr. Justice Pelletier and Sir Horace Archambault Chief Justice in the Court of King's Bench.\nMr. Justice Roy, as I have said, held that the fishing rights in question were real rights and rights of ownership\nde la nature d'un profit \u00e0 prendre du sol sur lequel coulent les eaux.\nMay I say, with deference, that, notwithstanding its French name, there is nothing similar, in the law of the Province of Quebec, to the profit \u00e0 prendre of the common law of England, which is defined as the right to take something off the land of another person, or the right to enter the land of another person and to take some profit of the soil, or a portion of the soil itself, for the use of the owner of the right. It is considered as an interest in land and may be created for an estate in perpetuity. Halsbury, Laws of England, verbis Easements and Profits \u00e0 Prendre, Nos. 656, 665, 667.\nMay I add that the use of such a term, in connection with a controversy arising under the law of Quebec, is confusing even though it may be thought that there is a certain analogy between one right and another. There are, of course, real servitudes in the Quebec law, but they can be granted only in favour of an immovable and not of a person, and whether the right acquired by Sir George Stephen could or could not be considered as a profit \u00e0 prendre under the law of England, it is certain that it is not a real servitude under the Quebec law. To assimilate it, therefore, to the profit \u00e0 prendre is, to say the least, misleading.\nArt. 405 of the Civil Code describes the rights which can be acquired with regard to property in the Province of Quebec.\n405. A person may have on property, either a right of ownership' or a simple right of enjoyment, or a servitude to exercise.\nThe right acquired by Sir George Stephen must be brought under one of these three heads. I am of the opinion that it is not a right of ownership. Sir George Stephen purchased no part of the river bed, although he could, no doubt, make use of it in so far as necessary for the exercise of his right of fishing, but this is a mere right of enjoyment. He did not acquire a right of servitude, by which art. 405 means a real servitude, for that is\na charge imposed on one real estate for the benefit of another belonging to a different proprietor (art. 499 C.C.).\nThe only remaining real right (jus in re) which he could acquire is the right of enjoyment, and this is the very most that can be found in his title.\nI am not unmindful of the fact that Sir George Stephen and his assigns have the right to pass over lot \"C\" for the exercise of their fishing rights. But this is a mere accessory of the latter rights, and is not a real servitude, for it is a right acquired by a person and not by an immovable, and thus does not come within the definition of art. 499 C.C. for want of a dominant property.\nIn the Court of King's Bench, Mr. Justice Pelletier expressed the opinion that Sir George Stephen acquired from Blais a sort of co-ownership with the latter in the river bed, because the fishing rights could not be exercised without using the bed of the river,. but the answer seems to be that Sir George Stephen could use the river bed by virtue of the right of enjoyment granted him, so that it is not necessary to treat him as being a co-owner with Blais.\nChief Justice Archambault, on the contrary, expressed the opinion that what Sir George Stephen acquired was a right of usufruct. This would bring it under the second species of rights mentioned by art. 405 C.C., the right of enjoyment, and I agree that this wide term, right of enjoyment, would comprise any right obtained by Sir George Stephen, which, of course, excludes the right of ownership on the one hand and the right of real servitude on the other. The grant to a person of fishing rights in a non-navigabla and non-floatable stream, by a riparian owner whose title extends to the centre of the stream, confers, under the authorities, a restricted right of use or usufruct (Baudry Lacantinerie, Biens, No. 1074; Pandectes Fran\u00e7aises, verbis P\u00eache Fluviale, No. 131; Fuzier Herman, verbis P\u00eache Fluviale, Nos. 114, 115, 118; Aubry et Rau, 5 ed., vol. 3, p. 110), which Demolombe (vol. 12. No. .686) calls \"un usage irr\u00e9gulier,\" but such a right is not and cannot be a real servitude. (See the same authors and an interesting decision, with regard to hunting rights, of La Cour de Cassation in Sirey, 1891, 1, 489; Dalloz, 1891, 1, 89, with special reference to the \"rapport\" of conseiller Sallantin and the \"conclusions\" of the avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Reynaud contained in the judgment.) There is no doubt that a right of usufruct can be restricted to certain fruits or products of a property by the title granting it (Demolombe, vol. 10, No. 265). But the important question that dominates the whole controversy, and which was argued at great length at the hearing by both parties is this: Granting that Sir George Stephen acquired a right of enjoyment or of usufruct, will this right last beyond the life of Sir George Stephen? A further question is whether this right is one that could be assigned.\nI have no doubt that it was an assignable right, for a right of enjoyment, other than the right of use and habitation (arts. 494 and 497 C.C.), can be assigned to others. See art. 457 C.C. for usufruct and art. 1638 C.C. as to the contract of lease.\nBut I am equally convinced that it was essentially a temporary right, for the right of enjoyment, as distinguished from the right of ownership or the right of real servitude, cannot be granted in perpetuity.\nIf we take the type and the most important form of the right of enjoyment, the right of usufruct, it is entirely elementary to say that it is essentially a temporary right, and if no other term be specified, it ends at the death of the usufructuary.\nArt. 479 C.C. says:\u2014\nUsufruct ends with the natural death of the usufructuary, if for life; by the expiration of the time for which it was granted. * * *\nThe words \"if for life\" do not mean that unless the usufruct be created for the life of the usufructuary, it will last for ever. The Code evidently contemplates that the usufruct may be created for life or for a term. In the former case, it ends with the life of the usufructuary, in the latter case, on the expiration of the term, and the reasonable construction of this article is that if no term for its duration be fixed, usufruct ends with the life of the usufructuary.\nThis is shewn by art. 481 C.C. which states:\u2014\nA usufruct which is granted without a term to a corporation only lasts thirty years.\nThe reason for this is evident. A corporation has generally a perpetual existence and succession (art. 352 C.C.), and therefore the law fixes a term in the silence of the contract for the duration of the usufruct.\nWhere it is granted to a person, then unless a term be expressly stipulated, and it cannot be stipulated in perpetuity, the usufruct does not extend beyond the life of the usufructuary.\nThe whole policy of the law is against the indefinite duration of such a right.\nToullier, one of the earliest commentators of the Code Napoleon, says, in his second volume, No. 445:\u2014\nSi l'usufruit pouvait \u00eatre pour toujours s\u00e9par\u00e9 de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, elle ne serait plus qu'un vain nom, et deviendrait parfaitement inutile. On a donc voulu qu'il ne p\u00fbt \u00eatre perp\u00e9tuel\/et qu'il s'\u00e9teign\u00eet par divers moyens, les uns tir\u00e9s de la nature des choses, les autres de la disposition de la loi.\nAnd Huc, one of the most recent of the commentators, gives the reason why all rights of enjoyment are necessarily temporary.\nTout d\u00e9membrement de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 portant sur le jus utendi et le jus fruendi est essentiellement temporaire, car s'il \u00e9tait perp\u00e9tuel il serait destructif du droit lui-m\u00eame de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, ainsi r\u00e9duit \u00e0 n'\u00eatre qu'un vain mot. Commentaire du Code Civil, vol. 4, No. 240.\nThis has always been the law, and from the time of Rome, the institutes of Justinian declaring expressly finitur autem usufructus morte usufructuarii.\nPothier, in his treatise on Dower, No. 247, says:\u2014\nL'usufruit de la douairi\u00e8re s'\u00e9teint par toutes les mani\u00e8res dont s'\u00e9teint celui de tous les autres usufruitiers.\n10. Il s'\u00e9teint par la mort naturelle de la douairi\u00e8re: finitur usufructus morte usufructuarii. Inst. tit. de Usufr., s. 4. Also Guyot, R\u00e9pertoire, Vo. Usufruit, vol. 17, p. 402:\u2014\nLa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ne serait qu'un vain nom et qu'un droit illusoire, si elle \u00e9tait toujours s\u00e9par\u00e9e de l'usufruit; les lois ont pr\u00e9v\u00e9nu cet inconv\u00e9nient, en attribuant \u00e0 plusieurs causes l'effet de les r\u00e9unir et de les consolider.\nLa premi\u00e8re est la mort de l'usufruitier.\nMy conclusions, therefore, on this branch of the case are:\u2014\n1. That Sir George Stephen acquired under the deed from Blais no rights of ownership over the bed of the river.\n2. That he did not acquire a servitude over the bed of the river, nor did he even get a real servitude of passage over any part of lot C.\n3. That he obtained from Blais a right of enjoyment or usufruct, which right will come to an end when he dies.\nThe mere sale of fishing rights, or of hunting rights, confers no title to the river bed or land where these rights are exercised, but only the right to use the same for the purpose of fishing or hunting, which is nothing more than a right of enjoyment, and therefore essentially temporary in nature.\nSo far, therefore, as the respondent's action merely claims the right to fish and seeks to prevent the appellant from interfering with this right, its action is, in my opinion, well founded, but the appellant's right to resume full possession of the river and its bed opposite lot \"C\" at the death of Lord Mount Stephen should be carefully safeguarded, which was not done in the courts below.\nI have not yet dealt with the defence of the appellant based on the alleged lack of proper registration of the sale from the Restigouche Salmon Club to the respondent in 1905, and on the failure of the latter to renew the registration after the official cadastre was put in force.\nI am, however, of the opinion that this defence fails.\nThe imperfect registration of the respondent's title from the Restigouche Salmon Club is immaterial, because, long before the appellant purchased lot \"C,\" the sale from Lord Mount Stephen to the Restigouche Club was duly registered, and the respondent is entitled to avail himself of this registration as against the appellant.\nAnd as to the failure to renew the registration, it suffices to say that ever since the decision, in 1874, of the Court of Appeal in the case of La Banque du Peuple v. Laporte[10], it is settled law in the Province of Quebec that the renewal of registration of any real right, required by art. 2172 of the Civil Code, has reference only to hypothecs or charges on real property and not to rights in or to the property itself.\nThe appellant has referred us to a statute passed by the Quebec Legislature in 1881,44 & 45 Vict., ch. 16, which requires the registration of customary dowers created before the Civil Code came into force and of real, discontinuous and unapparent servitudes. He especially insists on section 7 of the statute ordering the renewal of the registration of conventional servitudes affecting any lot of land.\nIt seems to me sufficient to answer that the right acquired by Sir George Stephen was not a conventional servitude but a right of enjoyment, as to which right no question of the necessity of renewal of registration can arise in view of the decision in the case of La Banque du Peuple v. Laporte10. To dispute now the authority of La Banque du Peuple v. Laporte10, which, as I have said, is settled law in Quebec, would imperil a great number of vested rights which rest on the authority of this decision. The statute of 1881 is, therefore, without application in this case, and I do not feel called upon to express any opinion as to the construction of section 7.\nOn the whole, my opinion is that the appeal should be allowed to the extent of declaring in the judgment that the fishing rights now exercised by the respondent in the Metapedia river, between the middle of the stream and lot \"C,\" in the first range of the township of Causapscal, and also the right of passage over lot \"C,\" will come to an end at the death of Sir George Stephen, now Lord Mount Stephen. As this was the principal question discussed before this court, I would give the appellant his costs here. I would also give him his costs before the Court of King's Bench, because he was right in appealing from the judgment of the Superior Court, the latter judgment treating the fishing rights as being rights of ownership. In the Superior Court, I think the appellant should pay the respondent's costs for the reason that he illegally interfered with the respondent's fishing rights, and thus forced the latter to take proceedings against him.\nCassels J. (dissenting).\u2014I have carefully considered the reasons for judgment of the trial judge and the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Pelletier and the other judges in the Court of King's Bench.\nI have also had the benefit of a perusal of the opinions of my brother judges, Mr. Justice Brodeur and Mr. Justice Mignault.\nThe case is of such importance that I have deemed it necessary to give extra consideration to it. A number of titles to valuable properties are dependent upon the decision to be arrived at in this case.\nWith considerable diffidence, having regard to the knowledge of the French law possessed by my learned brothers from the Province of Quebec, I have come to the conclusion that the judgment in the court below should not be disturbed.\nMr. Justice Mignault, in very carefully prepared reasons, has set out in a clear manner the facts of the case. It is unnecessary for me to repeat them.\nI have come to the conclusion that the reasons of Mr. Justice Pelletier in the court below are correct and I agree with the conclusions he has arrived at.\nThe owner of the lots has title to the bed of the river to the middle of the stream. The river is neither navigable nor floatable. This, I think, is beyond question having regard to the present state of the law in the Province of Quebec.\nI think also there is no question as to the right of the owner of the bed; of the river to separate the right of fishing from the right of the soil. The law of the Province of Quebec in this respect is similar to the English law. In the reasons for judgment of the trial judge, the language of Sir W. J. Ritchie, of Sir Henry Strong and of Gwynne J., in the case of The Queen v. Robertson[11] are quoted.\nThe late Chief Justice Sir W. J. Ritchie, at p. 115, states;\u2014\nA right to catch fish is a profit \u00e0 prendre, subject no doubt to the free use of the river as a highway and to the private rights of others.\nHe states, at p. 124:\nUnquestionably the right of fishing may be in one person and the property in the bank and soil of a river in another.\nSir Henry Strong puts it as follows at p. 131:\u2014\nIt results from the proprietorship of the riparian owner of the soil in the bed of the river that he' has the exclusive right of fishing in so much of the bed of the river as belongs to him, and this is not a riparian right in the nature of an easement but is strictly a right of property.\nGwynne J. states at p. 68:\u2014\nThe right of fishing, then, in rivers above the ebb and flow of the tide, may exist as a right incident upon the ownership of the soil or bed of the river, or as a right wholly distinct from such ownership, and so the ownership of the bed of a river may be in one person, and the right of fishing in the waters covering that bed may be wholly in another or others.\nThe late case The Attorney-General for British Columbia v. Attorney-General for Canada, decided by the Privy Council[12] is to the same effect.\nIn the Lower Canada Reports of Seigniorial question, vol. A, at p. 69a, is the answer to the following question:\u2014\nOn seigniories bounded by a navigable river can the seignior legally reserve the right of fishing therein?\nThe answer of the court is as follows:\u2014\nOn seigniories bounded by a navigable river or stream the seignior could have reserved to himself the right of fishing therein.\nI find no difference between the law of the Province of Quebec and the law of England in this respect. I am quite in accord with the view of my brother judges that when a question has to be decided arising in the Province of Quebec and governed by the laws of the Province of Quebec such a case should be decided by the laws of that province; but I fail to see why the decisions of the courts of England or of the United States should not be referred to as guides to arriving at the correct interpretation of such laws.\nThe reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Pelletier are so clear and the citations of authorities both in the judgments of the trial judge and of Mr. Justice Pelletier so ample that it would be a mere repetition to repeat what these learned judges have so clearly expressed. It is conceded that the grant to Sir George Stephen was not a mere personal grant. All agreed that the grant extended at all events to the life of Lord Mount Stephen.\nIt is not a personal right, it is a right capable of assignment.\nThe point in litigation is whether or not this right is a mere right of usufruct terminable on the death of Lord Mount Stephen or whether it is an estate vested in him and his heirs capable of transmission. I agree with Mr. Justice Pelletier that the estate is not one in usufruct but that it is a conveyance of property. I also agree with him that the exclusive right of fishing carried with it the right to the soil or bed of the river during the term of the fishing season.\nI refer to one or two additional authorities in support of this proposition.\nThe case of Tinicum Fishing Co. v. Carter[13], was decided by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. It is stated:\u2014\nThat a fishing-place may be granted, separate from the soil, maybe considered as settled in this State.\nOn page 39, the following statement of the law occurs:\u2014\nIf the easement consists in a right of profit a prendre, such as taking soil, gravel, minerals and the like from another's land, it is so far of the character of an estate or interest in the land itself that if granted to one in gross, it is treated as an estate and may therefore be for life or inheritance.\n* * *\nA right to take fish is a profit \u00e0 prendre in alieno solo. It requires for its use and enjoyment exclusive occupancy during the period of fishing. It implies the right to fix stakes or capstans for the purpose of drawing the seine and the occupancy of the bank at high tide as well as the space between high and low water marks as far as may be necessary and usual. The grantee in the nature of things must have exclusive possession for the time he is fishing and for that purpose; the grantor at all other times and for all other purposes. And in Massachusetts, in the Supreme Court, a case of Goodrich v. Burbank[14], deals with the question.\nThe judgment of the court is as follows:\u2014\nIn the case of rights of profit \u00e0 prendre it seems to be held uniformly that, if enjoyed in connection with a certain estate, they are regarded as easements appurtenent thereto, but if granted to one in gross they are treated as an estate or interest in land, and may be assignable or inheritable.\nIn Muskett v. Hill[15] it is pointed out\nthat a right to hunt and carry away game is a grant and held to be an assignable right.\nSo in Brooms' Legal Maxims, 8th ed. (1911), p. 367, it is stated:\u2014\nThat by the grant of fishing in a river is granted power to come upon the banks and fish for them.\nCiting Shep. Touch. p. 98.\nI refer to those authorities in addition to the authorities cited in the courts bleow as confirming the propositions mentioned by Mr. Justice Pelletier in his reasoned judgment.\nI think the question of whether profit \u00e0 prendre is known to the law of the Province of Quebec or not is a mere question of language. The fact exists that the right in this particular case, by whatever name you choose to call it, is a right of property. It is a right that passed by the grant and became vested in Sir George Stephen and his heirs and assigns as a right of property and not a mere right of enjoyment.\nIt has always been held that a right granted by the King of France to the seigniors in Lower Canada of fishing in the St. Lawrence was something greater than a mere right during the lifetime of the seignior.\nA number of valuable rights have been granted in the River St. Lawrence. It has never been doubted that these rights extended beyond the life of the seignior, nevertheless it never could be suggested that the soil of the river was vested in the seignior. If the decision of this court is to the effect that the granting of the fishing rights in question to Lord Mount Stephen is a mere right of personal enjoyment during the life of Lord Mount Stephen, by reason of its being only a right of usufruct, a number of rights which have heretofore never been questioned would be destroyed.\nI am unable to arrive at such a conclusion as I have stated. I am of opinion the right in question is not one of usufruct but one of property and capable of being transmitted.\nI think the judgment of the court below should not be interfered with. This appeal should be dismissed and with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Charles Angers.\nSolicitor for the respondent: John Hall Kelly.\n[1] [1914] A.C. 258; 15 D.L.R. 855; 46 Can.

A finding by the trial judge, that \"the misrepresentations as to condition and capacity\" of a log-hauler \"which induced the plaintiff to purchase were at least made with reckless carelessness as to their truth\" is a finding of fraud sufficient to sustain an action of deceit; and such finding brings this case within the rule laid down in Derry v.

Brodeur J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing in part the judgment of the trial judge, Ives J., and dismissing the plaintiff's action.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nC. C. McCaul K.C. for the appellant.\nS. B. Woods K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant complains that respondent, acting as agent for the owner of a steam log- hauler, had induced him by false and fraudulent representations to buy same at the price of $6,625. The learned trial judge held that he had been so induced and entered judgment accordingly directing an assessment of damages by a referee. That judgment the Court of Appeal for Alberta set aside and dismissed the action.\nThe owner had offered the outfit in question for $5,000, cash and then raised the price, owing to some slight addition of sleighs to the outfit as originally offered, to $5,875, which included a commission to respondent of 5% on the actual price the owner was getting on the basis of that increased price.\nThe purchase-money was to be paid into the Northern Crown Bank at Red Deer.\nThe respondent, not satisfied with such gain, conceived the idea of getting $750 more from the appellant as purchaser.\nAn involved history of negotiations with others brought about by respondent as part of the scheme I need not enter upon.\nThe result of the misrepresentations so found to have been false and fraudulent was that the appellant, before he ever saw, or had any one for him see, the outfit, agreed to pay and did pay, the $6,625 into the Northern Crown Bank, which was a condition precedent to the removal of the outfit from the place where situate.\nThe property in question was forty miles away from any railway. The appellant and respondent were dealing in Edmonton, a considerable distance further than the railway station nearest to the place where the property was. The appellant of necessity had to rely upon the knowledge of someone else, as respondent well knew, or go to the expense of going all that distance with an outfit capable of testing the truth of the representations made by respondent.\nHaving deposited the said price as required, the appellant went with the necessary help to take possession of his purchase and, on attempting to drive it by means of the power it was represented to possess, found that he had been deceived not only in that regard but in many other respects as to the condition of the outfit.\nHaving been thus induced to go to the place where the machine and outfit were, and moved it part of the way before realising how badly he had been deceived, he had no alternative except to abide by his purchase or recover from the respondent the amount which he had by virtue of its misrepresentations been thus defrauded of. Such, at least, is the effect in plain language of the findings of the learned trial judge.\nUnder the peculiar circumstances in evidence the appellant had no right of action against the owner, who had never authorised such misrepresentations to be made as the learned trial judge finds were made.\nI am not disposed to think that the law is so impotent that there is no remedy to be found for such a condition of things.\nBy no means do I think there is anything improper in an agreement between an owner of lands or goods and a sales agent providing for the latter getting all beyond a named price as his reward or part of his reward for bringing about a sale.\nI do suggest, however, that when we find an agent given such an opportunity and he has availed himself of it to the extent of obtaining a bargain with a purchaser at a cash price exceeding by one-fifth that which the owner\u2014to the knowledge of such agent\u2014was willing to accept in cash, we naturally ask how that came about? And when a learned trial judge finds as a fact that the misrepresentations of such an agent respecting the quality and conditions of the article sold were an inducing cause of such remarkable success, and that they were made in such manner as to induce the belief that they were founded upon and made from the knowledge of those making them, we are bound to ask ourselves whether or not they had been honestly made.\nWhen we find it distinctly stated that no such personal knowledge existed or had been procured on behalf of the agent, or any assurances of such a nature given by the principal, or authority given by him to make representations so false and fraudulent as found by the learned trial judge, what is the inevitable inference to be drawn but that of some dishonest representations having been made?\nIt is quite apparent from the absolutely conflicting evidence of the appellant with that of those he accuses who acted for respondent that the learned trial judge who alone had the best opportunity of deciding between them must, from what he has expressed, have found the former reliable and the latter not so reliable.\nAre we to discard such an important finding of fact? Or must we not rather accept it and apply it so far as practicable to guide us in trying, if possible, to fit it into the other admitted surrounding facts and circumstances and apply the relevant law, even if he may have-failed to state same as fully and accurately as we might desire? This is not the case of a trial where, as sometimes happens, there are outstanding circumstances of evidential force which conflict with the finding and relying thereon we can say the learned trial judge must have failed to recognize the force thereof and set aside his finding of fact and its consequences. The misrepresentations charged all bore directly or indirectly upon the value of the outfit offered for sale, and the findings of fact by the learned trial judge relative thereto cannot be attributable to anything else.\nIt seems to me the inevitable conclusion that to the extent at least of the $750 added to the price named by the owners, conversant as the respondent well knew with the value and condition of that offered at half its original cost, there was no possible justification for so adding to the price asked, and that there existed no foundation of fact for the misleading description given by respondent. How can such false representations made under such attendant circumstances be held as conceivably made in an honest belief in their truth?\nAnd that seems amply confirmed by the refusal of the owner to touch the $750.\nThat also carries with it a finding that the money in the Northern Crown Bank was not money belonging to the respondent, but money fraudulently procured by it to be deposited in said bank by the appellant.\nThe result must be in that way of looking at the case presented, that there never was any ground for an issue; that the respondent should pay the costs of that issue, both of the Northern Crown Bank and of the appellant, throughout, and, as another consequence, I think should be made to bear the entire costs herein. The whole litigation has been caused directly or indirectly by reason of the devious course of conduct the respondent saw fit to pursue.\nThe appeal to that extent should be allowed and the costs paid by the respondent throughout.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiff appeals from an adverse judgment in two actions\u2014one, an action for deceit; the other, an action to determine the ownership of a sum of $750 on deposit with the Northern Crown Bank which comes before us in the form of an interpleader issue. The judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta is reported[2].\nAfter carefully reading the entire evidence it is apparent to me that the learned trial judge intended by the opening paragraph of his judgment to inform an appellate court, without bluntly saying so, that he disbelieved the evidence given on behalf of the defendants and that his unfavourable opinion of their veracity was largely based upon his observation of them in the witness box. I need only say that the reading of their testimony\u2014especially that of Gorman, Edwards and McPhee\u2014is not calculated to lead one to think that the learned judge made a mistake.\nHe then proceeds, without putting his conclusion in a form unnecessarily harsh or offensive, to find that the plaintiff bought the log-hauler and sleighs in question on the faith and under the inducement of misrepresentations fraudulently made by Edwards, and strengthened by Gorman, in such a way as led, and, I take it, in his opinion was intended to lead\nthe plaintiff to believe that they were made from the knowledge of Edwards and Gorman of themselves,\nby which the learned judge no doubt meant knowledge gained from the inspection on their behalf which De Vall states they represented had been made. Several of the representations, most material in character, were false in fact. Admittedly neither Gorman nor Edwards had any personal knowledge of the condition or capacity of the log-hauler, nor had any inspection been made of it on their behalf. According to De Vall's testimony, accepted by the learned judge, he was induced to pur- chase without making the personal inspection which he had contemplated by Edward's assurance that the time spent on such an inspection would be wasted\u2014that the \"outfit\" was as he represented it.\nThe finding of fraud necessary to sustain an action of deceit might, no doubt, have been made more explicit. The success of the defendants before the Appellate Division indicates that in cases such as this it is probably better \"to call a spade a spade\" in plain language. Short, however, of stating in direct terms that the defendants had induced the plaintiff to purchase the log-hauler and sleighs by wilfully and dishonestly making material misrepresentations known to them to be untrue, the learned judge could scarcely have made more clear his intention to convict them of deliberate deceit. He adds that\nthe misrepresentations as to condition and capacity, which induced him (the plaintiff) to purchase, were at least made with reckless carelessness as to their truth.\nHe obviously meant to make a finding which would bring this case within the alternative ground of liability pointed out in Berry v. Peek[3]\u2014that the misrepresentations were made without real belief in their truth and with reckless indifference as to whether they were true or false. I cannot place any other construction on the phrase\nwith reckless carelessness as to their truth.\nWith profound respect I am unable to accept what I understand to be the view of the learned Chief Justice of Alberta, concurred in by the other appellate judges, that the trial judge misdirected himself as to the essentials of the action of deceit or failed to make the necessary finding of absence on the part of the representors of an honest belief in the truth of their representations. The learned judge allowed damages under two heads; as to the first\u2014the difference between the actual value of the log-hauler and sleighs as they were and where they were when purchased and the sum of $6,625 paid for them by the plaintiff\u2014I think it may not unfairly be assumed that the latter figure represents what would have been the saleable value of the property at Coal Camp if in the condition and of the capacity represented by the defendants, and that no substantial wrong will be done the plaintiff by allowing this portion of the judgment of the trial court to stand. In the second head of damage, however, there seems to be a duplication. When allowed the difference in value as above, the plaintiff is already awarded the reasonable cost of repairs necessary to put the engine into the condition represented. His recovery under this head should be restricted to the expenses of the first futile trip from Edmonton to Coal Camp, including wages of men and an allowance for his own time, except so much of them as were incurred in making repairs necessary to move the log-hauler and sleighs into Olds, i.e., he is entitled to recover so much of these expenses as is not included in the cost of necessary repairs. They were thrown away as the direct result of the defendants' misconduct.\nThe earning of profits on the tie contract undertaken by the plaintiff, however, was too uncertain and speculative to afford a basis for a further allowance of special damages. The learned judge properly refused to entertain this claim.\nThe judgment of the trial court in the action for deceit should, in my opinion, be restored with the modification indicated.\nAs to the $750 involved in what has been termed the minor action it must be borne in mind that the question at issue in it is not whether the plaintiff is liable to pay such an amount to the defendants as the price of their interest in the property which he purchased or otherwise, but whether the sum of $750 paid into the Northern Crown Bank by the plaintiff as part of the purchase price payable to the Great West Lumber Company is the property of the plaintiff or that of the defendants. The object of the interpleader issue on which the question is presented is to determine the ownership of this specific sum of money remaining on deposit\u2014who is entitled to demand and receive it from the Northern Crown Bank? The issue as defined by the order directing it makes that clear. The statement of claim properly followed it. The statement of defence, in my opinion, improperly sought to alter and enlarge it. Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Rat Portage Lumber Co.[4].\nThis money forming part of a larger sum deposited with the bank was the money of the plaintiff. He parted with it to the bank solely for the purpose of its being paid to the Great West Lumber Company as the purchase-price of its property bought by him. The Great West Lumber Company might, no doubt, have taken the whole sum paid in from the bank and paid over $750 of it to the defendants, or it might have directed the bank to pay that sum to them. It declined to do either, and disclaimed all right to, or over the disposition of, the $750. The defendants have obtained no title to it either from the plaintiff or from the Great West Lumber Company. It seems clear that, whatever other legal rights (if any) the defendants may have against the plaintiff as a result of the transaction under consideration, the money now in question is not their property. On the issue ordered to be tried it should be declared to be the property of the plaintiff upon a resulting trust in his favour arising from the partial failure of the trust on which he deposited the larger sum, of which it formed a part, with the Crown Bank.\nBut, as the learned trial judge points out, in that event the $750 cannot be treated as part of the purchase-money paid by the plaintiff and his damages in the deceit action must be based on the payment of $5,875, not $6,625, as purchase-money. In the result it is realty not material, except possibly on the question of costs of the minor action, whether the plaintiff recovers the $750 as his property in that action or as part of his damages in the deceit action, the fund being held to answer pro tanto the judgment in the latter. I therefore agree with the disposition made of this part of the case by the learned trial judge.\nBRODEUR J. (dissenting).\u2014I am satisfied that if there had been no dispute as to the $750 issue the action of deceit which has been instituted by the appellant would never have been taken.\nIt appears that the Great West Lumber Company were the owners of a log-hauling outfit for several years, and that they had used it only for a very short time (about four months) from 1912, when they bought it, until 1917, when it was sold to De Vall. In December, 1916, a man named McFee, who had a large tie contract with the Canadian Northern Railway Co., tried to acquire that outfit in order to carry out more expeditiously and more economically his tie contract Those negotiations were carried out partly by him and partly by the respondent, which seemed to be a respectable firm doing business in Edmonton.\nMcFee went with an engineer and a boiler inspector, to visit the outfit which was in a lumber camp at a great distance from Edmonton. He seemed to be satisfied that the price which was quoted for the machine was a reasonable one and, in fact, the Great West Lumber Company were willing to sell the machine for 50% of its original cost. McFee, however, did not seem to be able to raise the money.\nIt appears, however, at the same time, that Mr. Ewing, a reputed barrister of Edmonton, was interested in some way in McFee's contract; and as he had a case for De Vall he suggested to the latter the idea of purchasing the outfit or advancing the money to McFee to purchase it; and he advised him to go and see a man named Edwards, sales agent of the respondent company.\nEdwards described to him the machine, told him the work it could carry out and told him that the machine had been recently inspected by the boiler inspector and by an engineer.\nThere is a dispute here as to whether Edwards stated that it was their own engineer, namely, the engineer of the respondent firm, or some independent engineer. De Vall, in his evidence, repeats frequently that Edwards represented to him that the inspection had been made by their own engineer. However, in cross-examination, he was asked:\u2014\nQ. When he (Edwards) talked to you about having their engineer or the boiler inspector there, you did not understand that by their engineer he meant himself, but you understood it meant someone else?\nA. It sounded as if they had sent someone else, an engineer, down there, and the boiler inspector.\nThere is no doubt that an engineer had gone there with McFee and the boiler inspector to inspect the engine. There is no doubt either that this expedition was organized to a certain extent by the respondent company and it did not matter very much whether the engineer sent at that time was paid by the company itself or by McFee. There is one fact very sure and it is that an engineer had been sent and that his report seemed to be favourable.\nThere is also some statement made by Edwards in this conversation with De Vall to the effect that the hauling power of the engine could be increased by some dome being put on it.\nInterviews then took place between the father of De Vall and De Vall himself with Mr. Gorman, the principal partner in the respondent company; but the latter did not say anything more than repeat what had been said by their sales agent, Edwards. The plaintiff was informed that the respondent company had an option upon the outfit; and the price mentioned was $6,625. Then De Vall saw McFee and they agreed to form a partnership for the purchase of the machinery.\nIt was agreed, however, that the machine would be purchased by De Vall himself and that when McFee would have made enough money out of his tie contract, and out of the use of the machine, to reimburse his share, then the machine would become the property of both. De Vall then discovered that the Great West Lumber Company were the real owners of the property, and on the 24th January, 1917, he deposited with the Northern Crown Bank, who were the bankers of the Great West Lumber Company, the sum of $6,650, which was to be handed over to the Great West Lumber Company when the delivery would have taken place and when the bill of sale would have been properly drawn and De Vall then started for the camp to view the machine and to take delivery of it, and he was accompanied by a representative of the Great West Lumber Company.\nAfter much trouble he saw the machine, saw in what condition it was, and as he had an engineer and man with him, he started to raise the steam and to make it run. It appears, however, that the horsepower did not seem sufficient to make it run, so he telephoned to Edmonton and got the authorization from the authorities to raise the steam pressure and he succeeded in loading up the machine at the next station and sent it to Edmonton to get it properly fitted up and absolutely repaired.\nIn the meantime, he seemed to be dissatisfied with the test which he had made, because he gave instructions to his solicitor to write the bank not to give the money; but later on he gave a release and gave permission to the bank to hand over the money and he began to work with the machine when, after a few days, a shaft broke.\nIn the meantime, it was discovered that the Great West Lumber Company did not sell the machine for $6,625, but only $5,875, leaving a balance of $750 which the Great West Lumber Company declined to claim as belonging to them. The respondent company wanted to have this sum and stated that as they had an option for the sale of that machinery that sum really belonged to them. The money then was deposited into court by the bank and the court directed an issue to have it determined to whom that money would belong, whether to De Vall or to Gorman, Clancey & Grindley.\nIt looks to me as if De Vall had been greatly dissatisfied on finding out that the respondent company were not only being paid a commission of 5% on the purchase-price but that they were also getting $750 above the purchase-price stipulated by the Great West Lumber Company. He thought, I suppose, that it was not very fair on the part of the respondent com- pany to get a sum of $750 above the purchase-price, so he entered an action to get that sum of $750, as he had been directed by the court to do, and started a big action in damages for $14,000 for deceit. He alleges that this sale was made through the false and fraudulent representations of Gorman, Clancey & Grindley and that they should be held liable to that extent.\nThe trial judge gave judgment in favour of the plaintiff on account of the false representations and he said in his judgment that\nthe representations made to him (De Vall) as to the condition and capacity of that machine, which induced him to purchase, were at least made with reckless carelessness as to their truth,\nand he maintained the action of deceit instituted by the appellant De Vall but dismissed plaintiff's action as to the $750 and declared that that money belonged to the respondents.\nThe Court of Appeal reversed that decision and dismissed the two actions.\nA great deal depends in this case upon the construction of the findings of the trial judge. The law on the question is to be found in the case of Derry v. Peek[5], where it was held that:\u2014\nIn an action of deceit the plaintiff must prove actual fraud. Fraud is proved when it is shewn that a false representation has been made knowingly, or without belief in its truth, or recklessly, without caring whether it be true or false.\nA false statement, made through carelessness and without reasonable ground for believing it to be true, may be evidence of fraud but does not necessarily amount to fraud. Such a statement being made in the honest belief that it is true, is not fraudulent and does not render the person making it liable to an action of deceit.\nThe trial judge speaks of the carelessness with which some statements were made by the respondent company as to the truth of those statements. But it had to be also demonstrated that the statements were made in the belief that they were not true. There is no such finding in the reasons of judgment of the trial judge. Besides, I do not see anything in the evidence, which I have read very carefully, to shew that there were such fraudulent statements as were required to maintain the action of deceit.\nThe machine was represented as having been in use only for a short time, and it is true. It was represented that it had been inspected by an engineer, and it is true; it does not matter very much by whom the engineer was paid. As a question of fact, it was inspected. It was represented that it had been visited by a government boiler inspector and it is true. The plaintiff says that it was represented to him that it was brand new, that there was no scratch. Well, he saw the thing himself and became aware himself of the condition in which it was.\nNow, having himself inspected the machine, having seen it, having accepted and paid for it, I do not see how he could take this action for deceit. My conclusion is that it was the result of an afterthought when he heard that the company was making $750 above the price mentioned.\nNow, as to this $750, I agree with the trial judge that this money belongs to the respondent company.\nThe appeal, therefore, should be dismissed with costs of this court.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014With great respect I am of the opinion that the learned Chief Justice of Alberta has misconstrued the findings of fact of the trial judge. The latter said that he thought\nthat the representations made to him (the plaintiff) as to the conditions and capacity of that machine which induced him to purchase it were at least made with reckless carelessness as to their truth.\nThis finding of fact, in my opinion, brings the present case within the rule laid down by the House of Lords in Derry v. Peek[6], where it was held that in an action of deceit the plaintiff must prove actual fraud, and that fraud is proved when it is shewn that a false representation has been made knowingly, or recklessly without belief in its truth, or without caring whether it be true or false. (See also Angus v. Clifford[7]). The evidence here fully justifies the finding of the learned trial judge, and would even shew that the respondents made a false representation knowingly, to wit, that their engineer had examined the machine which they were endeavouring to sell to the appellant. This is emphatically a case where the appreciation of the oral testimony by the trial judge should not be lightly disturbed. I think, therefore, that the main action, by which I mean the action for deceit, should be maintained, and I concur in the opinion of my brother Anglin, concerning the damages which should be granted to the appellant.\nIn the other action, that for $750, I think the appellant should succeed. This sum, which the real vendors of the machine absolutely refused to accept as being in excess of the price for which they were selling the log-hauler, is the property of the appellant, and the attempt made by the respondents to have it paid over to them is on a par with their conduct in making the fraudulent misrepresentations of which the appellant complains.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be allowed with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Geo.

Idington J. dissenting.\nPer Idington J. dissenting.\u2014Under the circumstances of this case, the failure by the respondent to object to the evidence promptly and at the proper time is fatal to any application for a new trial.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (11 Sask. L.R. 324; 42 D.L.R. 516; [1918], 2 W.W.R. 1069), affirmed, Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], reversing the judgment of Bigelow J. and ordering a new trial.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nGeorge A. Cruise for the appellant.\nJ. A. Allan K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I think this appeal must be dismissed and the judgment of the Appeal Court granting a new trial confirmed with costs.\nThe wrongful evidence admitted at the trial, relating to the sale by the respondent plaintiffs of the Tuxedo lands and of the representations made by the respondents to the Tuxedo purchasers, was to my mind clearly inadmissible and should have been rejected by the trial judge. It is impossible to say what weight that evidence may have had on the mind of the trial judge in delivering his judgment in a case where the plaintiff and the defendant gave directly conflicting evidence as to the material representations alleged by the defendant to have been made to him and which induced him to enter into the contract now sought to be specifically enforced.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellant was induced on the 12th July, 1912, to enter into an agreement for the purchase of two lots described therein as lots \"Nos. 39 and 40 in block two in Tuxedo sub-division in North Battleford.\"\nIn the statement of claim the respondents sue for the balance of price of \"lots 39 and 40 in block two in the City of North Battleford.\"\nThe counsel for appellant admitted the agreement, and also by another admission admitted that the respondent had title to the land mentioned in the statement of claim, but seemed to avoid any express admission that the land named in the agreement was the identical land referred to in the statement of claim.\nAt the close of the plaintiff's case thus assumed to be established, appellant's counsel took the objection that there was nothing to shew that the land described in the statement of claim was the land mentioned in the agreement.\nInstead of counsel for plaintiff at once asking leave to amend his statement of claim or adduce proof of identity he did nothing, but allowed the learned trial judge to so reserve the point without objecting.\nI cannot say that that was a very satisfactory disposition of the point. Nor can I say that I should have reached the same conclusion as the learned trial judge without giving an opportunity to amend or adduce further proof.\nThe court below having taken the view that it did of that part of the trial, and found from what, to my mind, is not quite unreasonable, the inference of identity, though I might not have drawn it, I certainly should not disturb that part of the judgment appealed from.\nThe whole question is only worth considering as illustrative of the course of the trial.\nThe main ground of appeal is that the court below erred, as I think it did, in granting a new trial on the ground of improper reception of evidence.\nThe appellant had pleaded as a distinct defence the following:\u2014\n3. In the alternative the defendant says that on or about the 12th day of July, 1912, the plaintiffs falsely and fraudulently represented to him that the plaintiffs were the owners of lots 39 and 40, in block 2, in a certain sub-division in North Battleford known as Tuxedo Park, that the said lots were good city lots, that the town was built to within two blocks of them, that the Canadian Pacific Railway was building on the section just beyond the said lots, and that the said lots were worth more than the price of $825.00 which the plaintiffs were asking for them, and were within one-quarter of a mile of the Canadian Northern Railway station in the city of North Battleford.\nHis own evidence, if believed, established these allegations of fact. Then, hoping no doubt, to prove the fraudulent intent of such misstatements, he called Mrs. Tracksell, who had been present at a sale to her deceased husband by the defendants, in January, 1912, of a lot in same survey, and next or near to the lots in question. Counsel for respondent at once, upon her being sworn, objected to her evidence. No ground for the objection was stated or appears in the case. Her evidence really amounts to nothing more than that there was such a sale, and it seems to me inconceivable how or why its admission can be made ground for a new trial.\nThis was followed by evidence of another Tracksell relative to another sale of a lot in same survey by respondents to him in November, 1912. This witness testified to representations made to him on that occasion very similar in character to those charged in the above paragraph from the appellant's statement of defence.\nHis evidence was given, not as the court below in error states, under or subject to objection.\nNot a word of objection thereto was uttered till after it had all been given, and then counsel for respondents said: \"I have the same objection to this evidence.\" And then he proceeded to call his clients in reply to the defence made.\nI cannot understand why such an utter disregard of the established principles governing the conduct of parties at a trial requiring them promptly and properly to object, if they have any reason to complain of the conduct thereof, should be tolerated as a basis of granting a new trial.\nI observe from the respondents' factum that the appellant was not represented at the hearing of the appeal in the court below, and suspect this feature of the case was not observed by the members of that court.\nApart from any other considerations I think the failure to object at the proper time should have been held fatal to any application for a new trial upon the ground it is rested upon.\nIn the view I take relative to the possibility of such like evidence being admissible in support of a charge of fraud of such a character as set up, there is absolutely no ground for granting it.\nAssume that the defendant had in mind the purpose of establishing a highly fraudulent scheme of the kind, in which beyond a doubt, as illustrated by the judgments in the case of Blake v. The Albion Life Assurance Co.[2], and The Queen v. Rhodes[3], and cases cited therein, evidence of what had transpired between him accused and others than those immediately concerned, would be admissible and the attempt to do so failed by reason of the evidence falling short of what was expected, would that be any ground for granting a new trial?\nThe charge made, which I am for purposes of illustration thus assuming to have been of such a nature as to permit the evidence to go so far as to have been highly prejudicial to the party attacked and then failed, how could he, who lost on another ground other issues entirely, claim as the defendant does by reason thereof a new trial?\nI incline to think the pleading I have quoted wide enough to let in evidence of any fraudulent scheme unless limited by specific particulars which should have been demanded if any limitation claimed to be put upon the inquiry.\nThere is in the next paragraph of the defence a charge of representation of the same facts in a way entitling appellant to relief which did not in order to get same necessarily involve such gross fraud as first charged.\nOn this the court below seemed to think, if the learned trial judge saw fit to proceed thereon he could rightly have found, as he did, but because he did not expressly repudiate being affected by the evidence adduced on the other issue, therefore there must be a new trial.\nI must respectfully submit that is not a proper ground upon which to grant a new trial.\nTo hold so implies, that in every case wherein other issues may have been tried than those in which the plaintiff succeeds, the learned trial judge must by express language exclude all possibility of his mind having been prejudicially affected by having heard evidence on the other issues and in default of his doing so a new trial must be granted.\nThe presumption surely is that a learned trial judge has not misdirected himself unless he gives some indication of it other than apparent herein.\nThe evidence of George Boyd seems to me far from satisfactory and may have appeared more so to the learned trial judge.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs and the learned trial judge's judgment be restored.\nAnglin J.\u2014The evidence of similar misrepresentations made by the plaintiff to other prospective purchasers might have been admissible if his intent in making the misrepresentations to the defendant on which the latter relies in answer to this action of specific performance had been material to any issue in it which the court was called upon to determine. Blake v. Albion Assurance Society[4], chiefly relied on by the appellant, was such a case. See too Brunet v. The King[5].\nThe issues in the present action were whether the alleged misrepresentations had in fact been made, their truth or untruth, their materiality, and whether the defendant had been induced by them to purchase. To none of these issues could the proof of false representations by the defendant made months afterwards to other persons, however similar in character, be relevant. It would not tend to establish the probability of the defendant's case upon any of them. It would be quite as relevant to attempt to prove that the plaintiff's reputation for veracity was bad with a view to establishing that he was a person likely to make false representations when it should be to his interest to do so. The unnecessary and immaterial allegation of the defendant in his plea that the misrepresentations on which he relied had been made fraudulently cannot, in my opinion, render relevant evidence otherwise irrelevant to the real issues presented for trial. I agree with the view of the Court of Appeal that the testimony here in question was improperly received.\nWhile without it there may have been sufficient evidence to warrant the judgment dismissing the action, it is impossible to say that the testimony objected to may not have adversely influenced the trial judge's opinion as to the credibility of the plaintiff and thus occasioned a substantial wrong in the trial. Having received it, though subject to objection, and not disclaimed its having had any effect upon his mind, it is not unreasonable to assume that the learned judge treated it as admissible and that it, in fact, had what would seem to be its probable effect upon his decision. Allen v. The King[6]; Loughead v. Collingwood & Co.[7]; Hyndman v. Stephens[8].\nIn view of the absence from the statement of defence of any allegation that the land described in the agreement for sale was not the same as that' described in the statement of claim and of the unqualified admission of the plaintiff's title to the latter made by counsel for the defendant at the opening of the trial, which the learned judge appears to have then accepted as conclusive on that branch of the case, the action should not, in my opinion, afterwards have been dismissed because of an unexplained discrepancy between the two descriptions.\nI would affirm the judgment directing a new trial and dismiss this appeal with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014The Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan has decided that the appellant introduced irrelevant evidence of false representations made by the respondent to other persons to whom he endeavoured to sell lots. It ordered a new trial because, in its opinion, such evidence may have influenced the trial judge in deciding that the respondent had made to the appellant (which he denied) false representations concerning the lots sold to the appellant. The learned counsel for the appellant has not convinced me that the judgment appealed from is clearly wrong. The evidence complained of was certainly irrelevant and it may have influenced the result. I would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nCassels J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cruise, Tufts & Lindal.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Gold, Stockan & Company.\n[1] 11 Sask.

Knowles K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014In my opinion this appeal must be allowed.\nThe plaintiff respondent in jumping off the car at the time and under the circumstances he did clearly did so \"taking a chance'' and at his own risk. Even if his statement as to having done so with the actual concurrence of the brakesman of the car and at the latter's suggestion to jump when the brakesman told him to is accepted that will not absolve the plaintiff from blame or remove the case from the category of contributory negligence. He was a man 28 years of age, experienced in travelling and knew well the risk he was running as he stated the train was going at the rate of from eight to ten miles an hour when he jumped off. It was a foolhardy thing to have done, and he must be taken to have assumed the risks which such an action inevitably involved.\nI would allow the appeal with costs throughout and dismiss the action.\nIdington J.\u2014I cannot say as a matter of law that a man in jumping from a train going at the rate of eight or ten miles an hour is doing what a reasonably prudent man should permit himself to do, much less so if going at twelve miles an hour. The former rate of speed is respondent's own guess of rate in question. The latter rate is the finding of fact by the learned trial judge.\nThe respondent seems to have been an experienced traveller and had the advantage of daylight to guide him in making an estimate of the rate of speed and of his chances in doing what he did.\nThere are many circumstances evident in this case which should appeal to another court (either that of Parliament or its delegate the Board of Railway Commissioners) to supply for the public an efficient protective remedy in such like circumstances as respondent was placed, if the contentions set up on behalf of appellant are well founded.\nThe one feature I have referred to in respondent's case seems an insuperable barrier in his way in this court and in this case.\nTherefore I can see no good to be gained by directing as the court below has done, a new trial. If respondent is entitled to succeed the proper disposition of the case would be to so adjudge.\nOn the facts as found by the learned trial judge he suffered a wrong, but took a risky remedy when induced by the appellant's brakesman to jump, and an equally risky one when he launched this suit. Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Mayne[3], where plaintiff had a much stronger case but failed, must stand as a warning to travellers trusting brakesmen.\nAnglin J.\u2014The proper conclusion from the plaintiff's own evidence, in my opinion, is that he assented to a suggestion of the brakesman that instead of the train being stopped at Cardell (a flag station and not the destination for which he had bought his ticket), to let him off, it should be slowed down and he might jump off. His story is that he asked the brakesman if he would stop the train at Cardell to let him off and when the brakesman replied that he would not but that he would slow up the train and the plaintiff could jump off, he, the plaintiff, answered \"all right.\" He adds that he was prepared to do that and elsewhere he says that he did not want to insist on the train stopping, as he knew he was entitled to, because he \"thought it would be all right.\" Upon such a state of facts I find it extremely difficult to hold that there was any breach of duty or negligence imputable to the defendant company. I think there was not.\nBut assuming that there was breach of duty on the part of the brakesman for which the defendant should be held responsible in failing to stop the train at Cardell to permit the plaintiff to alight, his act in knowingly jumping from the moving train, even if running only at 8 or 10 miles an hour, as he says it was (other witnesses place its speed at from 12 to 22 miles per hour), was not thereby excused. He certainly assumed the risk of being injured in doing so. Although by no means of the opinion that the mere fact of stepping or jumping off a train in motion is always to be regarded as contributory negligence per se, under the circumstances of this case I am satisfied that the plaintiff's admitted act amounted to such negligence\u2014 if indeed it was not the sole negligence\u2014and his recovery is thereby debarred.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment dismissing the action restored with costs here and in the Court of Appeal, if the defendant should see fit to ask them.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I concur with my brother Anglin.\nMiGNAULT J.\u2014I concur with my brother Anglin.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Begg & Hayes.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Buckles, Donald, MacPherson, Thomson & McWilliam.\n[1] 11 Sask.

C. bought from the assignor of M. a parcel of land, the purchase price being payable in instalments and transferred half of his interest to E. Later E. sent to C. his accepted cheque for half of the amount of an instalment falling due, which cheque was deposited to the credit of C.'s account in the Bank of Montreal. Then C. drew a cheque of the same amount on the above account and sent it to M. with a statement that it was for his own share of the instalment. Payment of the cheque was refused by the Bank of Montreal on the ground that C. was in the hands of a receiver. M. brought an action asking that it be declared that the money standing to the credit of C. in the Bank of Montreal was the property of M., as being trust money in the possession of C. for the specific purpose of paying E.'s indebtedness to M.\nHeld, Davies C.J. and Idington J. dissenting, that the transaction was not impressed with a trust in favour of M.\nPer Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\u2014C. merely assumed, as agent of E., a personal liability towards M. whose right of action is one of damages against C. for breach of contract.\nPer Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\u2014The receipt of C.'s cheque by M. and its presentation, upon which it should have been accepted and paid, is not equivalent to a payment of the money itself to M.\nPer Mignault J.\u2014The money paid by E., being due by him to C. and not to M., was the property of C. and was not trust money in the possession of C. for a specific purpose.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, 39 D.L.R. 664; [1918], 1 W.W.R. 972, reversed, Davies C.J. and Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Hyndman J., and maintaining the plaintiff's action. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and H. C. Macdonald for the appellants.\nS. B. Woods K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014The reasons for the judgment of the Appeal Court in this case stated by Justices Beck and Stuart, from which judgment the present appeal has been taken, so fully and fairly represent my own views that I feel there is little or nothing I can add to them. I am satisfied to adopt these reasons as my own and would dismiss this appeal.\nMr. Tilley, however, for the appellant, pressed very strongly the argument that both Evans and Cairns paid these moneys in dispute before they were compellable to pay them and that their only liability was to the Canadian Agency and not to the Merchants Bank, the assignee of the Eby agreement. He contended there was no evidence of any trust having been created, or of any intention to create a trust, on the part of the agency in receiving the moneys.\nI am of opinion that this argument is based upon an incorrect appreciation of the evidence and of all the facts. We should not look to the form but rather to the substance of the transaction, and I think in so doing we must reach the conclusion that a trust was created when the moneys of Evans and Cairns were paid over to the Canadian Agency before they were due under the agreement, and that trust was to transmit these moneys to the plaintiff respondent, the Merchants Bank, in payment of their share of the instalment of the purchase money of the lands Eby had sold to Biggar and which instalments of purchase money had been assigned by Eby to the bank and one of which fell due the following day.\nBiggar had executed a declaration of trust that he had purchased in trust for the agency, but as a fact there was no assignment of the agreements of sale to Canadian Agency, Limited.\nThe Canadian Agency, on whose behalf Biggar had purchased these lands, had assigned 50% of their interest in them to one Cairns, who in turn assigned 10% interest to Evans subject in each case to payment of a proportionate share of the purchase-price.\nDuring the years 1911, 1912 and 1913, payments of principal and interest were made by the Canadian Agency to the vendor Eby and his assignee the respondent bank, and Evans and Cairns (the latter through the Western Mortgage Company) had paid through the Canadian Agency their 10% and 40% respectively of these instalments.\nIn 1913 Eby assigned his vendor's interest in the lands and unpaid purchase moneys to the bank respondent. On the 7th June, 1914, an instalment of principal and interest, $8,554.90, was due to the respondent bank by Biggar, the purchaser from Eby.\nEvans at the time filled the dual positions of manager of the Canadian Agency in Alberta and of president of the Canadian Mortgage Company, and on 6th June, the day before the above instalment fell due, he made out his own personal cheque for $855.49 in favour of the Canadian Agency, being his 10% share of the instalment and interest, the cheque stating on its face that it was for\nshare Eby payment due 7th June, 1914,\nand as president of the Western Canada Mortgage Company directed its cheque to be drawn and issued in favour of the Canadian Agency for the sum of $3,421.09, the cheque stating on its face\nthat it was in payment of 40% due to S. Eby on the 7th June.\nThe two together made up $4,277.45, the 50% of the instalment due the following day on the Eby agreement. Instead of forwarding these two cheques to the Merchants Bank direct indorsed by Canadian Agency, Evans sent that bank a cheque of the Canadian Agency for the whole sum of $4,277.45 enclosed in a letter which misrepresented the true facts, and two days later the personal cheque of Evans and that of the Canada Mortgage Company were deposited in the Canadian Agency's general account in the Bank of Montreal to its credit.\nWhen the cheque in favour of respondent was presented for payment the Bank of Montreal refused payment on the wrongful ground that a receiver for the assets of the Canadian Agency had been appointed in England by the court.\nUnder the state of facts proved at the trial beyond dispute, I do not doubt that the Canadian Agency received the two cheques, Evans' personal one and the Canada Mortgage Company's cheque in trust to forward them to the plaintiff the Merchants Bank, the assignee of the Eby agreement, and to whom the instalment of the purchase money was payable.\nThe fact that the general manager of the security company misrepresented the facts for the purpose of concealing the critical financial position of the Canadian Agency Company, Limited, is established.\nBut that misrepresentation cannot in any way alter or change the substance and essence of the transaction as proved by the oral and written evidence at the trial which were that the moneys were paid to the Canadian Agency, Limited, the day before an instalment of the purchase money due on the Eby agreement fell due, by the Canadian Mortgage Company on behalf of Cairns and by Evans personally to transmit to the Merchants Bank, the assignee of the Eby agreement, in payment of 40% of that instalment due by Cairns and 10% due by Evans and for no other purpose.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss the appeal and confirm the judgment of the Appeal Court.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The Canadian Agency, Limited, rested under a double obligation to pay respondent the money in question. First, as the purchaser bound to pay the entire purchase money for lands bought by others as its trustees, and secondly, as the actual recipient from Evans and Cairns, to whom it had resold a half interest of their shares, of the half of the instalment of purchase money then falling due, and which shares in the respective proportions of 10% and 40% had been so paid it for the express purpose of the transmission thereof to respondent as the assignee of the obligation that the Canadian Agency, through its trustee, had given Eby, the vendor in question.\nMoreover, it owed a duty to its own trustee who had so bought for it and had been indemnified by it against the covenants he had on its behalf entered into with the vendor Eby.\nNot one of these several parties thus concerned ever interposed to prevent the payment of the cheque in question unless the dubious letter of Evans can be said, on his behalf, to savour of such interposition.\nThe cheque, however, was for the exact sum of the total which was paid the agency for the express purpose of remitting to respondent in order to discharge such obligations, and became the property of respondent upon and by virtue of which it was entitled to receive the money from the Bank of Montreal.\nNo matter how much of falsehood the letter accompanying it may have contained, the agency had parted with the symbol of control of property which entitled the respondent thereby to get the money, and it was entitled to have the agency and all others enjoined from executing any fraudulent purpose that may have been involved in the attempted misdirection and misappropriation of the money.\nIf the money had been received by the respondent on its presentation of the cheque, as admitted now, it should have been, and applied as originally destined-, could the agency company or any of its creditors have insisted on the terms of such a letter being observed under all the circumstances in question?\nOn such a state of facts as disclosed in the evidence I have no doubt the judgment below is right.\nAnd quite apart from the view I thus present, even if there had never been any cheque sent, there exist in the maze of interrelated obligations so many grounds upon which the respondent could, as assignee of Eby, have enforced some of the several obligations of trusteeship which constituted the fund a trust and bound the Canadian Agency to apply the money in the way it was destined to be applied, the moment it was received by it, that I have no doubt it could not, nor could its liquidator, lawfully apply it otherwise than by paying it to respondent.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Mr. O. M. Biggar, nominally on his own behalf, but in reality as trustee for Canadian Agency, Limited (as evidenced by a declaration of trust), bought a parcel of land from one Eby, the purchase money being payable in instalments. Eby assigned his interest in the agreement to the plaintiff, the Merchants Bank (Battleford branch). Canadian Agency transferred 40% of its interest to one Cairns, and 10% to one Evans, who was its Alberta manager and was also president of the Western Canada Mortgage Company. Cairns and Evans undertook to furnish money as required to meet, or to recoup Canadian Agency for their proportion of Biggar's liability to the vendor, and the Western Canada Mortgage Company agreed to make advances to meet Cairns' payments.\nAn instalment of purchase money with interest, amounting in all to $8,554.90, fell due on the 7th of June, 1914. Of this sum, while Canadian Agency owed it all, it was entitled to be recouped by Cairns $3,421.96 and by Evans $855.49. In the case of earlier instalments the whole amounts thereof had in fact been paid by Canadian Agency, Cairns and Evans recouping it for their shares. In June, 1914, Canadian Agency was short of money. Evans' personal cheque for $855.49, and a cheque on the Western Canada Mortgage Company's account for $3,421.96, both good, were handed to Canadian Agency on the 6th of June in order that it should pay these sums by its own cheque to the Merchants Bank to cover Cairns' and Evans' shares of the instalment due on the 7th. The two cheques were deposited, as undoubtedly was intended, to the credit of Canadian Agency's current account in the Bank of Montreal at Edmonton on the 8th of June. On the 6th, a cheque of Canadian Agency drawn on that account for $4,277.45 was sent to the Merchants Bank at Battleford, but accompanied by a letter written by Evans stating in unmistakable terms that it was a payment on behalf of Canadian Agency itself and intended to cover its share of the instalment due on the 7th and that its co-owners had not provided funds to meet their shares of that obligation. Whatever may have been the purpose of this falsehood, it at least does not lessen the difficulty in which the Merchants Bank and Cairns and Evans now find themselves.\nOn presentation by the Merchants Bank payment of Canadian Agency's cheque was refused by the Bank of Montreal on the ground that a receiver had been appointed in England of the assets of the company; and, so far as this record shews, it still remains unpaid. An order for the winding-up of Canadian Agency has since been made and the liquidator defends this action, to which the Bank of Montreal is also a party defendant. But for some reason not disclosed the trial proceeded against the liquidator alone, and he as appellant and the Merchants Bank as respondent are the sole parties to this appeal.\nThe liability of Canadian Agency to the plaintiff as payee of its dishonoured cheque is not questioned. The object of this action, however, is to obtain the fund itself in the hands of the Bank of Montreal, the relief prayed for being\na declaration that of the sums now standing to the credit of the defendant, the Canadian Agency Limited, No. 1 account, in the defendant, the Bank of Montreal, at Edmonton, $4,277.45 is the property of the plaintiff.\nThe evidence establishes probably with sufficient clearness that the $4,277.45 on deposit with the Bank of Montreal, at the time that the dishonoured cheque was presented, to the credit of the account on which it was drawn, was the proceeds of the Cairns' and Evans' cheques, and I shall assume that payment of it was wrongfully refused. Re Maudslay Sons and Field[2]. The plaintiff's claim on the fund is based on two grounds\u2014that the money was impressed with a trust of which Canadian Agency was the trustee and it (the Merchants Bank) the cestui que trust; that, since the Bank of. Montreal should have paid Canadian Agency's cheque on presentation and equity will treat that as done which ought to have been done, the position is the same as if the proceeds of the Cairns' and Evans' cheques had actually reached the Merchants Bank through the Bank of Montreal or had been sent to it directly by Canadian Agency.\nOn the second hearing of this appeal Mr. Tilley strongly pressed the argument, not before presented, that, having regard to the terms of the agreement of the 25th of May, 1911, between Canadian Agency, Cairns and the Western Canada Mortgage Company, the payments in question by Cairns and Evans to Canadian Agency should be regarded not as payments of money by principals to their agent to be forwarded on their account but as payments by debtors to their creditor actual or about to be. If this view be correct; the case of the appellant is, in my opinion, unanswerable. But facts which militate against it are that Evans was not a party to the agreement of the 25th of May, 1911, that he knew the financial position of Canadian Agency when he handed the cheques for the Cairns' and Evans' payments to it, and that the agreement contains no express covenant by Cairns, and, of course, none of any kind by Evans, who was not a party to it, to pay respectively 40% and 10% of the instalments of purchase money due to Eby. This much, moreover, seems to be clear\u2014that it was contemplated by the parties that Canadian Agency should place the Cairns' and Evans' cheques to its own credit and should make the payment in question to Eby (the Merchants Bank) on its own account and in fulfilment of the contractual obligation of its trustee, Biggar, against which it was bound to indemnify him. Cairns and Evans were under no contractual obligation either to Eby or to Biggar. Payment was made by them, not as Eby's debtors, but under a contractual obligation with Canadian Agency to make it.\nI prefer, however, to deal with the question on the assumption that Evans intended, when he gave to Canadian Agency the cheques for his own 10% and Cairns' 40% of the instalment falling due to Eby, to put that company in funds to pay Cairns' and Evans' share of the instalment as their agent. Mr. Woods' contention, as I understand it, was that Canadian Agency received the Cairns' and Evans' cheques in the capacity of their agent to forward the proceeds, with Canadian Agency's own share of the instalment due, to the vendor's assignee, the Merchants Bank. How did this initial agency for Cairns and Evans develop into the trust for the Merchants Bank which Mr. Woods argued it became, and which he must establish in order to succeed? There is not a vestige of intention on the part of Cairns and Evans or either of them to create a trust, or on the part of Canadian Agency to assume the position of trustee. That an agent directed by his principal to pay to a third person money sent to him for that purpose (the direction or authority not amounting to an assignment of or charge upon the fund), is not, in general, responsible to such third person should he fail to execute his mandate is trite law. He may become so by assenting to the direction and communicating his assent to the intended payee or by undertaking with him to pay the money to him or to hold it for him. The law on these points is conveniently collected in 1 Hals. L. of E., par. 469; see, too, cases cited in Bowstead on Agency, 5th ed., 426, and Godefroi on Trusts, 4th ed., pp. 62-3. But even then the agent does not become a trustee for the intended payee nor the latter a cestui que trust; nor is the fund impressed with a trust so that it becomes in equity the property of the intended payee as it would be if the relation of trustee and cestui que trust were established. The prayer of the statement of claim that the fund be declared the property of the plaintiff recognizes this to be the necessary result of the creation of a trust. But the agent so undertaking merely assumes a personal liability to the intended payee. His obligation is contractual or quasi contractual. The payee's right is legal, not equitable. In the event of default by the agent the payee's right of action against him is not to recover the fund but for damages for breach of contract.\nThe distinction between trusts for the payment of the settlor's creditors generally and trusts for the payment of one or more named creditors, properly insisted upon by Mr. Woods in distinguishing the authorities cited by counsel for the appellant (Johns v. James[3], and Synnot v. Simpson[4]), is well established. See Underhill on Trusts, 7th ed., p. 36. New, Prance and Garrard's Trustee v. Hunting[5], is a comparatively modern illustration of the application of the rule stated by Turner V.C. in Smith v. Hurst[6], that a trust for particular creditors is effective and irrevocable without communication to or assent by them. But the foundation of a trust, whether expressly so termed, or arising from the apparent intention to create a trust, as distinguished from a mere contractual agency, is present in both classes of cases alike. The trust for creditors generally is sometimes compared to an agency, Lewin on Trusts, 12th ed., 607. It resembles agency in that it is revocable until communication and that such communication is essential to give the creditor a status to make a claim against the agent in the one case, or against the trustee and upon the trust fund in the other. But in the absence of any evidence of intention to create a trust, I find nothing to support the respondent's contention that what was clearly established as an agency became a trust.\nNor can I regard the giving to, or the receipt of, the cheque by the Merchants Bank, followed by a presentation upon which it should have been accepted and paid as equivalent in legal or equitable effect to a transfer or payment of the money itself to that bank. To do so would be, in my opinion, to give to the dishonoured cheque the effect and operation of an assignment of money in the drawee's hands belonging to the drawer, or at least of a charge upon it. It has neither. Its wrongful dishonour gives no right of action to the payee against the drawee either for the money itself or for damages for such wrongful dishonour. Schroeder v. Central Bank[7]; Hopkinson v. Forster[8]. There can be no charge in equity without an intent to charge. The cheque is merely a bill of exchange payable at the banker's. The giving of it implies neither an intention to assign the drawer's money in the banker's hands nor an intention to charge it. Unless the cheque be treated as amounting to an assignment of, or constituting a charge upon, these moneys, I cannot understand on what footing it can be successfully urged that its receipt and presentation and dishonour would produce the same legal situation as would result from the receipt of the money itself by the payee or a declaration by the banker that such money would be held in trust for him.\nThe maxim that\nequity looks upon that as done which ought to have been done,\nthough of very extended, is certainly not of universal application. Equity will not thus consider things in favour of all persons, but only of those who have a right to pray that the thing should be done. Burgess v. Wheate[9]; Story's Equity, 13th ed., p. 68. The Merchants Bank was not in that position. The Bank of Montreal owed no duty to it out of which there might arise an equity entitling it to pray that the Bank of Montreal should be made to accept and pay the dishonoured cheque. The banker's only obligation in respect of a cheque drawn on him is to his customer, the drawer, and it arises out of their contractual relations*. The drawer alone, if interested in collateral consequences and incidents, may invoke the maxim under consideration. Re Anstis, Chetwynd v. Morgan[10]; Re Plumptre's Marriage Settlement[11]. With deference, wholesome and useful as this doctrine of equity undoubtedly is within the sphere of its legitimate application, it cannot be invoked here. If it could the money in the Bank of Montreal to the credit of the drawer must be deemed to have become the property of the Merchants Bank just as if it had been actually paid to it on the presentation of the cheque, which would thus be given the effect of an assignment of that money by the drawer to the payee\u2014which it certainly cannot have. Schroeder v. Central Bank[12]. Another equitable maxim, which, although likewise by no means of universal application, may not be ignored, is that \"equity follows the law.\" It is not a consequence of the dishonour of the Canadian Agency's cheque having been wrongful that the payee's rights in equity are the same as if that cheque had been paid.\nThat neither Canadian Agency nor the Bank of Montreal was a trustee, that there was no trust fund and that the Merchants Bank was not a cestui que trust is, I think, indubitable. Neither did the latter ever attain a position in any sense equivalent to what it would have occupied had the money itself actually reached its hands whether on payment by the Bank of Montreal of Canadian Agency's cheque or directly from that company.\nWhatever rights of control Cairns and Evans may have as principals over the disposition of the fund to their agent's credit in the Bank of Montreal, the Merchants Bank has none. Cairns' and Evans' rights, too, are subject to all equities of set-off as between them and the Canadian Agency and its creditors. These rights are not in question here.\nI would for these reasons, with respect, allow this appeal and dismiss this action as against the liquidator with costs throughout.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur with my brother Anglin.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014So far as they need be stated, the pertinent facts are as follows:\u2014\nIn June, 1911, Mr. O. M. Biggar purchased from one Eby certain lands in the Province of Saskatchewan for the price of $47,134.50 on account of which he paid $11,783.62, and the balance was payable by instalments of $7,070.17 on the 7th June, 1912, 1913, 1914 and 1915, and the remaining balance in 1916, with interest at 7 per cent. to be paid with each instalment. This purchase was made by Mr. Biggar on behalf of the Canadian Agency, Limited, a corporation having its head office in London, England, which furnished the cash payment made to Eby, and Mr. Biggar, on 15th July, 1911, executed a declaration of trust in its favour.\nThe rights of Eby under his sale to Mr. Biggar now belong to the respondent to whom they were assigned by Eby.\nAt some date subsequent to this purchase an agreement, incorrectly dated of the 25th May, 1911, was entered into between the Canadian Agency, Limited, one J. F. Cairns of Saskatoon, and Western Canada Mortgage Company, Limited, a corporation having its head office in Edmonton, Alberta, whereby it was stated that it had been agreed between the Canadian Agency, Limited, and Cairns that the latter should take and hold an undivided one-half interest in the lands purchased from Eby and in some other lands acquired from other individuals, Cairns to pay one-half of the costs thereof and of the expenses incurred in connection with the same. It was also stated that Cairns had conveyed one-fifth of his one-half interest to Mr. H. M. E. Evans, who was the manager at Edmonton of the Canadian Agency, Limited, and also the president of Western Canada Mortgage Company, Limited. The agreement was that the Canadian Agency, Limited, should hold the lands in trust for the owners thereof as follows: the Canadian Agency, Limited, an undivided five-tenths interest; Cairns, an undivided four-tenths interest; and Evans, an undivided one-tenth interest in the said lands. It was further agreed that the Canadian Agency, Limited, should on its own behalf pay one-half of the cost of the said lands and of the expenses of surveying, grading, improving, advertising and developing, and all taxes and assessments, and should collect from Evans 10% of the cost of the said lands and of such expenses, Cairns being bound to pay or cause to be paid 40% of the cost of the lands and expenses. It was also stipulated that the Canadian Agency, Limited, should do all acts, matters and things required for the improving, developing, advertising and placing upon the market of the said lands and should, on behalf of itself and Cairns, advance all moneys that should be required and should immediately apply to the Western Canada Mortgage Company, Limited\u2014which was financing the venture for Cairns\u2014for the 40% share thereof payable by Cairns.\nThe instalments and interest on the purchase price were paid in 1912 and 1913, these payments, as I read the evidence, being made by the Canadian Agency, Limited, Cairns and Evans paying, or causing to be paid, their shares to the latter company. On 7th June, 1914, another instalment of $7,070.17 and of $1,484.73 of interest, in all $8,554.90 came due, and it is in connection with this payment that the controversy has arisen.\nTaking now the different documents relating to the 1914 payment in the Order in which we find them in the case, there is first a cheque, dated 6th June, 1914, to the order of the Canadian Agency, Limited, for $855.49, signed by Mr. Evans, for his tenth share of the 1914 payment.\nNext there is a cheque dated 6th June, 1914, of the. Canadian Agency, Limited, to its own order, for $3,421.96, drawn on its account No. 3, which is said to have been the account of Western Canada Mortgage Company, Limited. Both of these cheques were deposited to the credit of the Canadian Agency, Limited, in the Bank of Montreal at Edmonton. An order dated 6th June, 1914, was addressed to the accountant of the Canadian Agency, Limited, for the issue of a cheque signed \"Western Canada Mortgage Co., per H. M. E. Evans.\"\nThen there is a letter to the Merchants Bank of Canada, Battleford, Sask., dated 6th June, 1914, and signed by the Canadian Agency, Limited, per H. M. E. Evans. This letter is as follows:\u2014\nThe Merchants Bank of Canada,\nBattleford, Sask.\n6th June, 1914.\nDear Sirs:\u2014\nRe W. S. Eby.\nEnclosed please find our cheque for $4,277.45. This is just half the amount which is due to Mr. Eby on June 7th and which you have given notice to Mr. O. M. Biggar has been assigned to you. It is really a syndicate that is interested in this property and the owners of the half interest in that syndicate have not yet put us in funds to meet their share of the payment. We presume you will grant us a reasonable extension while we are communicating with them on the subject.\nYours faithfully,\nTHE CANADIAN AGENCY, LIMITED,\nPer H. M. E. Evans.\nThen we have the cheque here in question, drawn on 6th June, 1914, by the Canadian Agency, Limited, on its account No. 1 (which was the account of its own moneys), to the order of the Merchants Bank of Canada, Battleford, for the sum of $4,277.45, one-half of the payment of $8,554.90 due to the Merchants Bank as assignee of Eby. Payment of this cheque was refused by the Bank of Montreal, a receiver having been named in England to the Canadian Agency, Limited.\nFinally, there is an exhibit dated 8th June, 1914, purporting to be a receipt by the Canadian Agency, Limited, to the Western Canada Mortgage Company for $3,421.96, \"40% of payment due W. S. Eby.\"\nThe questions now to be decided are: (1) whether the cheque for $4,277.45, sent by the Canadian Agency, Limited, to the respondent represents moneys belonging to the Canadian Agency, Limited, in so far as the funds drawn on and the proceeds of the cheques of Evans and the Western Canada Mortgage Company are concerned? Or (2) whether these funds are funds belonging to Cairns, or the Western Canada Mortgage Company, Limited, and Evans personally, and subject, in the hands of the Canadian Agency, Limited, to a trust in favour of the respondent? The judgments rendered by the two courts below amount to an affirmative answer to the second question and to a negative answer to the first question.\nWith all possible respect, and inasmuch as there is no dispute as to the facts, and the only question is with regard to the inference to be drawn therefrom, the judgments of the Alberta courts are open to review\u2014I think the answer should have been in the negative to the second question and in the affirmative to the first. There is certainly no express trust here and, in my opinion, no trust can be implied from the circumstances I have stated above. The letter written by Mr. Evans to the appellant, above quoted, no doubt contained a false statement, but it certainly would shew that Mr. Evans did not treat the cheques of $855.49 and $3,421.96 as having been given to the Canadian Agency, Limited, for a specific purpose or as trust moneys, although the former cheque mentioned that it was for \"share Eby payment due 7th June, 1914.\" Moreover, the instalment of $8,554.90 due to the appellant on that date, was the debt of the Canadian Agency, Limited. The latter had sold an undivided one-half interest in the Eby lands to Cairns, and Cairns had sold one-fifth of his interest to Evans. Whatever Cairns or Evans paid to the Canadian Agency, Limited, on account of these lands was money due by them to this company and not money due by them to Eby or to his assignee, the respondent. Therefore the moneys paid by them to the Canadian Agency, Limited, and represented by these cheques, were moneys belonging to this company and not trust moneys which came into its possession for a specific purpose.\nThe appeal should consequently be allowed with costs throughout, and the respondent's action dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 39 D.L.R. 664; [1918], 1 W.W.R. 972.\n[2] [1900] 1 Ch. 602.\n[3] 8 Ch.D. 744.\n[4] 5 H.L.

Rep. 298), reversed, Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Clement J.[2], and maintaining the plaintiff,s action.\nThe appellant and the respondent entered into an agreement in October, 1915, whereby the respondent was to supply 2,000,000 feet of lumber and load it on cars from its mills for shipment. It was agreed that the respondent was to \"continue shipping regularly.\" Later on, the shipments being slowly made, the appellant wrote the respondent cancelling the contract. The respondent's manager acknowledged receipt of the letter; and going afterwards to the appellant's estab- lishment, he declared to two of appellant's employees, according to evidence accepted by the trial judge, that he could not blame the appellant for cancelling the contract. On the same occasion, the respondent asked the appellant to take nevertheless three carloads of lumber he had on hand, which was agreed to. Some months after, the respondent claimed damages for breach of the contract in the sum of $4,985.\nTilley K.C. for the appellant.\nLafleur K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014In my opinion the contract on which this action was brought was so ambiguously worded that it was almost impossible to determine from its language what the parties really intended and meant to express.\nIn these circumstances we have the right and the duty, as by their subsequent conduct the parties have themselves put a construction upon the contract, to adopt and apply that as the proper construction.\nI think the trial judge has reached the right conclusion that there was a cancellation of the contract by consent of the parties or, to put it in another way, that the cancellation by the appellant was accepted and approved of by the respondent company.\nThe learned trial judge says:\u2014\nI think the matter may be put in either one of two ways: either that what took place was a cancellation by consent or that the plaintiff company is estopped from denying that the cancellation or repudiation by the defendant company was justified. I think myself that at the time both parties were contented to drop the contract and did so by mutual consent.\nThe contract being ambiguous in its terms and a construction having been placed upon it by the conduct and language of the parties, that construction will be accepted by the court as the true one. That con- struction justified the cancellation of the contract and the acceptance by the respondent company of the lumber Murphy's company had on the cars at Gateway was a concession to Murphy made, as the trial judge finds, at his solicitation, after he had expressed himself as being under the circumstances unable to blame the appellant company for cancelling.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored with costs.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014Having regard to the fact that the respondent refused to be bound to a regular shipment of a specific quantity of lumber perday, and that both parties agreed to adopt instead thereof the ambiguous term of \"shipping regularly\" without defining either the length of time over which the contract was to run, or the quantities contained in each shipment so long as shipped in car loads of not less than twenty\u2014five thousand feet in a car, I do not think the appellant was entitled under the circumstances in evidence abruptly to cancel the contract.\nI think the judgment appealed from is right for the reasons assigned by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Gallagher respectively.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I would allow this appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge substantially for the reasons assigned by him and by McPhillips J.A. I incline to think that, having regard to the circumstances known to both parties necessitating punctuality in deliveries, there was such substantial default by the plaintiff as entitled the defendant to cancel the contract between them. But, if not, I am satisfied that the plaintiff's representative, Murphy, believed this to be the defendant's legal right. The trial judge's acceptance of the evidence of Morrow and Griffiths puts that practically beyond question. Counsel for the plaintiff frankly admits his client's urgent need of inducing the defendant to accept the two cars of lumber shipped to it after its notice of cancellation and of obtaining money from it to meet pressing obligations. Moreover, Mr. Murphy expected to dispose more advantageously of the greater part of the lumber which he had contracted to sell to the defendant. Under these circumstances, it seems to me quite probable that he was prepared to, and did in fact, acquiesce in the cancellation of his company's contract by the defendant upon receiving the assurance that it would take and pay for the two cars of lumber then standing on its railway siding. At all events, I am, with respect, convinced that the finding of the trial judge to that effect is so well supported by the evidence that it should not have been set aside. The delay in bringing this action makes it reasonably certain that it was an afterthought.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The first question is concerning the right of the Adolph Lumber Company to cancel the sale of timber which the Meadow Creek Co. had agreed to deliver. It was stipulated in the contract that the vendor would start shipping by the 10th of November, 1915, and would \"continue shipping regularly.\" The vendor started to deliver in due time; but his mill required repairs and he had to stop for a few days to have those repairs made. He had, however, taken the necessary steps to procure the logs from its own lumber limits and from some others and he had shipped six cars, when, on the 30th November, the purchaser, without any previous notice and without inquiry, cancelled the contract on the ground that the vendor had not shipped the quantity contemplated by the agreement.\nThe contract in that respect is somewhat indefinite. When the negotiations took place, the purchaser wanted to stipulate a car a day, but the vendor would not agree to that because his mill was small and had not been in operation for two years, that in cold weather it was impossible to have such a small mill run at its full capacity, that the trains sometimes only ran three times a week and that the cars might not be billed out or picked up for days after they were loaded, all circumstances well known to the purchaser.\nThe lumber, after being sawn at the Meadow Creek Co's. mill at a thickness of two inches, had to be finished at the purchaser's planing mill, which was rather large and which, in order to be run properly, had to be supplied with a much larger quantity than the vendor's saw mill, even running at its full capacity, could supply. The purchaser had then a supply of lumber which came from some other mills but the supply of this became exhausted on the 27th of November. He had been in negotiation with some other saw mill owners in the vicinity to buy from them, but he was unsuccessful; so he was, on the 30th of November, getting short of the quantity of lumber to run his planing mill properly, even if the respondent, had delivered 20,000 feet a day, viz., the whole quantity that his saw mill could cut, because the planing mill of the appellant had a capacity of 50,000 feet a day.\nThe way the Adolph company proceeded in cancelling the contract without giving to the vendor notice of its intention to do so and without making any inquiry as to whether the vendor could fulfil his contract proves to me conclusively that the motive which determined the purchaser to cancel the contract was not due to the insufficient delivery by the vendor but to the fact that he could not get the necessary supply of lumber from other contractors to keep his mill running.\nSuppose there had been a breach on the part of the vendor, it would not be such a breach as would justify the purchaser to rescind. The non-performance goes only to a part of the contract and it must imply a virtual failure of consideration to authorize the rescission.\nThis is a contract providing for delivery at certain intervals. In the event of breach of one of them the general rule is that the remedy must be by action unless the parties expressly agree that breach of a single shipment shall entitle the other party to treat the contract as abandoned or unless the party shews by his acts an intention to no longer be bound by his contract. Freeth v. Burr [3]; Withers v. Reynolds[4]; Simpson v. Crippin[5]; Honck v. Muller[6].\nIn the case of Mersey Steel & Iron Co. v. Naylor[7], Lord Blackburn said that:\u2014\nThe rule of law * * * is that where there is a contract in which there are two parties, each side having to do something * * * if you see that the failure to perform one part of it goes to the root of the contract, goes to the foundation of the whole, it is a good defence to say, \"I am not going to perform my part of it.\"\nIn the present case, there is nothing to shew that it went to the root of the matter and I fail to see how the defendant company could be justified in cancelling the contract, as it has done.\nThe trial judge, who decided in favour of the Adolph Lumber Company, on another ground, stated positively that the cancelling letter was absolutely unjustifiable.\nThe other question at issue is whether the respondent company acquiesced in the cancellation and released the purchaser from any liability arising out of the cancellation.\nThe trial judge has come to the conclusion that the plaintiff company acquiesced. It is true that after the notice of cancellation was received, the manager of the respondent company went to see the appellants to induce them to take delivery of two cars which had been shipped; and later on to obtain payment of the money which was due to him. In his evidence, that manager says that in those interviews the cancellation has not been discussed.\nOn the other hand, the witnesses of the defendant company say that the question of cancellation was taken up and that the manager of the respondent company stated that he could not blame the appellants for cancelling the contract. The trial judge accepts the evidence of the appellant company's witnesses. It is a question of credibility; and in that respect I should concur in the finding of the trial judge who saw the witnesses and could form a better opinion as to their veracity than a Court of Appeal.\nOn this ground I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs throughout.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014That this is a case where there is room for doubt is shewn by the equal division of opinion among the learned judges who have so far dealt with it. The trial judge dismissed the respondent's action and his judgment was reversed by the Court of Appeal with two dissenting judges. While I have not felt entirely free from doubt, I have nevertheless come to the conclusion that the judgment of the learned tria judge should be restored, for I cannot think that under any reasonable construction of the contract the respondent made regular shipments to the appellant.\nIt seems also difficult to hold under all the circumstances of the contracting parties, well known to each other, that this stipulation of regular shipments was not of the essence of the contract, and Mr. Murphy, the respondent's manager, frankly admitted that he was to ship to the appellant the entire cut of his mill, which amounted to 20,000 feet, or substantially one carload, per day. This he lamentably failed to do up to the date of cancellation.\nBut what entirely satisfies me is Murphy's conduct after the cancellation. He acknowledged receipt of the letter of cancellation without a word of complaint, he went to the appellant's establishment and declared to two of the appellant's employees, whose testimony the learned trial judge believed, that he could not blame the appellant for cancelling the contract, but he asked them to take nevertheless three carloads he had on hand, which they agreed to do. Subsequently Murphy went to Fernie to get some money from Mr. Adolph, the appellant's manager, to pay a note, and he does not think that he said anything about the cancellation of the contract, having then, he explains, a deal on with another concern covering a million feet of lumber, and finally, it is only on the 8th of February that his solicitor wrote to the appellant threatening suit. I cannot help thinking that, even if the appellant has not (and I believe it has) made out a case for the exercise of the right of cancellation, it has at least shewn that the respondent fully acquiesced in the can- cellation of the contract. Viewing all the circumstances of the case, I have come to the firm conclusion that the Court of Appeal should not have disturbed the findings of the learned trial judge.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be allowed with costs here and in the court below and the judgment of the trial court restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Herchmer & Martin.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lawe & Fisher.\n[1] 25 B.C.

Ord. c. 43). The mortgage, therefore, as provided in that section, \"ceased to be valid as against the creditors\" of E. G. obtained judgment against E. and caused a writ of execution to be placed in the sheriff's hands against his goods.

Pursuant thereto, the sheriff's officer, after taking an inventory of the goods, left them on the premises in charge of the tenant.\nHeld, Idington and Anglin JJ. dissenting, that the word \"creditors,\" as used in section 17 of the Bills of Sales Ordinance, means all creditors of the mortgagor and not merely the execution creditors.

The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nH. C. Macdonald for the appellant.\nS. B. Woods K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This appeal comes to us by way of appeal per saltum from a judgment of Mr. Justice Ives delivered on the trial of an interpleader issue in which the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Co. was directed to be the plaintiff and the respondent Dearborn defendant for the purpose of testing the validity of a chattel mortgage given on the 29th day of January, 1914, by the Edmonton Gravel Co. Ltd. in favour of the Northern Trust Co., of which chattel mortgage the respondent Dearborn had become assignee.\nOn the 16th day of April, 1917, the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Co. obtained judgment against the Edmonton Gravel Co. in the sum of $7,808 and costs, and on the 4th of May, 1917, a writ of fi.-fa. for the amount of the judgment and costs was placed in the sheriff's hands with instructions to levy the amount thereof on the goods and chattels of the Edmonton Gravel Co.\nOn the 5th of April, 1917, a distress warrant was placed in the hands of the sheriff by the defendant Dearborn as assignee of the mortgage bill of sale from the Edmonton Gravel Co. with instructions to take possession of and sell the goods and chattels set out and assigned in the said mortgage and pursuant thereto the sheriff did actually seize and take possession of the said chattels. A portion of them were actually sold by the sheriff and the remainder held by him subject to the order of the court on the interpleader issue.\nThe learned trial judge held that the facts did not constitute a delivery of possession by the mortgagor, and also held that while he agreed personally with the contention of the plaintiff and the dissenting judgment of Chief Justice Harvey in the case of The Security Trust Co. Ltd. v. Stewart[1], that failure on the part of the mortgagee of the bill of sale or its assignee to file the renewal statement required by the statute\nmade void the mortgage against all creditors and that there was no sufficient justification for qualifying the term \"creditors\"\nin section 17 of the Ordinance respecting the registration of Bills of Sale so as to read \"execution creditors,\" he was nevertheless bound by the judgment of the court in that case and precluded from giving effect to his own opinion.\nIn this appeal the question is squarely raised before this court, which is, of course, not bound by any provincial judgments, whether under the Bills of Sales Ordinance, ch. 43 of the Consolidated Ordinances of the N.W. Territories, the defendant's mortgage, not having been renewed on or before the 18th of January, 1917, as required by section 17 of the Ordinance, had in the words of the Ordinance \"ceased to be valid\" as expressed in section 6 or had become \"absolutely null and void\" as expressed in section 11 against the creditors of the mortgagor, and whether the courts should limit the meaning of the term \"creditors\" in the section to execution creditors only.\nThe Ordinance in question is substantially a copy of the Ontario statute upon the same subject before it was amended by enacting that the word \"creditors\" should not be limited to \"execution creditors\" as it had been by the judgments of the courts of Ontario.\nUpon this question, as to the meaning of the word \"creditors\" in the section as originally enacted by the Ontario Legislature and substantially copied by the Ordinance of the N.W. Territories, there has been a great difference of judicial opinion.\nIn Holmes v. Vancamp[2], Ch. J. Robinson, delivering the judgment of the court, says at p. 515:\u2014\nIt is established clearly that he (Vancamp) was in fact a creditor (of the mortgagor) when this mortgage was given, and when he shews that, he compels us to hold the mortgage void as against him from the first and not merely from the time his judgment was entered.\nIn a case in the Chancery Division of Barker v. Leeson[3], it was held by Chancellor Boyd that\na chattel mortgage which has expired by effluxion of time under R.S.O. ch. 119, sec. 10, and has not been renewed or refiled, ceases to be valid as against all creditors of the mortgagor then existing.\nThe Chancellor, in giving judgment, said at p. 117:\u2014\nThe language of the statute is, that every mortgage shall cease to be valid as against the creditors of the person making the same after the expiration of one year from the filing thereof, unless there be a statement of renewal filed, as provided in the 10th section of the Act: R.S.O. ch. 119. Why should this be read as meaning judgment or execution creditors?\nThe recovery of judgment merely facilitates the proof of the party who is the creditor, but he is as much a creditor before as after judgment. The object of the Act is plainly, by means of registration, to inform everybody that goods apparently in the possession and ownership of A. are not in truth his, but are held by him subject to the claim of B. under a chattel mortgage or bill of sale. The object of the Act is to enforce a visible and actual transfer of possession upon every change of ownership, or to compel the recording of the instruments which manifest the change of property. The intent is, that persons who are about to become the creditors of others by parting with money or money's worth, may, by searches in the public office, obtain information for their guidance; and that the ostensible owners of chattels may not gain fictitious credit on the faith of property which is either encumbered or belongs to other people. By the statute then, where the mortgagee has not renewed his security by refiling at the year's end, and is not in possession of the chattels, his mortgage ceases to be valid against creditors. The case chiefly relied upon by the respondent was that of Parkes v. St. George[4]. There the appeal court held (Patterson J. dissenting) that a creditor who is not in a position to seize or levy on an execution on the property cannot maintain an action to have the instrument declared \"invalid,\" and that holding was, of course, followed in the Ontario courts in a series of decisions until the Act was amended eight years afterwards by declaring that the word \"creditors\" in the statute should not be limited to execution creditors.\nIn the Province of Alberta, in the case of the Security Trust Company Ltd. v. Stewart[5], the court, Harvey C.J. dissenting, followed the Ontario decision of Parkes v. St. George4, and limited the word \"creditors\" in the Act to\nsuch as were either execution or attaching creditors.\nI agree fully with the dissenting Chief Justice Harvey in his statement[6], that he could see\nno sufficient reason for concluding that when the legislature said that a mortgage would cease to be valid as against the creditors of the mortgagor, it meant anything different from what it said. To prefix the word \"execution\" before the word \"creditors\" would be a perfectly legitimate amendment but it is only the legislature that has the right to make such amendment.\nSee also judgment of Walsh J. in Graf v. Lingerell[7].\nThe same question came before this court in the case of Clarkson v. McMaster[8]. Chief Justice Strong, in his judgment, referring to the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Parkes v. St. George, above referred to4, and the cases which followed it, said at p. 100:\u2014\nIf it were necessary now to determine whether this construction was or was not correct I am compelled to say, with great respect for the opinions referred to, that I should find great difficulty in agreeing with these decisions. First, I see no reason why the words creditors should be restricted to a particular class of creditors, viz., judgment creditors. Why should the same word receive a different construction in this Act from that which it has received as used in the statute of the 13th Elizabeth? I see no reason for any such distinction. It is true that equitable execution as consequential on the avoidance of a transaction under the 13th Elizabeth could not, under the old system of separate jurisdictions for law and equity, have been obtained by any but judgment creditors, but the deed was nevertheless held to be void as against simple contract creditors.\nAnd again at p. 101:\u2014\nThen, there are reasons which, in my opinion, require a liberal construction of the word \"creditors,\" derived from the manifest policy of the \"Chattel Mortgage Act.\" Registration or possession were required manifestly for the protection, not only of actual creditors, but of those who might become creditors, relying on the visible possession of property by their debtor, and the absence from the appropriate registry of any charge upon that property; and this for the protection of those who had not had the opportunity of recovering judgment, creditors payment of whose claims might be deferred, or who had not had time to get judgment.\nI have no hesitation myself in putting the construction upon the section of the Ontario Legislature, from which the Ordinance was substantially copied, adopted by Chief Justice Robinson in Holmes v. Vancamp[9], Chancellor Boyd in Barker v. Leeson[10], and Patterson J. in Parkes v. St. George[11], and also by Chief Justice Strong in Clarkson v. McMaster[12], and, upon the N.W. Ordinance which is a substantial copy of the Ontario enactment, by Chief Justice Harvey, dissenting in the Appeal Court and Simonds J., the trial judge, in Security Trust Company v. Stewart[13], and by Walsh J. in Graf v. Lingerell[14], on the N.W. Ordinance before us.\nI cannot admit the right of the courts where the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous to practically amend such statute either by eliminating words or inserting limiting words unless the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words as enacted leads to some absurdity or some repugnance or inconsistency with the rest of the enactment, and in those cases only to the extent of avoiding that absurdity, repugnance and inconsistency.\nI think the word \"creditors\" as used in this Ordinance means just what it says and embraces all creditors and not merely execution creditors. Such a construction has in scores of cases in the English and in our courts been put upon the same word \"creditors\" in the Statute of Elizabeth.\nI think the object and purpose of the legislation being construed was to compel either registration of a mortgage or other bill of sale from the owner in possession of the chattels to a mortgagee or the visible and actual transfer and possession of the chattels to him so that persons might not be entrapped or misled into advancing moneys or credits to others in ostensible possession of chattels and goods under the belief that they were the owners of the goods. It was intended to prevent the ostensible owner of goods from obtaining undeserved credit on the faith of his being the real owner of property which was either encumbered by secret bills of sale or belonged to other people. It does not require an actual change in the ostensible possession of property but it does require, if there is no such change of possession, that the security taken upon the property should be recorded in a public office; and it further requires that from time to time, as specified in the Act, such security should be renewed on the registry so as to conform with the actual existing facts. These requirements were not enacted surely for the benefit of execution creditors merely. They were so enacted for the benefit and protection of all who were or might become creditors before there was an open, visible change of actual possession of the goods and chattels or a registration in a public office of a mortgage of such goods. It comes down to this, that either registration and renewal or actual transfer of possession were required for the protection as well of existing as for future creditors who might rely upon such possession and the non-registration or non-renewal of charges in the proper registry.\nBeing a remedial statute to prevent fraud and protect honest dealers it should rather be construed, if its language is doubtful, liberally and to advance the object the legislature clearly had in view.\nFor these and other reasons I will not stop to enlarge upon, I would allow the appeal and direct judgment as prayed for in the statement of claim.\nIf a majority of the court does not agree with my construction I would still allow the appeal upon the second ground that the plaintiffs appellants having become execution creditors, and the goods not having been sold when the execution was placed in the hands of the sheriff, they were still held under the mortgage which had become invalid as against the plaintiffs as execution creditors and that as such these latter had priority over the claimant under the void chattel mortgage.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014I agree with the construction adopted herein by the court below, of the Bills of Sale Ordinance Act in question. Even if I had grave doubts (which I never had) of the correctness of that construction having been well founded, when adopted long ago by the courts of Ontario in applying the Act from which that now in question seems to have been copied, I should not feel at liberty at this late day to upset all that which now rests upon the adoption of such construction, supposed to have been settled so long ago.\nThere have been many interesting questions suggested in the course of the argument which, when connected with charges of fraud, might be well worth considering, but raises nothing herein when such charges are not made. Therefore I pass no opinion but upon the single point raised and dealt with above.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The defendant having failed to renew the registration of his chattel mortgage on or before the 18th January, 1917, as required by section 17 of the Bills of Sales Ordinance (Con. Ord. N.W.T., ch. 43), it \"ceased to be valid as against the creditors\" of the mortgagor. The plaintiff, the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Co., was then a simple contract creditor of the mortgagor. It became an execution creditor on the 4th of May, 1917. Meantime, on the 5th of April, the defendant had caused what he asserts was a seizure to be made of the goods covered by his chattel mortgage and they were, formally at least, still under such seizure when the plaintiff company's execution was lodged with the sheriff on the 4th of May and when he was directed, on the 19th of October, to hold the chattels or proceeds of the sale thereof to meet it.\nUpon these facts, Ives J. following, as he was bound to do, the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta in Security Trusts Co. Ltd. v. Stewart[15], (although he expressed his personal preference for the dissenting opinion of Harvey C.J.), dismissed the plaintiffs' claim to have the chattel mortgage declared void as against them and for pay- ment over to them of the proceeds of the sale of the goods in question (made without prejudice under an arrangement with the parties) by the sheriff in whose hands they are. From that judgment the plaintiffs appeal to this court\u2014per saltum by consent.\nThe appeal rests on two distinct grounds: [16] that the word \"creditors,\" in section 17 of the Bills of Sales Ordinance, means all or any creditors of the mortgagor and not merely \"execution creditors,\" as was held by the Appellate Division in the Stewart Case[17], that the goods being only under seizure and not yet sold when the first execution was placed in the sheriff's hands, they were still held under the mortgage, which had become invalid as against the plaintiffs, if not before, at least immediately upon their attaining the status of execution creditors, and that as execution creditors they acquired a right to have the goods in question seized and disposed of for their benefit superior to that of the defendant as chattel mortgagee.\nOn the first point, notwithstanding Mr. Macdonald's very able argument and the powerful judgment of the late Chief Justice Strong in Clarkson v. McMaster (2), by which he supported it, I am of the opinion that the word \"creditors\" in the Bills of Sales Ordinance has been properly held to mean execution creditors\u2014creditors whose claims are in such a form as gives them a lien on the property and entitles them to seize it\u2014creditors having rights in respect of the goods to the exercise of which the security to be avoided would, if valid, present an obstacle. The judgments in Parkes v. St. George[18], have convinced me that the legislature cannot have meant to give a simple contract creditor what would be tantamount to execution before judgment. It would be useless at the suit of such a creditor to set aside a mortgage which (subject to the statute against fraudulent preferences) could be at once replaced (no creditor having acquired a right to seize the goods covered by it and no subsequent purchaser or mortgagee having intervened) unless such goods should be held to meet the suitor's claim when he should have recovered judgment against his debtor. On this branch of the case, however, I merely desire respectfully to express my concurrence in the judgment in Parkes v. St. George[19], and the numerous decisions which have followed it.\nBut upon the other aspect of the case, I think the appellants are entitled to succeed on the ground on which Heaton v. Flood[20], was decided in favour of the execution creditor. I express no decided opinion upon the question whether there must be what is tantamount to \"a delivery or new transfer by the mortgagor\" to render the taking of possession effectual to cure the defect in the mortgagee's title due to non-compliance with the requirements of the statute. The mortgagee certainly took such possession as he obtained by virtue of his mortgage upon a suggestion that a seizure by him under it would \"cure the defect\" due to its nonrenewal. He continued to hold solely under whatever right the defective mortgage gave him\u2014a right good as against the mortgagor but which had \"ceased to be valid\" as against his execution creditors. There had been no sale of the goods such as was held in Meriden Co. v. Braden[21], and Cookson v. Swire[22], to vest in the purchaser a title not dependent on the continued subsistence of the chattel mortgage and good as against the subsequent execution creditor. There was nothing which amounted, or was equivalent, to a delivery or new transfer by the mortgagor\u2014nothing which took the transaction out of the Bills of Sale Ordinance (Smith v. Fair[23]), per Patterson J.A., if an act of the mortgagor tantamount to delivery was requisite. The view that \"the remedial effect of possession depends upon the act of the mortgagor\" was taken at an early date in a case arising under the Bills of Sale Ordinance now under consideration by Wetmore J., Adams v. Hutchings[24].\nBut whether this view be or be not correct the evidence, in my opinion, to quote the language of Meredith C.J. in Heaton v. Flood,[25] does not\nestablish any change of possession, or anything more than a mere formal delivery\nto the sheriffs officer as the mortgagee's bailiff,\nwithout any real change of the possession being intended or effected.\nThe apparent possession continued as before. The goods covered by the chattel mortgage were found by the sheriff's officer lying in or about a barn on a tenanted farm. After taking an inventory the officer left them on the place just as he found them in charge of the tenant, without pay, merely with instructions to \"see that nobody took the stuff.\" In my opinion, even in the absence of a statutory provision expressly prescribing that the change of possession be open and reasonably sufficient to afford public notice thereof (Hogaboom v. Graydon[26]), what took place did not constitute the \"actual and continued change of possession\" requisite to dispense with a mortgage duly registered in conformity with the Bills of Sales Ordinance, and only such possession would enable the mortgagee to hold as against execution creditors of the mortgagor. Scribner v. Kinlock[27], per Patterson J.A. at p. 378 and per Rose J. at p. 380. Heaton v. Flood[28]; Steele v. Benham[29]. To hold otherwise would open the door to the very mischief against which the statute was designed to guard.\nI would allow the appeal of the execution creditors and direct judgment in their favour in accordance with the prayer of the statement of claim.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The main question in this case is as to whether a chattel mortgage which has not been renewed is good against ordinary creditors of the mortgagor. The section we have to construe is section 17 of the Bills of Sales Ordinance, ch. 43, which enacted that every chattel mortgage has to be renewed within two years of the filing, under penalty that in default the mortgage\nshall cease to be valid as against the creditors of the persons making the same and against subsequent purchasers or mortgagees in good faith for valuable consideration.\nThat section has been the law of the North West Territories since 1881. That legislation had evidently been adopted from the legislation then in force in Ontario because the Ordinance of 1881 copies almost word for word the statute which was then in force in Ontario.\nIt is contended by the respondent that the word creditors in that section means the execution creditors. The appellant, on the other hand, contends that the word creditors should be construed literally as applying to all the creditors, including the ordinary creditors.\nWe find in the Statute 13 Elizabeth that the name creditors is there mentioned in connection with the right to set aside fraudulent or preferential assignment. That word was construed in different cases in England, which are to be found in May on Fraudulent Conveyances, 3rd ed., p. 102; and I may in that respect quote the case of Reese River Silver Mining Co. v. Atwell[30], where it was held by Lord Romilly M.R. that simple contract creditors are entitled to a decree declaring a deed void under the Statute of Elizabeth, though not having obtained the judgment at law.\nIn 1881, in Ontario, in the same year in which the Ordinance was passed in the North West Territories, Chancellor Boyd, in the case of Barker v. Leeson[31], being palled upon to construe exactly the same section as the one passed in the North West Territories decided that the word creditors in that section could not be restricted to execution creditors but should apply to all creditors.\nThen the Council of the North West Territories, in passing that legislation and in adopting the word creditors, is supposed to have used the word according to the construction which it had received in England and was receiving in the Province of Ontario.\nThree years later, in Ontario, was decided the case of Parkes v. St. George[32] where the Court of Appeal held that a creditor, who is not in a position to seize or lay an execution on a property cannot maintain an action to have the chattel mortgage declared invalid.\nThat decision of the Court of Appeal of Ontario seems to have been followed in that province until 1892, when the law was changed.\nIn 1895, the question came up before this court in the case of Clarkson v. McMaster[33], and there the Chief Justice, Sir Henry Strong, said that he could not agree with the opinions expressed in the case of Parkes v. St. George[34] I will quote his words:\u2014\nI see no reason why the word creditors should be restricted to a particular class of creditors, viz., judgment creditors.\nAnd he goes on:\u2014\nRegistration or possession are required manifestly for the protection not only of actual creditors but of those who might become creditors relying on the visible possession of property by their debtor and the absence from the appropriate registry of any charge upon that property.\nIn the Province of Alberta from which the present appeal comes there seems to have been a great divergence of opinion among the judges of that province. It seems to me that the case of Parkes v. St. Georg34, has been decided on account of the peculiar expressions used in the English \"Bills of Sale Act,\" which speaks of execution creditors. Chief Justice Hagarty, in rendering the judgment in the case of Parkes v. St. George34, says:\u2014\nIt is significant that with the extreme care manifested in these Acts (the English \"Bills of Sales Acts\") to avoid secret or fraudulent assignments of chattels, they should have carefully limited their operation to creditors having executions. I cannot believe our legislature ever contemplated applying the remedy of registration to the case of every person having a claim or account against the mortgagor at the date of the instrument.\nIt is pretty clear that the Ontario \"Bills of Sales Act\" was taken from the English Act. But if the Ontario Legislature has found it advisable to use the word creditor as it was used in the Statute of Elizabeth, it seems to me that the change was made intentionally on the part of the legislature and that it meant to give to the creditors the same rights as they had under the Statute of Elizabeth.\nThe Court of Appeal of Alberta came to the conclusion that they should follow the decision of Parkes v. St. George34. With a great deal of deference I hold the contrary view. It seems to me that the word creditors should be construed as applying to all creditors.\nThe appeal, then, should be allowed with costs of this court and of the courts below.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014Two questions are submitted by the appellant:\u2014\n1. By virtue of section 17 of the Bills of Sales Ordinance, being ch. 43 of the Consolidated Ordinances of the North West Territories, the respondent having failed to file a renewal statement within thirty days' next preceding the 18th of January, 1917, its chattel mortgage ceased to be valid as against the creditors of the mortgagor and the appellant was such a creditor.\n2. This failure to file a renewal statement has not been cured by the seizure made by the respondent on the 5th April, 1917, of the goods covered by the chattel mortgage, which was not such a taking possession of the mortgaged goods as could cure the omission to file the statutory renewal.\nFirst question\u2014The answer to this question depends on the construction of the word \" creditors\" in sections 11, 17 and 19 of the Ordinance, the appellant contending that it means creditors generally, the respondent claiming that it only applies to execution creditors, to the exclusion of mere contract creditors.\nIn this case the appellant became an execution creditor only on the 4th May, 1917, subsequent to the seizure made by the respondent on the 5th April.\nAs briefly as they can be stated, the provisions of the Bills of Sales Ordinance, with regard to the registration and renewal of registration of chattel mortgages, are as follows:\u2014\nSection 6 requires the registration, within thirty days from its execution, of every mortgage or conveyance of goods and chattels which is not accompanied by an immediate delivery and an actual and continued change of possession of the things mortgaged.\nBy section 11 it is provided that if such mortgage or conveyance is not so registered, it shall be\nabsolutely null and void as against creditors of the mortgagor and against subsequent purchasers or mortgagees in good faith for valuable consideration.\nSection 17 states that\nevery mortgage filed in pursuance of this Ordinance shall cease to be valid as against the creditors of the persons making the same and against subsequent purchasers or mortgagees in good faith for valuable consideration after the expiration of two years from the filing thereof unless, within thirty days next preceding the expiration of the said term of two years, a statement exhibiting the interest of the mortgagee, his executors, administrators or assigns in the property claimed by virtue thereof and a full statement of the amount still due for principal and interest thereon, and of all payments made on account thereof, is filed in the office of the registration clerk of the district where the property is then situate * * *\nFinally section 19 directs that another statement in accordance with the provisions of section 17 shall be filed in the office of the registration clerk of the district where the property is then situate within thirty days next preceding the expiration of the term of one year from the day of the filing of the statement required by section 17,\nand in default thereof such mortgage shall cease to be valid as against the creditors of the person making the same and as against purchasers and mortgagees in good faith for valuable consideration, and so on from year to year, that is to say, another statement as aforesaid duly verified shall be filed within thirty days next preceding the expiration of one year from the filing of the former statement, and in default thereof such mortgage shall cease to be valid as aforesaid.\nThis Ordinance was adopted in 1881, and was substantially copied from the Ontario Act, R.S.O. 1877, ch. 119, which also stated (section 4) that chattel mortgages not registered would be\nabsolutely null and void as against creditors of the mortgagor, and against subsequent purchasers or mortgagees in good faith for valuable consideration. Section 11 of the Ontario Act provided that\nevery mortgage, or a copy thereof, filed in pursuance of this Act, shall cease to be valid as against the creditors of the persons making the same and against subsequent purchasers and mortgagees in good faith for valuable consideration, after the expiration of one year from the filing thereof,\nunless within thirty days next preceding the expiration of the said term of one year a statement exhibiting the interest of the mortgagee is again filed in the office of the clerk of the County Court.\nThe English \"Bills of Sale Act,\" 1878, 41-42 Vict, ch. 31, also required the registration of bills of sale, failing which\nsuch bill of sale, as against all trustees or assignees of the estate of the person whose chattels, or any of them, are comprised in such bill of sale under the law relating to bankruptcy or liquidation, or under any assignment for the benefit of the creditors of such person, and also as against all sheriffs, officers or other persons seizing any chattels comprised in such bill of sale, in the execution of any process of any court authorizing the seizure of the chattels of the person by whom or of whose chattels such bill has been made, and also as against every person on whose behalf such process shall have been issued, shall be deemed fraudulent and void as regards the property in or right to the possession of any chattels comprised in such bill of sale.\nIt is perfectly clear that decisions under the English \"Bills of Sale Act\" cannot be taken as a guide for the construction of the Canadian statutes. In drafting the latter statutes the legislature has departed from the carefully guarded language of the English Act, and that, it seems to me, cannot have been done with any other idea than of giving to the Canadian statutes a wider application than the English Act.\nIn Parkes v. St. George[35], decided in 1884, the Ontario Court of Appeal, Hagarty C.J., Burton, Patterson and Osier JJ. held, Patterson J. dissenting, that a judgment or execution creditor is entitled to impeach a chattel mortgage on the ground of an irregularity or informality in the execution of the document, or by reason of its non-compliance with the provisions of the \"Chattel Mortgage Act\" (R.S.O. ch. 119), but that a creditor who is not in a position to seize or lay on an execution on the property, cannot maintain an action to have the instrument declared invalid, and that a creditor in that position can only maintain such a proceeding where the security is impeached on the ground of fraud.\nIn 1892, the Ontario Act respecting mortgages and sales of personal property was amended by 55 Vict. ch. 26, and it was enacted (section 2) that in the application of the said Act the words,\nvoid as against creditors shall extend to simple contract creditors of the mortgagor or bargainor suing on behalf of themselves and other creditors * * * as well as to creditors having executions against the goods and chattels of the mortgagor or bargainor in the hands of the sheriff or other officer.\nReferring now more specially to Parkes v. St. George[36], which was followed by the Alberta Court of Appeal in the Security Trust Co. v. Stewart[37], Chief Justice Harvey dissenting, doubts as to its correctness where expressed by so eminent a jurist as Chief Justice Sir Henry Strong in Clarkson v. McMaster[38]. Before Parkes v. St. George (1) Chief Justice Sir John Beverley Robinson, dealing with the statute then in force, had expressed a contrary opinion in Holmes v. Vancamp[39], and Chancellor Boyd in Barker v. Leeson[40], had decided that a chattel mortgage, registration of which had not been renewed, ceased to be valid as against all creditors of the mortgagor then existing.\nMr. Woods, for the respondent, referred us to the dictum of Lord Atkinson as to the construction of statutes in Banbury v. Bank of Montreal[41], where the noble Lord said, at p. 691:\u2014 The question then is, does this section (section 6) of Lord Tenter-ton's Act apply to innocent representation? No doubt the words of the section are general. On its face it applies to every representation, innocent or fraudulent; but one cannot construe these words, general in character though they be, without having regard to the circumstances in reference to which they were used, and to the object appearing from the statute which the legislature had in view in using them. Lord Coke, in a well-known passage in Heydon's Case[42], lays it down that to get at the scope and object of an Act one should consider: (1) What the law was before it was passed; (2) what was the mischief or defect for which the law had not provided; (3) what remedy parliament has appointed; (4) the reason for the remedy. In Hawkins v. Gathercole[43], Turner L.J. said that \"in construing Acts of Parliament the words which are used are not alone to be regarded.\" He then quotes with approval and adopts a passage from the judgment in Stradling v. Morgan [44]. This statement of the law was by Turner L.J. stated to be the best he knew of. It has been approved of by Lord Hatherley in Garnett v. Bradley [45], by Lord Selborne in Bradlaugh v. Clarke[46], and by Lord Halsbury in Eastman Photographic Materials Co. v. Comptroller-General of Patents, Designs and Trade Marks[47]. The passage from Plowden is so applicable to the present case and, approved of as it has been, is so authoritative that one may be excused for quoting it at length. It runs thus: \"The judges of the law in all times past have so far pursued the intent of the makers of statutes that they have expounded Acts which were general in words to be but particular where the interest was particular,\" and after referring to several instances proceeds: \"From which cases it appears that the sages of the law heretofore have construed statutes quite contrary to the letter in some appearance, and those statutes which comprehend all things in the letter, they have expounded to extend but to some things, and those which generally prohibit all people from doing such an act, they have interpreted to permit some people to do it, and those which include every person in the letter they have adjudged to reach to some persons only, which expositions have always been founded upon the intent of the legislature, which they have collected sometimes by considering the cause and necessity of making the Act, sometimes by comparing one part of the Act with another, and sometimes by foreign (i.e., extraneous) circumstances. So that they have ever been guided by the intent of the legislature, which they have always taken according to the necessity of the matter, and according to that which is consonant to reason and good discretion.\"\nThere is no doubt that, apart from the authority due to this exposition of the law governing the con- struction of statutes, the duty of courts is to have regard, in construing general terms,\nto the circumstances in reference to which they were used and to the object appearing from the statute which the legislature had in view in using them.\nBut I can discover in this Ordinance no indication that the intention of the legislature was not to use the words \"creditors of the mortgagor\" in their general sense. The statute provided for the establishment of registration districts and for the registration of mortgages and conveyances intending to operate as a mortgage of goods and chattels. The object of the statute was without doubt to secure the due publicity of these mortgages and conveyances, and this publicity was required for the protection of third parties dealing ill good faith with a person in actual possession of goods and chattels, for registration was required in the case of\nevery mortgage or conveyance intending to operate as a mortgage of goods and chattels which is not accompanied by an immediate delivery and an actual and continued change of possession of the things mortgaged.\nWhen, therefore, the statute says that in default of registration or the filing of a statement of the interest of the mortgagee, the mortgage shall be absolutely null and void, or shall cease to be valid, as against the creditors of the mortgagor and subsequent purchasers or mortgagees in good faith for valuable security, I cannot think that the word \"creditors\" should be cut down by construction so as to read in the statute the qualification that these creditors must be judgment or execution creditors. The evil or mischief which the legislature unquestionably desired to remedy was the possibility of a debtor making secret conveyances or mortgages of his goods and chattels not accompanied by an immediate delivery and actual change of posses- sion. That such secret conveyances or mortgages would be prejudicial to creditors generally, who have given credit to the mortgagor on the faith of his possession of ample goods and chattels, as well as to judgment or execution creditors who have obtained a lien on his goods, cannot be doubted, and the intention was to remedy this evil and to give to registration the same effect as an actual delivery and change of possession, both serving as a notice to third parties from whom the owner of the goods and chattels might seek to obtain credit or who might obtain a lien on his property.\nI think that the Ontario statute passed in 1892, eight years after Parkes v. St. George (1) was decided, expressly declaring that the word \"creditors\" shall extend to simple contract creditors of the mortgagor or bargainor suing on behalf of themselves, as well as to creditors having executions against the goods and chattels of the mortgagor or bargainor, shews that at least in Ontario, where this legislation was first enacted, the intention was not that the word \"creditors\" should be restricted to execution creditors. And notwithstanding the great respect which I have for the decision in Parkes v. St. George[48], and the reluctance which I naturally feel to dispute its authority, I cannot, now that the question is raised before this court, do otherwise than express the opinion that the appellant, although a contract creditor, was such a creditor as was in the contemplation of the sections of the Ordinance above cited. For that reason, I think, with deference, that the decision of the Alberta Court of Appeal in Security Trust Company Ltd. v. Stewart[49], should be overruled. I, therefore, have come to the conclusion on this first question that the respondent's chattel mortgage ceased to be valid as against the appellant, no renewal statement having been filed as required by the Ordinance.\nSecond question.\u2014I here express my entire concurrence with what my brother Anglin has said on this branch of the case, and I am of the opinion that there was not, by means of the proceedings under the seizure made by the respondent on the 5th April, 1917, such a taking of possession of the mortgaged goods as would dispense with compliance with the requirements of the statute as to registration or renewal thereof.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be allowed with costs throughout, and judgment should be rendered in accordance with the appellants' demand.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 12 Alta.

Idington J. dissenting.\nPer Idington J. dissenting\u2014The only charge a judgment creditor gets by virtue of his judgment is upon such interest as the debtor may have at the time of registration or issue of execution; and in this case, that is subject to whatever rights the mortgagee may have acquired by virtue of its mortgage.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (43 D.L.R. 14; [1918] 3 W.W.R. 551), affirmed, Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Clement J.[2], and dismissing the plaintiffs action.\nThe appellant held a mortgage, upon certain lands, executed by Harper between the 10th and the 16th of March, 1916, and registered in the Land Registry Office on an application dated the 12th of July, 1916. The respondents were the holders of a judgment against Harper, which was duly registered on an application made on some date between the 16th of March and the 12th of July, 1916. The question in issue is which of these charges is entitled to priority.\nW.C. Brown for the appellant.\nG. E. Housser for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I think the judgment appealed from correctly interprets the meaning of section 73 of the \"Land Registry Act\" of British Columbia on which this appeal depends. That section gives priority to charges according to date of their registration, not of their execution. As put by Mr. Justice Martin, could there possibly be any doubt as to the meaning and effect of that section in a dispute between two charges of the same kind, e.g., mortgages, or as to the priority that ought to be declared between them? I think not, and am unable to see how a contrary conclusion could be reached as to charges of a different kind.\nI agree with the Chief Justice that the cases relied upon by Mr. Justice McPhillips, Entwisle v. Lenz[3], and Jellett v. Wilkie[4], do not govern or apply to the case before us, which is simply one as to the priority of charges under section 73 of the \"Land Registry Act\" and the rule which should govern in a contest on that point and is not one as between an equitable right to the fee as against a charge.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The decision of the courts below, that by prior registration a judgment creditor destroys, as against him an existent though unregistered mortgage, is supported by a rather plausible way of putting forward the alleged premises and drawing the conclusion reached.\nNevertheless, I think the premises are not well founded. The only charge a judgment creditor gets by virtue of his judgment is upon such interest as the debtor may have at the time of registration or issue of execution.\nIn this case that is subject to whatever rights the mortgagee may have acquired by virtue of its mortgage.\nSuppose I see fit to charge one-half of my interest in any land with a burden of some sort, and then give another charge expressly subject thereto, could priority in registration of the latter give its holder any advantage over the former? No one, I venture to think, would say it could. Yet when we have regard to the language of the last part of section 27 of the \"Execution Act,\" par. 1, defining what is acquired by registration of a judgment, the lien or charge created thereby on the lands of the judgment debtor is expressly declared to operate\nin the same manner as if charged in writing by the judgment debtor under his hand and seal; and after the registering of such judgment the judgment creditor may, if he wish to do so, forthwith proceed upon the lien and charge thereby created.\nSurely that means only such interest in any lands as the judgment debtor has and no more.\nBecause the words \"lands of a judgment debtor\" are used they cannot be held to mean the entire fee in same, but only the interest he may happen to have therein.\nThis is not only in accord with common sense, and the law as it stood before the enactment of these registration provisions, but is in accord also with the provisions in sub-sec. (b) of sec. 137 of the \"Land Registry Act,\" which reads as follows:\u2014\nNo judgment shall form a lien upon any lands as against a registered owner thereof, or the holder of a registered charge thereon, where the registration of such person as owner or as holder of a charge has been effected after a notice, of not less than fourteen days, has been given by the registrar to the judgment creditor, either personally or at his registered address, of the registrar's intention to effect registration of the aforesaid fee or charge free of such judgment. If the judgment creditor claims a lien upon the said lands by virtue of his judgment he shall within the time fixed by the registrar's notice, register a certificate of lis pendens in accordance with section 34 of the \"Execution Act,\" otherwise the registrar may register such fee or charge free from such judgment.\nAs I read this, it makes a clear provision for the adjustment of the priority of the respective rights of the judgment creditor and the holder of another charge.\nIf the judgments below are to be taken literally surely there never was any need for the adjustment thus provided for.\nAgain, section 104 of the \"Land Registry Act\" reads as follows:\u2014\nNo instrument executed and taking effect after the 30th day of June, 1905, and no instrument executed before the first day of July, 1905, to take effect after the 13th day of June, 1905, purporting to transfer, charge, deal with or affect land or any estate or interest therein (except a leasehold interest in possession for a term not exceeding three years), shall pass any estate or interest, either at law or in equity, in such land until the same shall be registered in compliance with the provisions of this Act; but such instrument shall confer on the person benefitted thereby, and on those claiming through or under him, whether by descent, purchase or otherwise, the right to apply to have the same registered. The provisions of this section shall not apply to assignments of judgments.\nWhat does this section mean? Respondents urge that it means a good deal more than it says. For we must read the whole and not drop the last few lines as giving nothing. Whilst by the drastic language of the first part of the section every right of a vendor or chargee seems swept away, clearly the last few lines give a right to have something registered. The right thus given clearly cuts down or renders liable to be so, the judgment creditor's right by rendering it subject to the possibility of the registration by vendee or chargee or those claiming under him of any instrument which is designed to convey or charge the land.\nThat is the right of the appellant and the mode of enforcing it was supplied by section 137 of the \"Land Registry Act,\" as well as what is indicated herein.\nMy only difficulty in this case is whether or not the appellant lost its opportunity by the registration it made of its mortgage in July, 1916, six months before bringing this action for prosecuting the specific remedy given by these sections. And my difficulty has not been helped much by what I respectfully submit are the extreme views taken by the court below depending entirely upon a construction of section 73 of the \"Land Registry Act\" with which I cannot agree.\nThe dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice McPhillips failing to observe the effect I find in said sections, or indeed to notice them at all, further increases my difficulties. Such omission suggests there may be something else in the Acts in question which counteracts said effect or prevents reliance upon said sections at all under the peculiar circumstances of the appellant's registration of its mortgage.\nHowever, I have been unable to discover anything else than such registration by appellant.\nIt seems to me that act was done in error by the appellant; that it has not misled any one; that nothing has been done by anyone concerned in reliance thereon, and that under the authority of Howard v. Miller[5], the mistake may be rectified, and that being possible the rights of the parties hereto may be declared as if nothing had happened. We were told in that case when before us that there could be no rectification unless for fraud. I was not then of those who accepted that doctrine and, seeing the court above has discarded it, am less inclined to act upon it.\nThe principles therein involved and applicable to the peculiar circumstances there in question are somewhat analogous, but the actual decision helps herein no further than holding it possible to rectify an error when no countervailing equity intervenes.\nThe findings of fact, so far as they go, do not suggest any other difficulty. In the Howard Case[6] there was an error not only on the part of the party applying for registration but also the registrar or someone in his office. Here the mistake seems wholly the appellant's own. Though otherwise alleged in the declaration I can find no proof bearing out the allegations in that regard.\nI am of opinion the appeal should be allowed and the appellant held entitled to a declaration as prayed.\nIt is not a case for costs, and the error of appellant being the primary cause of the litigation the fee of five dollars fixed by the statute would have been payable to respondent if the right proceeding had been taken.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Section 27 of the \"Execution Act\" provides that upon registration a judgment shall form a lien or charge on land of the debtor\nin the same manner as if charged in writing by the judgment debtor under his hand and seal.\nUnder section 2 of the \"Land Registry Act\" a \"charge\" includes a judgment. Amendments to the \"Land Registry Act\" made by ch. 43, sec. 3, of the statutes of 1914, read as follows:\u2014 \"Mortgage\" means and includes any charge on land created for securing a debt or lien, or any hypothecation of such charge;\n\"Mortgagee\" means the owner of a mortgage registered under this Act;\n\"Mortgagor\" means and includes the owner of land or of an estate or interest in land pledged as security for a debt.\nSection 73 of the same Act provides that:\u2014\nWhen two or more charges appear entered upon the register affecting the same land, the charges shall, as between themselves, have priority according to the date at which the applications respectively were made, and not according to the dates of the creation of the estates or interests.\nThe respondent's judgment was registered before the appellant's mortgage. Indeed, although the appellant's mortgage was executed before the registration of the respondent's judgment, the certificate of acknowledgement or proof required by section 77 of the \"Land Registry Act\" to obtain registration was procured only some three months after the registration of the judgment. The appellant, therefore, became entitled to apply for registration of its mortgage only after the respondent's judgment had become a charge on the land by registration.\nSection 104 of the \"Land Registry Act\" reads as follows:\u2014\nNo instrument executed and taking effect after the thirtieth day of June, 1905, and no instrument executed before the first day of July, 1905, to take effect after the said thirtieth day of June, 1905, purporting to transfer, charge, deal with or affect land or any estate or interest therein (except a leasehold interest in possession for a term not exceeding three years), shall pass any estate or interest, either at law or in equity, in such land until the same shall be registered in compliance with the provisions of this Act; but such instrument shall confer on the person benefitted thereby, and on those claiming through or under him, whether by descent, purchase or otherwise, the right to apply to have the same registered. The provisions of this section shall not apply to assignments of judgments. 1906, ch. 23, sec. 74; 1908, ch. 29, sec. 6.\nBy section 2, \"instrument\" includes any document dealing with or affecting land.\nNotwithstanding the very plain and explicit language of section 104 (formerly section 74 of the Act of 1906), the Supreme Court of British Columbia en banc, reversing Martin J., held in Entwisle v. Lenz[7], that a prior unregistered deed has priority over a registered judgment, I agree with Martin J. that this decision is logically irreconcilable with the judgment now under review. Only because the legislature has re-enacted section 74 in ipsissimis verbis in the revision of 1911 as section 104, and because we are here dealing not with a deed or transfer but with a mortgage or charge, do I hesitate to hold that Entwistle v. Lenz[8], should be overruled, unless, indeed, it can be distinguished on the ground that the transfer in that case was actually deposited for registration but owing to a mistake in the description was not recorded against the debtor's land. When a statute declares that an instrument\nshall (not) pass any estate or interest either at law or in equity\nuntil registered, the reasoning by which the conclusion is reached that the transferor in an unregistered deed to which that statute applies is nevertheless merely a dry legal trustee and that he retains no estate or interest, but that the entire beneficial interest is vested in the transferee, is, I confess, quite too subtle for me to follow.\nBut the case now before us may, I think, be disposed of under section 27 of the \"Execution Act\" and section 73 of the \"Land Registry Act\" without actually overruling Entwistle v. Lenz[9], by merely declining to apply it to facts not absolutely identical with those there dealt with. Even if some estate or interest was created in the debtor's land by the appellant's unregistered mortgage upon its execution, as against another chargee who had registered his charge before that mortgage was registered, the interest or estate so created could not avail. Section 73 in terms so provides, unless it be entirely meaningless. As Mr. Justice Martin says:\u2014\nIf this were a case between two \"charges\" of the same kind, e.g. mortgages, would there be any doubt as to the \"priority\" that ought to be declared?\nBut by section 27 of the \"Execution Act\" the lien created by a judgment when registered is the same as if such judgment had been\ncharged in writing by the judgment debtor under his hand and seal,\ni.e., is the same as the lien created by a registered mortgage. Reading these two statutory provisions together, as they must be read, I entertain no doubt that the judgment appealed from is correct and should be upheld.\nYorkshire v. Edmonds[10], is necessarily overruled by this judgment. Chapman v. Edwards et al.[11], on the other hand, may be supported as depending on the consequences of fraud. Neither fraud nor actual notice is present in the case now before us. As to the latter, however, sub\u2014sec. 2 of sec. 104, as enacted in 1912 (ch. 15, sec. 28), must be taken into account. It indicates how far the legislature is prepared to go in support of the rights created by prior registration.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014In March, 1916, the appellant had a mortgage executed in its favour by McArthur and Harper on lands which they possessed. That mortgage was registered only on the 12th July, 1916. In the meantime, i.e., between March and July, 1916, the respondents, who are the holders of a judgment against McArthur and Harper, had that judgment duly registered.\nThe question is: Is the mortgage held by the bank, or the charge arising out of the judgment, entitled to priority?\nBy section 73 of the \"Land Registry Act\" (R.S. B.C., ch. 127) it is enacted that:\u2014\nWhen two or more charges appear entered upon the register affecting the same land, the charges shall, as between themselves, have priority according to the dates at which the applications respectively were made, and not according to the dates of the creation of the estates or interests.\nThere is no doubt that the mortgage constituted a charge upon the property, and there is no dispute as to that.\nAs to the judgment, section 2 of the same \"Land Registry Act\" declares that the word \"charge\" includes a judgment.\nBut it is contended by the appellant that a judgment can affect only the interest which the judgment debtor actually had in the lands, relying, in that respect, on a judgment rendered in this court in the case of Jellett v. Wilkie[12].\nIn that case of Jellett[13], Sir Henry Strong C.J. stated that the common law rule is that\nan execution creditor can only sell the property of his debtor subject to all such charges, liens and equities as the same was subject to in the hands of his debtor;\nand he adds that this law has become the law in the North West Territories\nunless it has been displaced by some statutory provision to the contrary.\nThe provisions of the \"Land Registry Act\" which I have quoted above shew conclusively that the registration of the mortgage and of the judgment creates two charges upon the land; that those charges are to be treated alike; and there is no distinction made in that statute with regard to the beneficial interest of the judgment debtor or not as it was under the common law. The statute has superseded the old rule and the priority of the charge is to be determined by the dates at which they are registered.\nBesides, by section 104 of the same \"Land Registry Act,\" it is provided that no instrument purporting to affect land shall pass any estate in such land until it shall be registered. The effect of that provision is that the appellant's mortgage should be considered as being an instrument dated the 12th of July, 1916, and until then the estate which the mortgage would have passed has remained in the mortgagor and the judgment duly affected all the estate he had at that time in the land.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014 I concur with my brother Anglin.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ellis & Brown.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Williams, Walsh, McKim & Housser.\n[1] 43 D.L.R. 14; [1918] 3 W.W.R. 551.\n[2] 25 B.C.

R.S. 1909, c. 84, s. 247.\nUnder section 247 of the \"City Act\" (Sask. R.S. 1909, ch. 84), when any land, though not taken for some public work, is injuriously affected thereby, a claim for damages must be filed with the city clerk within fifteen days after the publication in a local newspaper of a notice of the completion of the work; and sub-section 3 provides that \"the date of publication of such notice shall be the date in respect of which the damages shall be ascertained.\"\nHeld, Davies C.J. dissenting, that, in determining the compensation to be awarded under the statute, the court has only to consider the depreciation in value which the claimant's property, as it stood at the date of the publication of the notice, had suffered as a necessary result of the work done by the municipality, and the fact that since the commencement of the work, but before the notice of its completion, the claimant's buildings had been destroyed by fire and rebuilt by him, cannot effect the right of the claimant to recover compensation for depreciation in their value by reason of this work.\nPer Davies C.J. dissenting.\u2014Damages to buildings erected by the owner after the \"work\" has been commenced are not \"necessarily incurred by the construction of the work,\" within the meaning of the statute.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (42 D.L.R. 792; (1918), 2 W.W.R. 1013), reversed, Davies C.J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], varying the judgment of the Supreme Court en banc[2], and further reducing an award given to the claimant. The claimant claims compensation for land and buildings injuriously affected by the construction of a subway by respondent. The work had begun about the 18th September, 1911, and the public notice of the completion of the subway was given on the 17th October, 1914. On the 10th January, 1912, the buildings were destroyed by fire, but rebuilt, partly with insurance moneys recovered, in the summer of 1912. The claimant filed a demand for compensation to the amount of $81,000, and he was awarded $21,334 by the arbitrator. The respondent then appealed to the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan en banc where a reduction of $4,050 was made. Subsequently, on a motion by the respondent to amend the minutes of the above judgment, the amount of $6,484 was further deducted from the claimant's award.\nE. B. Jonah for the appellant.\nG. F. Blair K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting)\u2014The damages to be ascertained \"for injurious affection\" to lands, no part of which has been taken, have to be determined as from or on a particular day, but they are only such as were \"necessarily incurred by the construction of the work\" and must relate to the conditions existing not alone at the date fixed to ascertain the damages, but those created or caused by or necessarily resulting from the exercise of the city's powers in constructing the work.\nThe evidence shewed that the buildings, which had been upon the appellant's property at the time the subway was commenced, had been destroyed by fire some three months after such commencement. It was not contended, and could not be successfully contended, that the construction of the subway had anything to do with the burning of the building directly or indirectly, or that the city was an insurer and liable for plaintiff's loss by fire not caused by the subway. The respondent collected his insurance and built another and larger building in its place while the subway was being constructed. That building, having been commenced and completed months after the commencement of the construction of the subway, cannot in any way be considered as coming within the terms of the statute. I fail to understand how damages can be awarded for a new building erected on the premises of the appellant after the construction of the subway was commenced and during its construction. I think the damages allowed by the arbitrator of 40% for depreciation in the value of this building now in dispute in this appeal was properly disallowed by the. Court of Appeal.\nImprovements upon the property made after the commencement and during the construction of the subway are, in my opinion, not within the contemplation of the statute. It is the condition of the property when the construction of the subway was commenced that is to be considered when the arbitrator is to ascertain the \"damages necessarily incurred by the construction of the work,\" and not improvements which the owner may put on the land after the work has been commenced.\nIt was contended that because the statute provided that the date of the publication of the notice of the completion of the work or undertaking should be the date in respect of which the damages should be ascertained, that as a consequence buildings erected by the owner after the work was commenced and depreciated in value in consequence of the work should be valued. As I have said I cannot accede to that contention. The owner could not, by his own act, after the commencement of the work, increase the damages to which he otherwise would be entitled. Those damages must be confined to those as the statute provides \"necessarily incurred by the construction of the work,\" and I cannot think damages incurred to buildings erected by the owner after the \"work\" has been commenced are within the statute.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan which deducted from the award of an arbitrator the sum of $6,484. The award was made under provisions enabling the arbitrator to determine the damages suffered by the appellant by reason of the injurious affection of his property by the construction of a subway.\nThe only right of recovery of damages appellant could have in law was that given by section 247 of respondent city's charter reading as follows:\u2014\nIn case any land not taken for any work or undertaking constructed, made or done by the council or commissioners under the authority of this Act is injuriously affected by such work or undertaking the owner or occupier or other persons interested therein shall file with the city clerk within fifteen days after notice has been given in a local newspaper of the completion of the work his claim for damages in respect thereof stating the amount and particulars of such claim.\n2. Such notice shall be given by the city clerk forthwith after the person in charge of the work or undertaking has given his final certificate and shall state the last day on which any claim under this section may be filed.\n3. The date of publication of such notice shall be the date in respect of which the damages shall be ascertained.\nThe foregoing furnishes the only basis of submission possible and must be held to contain the limitations of the claim made, and authority of the arbitrator to determine the damages suffered by reason of the construction of the work in question.\nIt is to be observed that the claim could only arise after the completion of the work as evidenced by the final certificate of him in charge of the work and upon the notice of the city clerk forthwith thereafter.\nThe date of that publication\nshall be the date in respect of which the damages shall be ascertained.\nThe Court of Appeal, in going beyond that date of 19th October, 1914, I submit with respect, erred by exceeding the powers there given by this statutory submission to the arbitrator.\nIt was not the condition of things existent two or three years before that time, but simply how much the completed structural changes affected the value of the appellants' property on the 19th October, 1914, by depriving it of the advantages the owner would have enjoyed had the said changes on the street never taken place.\nHence importing into the matters to be considered the destruction of a property by fire in the month of January, 1912, and the insurance money secured in relation thereto, was doing that for which there was no authority.\nThe above statutory provision seems novel and may be unique, nevertheless it is what those concerned for respondent chose to induce the legislature to provide.\nEach expropriating statute generally fixes a time for determining the damages to meet the particular case in respect of which provision is made. The fact that usually the question of what damages any party may suffer by reason of the execution of any public project having to be determined before such execution is entered upon, may have led to the misconception of the court below in regard to what should fall within the operation of the section in question. It is to be observed that any statute passed, competent for any parliament or legislature to pass, authorizing the execution of any work, gives no right to those suffering thereby to recover damages in respect thereof unless provision for compensation or damages is provided for. I repeat the only provision made herein seems to be that which I have quoted.\nThe appeal does not enable us to determine whether or not the point of view taken by the arbitrator and his measure of damages were correct. We can only determine herein whether or not the limits of the submission have been exceeded or not.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the court below, so far as relative to the item of $6,484, amended by restoring said sum to the amount awarded appellant, with costs of this appeal to the appellant.\nAnglin J.\u2014When the defendant city constructed the subway which gave rise to the claim for compensation or damages before us on this appeal, it was governed by the \"City Act\" of Saskatchewan (R.S.S. 1909, ch. 84). No part of the claimant's property having been taken, his claim for injurious affection fell under section 247 of that Act. That section prescribed that such a claim should be filed with the city clerk within fifteen days after publication in a local newspaper of notice of completion of the work, which the municipal council was directed to give. Subsection 3 is in the following terms:\u2014\n3. The date of publication of such notice shall be the date in respect of which the damages shall be ascertained.\nThis provision, in my opinion, admits of only one construction. It prescribes that the compensation of the claimant should be the amount of the depreciation in the value of his property, as it stood at the date set, due to the work in question, i.e., he should be awarded the difference between its value as it then stood with the work constructed and what would have been its value as it then stood had the work not been constructed. The use in sub-section 3 of the words, \"the date in respect of which\" makes this abundantly clear; and a comparison of the language of that subsection with the corresponding clause at the end of sub-sec. 2 of sec. 246 removes any possible ground for contending that the words \"in respect of which\" are not more than an equivalent of \"at which.\"\nMr. Blair very properly directed our attention to the language of section 245 restricting the damages to such\nas necessarily result from the exercise of (the) powers\nof the city. But I find nothing in these terms which would justify our placing any other construction than that which I have indicated on sub-sec. 3 of sec. 247. Of course the damages to be allowed must be confined to the depreciation in value which the claimant's property as it stood at the date of publication of the notice of completion had suffered as a necessary result of the work done by the municipality in the exercise of its powers. The owner cannot enhance his damages by introducing fanciful considerations.\nHe is apparently not entitled to compensation for loss sustained during the construction of the work owing to reduction in the rental value of his property, or other inconvenience. That is one of the anomalies of this peculiar legislation. Another is that if the work is not completed there would appear to be no provision for any compensation although serious loss may have been entailed.\nBut, with great respect, I am unable to appreciate the bearing on the claimant's right to compensation of the fact that pending the construction of the work he recovered some insurance in respect of injury to his buildings by fire. Neither is the relative value of his buildings when the work was begun and when it was completed a matter for consideration in determining the compensation to be awarded under the statute.\nAlthough sub-sec. 3 of sec. 247 is probably a unique provision in legislation of this class, it is not at all unjust that the claimant should be compensated on the basis fixed by it. He is entitled to make the most of his land\u2014to build upon it so as to use it to the best advantage. Its possibilities when so utilized must be taken into account in determining its value to him and in estimating the depreciation caused by the work constructed by the municipality. For this purpose a building should be valued not according to its cost\u2014 it may be very extravagant for the locality and therefore unprofitable\u2014but upon the basis of its rental value, and depreciation must be measured on the same footing.\nI am, with deference, of opinion that the Court of Appeal erred in disallowing $6,484 awarded by the arbitrator for damages in respect of the claimant's building and that this item of the award should be restored. The appellant is entitled to his costs of the appeal to this court and also to his costs of the defendant's motion before the Court of Appeal to vary the minutes of its judgment.\nBrodeur J.\u2014In 1911 the respondent corporation commenced the construction of a subway on Broad Street, in the city of Regina. The appellant was the owner of lands and buildings fronting on that subway but which were not taken and expropriated. However, those lands and buildings were injuriously affected by the construction of that work, since it partially lowered the grade of the street. In 1912 a fire occurred in the appellant's buildings; and, as they were insured, he recovered the insurance money and he rebuilt them.\nThe subway was completed in 1914 and, as required by the law, a notice was published in October, 1914, by the city clerk. By the law of Saskatchewan, the liability of the municipal corporation to pay compensation for land injuriously affected is not limited to the cases where some land has been actually taken by the city but it exists in any case where land is injuriously affected by the exercise of the power conferred by the Act. Vachon v. City of Prince Albert[3].\nIn the case of land taken a plan has to be filed shewing the land which is to be expropriated and the work which is to be done; and the names of the owners must be filed with the city clerk. Those owners are then notified and the claims for compensation must be filed within fifteen days from the date of the deposit of the plan.\nIn the case, however, of land not taken but simply injuriously affected, the owner of the land has to file his claim for damages with the city clerk, within fifteen days after notice has been given in a local newspaper of the completion of the work. (Sec. 247, ch. 84, rev. statutes of Saskatchewan, 1909.)\nThe law also provides that\nthe date of publication of such notice shall be the date in respect of which the damages shall be ascertained.\nSo, we see that there are different provisions in the case of lands taken and of lands injuriously affected. In the first case the owner is obliged to make his claim within fifteen days of the deposit of the plan; and in the case of land simply injuriously affected, the claim has to be filed within fifteen days after the notice of completion has been given. McCarthy filed his claim in due time after the notice of completion was given. In the judgment a quo McCarthy was denied the right to claim any compensation in respect of his building because the property had been built on after the commencement of the subway. I am unable to agree with that proposition. The law states specifically that the date of publication of the notice of completion shall be the date at which the damages shall be ascertained. Then, we have to find out what buildings were on the property when the work was completed, and the extent to which those buildings are injuriously affected. We have nothing to do as to whether those buildings were of recent date or not.\nOf course, if something had been done by the owner so as to unduly increase the burden of the city as regards the compensation to be paid, the situation might be different (Mercer v. Liverpool , St. Helens & Lancashire Railway[4]). But there is no suggestion in this case of any such fraudulent action on the part of the land owner.\nIn those circumstances, I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and that the appellant should be entitled to recover the sum of $6,484 for damages as to his building with costs of this court and of the motion to amend the judgment in the court below.\nMignault J.\u2014The only question which arises here is as to the construction and effect of certain provisions of the statute governing the respondent previous to 1915.\nThe appellant claimed compensation for land and buildings injuriously affected by the construction of Broad Street subway, being an extension north of Broad Street across the right-of-way of the Canadian Pacific Railway to Dewdney Street, in the city of Regina. No part of the appellant's land or buildings was taken, but he claimed that they were injuriously affected by the construction of the subway and demanded the sum of $81,000 for his damages. Public notice of the completion of the subway was given on the 17th October, 1914, the work of construction of which had begun about the 18th September, 1911.\nOn the 10th January, 1912, the appellant's building on lots 24, 25 and 26 was destroyed by a fire which also damaged his building on lots 27 and 28. The building on the two latter lots was repaired or rebuilt in the spring and summer of 1912, and was in the same condition as repaired or rebuilt on the date the damages were assessed, namely, the 14th October, 1914. The appellant filed his claim for damages on the 22nd October, 1914.\nThe arbitrator awarded to the appellant $21,334. The respondent then appealed to the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan en banc, where, as appears by the judgment of Mr. Justice Newlands of the 27th November, 1917, a reduction of $4,050 was made in the amount awarded to McCarthy. Subsequently, on the 15th July, 1918, on a motion of the respondent to amend the minutes of judgment, the amount of $6,484 was further deducted from Mr. McCarthy's award for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Newlands as follows:\u2014\nIn this matter, Mr. Blair, for the city, called the attention of the court to the fact that the learned arbitrator in assessing the damages to the McCarthy property had included in his award the building upon the property, and had allowed 40 per cent. depreciation for damage to the same by the subway; that the evidence shewed that the building which had been upon this property at the time the subway was commenced had been destroyed by fire some three months after the commencement of that work; that McCarthy had collected the insurance and had rebuilt. This matter was not dealt with in our previous judgment through an oversight.\nAs the building which is now upon the property was built after the commencement of the subway, it cannot be said to be injured by that work, so McCarthy would not be entitled to any damages on that account. Neither can the rebuilding be considered as a repair of an existing building, as urged by Mr. Jonah, because after the fire it could not be used for any purpose, and was not such a building as could be damaged by the building of the subway.\nThe building was damaged by fire, for which McCarthy was paid by the insurance company, not by the subway.\nThere should, therefore, be deducted from the award to McCarthy the sum of $6,484, the amount allowed for damage to the building.\nMr. McCarthy now appeals from the judgment thus reducing his award by $6,484.\nI am, with deference, of the opinion that this reduction should not have been made.\nThe sections of ch. 84, R.S.S. 1909, which governed, at all the dates in question in this case, the compensation payable for land taken by the respondent, or for land injuriously affected by the construction of public works by it, are the following:\u2014\nSection 245.\u2014The said council or commissioners shall make to the owners or occupiers of or other persons interested in any land taken by the city in the exercise of any of the powers conferred by this Act due compensation therefor and pay damages for any land or interest therein injuriously affected by the exercise of such powers the amount of such damages being such as necessarily result from the exercise of such powers beyond any advantage which the claimant may derive from the contemplated work; and any claim for such compensation or damages if not mutually agreed upon shall be determined by arbitration under this Act.\nSection 246.\u2014Before taking any land the council or commissioners shall deposit with the city clerk plans and specifications shewing the land to be taken or used and the work to be done thereon and the names of the owners or occupiers thereof according to the last revised assessment roll.\n2. The city clerk shall thereupon notify such owners and occupiers of the deposit of the said plans and specifications and of the date of such deposit, and that all claims for compensation for the land so to be taken and the amount and particulars thereof must be filed with him within fifteen days from the date of the deposit of the said plans and specifications which date shall be that with reference to which the amount of the compensation for such lands shall be ascertained. 3. If any claimant under this section has not filed his claim within the period hereinbefore limited it may be barred and extinguished on an application to a judge upon such terms as to notice, costs and otherwise as the judge may direct.\n247. In case any land not taken for any work or undertaking constructed, made or done by the council or commissioners under the authority of this Act is injuriously affected by such work or undertaking the owner or occupier or other persons interested therein shall file with the city clerk within fifteen days after notice has been given in a local newspaper of the completion of the work his claim for damages in respect thereof stating the amount and particulars of such claim.\n2. Such notice shall be given by the city clerk forthwith after the person in charge of the work or undertaking has given his final certificate and shall state the last day on which any claim under this section may be filed.\n3. The date of publication of such notice shall be the date in respect of which the damages shall be ascertained.\n4. Any claim under this section not made within the period hereinbefore limited shall be forever barred and extinguished.\nA clear distinction is here made between compensation for lands taken by the city and compensation for lands not taken but injuriously affected by a public work constructed by it.\nIn the case of lands taken, plans and specifications of the lands and work are deposited with the city clerk before taking the lands, and thereupon the city clerk notifies the owners of the lands to be taken, and the date of the deposit of the plans and specifications is that with reference to which the amount of the compensation for such lands shall be ascertained.\nIn the case of lands not taken but injuriously affected, the owner notifies the city clerk of his claim for damages within fifteen days after notice has been given in a local newspaper \"of the completion of the work,\" and the date of publication of such notice\nshall be the date in respect of which the damages shall be ascertained.\nSince the date of the notice of the completion of the work is the date in respect of which the damages to lands not taken but injuriously affected shall be ascertained, it is entirely immaterial whether during the construction of the work the buildings of the appellant were destroyed by fire and rebuilt by him. It is also immaterial whether or not the appellant received insurance money on account of the destruction of the building. I cannot, with respect, agree with Mr. Justice Newlands when he says that as the building which is now on the property was built after the commencement of the subway, it cannot be said to be injured by that work. The roadway was narrowed from 100 feet to about 33 feet, and any building erected on such a roadway would be damaged by the work. In other words, it would generally be worth less than if the roadway had not been narrowed. It is true that McCarthy received the amount of his insurance, but apparently he employed it to rebuild, and there is nothing in the statute preventing him from so doing. There is no suggestion of fraud on his part or of any attempt to injure the city. What he did was to replace at his own cost a building which was on the property when the work began.\nMoreover, as I have stated, the statute is clear and the only date to be considered for the purpose of determining the compensation to which the appellant is entitled is that when the notice of completion of the work was published.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs as stated by my brother Anglin, and fix the compensation to be paid to the appellant at the sum of $17,284, being the amount allowed by the court below before the reduction was made.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cross, Jonah, Hugg & Forbes.\nSolicitor for the respondent: G.

Within the delay during which he had a lien on the property without registration (article 2013b. C.C.), S. signed and delivered to B., with whom the owner of the property was negotiating a loan, a document by which he declared that he renounced all legal privilege. Later on, S. registered his claim against the property and afterwards transferred the greater part of it. W., a mortgage creditor, then took an action to set aside S.'s lien and, asking that the transfer be declared null and void, summoned G., the transferee, as mis-en-cause. In the trial court, G. appeared through counsel, but did not fyle any plea; and judgment was rendered, dismissing the action, upon the contestation produced by S. W. then appealed to the Court of King's Bench and to the Supreme Court without giving any notice to G.\nHeld, that the privilege of S. had ceased to exist at the date of its registration.\nPer Idington J.:\u2014S. having failed to enforce his privilege within the delay mentioned in article 2013b. C.C., his right was extinguished.\nPer Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.:\u2014The document signed by S. was an absolute and unqualified renunciation of his privilege and not a mere undertaking not to register it.\nPer Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ:\u2014On this appeal, S. cannot set up a plea of res judicata to which the transferee may be entitled.\nPer Anglin and Mignault JJ.:\u2014The judgment of the trial court, so far as it affects the transferee, cannot be disturbed by the Supreme Court. Per Brodeur and Mignault JJ.:\u2014W., though not a party to the document signed by S., has a right to take advantage of it, because as creditor of the owner who failed to do it, W. can exercise the latter's right to have the registration declared illegal.\nPer Brodeur J.:\u2014A judgment pronouncing the extinction of a claim, if rendered before the notification of the transfer, can be opposed to the transferee.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench, 24 R.L. N.S. 204, reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[1], affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, and dismissing the action with costs. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nPaul St. Germain K.C. and Weinfield K.C. for the appellant.\nBusteed K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I concur in the result.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant sues as mortgagee of certain property to have it declared amongst other things that an alleged privilege created by a mechanic's lien registered by respondent against the mortgaged property had ceased to exist by reason of respondent's failure, within one year from the date of such registration, to take a suit to enforce same.\nThe alleged privilege was registered on the 26th of November, 1914.\nOn the 27th February, 1915, the owners made an abandonment of their property.\nThe respondent never filed his claim with the curator or took any steps of any kind either to enforce same or to have his right declared.\nArt. 2013b C.C. provides as follows:\u2014 The right of preference or privilege upon the immovable exists as follows:\u2014\nWithout registration of the claim, in favour of the debt due the labourer, workman and the builder, during the whole time they are occupied at the work or while such work lasts, as the case may be; and with registration, provided it be registered within the thirty days following the date upon which the building has become ready for the purpose for which it is intended.\nBut such right of preference or privilege shall exist only for one year from the date of the registration, unless a suit be taken in the interval, or unless a longer delay for payment has been stipulated in the contract.\nI am of the opinion that such failures, as I have just now referred to, terminated his right, if any ever existed, to enforce any such alleged privilege unless, which is not pretended, a longer delay had been stipulated for in the contract.\nThe express and imperative language of this article, which gives or enables the creation of the privilege, specifies the conditions of its existence, and limits its duration, cannot be overcome or defeated by references to the articles dealing with the powers and duties of a curator or the possibility of a successful issue to a suit so brought. The necessity for the prompt assertion (beyond mere registration) of such a claim is well illustrated in many phases of this litigation.\nIf, as is faintly suggested, the law does not permit of such a suit, then so much the worse for respondent's claim; for the doing so is one of the limitations imposed upon him as the boundary of his right to assert such a privilege, which is the creature of a statute.\nBut I see no insuperable obstacle in the way of bringing a suit. I need not labour with that. I submit that a sufficient answer is to be found in the unchallenged existence of this very suit by a mortgagee and the right to bring it even after all the property has been sold; upon which fact stress is laid as an argument against the respondent's right to do something akin thereto. I may remark in passing that the considerant in the judgment appealed from which relies upon the sale of the property as an answer to this point is surely founded in error, for though there was an abortive sale by or for the curator within the year, there was no real sale until September, 1916.\nThe principle involved in the case of La Banque d'Hochelaga v. Stevenson[2], is applicable to the decision of this case, and I intend to abide by it. In that case it was expressly held that the privilege is limited to one year from the date of registration.\nThe claim therein was as this put forward in one aspect on behalf of an assignee of the builder and alternatively rested on the right given the supplier of material. It was held to have been barred in the first way of putting it by reason of failure to proceed within the year and in the alternative claim as invalid by reason of failure to give notice to the proprietors within the prescribed period for doing so.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout.\nSince writing the foregoing, my brother Brodeur has called attention to the peculiarity of the assignees of some part of the claim in question not being parties to this appeal. I have considered the matter and agree that the rights of such assignees as not before us should be protected and agree in the mode of doing so suggested by the judgment of my brother Mignault.\nAnglin J.\u2014The plaintiff who holds a hypothec upon the property in question sues to set aside a privilege claimed by the defendant Silverman as a builder in which the mis-en-cause Brucker, Gurney-Massey, Limited, and J. Watterson & Company, Limited, are interested as transferees of it in part. The basis of the plaintiffs claim is an express renunciation by Silverman of his privilege under art. 2081 C.C., par. 4, made prior to any of the transfers.\nThe original renunciation was lost, and the plaintiff at the trial proved a copy of it by parol evidence. The learned trial judge dismissed his action on the ground that such evidence was inadmissible. The Court of Appeal held that the case fell within art. 1233 C.C., par. 6, and that parol proof of the renunciation was, therefore, admissible; and neither this point nor the sufficiency of the parol proof adduced is now contested on behalf of the respondent.\nThe Court of Appeal, however, maintained the judgment dismissing the action on other grounds, the lamented Chief Justice Archambeault taking the view that the renunciation operated merely as a contract between Silverman and the other renouncing lienholders who joined in it and one Bulkis, at whose instance it was obtained by the debtor-owners, that the liens would not be registered, of which only Bulkis could take advantage (art. 1023 C.C.). The learned Chief Justice based this conclusion upon his view that the lien or privilege did not exist when the document in the form of a renunciation was executed because it had not then been registered. I am, with profound respect, unable to accept this view because art. 2013b C.C. declares in explicit terms that the lien exists without registration during the construction of the building and for 30 days after its completion. Art. 2081 C.C. declares that by a remission, express or tacit, the privilege becomes extinct. The instrument executed by Silverman was a remission or renunciation and no mere undertaking with Bulkis not to register. As Carroll J. points out it was a unilateral\u2014not a bilateral-contract, and therefore not within art. 1023 C.C. If the lien had been registered when the renunciation was executed the learned Chief Justice would apparently have considered it thereby extinguished. If the lien subsisted when the renunciation was executed although not yet registered, as I think it undoubtedly did, I can see no reason why the renunciation should not have the same effect.\nMr. Justice Carroll, on the other hand, was of the opinion that although the renunciation when executed extinguished the defendant's lien for the benefit not merely of Bulkis, but of all the defendant's creditors, yet because after signing it the defendant registered a\nclaim of lien and thereafter executed what purported to be transfers of partial interests therein to the three mis-en-cause above mentioned, which they registered without notice of the renunciation, the plaintiff was thereby precluded from setting up the renunciation which had not been registered as against the registered transferees. But, with deference, if the renunciation or remission extinguished the privilege (art. 2081 C.C.), subsequent registration could not revive it. If it were non-existent the attempted transfers of it were nullities and their registration was equally ineffectual. Art. 2127 C.C., cited by the learned judge, deals with conveyances or transfers, not with renunciations or remissions. It is the unregistered transfer of a privilege\nwhich is avoided in favour of a subsequent transfer duly registered.\nI see no reason why the appeal should not be allowed as against the respondent and his interest. If the mis-en-cause have rights under the judgment of the Superior Court, the respondent Silverman cannot derive any advantage from them.\nBut although the view I have taken as to the nature and effect of the document signed by Silverman et al. is adverse to any claim of the mis-en-cause apart from the judgment dismissing this action, the appellant has failed to convince me that it is possible for us to adjudicate against them in their absence and deprive them of the benefit of the judgments pronounced below. After I had dealt with the merits of the appeal, I had the advantage of seeing the opinions of my learned brothers Brodeur and Mignault, who differ in their views as to the consequences of the appellant's failure to give notice to the mis-en-cause of his appeal to the Court of King's Bench and likewise of his appeal to this court. My brother Mignault points out the gravity of the difficulty thus raised. My brother Brodeur's view is that, in the absence of any proof that Silverman's transferees notified the debtors of the transfers in their favour, we should hold them void as against the curator, to whom the debtors' estate has been transferred (arts. 1571 and 2127 C.C.), and therefore as against the appellant as a creditor (art. 1031 C.C.). But are we on this ground, any more than upon the ground that the registration of their void transfers was ineffectual, entitled as against the mis-en-cause in their absence to deprive them of whatever rights they may have under the judgments of the provincial courts? I fear not. I, of course, agree that Silverman cannot set up the plea of res judicata to the benefit of which the mis-en-cause may be entitled. But I incline to accept the view of my brother Mignault that since notice was not given to the mis-en-cause of this appeal the judgments of the provincial courts so far as they effect them cannot now be disturbed.\nUnder all the circumstances, however, I would reserve to the appellant the right, notwithstanding his appeals to the Court of King's Bench and to this court, to appeal against the judgment of the Superior Court in favour of the mis-en-cause, if, after the lapse of time that has occurred he can obtain any necessary leave to do so, or to take such other steps as he may be advised to protect his interests against their claims.\nThe respondent should pay the appellant's costs of this litigation throughout.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This is an action by Weiss, a mortgage creditor, to have declared illegal the registration of a builder's privilege by Silverman on the property covered by his mortgage.\nThe ground invoked by the plaintiff was that Silverman, the creditor of the privilege, had abandoned it by an agreement sous seing priv\u00e9.\nThe defendant Silverman denied having ever signed such an agreement.\nAt the trial it was proved that the document in question had existed but that it had been mislaid or destroyed. However, a copy of it had been made by a person in whose custody the document had been for a while and that copy has been filed in this case.\nThe Superior Court dismissed the action on the ground that the plaintiff had not produced the original writing, and had not obtained an admission from the defendant that would constitute a commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit.\nThe Court of Appeal, relying on par. 6 of art. 1233 of the Civil Code, decided, on the contrary, that proof could have been made by testimony, since the proof in writing, while being in possession of a third party, had been lost and could not be produced. They dismissed, however, the plaintiff's action on another ground, viz., that the renunciation signed by the defendant Silverman n'\u00e9tait qu'un engagement de la part de l'intim\u00e9 de ne pas faire inscrire de privil\u00e8ge sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et ne peut avoir d'effet qu'entre les parties et * * * que l'appelant n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 partie \u00e0 la dite promesse de l'Intim\u00e9 et n'a pas titre pour s'en pr\u00e9valoir.\nOn this appeal we are not concerned with the question of admissibility of evidence, since the respondent, in that respect, accepts the decision of the Court of King's Bench; but we have to construe the remission in question and find out if the appellant could invoke it.\nThe renunciation reads as follows :\u2014\n(Renonciation de privil\u00e8ge contre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de G. Zudick et autres, 19 octobre 1914.)\nNous, soussign\u00e9s, entrepreneurs d'ouvrages et fournisseurs de mat\u00e9riaux pour les constructions que MM. Joseph Shpretzer, Gershon Zudick, Henry Shapiro fait actuellement \u00e9riger aux Nos * * * de la rue Outremont sur le lot portant le num\u00e9ro officiel 35, 386, 387, 388, 389, 390 & 391, Paroisse de Montr\u00e9al, d\u00e9clarons renoncer chacun pour nous \u00e0 tout privil\u00e8ge l\u00e9gal que nous pouvons avoir comme tels sur ces immeubles et consentons qu'ils n'en soient jamais affect\u00e9s ni \u00e0 ce jour, ni \u00e0 l'avenir.\nThat document was signed by several contractors and suppliers of materials, amongst whom was the defendant respondent, Silverman.\nIt would appear rather extraordinary that Silverman contended all along that he had not signed such a document, since the copy brought in evidence shews his name appearing amongst those who signed. It was contended at bar by his counsel that the document being written in a language with which he was not familiar, that might explain the stand he took before the Superior Court in his plea and in his evidence.\nI may have my doubts as to the good faith of the defendant; but it is not necessary to express any views as to that, since the case does not turn upon that. We have simply to deal with the agreement as it has evidently been written and signed.\nSilverman, by that document, undertook to renounce any legal privilege which he could claim on the immovable property belonging to the persons for whom he worked, and he agreed that that property would never be burdened for the past or for the future with such a privilege.\nIt was a very sweeping engagement which he took; no reservation with regard to person or time.\nIt was not simply a promise that his privilege would not be registered; but he stated formally in the writing he signed that he abandoned his privilege.\nBy art. 2081 of the Civil Code a privilege becomes extinct by remission. The creditor of the privilege who gives up his right is in the same position as a creditor of an obligation. If the latter releases his debtor from his obligation it becomes extinct (art. 1138 C.C.).\nAt the time Silverman signed his release he had a right of preference as builder upon the additional value given to the immovable by his work done (arts. 2013, 2013b C.C.). He was within the delay during which his privilege existed without registration. His right was born and in existence; and he could undoubtedly release that right.\nThat is what he has done by the writing of which we have a copy. But it is contended that this document was signed in favour of a certain Bulkis, to whose agent it had been handed.\nIt is in evidence that the document was signed on the occasion of a loan which the owners of the property were negotiating with that man. But no stipulation is made in the document to the effect that Bulkis's mortgage or claim would have priority over Silverman's privilege. The document was in general terms; it was handed to the debtors themselves and constituted, as far as the evidence shews, a release on the part of the creditor of the privilege in favour of his debtors, since he was asked by the latter to sign such a release.\nIt is contended, however, that the appellant cannot take advantage of that instrument if we apply the rule res inter alios acta.\nBy art. 1023 of the Civil Code, contracts have effect only between the contracting parties. They cannot affect third persons, except in certain cases; and amongst those are the right of the creditors to exercise actions of their debtors, when to their prejudice they neglect to do so (art. 1031 C.C.).\nIn this case the owners of the property on which the privilege has been registered should have taken the necessary proceedings to set aside that privilege and strike out its registration; but as they have failed to do so, Weiss, as one of their creditors, can proceed to exercise that right. I am, therefore, of opinion that Silverman, having given a release of his privilege, is now without any right to claim that such a privilege now exists; and, as far as he is concerned, the appeal should be allowed.\nWeiss, however, by his action not only asks that Silverman's privilege be set aside but that the transfer which he made to third parties of a part of the sum covered by it, viz., Gurney-Massey & Company, Max Brucker and J. Watterson & Company be declared illegal, null and void in so far as the property in question or the proceeds of sale thereof are concerned and that those transfers be radiated.\nThe plaintiff Weiss has summoned those third parties as mis-en-cause. They filed appearances but did not file any plea. They were given notice of inscription when the case was heard on the merits. The plaintiff's action having been dismissed, inscription in appeal was then made by Weiss; but he did not give notice thereof to those third parties, and the judgment of the Superior Court having been confirmed no notice of appeal to the Supreme Court was given to them and the defendant Silverman was the only one served with those notices of appeal.\nIt is contended by the respondent that the renunciation made by the transferor Silverman cannot affect the rights of the registered transferees; and he invokes art. 2127 of the Civil Code, according to which where there are successive transfers by the same person of the same privileged claim the rights of the transferees are governed not by priority of transfer but by priority of registration.\nI am unable to agree with the respondent's contention. If the issue was between different transferees of Silverman, art. 2127 C.C. would apply. If Silverman had transferred that privilege to A., who had not registered his deed, and later on to B., who had his deed registered in due time, of course the latter would have a better claim than A. That is the case provided for in art. 2127 C.C. But this is not the present case. It is not a matter of dispute between transferees and transferees. It is the case of a privilege that has been abandoned by the creditor and which has been extinguished. The registration which Silverman made in order to revive that privilege was of no effect and he could not transfer to the mis-en-cause greater rights than he possessed. Aubry & Rau, vol. 3, 4\u00e8me, \u00e9d., p. 287.\nOur registration laws protect in a certain measure the creditors of registered rights. For example, the real rights subject to registration take effect from the moment of their registration against creditors whose rights have been registered subsequently (art. 2083 C.C.). There is a preference which results from the prior registration of the deed of a conveyance of an immovable between purchasers who derive their respective titles from the same person (arts. 2089, 2098 C.C.). In those cases the ordinary principles applied to obligations and contracts do not avail (art. 1472-1480-1025-1027 C.C.).\nBut in this case the registration of the privilege was made on a property, of which Zudick and his associates were open owners, without their consent and likely without their knowledge. Silverman, in registering that privilege which he had abandoned, could not give to his transferees any rights which he did not possess himself (art. 2088 C.C.).\nThe Court of King's Bench, in a case of Longpr\u00e9 v. Valade[3], decided that:\u2014\nL'enregistrement d'un acte r\u00e9sili\u00e9 entre les parties ne peut faire revivre cet acte lors m\u00eame que Facte de r\u00e9siliation n'aurait' pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9.\nIn a case of Stuart v. Bowman[4], it was decided also that:\u2014\nL'enregistrement ne valide pas un titre nul \u00e0 l'encontre des droits du v\u00e9ritable propri\u00e9taire.\nWe may say in conclusion on that question of registration that the cessionnaires had no more rights on Zudick's property than Silverman himself. His renunciation of his privilege has extinguished it and it could not be revived by registration.\nThe respondent, in a supplementary factum, now urges that the conclusions of the action concerning the transfers and their registration could not be granted because no notice of appeal was given to the transferees mis-en-cause, and that there is res judicata as to that part of those conclusions. That contention is a forcible one, but the respondent is not the proper party to raise it. It should be raised by the mis-en-cause themselves. They are the only persons entitled to raise the issue of res judicata.\nBesides, the evidence of record does not shew that the alleged transfers were duly made and served upon the debtors. In law the transferees have no possession available against third persons until signification of the deed of transfer and of the certificate of registration has been made to the debtors (arts. 1575-2127 C.C.).\nThere has been, since one of those transfers was made, an abandonment of property by the debtor and a curator has been appointed. In the case of the two other transfers, they have been made since the cession de biens has taken place. It may be that those transfers have been regularly served upon the debtor, but the evidence does not shew it. Some further facts and arguments could be brought up by the transferees on subsequent proceedings which could affect the rights of the plaintiff. But taking the record as it is, the pleadings as they have been made, I think that the plaintiff should succeed and obtain all his conclusions.\nI may quote on that point the following authorities which shew that the judgment which has decided that a claim has been extinguished may be opposed to the transferee if that judgment has been rendered before the notification of the transfer. Aubry & Rau, vol. 8, p. 373; Demolombe, vol. 30, no. 351; Lacoste, Chose jug\u00e9e, no. 485; Dalloz, 1855, I-281; Dalloz, 1858-1-236.\nIn the present case it does not appear that the transfers have been served upon the debtors. The mis-en-cause had registered their transfers, but the necessary notice has not been made and they have no possession available against the debtors or their ayant cause. I come to the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed as to all the rights and interests of the respondent Silverman in question in this action, without prejudice to the rights of the transferees, the mis-en-cause, if any, under the judgment of the Superior Court, and to whatever rights against them the appellant may have, if any. Costs throughout to the appellant against the respondent Silverman.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014With no little hesitation I have come to the conclusion that as against the respondent Silverman, the appellant can rely on the unconditional renunciation to privilege made by Silverman on the 19th October, 1914. It is true that this renunciation was obtained by J. A. Parent, notary, acting for one G. Bulkis, who on the same day made a loan of $11,000 to Gershon Zudick, Joseph Shpretzer and Henry Shapiro, the owners of the building on which Silverman had acquired a builder's privilege. But this renunciation is absolute and unqualified. The document signed by Silverman says:\u2014\nNous, soussign\u00e9s, entrepreneurs d'ouvrages et fournisseurs de mat\u00e9riaux pour les constructions que M. Joseph Shpretzer, Gershon Zudick, Henry Shapiro, fait actuellement \u00e9riger aux No s * * * de la rue Outremont sur le lot portant le num\u00e9ro officiel 35, 386, 387, 388, 389, 390 et 391, Paroisse de Montr\u00e9al, d\u00e9clarons renoncer chacun pour nous \u00e0 tout privil\u00e9ge l\u00e9gal que nous pouvons avoir comme tels sur ces immeubles et consentons qu'ils n'en soient jamais affect\u00e9s ni \u00e0 ce jour, ni \u00e0 l'avenir.\nI would further add that, even construing this document as it was construed by the Court of King's Bench, this was a deliberate renunciation in favour of Bulkis, a hypothecary creditor, and Bulkis could not avail himself of this renunciation without the appellant, an anterior hypothecary creditor, getting the full benefit of it. Bulkis was examined as a witness but seemed singularly indifferent to the fact that he had lent $11,000 on the property and that he had a vital interest in having the builders and furnishers of materials renounce their privilege. Notwithstanding this he says that he got a paper from the notary containing some signatures, but never read it and finally lost it. This is one of the peculiarities of this rather remarkable case. I feel convinced, however, that, unless Bulkis has been promised security otherwise, he would act according to his interests, and then the appellant would have the full benefit of Silverman's renunciation.\nOn 26th November, 1914, a little more than a month after signing this renunciation, the respondent Silverman registered a claim against the property for $7,375. Of this amount he transferred, on 5th February, 1915, the sum of $2,571 to one Max Brucker, and, on 9th April, 1915, he also transferred $2,429.77 to Gurney-Massey & Co. Ltd., and $1,688.45 to J. Watterson & Co. Ltd., so that he is now creditor only for the sum of $665.78. The appellant alleges that these transfers were registered, but does not pretend that the transferees did not comply with the requirements of art. 2127 C.C. as to the signification of the transfers.\nIn February, 1915, Zudick, Shpretzer and Shapiro made an abandonment of their property for the benefit of their creditors and the property in question was sold at the instance of the curator, and after collocating several privileged claims, there remained in the hands of the prothonotary the sum of $30,388.13, which was insufficient to pay the hypothecs and the builders' privileges so that the prothonotary reported that a \"ventilation\" would be necessary to determine the value of the improvements.\nOn the 15th February, 1917, the appellant took this action against Silverman, and made the above mentioned transferees parties to his action as mis-en-cause. He asks that the privilege be declared null and void, and also that the transfers be annulled in so far as the said property or the proceeds of sale thereof are concerned, that the prothonotary be ordered not to collocate the respondent and his transferees as privileged creditors, and that the transfers be radiated, cancelled and struck from the certificate of search.\nThe respondent Silverman contested the action, denying that he had signed the renunciation. The transferees appeared by attorney, but did not plead to the action, and were foreclosed. The judgment was rendered in the Superior Court on the inscription of the plaintiff against Silverman and on his inscription ex parte against the transferees.\nSilverman having, as a witness, denied that he had signed the renunciation, the Superior Court refused to allow the plaintiff to make secondary proof of the renunciation and also decided adversely to the contentions of the plaintiff who pretended that the privilege was null for want of compliance with the necessary formalities. The action was dismissed with costs.\nThe plaintiff appealed to the Court of King's Bench, and the latter court, while deciding that the renunciation was legally proved, came to the conclusion that, as regards the appellant, it was res inter alios acta (art. 1023 C.C.). Mr. Justice Carroll was of the opinion that the appellant could avail himself of the renunciation, but that it could not affect the transferees, who were protected by art. 2127 C.C., and could not lose their rights by reason of a renunciation which had received no publicity.\nI agree that the renunciation of the respondent Silverman was legally proved. Undoubtedly Silverman, notwithstanding his denial, signed it, and his counsel very properly abandoned, at the hearing before this court, the plea that his client had not signed the document. I have also come to the conclusion, as stated above, that the appellant can claim the benefit of the renunciation as regards Silverman. Whether he can set it up against the transferees is, however, another question.\nAfter the argument, an examination of the record in the court below disclosed the fact that although the transferees had been made parties to the suit in the Superior Court and had appeared by counsel, the appellant had not given them notice of his inscription in appeal to the Court of King's Bench (art. 1213 C.C.P.), nor did he give them notice of his petition for leave to appeal to this court, so that the transferees were not parties to the appeal, and the question might arise whether they were not protected by the judgment of the Superior Court which dismissed the appellant's action, not only with regard to Silverman, but also with respect to the transferees of the greater part of the claim he had registered against the property.\nThe attention of the solicitors of the appellant and of the respondent Silverman was called to this fact, and they were given the opportunity of filing supplementary factums if they desired. They have done so.\nThe respondent Silverman, in his supplementary factum, submits that the judgment of the Superior Court is now res judicata and, therefore, conclusive in favour of the transferees. He has, however, no right to make this plea on behalf of the latter.\nThe appellant, on the other hand, has filed a supplementary factum in which he takes several grounds, which I will briefly summarize.\n1. The appellant claims that by appearing by counsel in the Superior Court, and failing to plead to the action, the transferees tacitly shewed that they intended to submit themselves to justice and to acquiesce in the final judgment to be rendered upon the issues between the appellant and the respondent.\n2. The appellant submits that the inscription in appeal against Silverman alone is effective against the transferees, the privilege claimed by Silverman and his transferees being indivisible.\n3. He also contends that the transferees were duly represented on the appeal by the respondent Silverman, inasmuch as they had taken the transfers as a pledge and were subrogated in Silverman's rights, so that Silverman, being the warrantor of the transfers he had made to them, could plead in their name.\nI think the first ground urged by the appellant is not a sufficient answer to the objection that the transferees should have been made parties to the appeal taken by the appellant. Granting that the transferees, who had appeared in the Superior Court, but did not plead to the action, tacitly shewed that they intended to submit themselves to justice and to acquiesce in the final judgment\u2014and I do not consider that this was an acquiescence in any judgment that might be rendered in another court upon the issues between the appellant and Silverman\u2014I am of the opinion that they were entitled to notice of any inscription for proof and hearing in the Superior Court (art. 418 C.C.P.), as well as of any inscription in appeal from the judgment. They received notice of the inscription in the Superior Court but not of the inscription in appeal. Most certainly the appellant could, after the first judgment, abandon the conclusions he had taken against the transferees and limit the appeal to the respondent Silverman, and how could he more effectively shew his intention to do so than by giving notice of appeal to Silverman alone?\nThe second answer of the appellant is on its face more serious, and he undoubtedly cites in his supplementary factum very weighty authorities to shew that in the case of an indivisible obligation, legal proceedings or appeals taken by or against one of several creditors or debtors are effective as to the latter.\nBut on due consideration, I have come to the conclusion that, in view of the circumstances of this case, the answer of the appellant does not dispose of the objection.\nIn the first place, the appellant did not, before the Superior Court, conduct his action against Silverman as representing in any way his transferees, but he made the latter parties to his action, thereby separating their case from that of Silverman, and giving them the opportunity of contesting the action separately. The fact that they did not make a separate defence does not alter their status in the action, and they were undoubtedly entitled to be heard on an appeal from the judgment, which judgment dismissed the appellant's action, not only as to his demand against Silverman, but also as to the conclusions taken by him against the transferees.\nIn the second place, I am of the opinion that the appellant misapplies the rules concerning indivisible obligations.\nThere is no doubt that a privilege is indivisible, but all the authors hold that this indivisibility, as well as the indivisibility of the contract of hypothec, is not of the essence of the contract, but exists by virtue of the will of the parties. It is without effect on the obligation itself, of which the privilege or hypothec is merely the accessory, and if the claim guaranteed by the privilege or hypothec be divisible, as this claim is divisible, it is not made indivisible because an indivisible security has been given. So, in my opinion, Silverman cannot in any way represent his transferees.\nMoreover, the indivisibility of the privilege or of the hypothec exists in favour of the creditor and cannot be turned against him.\nSee Guillouard, Privil\u00e8ges et Hypoth\u00e8ques, vol. 2, nos. 637 and 638; Laurent, vol. 30, nos. 175, 177, 178; Baudry-Lacantinerie, Privil\u00e8ges et Hypoth\u00e8ques, vol. 2, no. 900; Paul Pont, Privil\u00e8ges et Hypoth\u00e8ques, vol. 1, nos. 331 et seq.; Cassation, 9th November, 1847, Dalloz, 48, 1. 49.\nThe third answer of the appellant seems to me clearly unfounded. There is no proceeding here of the nature of an action in warranty. And assuming that Silverman is obliged to warrant the transfers he has made, this mere fact would not, in my opinion, permit the appellant, after impleading the transferees in the first court, to entirely ignore them in his appeal to a higher court.\nI think, therefore, under the very special circumstances of this case, that effect should be given to Silverman's renunciation merely in so far as his interest is concerned, to wit, the sum of $665.78. There would be a very serious question whether the unregistered renunciation could be opposed to the registered transferees. It is, however, not necessary to decide this question inasmuch as the transferees are no longer parties to these proceedings. It is also unnecessary to decide the objections made by the appellant as to Silverman's privilege, for the renunciation puts an end to it in so far as his interest is concerned, and as regards the transferees, the latter are not before this court, so I would not feel justified, even were I of the opinion that the appellant's objections are well taken\u2014and I express no opinion on this point\u2014in passing upon the validity of any privilege belonging to the transferees.\nI would allow the appeal in so far as the interest of the respondent Silverman in this claim is concerned, without prejudice to any rights the transferees may have acquired under the judgment of the Superior Court, and to whatever rights against them the appellant may have, if any.\nThe appellant should have his costs throughout against the respondent Silverman.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Weinfield, Sperber, Ledieu & Fortier.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

S., 1917, 2nd sess., c. 18, s. 194. R.S. Sask, 1909, c. 41, s. 162.\nIn April, 1912, the owner made an agreement to sell a lot of land to P. for a price payable by instalments, and in May, 1913, P. assigned to B. his interest in this agreement. This assignment was not registered, but in June, 1913, B. filed a caveat. In September, 1914, P., having paid the purchase price, was registered as owner of the land subject to the caveat. Subsequently P. executed a mortgage of the land, and when it was registered the mortgagee was made aware of B.'s caveat. In June, 1915, the registrar, under section 136 of \"The Land Titles Act\" of Saskatchewan, notified B., at the request of the mortgagee, that his caveat would lapse at the expiration of a certain delay, unless continued by order of the court; and, by a subsequent order, B.'s caveat was continued for 35 days from the 8th of October, 1915. As no action had been taken by B. within that time, the caveat was vacated.\nHeld that, under section 194 of \"The Land Titles Act\" of Saskatchewan and in the absence of fraud, B., having allowed his caveat to be vacated, could not invoke the knowledge by the mortgagee of the existence of the caveat in order to maintain its priority of claim.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (11 Sask. L.R. 297; 42 D.L.R. 548; (1918) 3 W.W.R. 27, 196), reversed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], reversing the judgment of Brown C.J. at the trial and maintaining the plaintiff's action. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nS. B. Woods K.C. for the appellant.\nP. E. Mackenzie K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The question for our decision in this appeal really turns upon the proper construction to be given section 194 of \"The Land Titles Act, 1917,\" of Saskatchewan. Apart from that statute, and especially from section 194, there is little doubt that, under the authorities, the plaintiff respondent would have a right to maintain its action and the priority of its security over that of the bank and that, but for section 194, the failure on its part to maintain or renew its caveat which it had registered to protect its interest would not, with the knowledge possessed by the bank of the respondent's interest, operate to affect such right of priority. As Chief Justice Haultain puts it,\nThe outstanding and important facts are that the plaintiff had an equitable interest in the land in question prior in time to the equitable interest of the defendant bank, and that the bank had full knowledge and notice of that interest at the time it took its security from Phillips. Apart from the provisions of \"The Land Titles Act, 1917\" (2nd sess.), ch. 18, these facts bring this case clearly within well established principles.\nThe section in question, 194, reads as follows:\u2014\n194. No person contracting or dealing with or taking or proposing bo take a transfer, mortgage, incumbrance or lease from the owner of any land for which a certificate of title has been granted shall, except in case of fraud by such person, be bound or concerned to inquire into or ascertain the circumstances in or the consideration for which the owner or any previous owner of the land is or was registered or to see to the application of the purchase money or of any part thereof nor shall he be affected by any notice direct, implied or constructive, of any trust or unregistered interest in the land, any rule of law or equity to the contrary notwithstanding.\n2. Knowledge on the part of any such person that any trust or unregistered interest is in existence shall not of itself be imputed as fraud.\nThe authorities relied upon in the argument at bar were to the effect that a purchaser or morgtagee for value of an equitable interest in lands with actual or constructive notice of other equitable unregistered interests prior to that which he acquired took subject to those interests.\nBut it seems to me that the object and purpose of this section, apart from cases of fraud, was to lay down a different rule which should govern in cases coming within its ambit, and, unless we are prepared to ignore the section altogether or fritter away its language and meaning, we must hold that, except in cases of fraud, these equitable rules established by the authorities, however just and equitable they may seem to be under ordinary circumstances, are not applicable to cases coming within section 194 of \"The Land Titles Act.\"\nI think the object and purpose of such statutes as the one here was very well stated by Edwards J. in delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal in New Zealand in Fels v. Knowles[2]:\u2014\nThe object of the Act was to contain within its four corners a complete system which any intelligent man could understand, and which could be carried into effect in practice without the intervention of persons skilled in the law. * * * The cardinal principle of the statute is that the register is everything and that, except in cases of actual fraud on the part of the person dealing with the registered proprietor, such person, upon registration of the title under which he takes from the registered proprietor, has an indefeasible title against all the world. Nothing can be registered the registration of which is not expressly authorized by the statute. Everything which can be registered gives, in the absence of fraud, an indefeasible title to the estate or interest, or in the cases in which registration of a right is authorized, as in the case of easements or incorporeal rights, to the right registered.\nIn construing section 194 of \"The Saskatchewan Land Titles Act,\" we must always bear in mind that cases of fraud are excepted from it, but that knowledge of an unregistered interest in lands \"shall not of itself be imputed as fraud.\" The section provides that no person dealing with lands for which a certificate of title has been granted shall\nbe affected by any notice direct implied or constructive of any trust or unregistered interest in the land any rule of law or equity to the contrary notwithstanding.\nThat seems to be sufficiently explicit and clear as making the register everything and outside notices or knowledge immaterial.\nNow in this case a caveat had been filed on behalf of the plaintiff respondent against the lands in question and the registrar having given the plaintiff respondent notice to take action on the caveat the local master made an order under the statute directing the plaintiff within 35 days to bring an action to establish any claim it might have to the lands with an express provision that if such action was not brought the caveat should be vacated. No action having been brought the caveat was vacated.\nThe plaintiff then notified the appellant bank that it had not abandoned, its claim and it brought the present action resting its claim to relief on the ground that the appellant bank, having had the knowledge of plaintiff's claim before taking its mortgage, cannot in equity acquire a title free from and prior to such claim.\nThis raises a clear cut issue whether the old rules of equity which section 194 was supposed to do away with still prevail and will be given effect to notwithstanding the section or whether the plain words of the section itself, which practically makes the register everything, shall prevail.\nI have no hesitation myself, apart from cases of fraud, in reaching the latter conclusion and that the plaintiff, whether by mistake or negligence, having allowed its caveat to be vacated, cannot invoke the old rule of notice and knowledge to maintain its priority of claim over that of the bank.\nSuch rule has, in my judgment, been expressly abrogated by this section 194, in all cases coming within its ambit and the register alone made the sole test always of course excepting, as the section does, cases of fraud.\nI cannot find that the plaintiff has any one to blame but itself for the position it finds itself in. The bank did not try to take any unjust advantage of it. Perfectly within its right, the bank took proceedings under the Act which resulted in the plaintiff being ordered to bring an action to enforce that claim within a definite period, otherwise its caveat would lapse and be vacated.\nThe respondent allowed it, by its own neglect and inaction, to be vacated and so lost the right it otherwise would have had to enforce its claim of priority as against the defendant bank which in the meantime had acquired an interest in the land. I agree with Mr. Justice Newlands\nthat the vacating of the caveat cleared the registered title to the land of any claim the plaintiff might have against it in priority to any right that had attached to such land by such lapse.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment of the trial judge. Idington J.\u2014The question raised herein, I think, should be determined by the interpretation and construction of section 162 of \"The Lands Titles Act,\" ch. 41 of the Revised Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1909, (Sask. s. 1917, 2nd session, c. 18, s. 194) so far as relevant to the facts in evidence.\n162. No person contracting or dealing with or taking or proposing to take a transfer, mortgage, incumbrance or lease, from the owner of any land for which a certificate of title has been granted shall, except in case of fraud by such person, be bound or concerned to inquire into or ascertain the circumstances in or the consideration for which the owner or any previous owner of the land is or was registered or to see to the application of the purchase money or of any part thereof nor shall he be affected by any notice direct, implied or constructive of any trust or unregistered interest in the land any rule of law or equity to the contrary notwithstanding.\n2. The knowledge that any trust or unregistered interest is in existence shall not of itself be imputed as fraud.\nOne Munson sold some land to one Phillips and gave him an agreement of purchase therefor on the 2nd of April, 1912, which he assigned, merely in the way of security, on the 2nd of May, 1913, to a company under whom, by virtue of several assignments, the respondent corporate company claims.\nIn the course of events attendant upon the said several assignments, one Scott Barlow, who had become one of the said several assignees, as trustee for respondent company, registered a caveat on the 5th of June, 1913.\nIn September, 1914, Phillips had paid the balance of the purchase money and obtained a conveyance from Munson who had never been notified by the assignees aforesaid, or any of them, of the fact of the said assignment by Phillips the vendor.\nNo one has pretended that Phillips, in doing so, had any fraudulent purpose in view or claimed that his action in doing so was fraudulent.\nThereafter, on the 23rd of March, 1915, the appellant obtained from Phillips a mortgage upon the said lands and having had, when doing so, knowledge of the said caveat filed by Scott Barlow, the appellant is held by the court below to have committed a fraud and thereby is deprived of its rights as such mortgagee.\nNot a word appears in the pleading herein charging such fraud.\nAnd a very curious circumstance appears in evidence which seems quite inconsistent with the charge of fraud made by the court below. It is this: that the appellant, shortly after getting its mortgage from Phillips, instructed solicitors to call the attention of Scott Barlow, in whose name the caveat stood, that he must proceed to enforce his claim thereunder or it would lapse in thirty days, unless continued by order of the court.\nThe respondent, in consequence of this, applied accordingly and obtained an order continuing the caveat for thirty-five days on terms of the caveator taking proceedings within that time to establish his rights thereunder.\nThis he and the respondent failed to do and in the language used in the western provinces relative to such omissions, the caveat lapsed.\nThe respondent took ineffectual steps later to have it re-established.\nThe consequence of such failures is that on the registry record the appellant stands in priority to anything the respondent can now get registered against the same land. What has that in it in the nature of fraud?\nThe answer is furnished by the judgment in Le Neve v. Le Neve[3], upon which had been built, as it were, an enormous volume of law, which produces judicial expressions that might, if later legislation discarded, warrant one in saying any such advantage with knowledge, was equivalent to fraud and liable to have that declared and the priority of registration deprived of its usual effect.\nI cannot, however, see how such doctrines can be maintained in such cases as this, in view of the express language of the legislature in the clause above quoted.\nIt seems impossible that the proper effect can be given to that section unless we try to appreciate what the legislature was about.\nClearly it was not satisfied with the results of the law as settled by judicial expressions and decisions, and had determined upon the adoption of a system of registration as a basis of ownership of land and a means of settling the order of priority of claims into or out of any such ownership when once registered under the Act in question.\nIn doing so it cast upon those acquiring any such ownership or claim to any interest therein burdens, perhaps previously unknown, in the way of diligence in order to protect the rights so acquired by observing the provisions of the Act in that regard under penalty of losing ownership or priority of claim save in the case of fraud on the part of those obtaining the priority, which the Act seems clearly to contemplate as possible even with notice or knowledge unless springing from that conveyed by means of registration of a caveat. Notice or knowledge resting upon the warning given by a permissible caveat would be available to him registering it, or those claiming under him by virtue thereof as a means of maintaining priority over any later registration.\nBut the steps necessary to secure such benefits must be those contemplated by the Act and not something else.\nThe principle involved is not new. A privilege of any kind created by statute must be enforced in the way that statute provides.\nIt cannot be made available in any other way. The respondent seems to have recognized that by getting the renewal under the Act.\nWhen it failed to proceed according to the law enacted for its benefit its rights ceased.\nThe notice or knowledge thus obtained by appellant was nothing more than all other kinds of notice or knowledge excluded by the section quoted from having any effect and, by the express language of the Act, \"shall not of itself be imputed as fraud.\"\nI am unable, therefore, to see how the language of the legislature can be properly defied and set at naught by reason of judicial conceptions of what might have been called fraud, before this express prohibition of their being given further recognition.\nWe have been referred to a number of New Zealand cases which, of course, do not bind us any more than the judgment appealed from. I have, however, looked at them and find in most, if not all, some element of fact which could well be interpreted as to constitute fraud, or might well be held as within such a compliance with the statute as to found a claim thereunder for the relief sought and got.\nThe New Zealand Act differs somewhat from that now in question and the corresponding section to that above quoted is capable of a less drastic meaning than it.\nThe Australian statutes, upon which cases were cited to us, are not in our library. And I may be permitted to think that the attempted construction of such like statutes as in question from a reading of a single section or extract therefrom is rather a hazardous sort of proceeding.\nFor this court to attempt to call that fraud on the part of the appellant which it appears to have done herein, would only tend to impair the regard attaching to any finding of fraud we might be able to find as understood by the exception in above quoted section.\nNor is this the only illustration furnished by the administration of justice wherein due diligence is recognized as entitled to acquire its reward and he wanting in the application thereof is doomed to disappointment.\nSo long as its application is not associated with a fraudulent purpose, he suffering has no legal right to complain.\nIt does not seem to me that the facts upon which the court above had to proceed in the case of Loke Yew v. Port Swettenham Rubber Co.[4], have much resemblance to those we have to deal with and the relevant law contained in the statute there in question has still less to that aboye quoted.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and, I think, the respondent should be at liberty to redeem and judgment go for that as falling under its alternative prayer for relief.\nAnglin J.\u2014The facts in this case appear in the judgments delivered[5], in the Court of Appeal. They establish that the appellant bank took the mortgage for which it now claims priority over the respondent's unregistered equitable interest in, or claim upon, the lands in question with \"direct\" notice of such interest. Were it not for the effect of section 194 of \"The Land Titles Act\" (statutes of Saskatchewan, 1917 (2nd sess.), ch. 18), I should unhesitatingly agree with the learned Chief Justice of Saskatchewan and Lamont J. that any attempt of the bank to give to its security \"an effect inconsistent with or destructive of\" the respondent's prior interest would, under these circumstances, be\n\"looked upon by equity as a fraud which it (could) not countenance.\"\nMr. Justice Lamont has, in my opinion very convincingly shewn that but for the effect of section 194 a caveat would not have been required to protect the respondent's interest against the bank and that the lapse of its caveat, therefore, did not leave it in any worse position than it would have occupied had it never lodged it.\nBut I find in section 194 an insuperable difficulty to giving effect to the principle of equity which would otherwise support the respondent in this position. The language of that section is so explicit that it leaves no room for doubt as to the intention of the legislature that that principle shall be abrogated in favour of a\nperson * * * taking * * * a transfer mortgage, incumbrance or lease from the owner of any land for which a certificate of title has been granted, except in the case of fraud.\nBy sub-sec. 2:\nKnowledge that any trust or unregistered instrument is in existence shall not of itself be imputed as fraud.\nHere there was knowledge, but nothing more Knowledge, of course, could not of itself constitute fraud. Fraud must always have consisted in the doing of something which that knowledge made it unjust or inequitable to do. The meaning of the statute must, therefore, be that the doing of that which mere knowledge of \"any trust or unregistered interest\" would make it inequitable to do shall nevertheless not be imputed as fraud, within the meaning of that term as used in sub-sec. 1. of sec. 194. That which equity deems fraud, therefore, is by this enactment of a competent legislature declared not to be imputable as fraud.\nA passage from my judgment in Grace v. Kuebler[6], is cited by the learned Chief Justice and by Lamont J. apparently as inconsistent with this view. All that that case decided was that the mere lodging of a caveat to protect an interest acquired subsequently to the making of an agreement for the sale of registered land does not affect the purchaser under such agreement, otherwise ignorant of them, with notice of the rights to protect which the caveat is lodged so as to render ineffectual as against the caveator payments on account of purchase money subsequently made by the purchaser to his vendor. Expressions of opinion in the judgment on any other point must, it is needless to say, be regarded as obiter. If anything I said in that case is really inconsistent with the views I have expressed above, I can only cry peccavi and plead that it was not so intended. I find in section 194 the \"very explicit language\" which I deem necessary to justify our regarding a statute as intended to render unenforceable such a wholesome doctrine as that of the effect of notice in equity. To give effect to a provision that a person is to be unaffected by notice, his rights and remedies must be the same as they would have been had he not had notice. However wholesome we may consider the equitable doctrine as to the effect of notice\u2014however regrettable and even demoralizing in its tendency we may deem legislation rendering it inoperative\u2014it is not in our power to disregard it. The legislative purpose being clear we have no right to decline to carry it out. Were we to do so consequences still more deplorable must ensue. The court would occupy a wholly indefensible position, one of usurpation of an authority, sovereign within its ambit, which it is its imperative duty to uphold.\nMignault J.\u2014In my opinion the decision of the question submitted is entirely governed by the provisions of \"The Land Titles Act\" of Saskatchewan (ch. 41 of the Revised Statutes of Saskatchewan (1909)). (Sask. S., 1917, 2nd session, c. 18).\nAs briefly as they can be stated, the pertinent facts are as follows:\u2014\nIn April, 1912, one J. H. Munson made an agreement to sell to Frank C. Phillips lot 10, block 6, plan E.M., town of Humboldt, Saskatchewan, for $1,750 payable by instalments.\nIn May, 1913, Phillips, being indebted to Boulter Waugh and Company, Limited (now represented by the respondent), assigned his interest in the agreement for sale to the said company, which immediately transferred its interest to its credit manager, Mr. Scott Barlow, in trust for the company. These assignments were not registered, but on the 5th June, 1913, Mr. Barlow filed a caveat in the district land titles office to protect the interest thus assigned by Phillips.\nIn September, 1914, Phillips, having paid to Munson the purchase price, received a transfer and was registered as owner of the land, subject to a mechanic's lien and to the Barlow caveat.\nSubsequently Phillips became indebted to the appellant and executed a mortgage of the land in its favour, which mortgage was registered on the 24th March, 1915. When the appellant acquired this mortgage from Phillips, it was aware of the Barlow caveat, which was entered on the certificate of title, and of the rights represented by this caveat. On the 29th June, 1915, the deputy registrar, under section 130 of \"The Land Titles Act,\" (R.S. Sask. 1909, c. 41) notified Mr. Barlow at the request of the appellant that his caveat would lapse at the end of 30 days unless continued by order of the court. An order was made on the 28th July, 1915, and registered, continuing the caveat until further order. By a Subsequent order of the court, the Barlow caveat was continued for 35 days from the 8th October, 1915, and it was ordered that in default of the caveator taking proceedings within that time, the caveat should be vacated. On the 13th November, 1915, a certificate of the clerk of the court was registered stating that no action had been taken during the 35 days continuing the caveat, and that this time having expired the caveat was vacated\nLegal proceedings were subsequently taken to reinstate the Barlow caveat resulting in a judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan en banc of the 14th July, 1916, setting aside an order of the local master at Humboldt reinstating the Barlow caveat, without prejudice, the judgment stated, to the right of the respondent to make application to file a new caveat.\nThe question to be decided is whether the appellant is entitled to priority over the respondent in respect of their respective rights in and to the lands in question, and this question, as I have said, must be determined according to the rules enacted by \"The Saskatchewan Land Titles Act.\"\nThe material provisions of this statute (R.S. Sask. 1909, c. 41) are as follows:\u2014\n125. Any person claiming to be interested in any land under any will, settlement or trust deed or under any instrument of transfer or transmission or under any unregistered instrument or under an execution where the execution creditor seeks to affect land in which the execution debtor is interested beneficially, but the title to which is registered in the name of some other person or otherwise, may lodge a caveat with the registrar to the effect that no registration of any transfer or other instrument affecting the said land shall be made and that no certificate of title therefor shall be granted until such caveat has been withdrawn or has lapsed as hereinafter provided unless such instrument Or certificate of title is expressed to be subject to the claim of the caveator as stated in such caveat;\nProvided that no caveat which has heretofore been or that may hereafter be lodged shall be deemed to be insufficient for the purposes of the lodgment thereof merely upon the ground that the interest claimed therein is not shewn to be derived from the registered owner of the land affected.\n129. The owner or other person claiming any interest in such land may by summons call upon the caveator to attend before a judge to shew cause why the caveat should not be withdrawn; and the said judge may upon proof that such last mentioned person has been summoned and upon such evidence as the judge requires make such order in the premises as to the said judge seems fit.\n130. Subject to the provisions of the preceding section such caveat shall continue unless and until it is removed as hereinafter set forth, namely: The owner or other person claiming any interest in such land may require the registrar by notice in writing which shall be in form Y in the schedule to this Act to notify the caveator at his address for service as set forth in the caveat that such caveat shall lapse at the expiration of thirty days from the mailing of such notice by the registrar unless within said thirty days, the caveator shall file with the registrar an order made by the judge providing for the continuing beyond the said thirty days of said caveat, and in the event of such order not being filed with the registrar within the said thirty days, such caveat shall lapse and shall be treated as lapsed by the registrar; the notice hereinbefore provided to be given by the registrar shall be by registered letter.\nProvided, however, that whenever the registrar is satisfied that any interest in such land other than the interest therein of the caveator is protected by such caveat he may refuse to notify the caveator as required by this section, and in such case the removal of such caveat shall be subject only to the provisions of sec. 129 hereof.\n131. The caveator may by notice in writing to the registrar withdraw his caveat at any time; but notwithstanding such withdrawal the court or judge may order the payment by the caveator of the costs of the caveatee incurred prior to such withdrawal.\n132. A memorandum shall be made by the registrar upon the certificate of title and upon the duplicate certificate of the withdrawal, lapse or removal of any caveat or of any order made by the court or a judge in connection therewith.\n2. After such withdrawal, lapse or removal it shall not be lawful for the same person or for any one on his behalf to lodge a further caveat in relation to the same matter unless by leave of the judge. 133. Any person lodging or continuing any caveat wrongfully, and without any reasonable cause, shall be liable to make compensation to any person who has sustained damage thereby.\n2. Such compensation with costs may be recovered by proceedings at law if the caveator has withdrawn such caveat and no proceedings have been taken by the caveatee as herein provided.\n3. If proceedings have been taken by the caveatee then the compensation and costs shall be determined by the court or judge acting in the same proceedings.\nThe rules laid down here can give rise to no difficulty. Under section 129, the owner or other person interested in a lot of land may by summons call upon the caveator to attend before a judge to shew cause why the caveat should not be withdrawn, or he may, under section 130, require the registrar to notify the caveator that such caveat shall lapse at the expiration of 30 days from the mailing of the notice by the registrar, unless, within 30 days, the caveator shall file with the registrar an order made by the judge providing for the continuing of the caveat beyond the 30 days, and if such order is not filed, the caveat shall lapse and shall be treated as lapsed by the registrar.\nThe notice in question was given under section 130. The caveator first obtained an order of the court continuing the caveat until further order, but a subsequent order continued the caveat for 35 days from the 8th of October, 1915, and ordered that in default of the caveator taking proceedings during this term, the caveat should be vacated. No proceedings having been taken by the caveator during the 35 days I am of the opinion that his caveat fully lapsed. The permission subsequently granted him by the Supreme Court en banc to file a new caveat\u2014permission which was required under section 132\u2014and the filing of the caveat could only operate from the date of the new caveat and could not affect the prior registered mortgage of the appellant. But the respondent relies on the knowledge acquired by the appellant at the time it took its mortgage from Phillips of the rights represented by the Barlow caveat as first filed, and the respondent contends that it would be \"against conscience\" or equivalent to fraud to thus acquire a right in land with knowledge of the existing unregistered rights of the respondent. Many cases are cited in this connection, but I cannot but think that they are without application in view of sec. 162 of \"The Saskatchewan Land Titles Act,\" (R.S. Sask. 1909, c. 41) which section is, in my opinion, a complete answer to the respondent's contention.\nThis section reads as follows:\u2014\n162. No person contracting or dealing with or taking or proposing to take a transfer, mortgage, incumbrance or lease from the owner of any land for which a certificate of title has been granted shall, except in case of fraud by such person, be bound or concerned to inquire into or ascertain the circumstances in or the consideration for which the owner or any previous owner of the land is or was registered or to see to the application of the purchase money or of any part thereof, nor shall he be affected by notice direct, implied or constructive, of any trust or unregistered interest in the land any rule of law or equity to the contrary notwithstanding.\n2. The knowledge that any trust or unregistered interest is in existence shall not of itself be imputed as fraud.\nIn this connection, but of course not an authority, but merely as shewing that the registration laws of the different provinces are not so far apart, I might refer to art. 2085 of the Quebec Civil Code, the application of which has never given rise to any difficulty, and which reads as follows:\u2014\n2085. The notice or knowledge acquired of an unregistered right belonging to a third party and subject to registration cannot prejudice the rights of a subsequent purchaser for valuable consideration whose title is duly registered, except when such title is derived from an insolvent trader.\nI, however, base entirely my opinion on section 162 of \"The Land Titles Act,\" and I take it that the knowledge acquired by the appellant of the unregistered interest of the respondent cannot, of itself, be imputed as fraud. The registration by the appellant of the mortgage acquired by it from Phillips was certainly not a fraudulent act, for if the Barlow caveat had been maintained by the court the appellant's mortgage would have been subject to the rights represented by this caveat. And it certainly cannot be contended that the appellant committed a fraudulent act by availing itself of the right granted by sec. 130 of \"The Land Titles Act\" to any person claiming an interest in a lot of land to test the validity of a caveat lodged in the land titles office. If Barlow or the respondent allowed the caveat to lapse, no fault or fraud can be imputed to the appellant, but the respondent suffers by reason of its own negligence.\nThe learned judges of the Court of Appeal who have found in favour of the respondent observe that if the opinion I feel constrained to adopt is to be followed, Barlow would be in a worse position by filing a caveat than if he had relied on the equitable doctrine that the knowledge of his right by the appellant prevented the latter from acquiring priority as against his interest in the land in question.\nI am not at all sure in view of sec. 162 that Barlow would have been in a better position had he not filed the caveat, a point on which it is unnecessary to express any opinion. He has, however, filed a caveat to protect his rights and he, therefore, has put himself entirely under \"The Land Titles Act.\" The respondent has, moreover, since the first caveat lapsed and it was refused reinstalment, filed a new caveat which is subsequent in date to the registration of the appellant's mortgage. I think, therefore, that the statute entirely governs the parties in this case, and it is clear to my mind that the appellant is entitled to preference.\nThe learned Chief Justice of Saskatchewan cites certain maxims coming, I think, originally from the Roman Law with which, as a civilian, I am familiar, such as nemo dot qui non habet, or qui prior est tempore potior est jure But I may say with deference that these maxims are not of universal application, and when third parties are concerned they cannot be applied without some qualification. It might, moreover, be possible to offset axiom by axiom and to refer to the one so often mentioned by the old jurists, vigilantibus non dormientibus scripta est lex. I prefer, however, to rest on the clear text of the statute, and I take it as being eminently desirable, in the interest of the security of land transactions in a system where registration of titles to land is provided for, that the entries in the public register, in the absence of fraud, be taken as conclusive. Here the respondent failed to register its assignment and even to protect its caveat when it was called upon in the manner prescribed for by \"The Land Titles Act\" to do so. I cannot, under the circumstances of this case, come to its assistance.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored with costs throughout.\nCassels J.\u2014I concur in the reasons and result arrived at by Mr. Justice Mignault.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: F.

H. Clarke K.C. for the respondent. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014For the reasons given by Chief Justice Macdonald and Mr. Justice Martin in the Appeal Court, which are together quite satisfactory to me, I think this appeal must fail and should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The answers to the only questions raised herein depend upon the construction of the lease. I am of the opinion that the learned trial judge and the Court of Appeal have correctly construed the same.\nThe language used in expressing the agreement of the parties might have been more explicit, but I do not think it difficult to understand and accurately determine its meaning, if we pay attention to the business the parties had on hand.\nI do not think we can help the solution of the problems presented by paying attention to the business which some other parties long ago had in hand and the language they used relevant thereto.\nIt is quite clear the parties postponed for nearly five years the settlement of the terms of a renewal lease and depended for the protection of their respective self\u2014interests upon the development by work to be done within the meaning of the contract as likely to ensure a renewal upon reasonable terms. For who could imagine a lessor as being likely to pay $15,000 for the privilege of refusing a lease upon reasonable terms?\nThis lessor did so refuse and imagined he could by devious methods escape paying the $15,000. And he has thereby started the amusing exhibitions of dialectical skill necessary to enable him to hope to escape the consequences of so doing.\nThe meaning of the word \"fixtures\" in the clause which has been for convenience sake numbered five, but not so in the instrument, is prim\u00e2 facie more fairly arguable.\nSeeing, however, that the operation of the whole scheme was expressly made dependent upon the following paragraph in clause 2\nProvided, however, that the plan and specifications of any such alterations or additions shall be first submitted to and approved by the lessor;\nand seeing further that he paid, as is admitted, $5,000 on account of such work and there is not pretended to have ever been any other \"plans and specifications\" than those adduced in evidence, I accept them as an infallible guide and especially so when coupled with the later conduct of the lessor and his language in his correspondence as to \"fixtures.\"\nThese plans and specifications seem to have no relation to such fixtures as now in question, and hence any claim in respect of their removal must be founded upon something else which is not discoverable in the lease when read in light of the law relevant to trade fixtures owned by a tenant.\nHow a lessor so keenly alive to his selfish desires as appellant seems to have been failed to object to their removal, done openly under his own eyes or those of his agent, surprises me. And his solicitor's failure to recognize the possibility of claiming therefor, till over a year after the pleadings were closed, indicates how little either expected from such a claim.\nAnd even when amended then, I incline to think as urged by respondent's counsel, he failed to rest the claim upon the right ground in law if such had ever had any foundation in fact.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014For the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Martin I am satisfied that the failure to renew the respondent's lease entitled him to recover the $15,000 in question in this action. If reasonableness of conduct were a consideration that should enter into the matter I would agree with the view of the Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal\nthat the lessee (had) bon\u00e2 fide endeavoured to bring about an agreement on reasonable terms of renewal.\nThe construction placed by the learned dissenting Justice of Appeal on the provision for renewal, with respect, seems to me to be so unreasonable that it is inconceivable that it is what the parties intended.The language used certainly does not require such a construction. In my opinion it scarcely admits of it.\nI also concur in the view of the Chief Justice that the learned trial judge came to the right conclusion as to the construction of what he terms the 5th clause of the lease, which immediately follows the short form covenant for quiet enjoyment, and that the respondent was entitled to remove the tenant's fixtures which it took away from the premises. They formed no part of the \"alterations to the front\" and\nalterations and additions to the interior of the building\nfor which the appellant agreed to pay a sum not exceeding $20,000 in the event of non\u2014renewal. Applying the rule noscitur a sociis the word \"fixtures\" in the clause of the lease in question, having regard to the improvements and alterations with which it is connected, must be restricted to what are ordinarily known as landlords' fixtures.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014This is an action by a lessee to recover the value of improvements made upon the property leased. The lease was for five years from the 1st April, 1909 and was concerning premises in Vancouver known as the Braid Building. It could be renewed at the lessee's option on terms to be agreed upon and by his giving three months' notice in writing of his desire to renew. The rent was $12,000 a year.\nBy the lease, the lessee, who is the respondent, agreed to make certain alterations necessary for the requirements of his business and to adapt the other portions of the premises as hotel rooms, since only a portion of the ground floor and basement was used by the respondent for his business.\nIt was stipulated that the alterations and plans should be submitted to and approved by the lessor, and it was further agreed that the lessor would pay the lessee during the second year of the term a sum of $5,000 in connection with those improvements.\nClause 4 of the lease, which is the one the construction of which has occasioned this litigation, reads as follows:\u2014\nIn the event of a renewal of this lease not being granted for a further term of five years as aforesaid, then in such case, but not otherwise, the lessor shall pay to the lessee at the end of the term hereby granted, the balance of the actual cost to the lessee of such alterations and additions over and above the said sum of Five Thousand Dollars ($5,000). Provided, however, that such total cost shall not in any case exceed the sum of Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000).\nExtensive alterations were made and approved by the lessor. Those alterations are estimated. by the respondent as having cost a much larger sum than the $20,000 stipulated as being the amount which should be paid for those alterations in case the renewal of the lease should not be granted.\nThe notice required by the lease was given by the lessee, that he was willing to renew the lease. Negotiations went on and were being carried out until a few days before the lease expired, but the parties were never able to agree. The lessee then had to vacate the premises and has instituted the present action to recover the $15,000 which was stipulated in that clause 4.\nThere is no doubt that the parties contemplated a renewal lease for a further period of five years if they could agree as to the terms; but in the case they would not agree as to the terms, or in the case where a new lease would not be granted, then, in such a case, what should be done with regard to the improvements?\nThe parties agreed that if a renewal would take place, the benefit of the alterations enjoyed by the lessee and the $5,000 already paid by the lessor would be sufficient to cover those alterations and the lessee would have no further claim as to them. But if there was no renewal, then I construe the lease as meaning that the lessor is bound to pay the balance of the sum stipulated for the value of the alterations.\nAnother question was raised as to some fixtures to the value of $8,000, which had been put in by the respondent on the premises and which were of the category of fixtures called tenant's fixtures.\nThe appellant claims that he is entitled to those fixtures.\nI think, on the contrary, that the fixtures mentioned in the lease which could be retained by him are those alterations and fixtures provided by the contract itself and not the fixtures which the lessee might bring in. Clause 5, relied upon by the appellant to substantiate his contention, mentions at first in general terms\nall improvements, alterations and fixtures;\nbut the reference in the latter part of the clause to the payments made on account of those improvements shews conclusively that what the parties intended to cover was not the tenant's fixtures but those improvements included in the formal covenant, viz., those which the lessee undertook to make with approval of the lessor.\nFor those reasons, I am of opinion that the plaintiff (respondent) was entitled to claim the $15,000, and that the judgment rendered in his favour below should be confirmed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The contract which has given rise to this litigation is in truth a singular one.\nThe appellant, on the 1st February, 1911, leased to the respondent a certain building in Vancouver for a term of five years at a rental of $1,000 per month, the lessee to have the privilege\nof renewing said term for a further term of five years from the first day of April, 1916, upon such terms as may be mutually agreed upon between the parties hereto, and further upon the lessee giving to the lessor a notice in writing of the lessee's desire to renew same as aforesaid, which said notice shall be given at least three months before the expiration of the term hereby granted.\nIt was stipulated that the lessee should make\nsuch alterations to the front, and such alterations and additions to the interior of the building hereby demised as in the opinion of the lessee shall be necessary for the requirements of its business, provided, however, that the plans and specifications of any such alterations and additions shall be first submitted to and approved by the lessor.\nIt was agreed that the lessor would pay to the lessee, during the second year of the term of the lease, the sum of $5,000,\nwhich sum shall be accepted by the lessee in full of all claims and demands of the lessee against the lessor for any and all alterations hereafter made to the building by the lessee as aforesaid.\nNotwithstanding this specific stipulation, however, the lease immediately added that\nin the event of a renewal of this lease not being granted for a further term of five years as aforesaid, then in such a case, but not otherwise, the lessor shall pay to the lessee at the end of the term hereby granted, the balance of the actual cost to the lessee of such alterations and additions over and above the said sum of $5,000. Provided, however, that such total cost shall not in any case exceed the sum of $20,000.\nThe parties could very well expect trouble under such a contract. The renewal clause, leaving as it did the terms and conditions of renewal to be determined by a future agreement of the parties, really gave no right of renewal to the lessee, for a disagreement as to these terms and conditions was a more likely contingency than an agreement. But, on the other hand, it was possibly thought by the lessee that he could nevertheless go ahead and make expensive alterations and additions, in the expectation of recovering from the lessor the value of the alterations and additions up to the sum of $20,000 (including the $5,000 already paid by the lessor), should the latter not grant a renewal of the lease on terms acceptable to the lessee.\nOn the 28th December, 1915, the respondent gave formal written notice to the appellant of his desire to renew the lease, and that he was ready and willing to enter into negotiations with a view to the settlement of the terms of such renewal. Some correspondence followed and finally, on the 2nd March, 1916, the appellant stated as his terms of renewal of the lease for the premises as a whole (apparently the whole block), $850 per month for the balance of that year, and for the ensuing period of four years, $1,000 per month. The respondent demurred to this, and on 23rd March proposed a renewal at a rental of $500 per month, offering whatever it could get out of the upstairs and basement in addition, adding, that if this were not satisfactory, it would be willing to leave the matter to arbitration. In a subsequent letter of 27th March, the respondent repeated this offer, and stated that if it were not accepted, the respondent would expect to receive the sum of $15,000 under the provisions of the lease.\nBoth of the parties adhered to the position they had respectively taken until finally, on the 28th April, the appellant accepted the offer he had previously refused of a renewal at a rental of $500 per month, but this proposal was refused by the respondent which had previously given notice to the appellant of its intention to move out of the premises.\nThe present action was taken by the respondent (lessee) against the appellant (lessor) demanding, because the parties had failed to agree as to the terms of renewal of the lease and the lessor had not granted a renewal of the same, that the appellant pay him $15,000 for the balance of the cost of the alterations and additions, the total cost of which was approximately $39,000. His action was maintained by the learned trial judge, Mr. Justice Gregory, and this judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice McPhillips dissenting.\nThe right of action of the respondent depends on the construction of the lease, and notwithstanding the somewhat singular and almost conflicting provisions of this lease, it does not seem impossible to arrive at a construction which will give effect to what I take to have been the intention of the parties. The premises rented by the appellant required considerable alterations to make them suitable for the respondent's business, and the appellant had agreed to contribute at all events the sum of $5,000 to the cost of these alterations and additions, thereby indicating that they enhanced the value of his building. On the other hand, it was also considered that if the lease were not renewed for a further term of five years, the lessee should be further compensated for his improvements, and the extent to which the lessor should contribute to the payment of the same was fixed at an amount not exceeding $15,000, over and above the $5,000 he had already paid. It is true that for the renewal of the lease an agreement of the parties as to the terms and conditions on which the renewal would be granted was necessary, and the parties evidently considered that these terms and conditions could not be determined in advance, but if the renewal was not granted by the lessor, and if he took possession of the premises with the alterations and additions made by the lessee at the expiration of the lease, it was expressly stipulated that the lessor should pay to the lessee the balance of the actual cost of the alterations and additions over and above the $5,000, not to exceed in the aggregate $20,000.\nIt seems to me entirely immaterial whether the lessor and the lessee, or either of them, were unreasonable in the discussion of terms and conditions of renewal. There was no agreement between them and the renewal term of five years was not granted by the lessor, and he thus came into possession of the leased premises at the expiration of the lease. I think, therefore, that the lessee is clearly entitled to the $15,000, which is no way a penalty against the lessor, but a sum payable to the lessee on a contingency provided for and which has happened. I think also that the offer of the lessor on the 28th April to accept terms of renewal which he had already refused to accept came too late to avail him in this litigation.\nMr. Tilley, on behalf of the appellant, earnestly argued that the respondent had violated the lease by removing certain improvements, alterations and fixtures, and that consequently he could not avail himself of the stipulation concerning the $15,000. In my opinion, nothing was removed by the lessee which does not fairly come under the description of tenant fixtures which the lessee could in any event remove at the expiration of the lease.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: A. H. MacNeill.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lennie, Clarke, Hooper & O'Neill.\n[1] [1918], 3 W.W.R. 587.\n[2] [1917], 3 W.W.R. 966.\n"}

Respondent.\n1919: March. 24; 1919: April. 9.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nCriminal law\u2014Mixed jury\u2014Proceedings in one language only\u2014New trial\u2014Substantial wrong\u2014Art. 1019 Cr. C.\nThe appellant, being tried on an indictment for murder, made a statement, by counsel, that the language of the defence was French; and the trial judge directed the impanelling of a mixed jury. Each of the six French-speaking jurors stated to the court at the time of their selection that they understood and spoke both English and French. The trial proceedings were carried on in the English language. The questions submitted in a reserved case, and on which there was a dissent in the Court of King's Bench, are: (1) The trial judge had not summed up the case to the jury in the French language; (4) the trial judge had commented \"upon the failure of the prisoner'' (who was a witness on his own behalf) \"to testify that he had not actually committed the murder.\"\nHeld, Brodeur J. dissenting, that, even assuming these grounds to be errors in law constituting, \"something not according to law * * * done at the trial or some misdirection given,\" the conviction should not be set aside, as \"in the opinion of the court\" no \"substantial wrong or miscarriage\" has been \"thereby occasioned\" to the appellant. (Sec. 1019 Cr. C.)\nPer Anglin and Mignault JJ.\u2014Though the terms of the trial judge's charge may be open to criticism, the prisoner's evidence was open to comment by him as that of any other witness.\nPer Idington, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\u2014After the election by the accused for and the empanelling of a mixed jury, he had a right to have the case conducted in both English and French.\nPer Brodeur J. dissenting:\u2014The failure by the trial judge to have summed up the case in French constituted a \"substantial wrong\" to the appellant: the conviction should be set aside and a new trial ordered.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec,[1] affirming the judgment of the trial court, with a jury, at Bryson, District of Pontiac.\nThe accused, appellant, was found guilty of murder but he prayed for a case to be reserved for the Court of King's Bench.\nThe questions submitted in the reserved case stated by the trial judge and the circumstances of the case are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nW. K. McKeown K.C. and A. J. McDonald for the appellant.\nErnest Gaboury for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I have carefully read and considered the reasons for their judgment in this case given by the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench and weighed carefully the able argument presented at bar by Mr. McKeown on the prisoner's behalf.\nThe Chief Justice of the Court of King's Bench having dissented from the judgment of the majority of that court on the first and fourth questions reserved, this appeal comes before us and is limited to those two questions.\nAssuming for the purpose of the argument that the failure of the trial judge to charge the jury in both languages, French and English, brings the case within section 1019 of the Criminal Code as \"something not according to law done at the trial,\" we are by that section expressly prohibited from setting aside the conviction or directing a new trial unless in our opinion \"some substantial wrong or miscarriage\" was occasioned thereby.\nI am quite clear in my judgment that under the special facts and circumstances of this case no such \" substantial wrong or miscarriage\" was so occasioned at the trial to the prisoner either in the fact of the trial judge not having summed up the case to the jury in French nor in the fact of his having commented \"upon the failure of the prisoner\" (who had elected to give evidence) \"to testify to the effect that he had not actually committed the murders mentioned in the indictment.\"\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014I agree so entirely with the reasoning of Mr. Justice Cross in his opinion given in the court below that I adopt same so far as applicable to that part of the reserved case presented for our consideration. I only desire to add a few words thereto, suggested to my mind by the argument for appellant insisting upon everything said in evidence being translated and addresses repeated in two languages.\nI not only dissent from the view expressed by the learned Chief Justice relative to the first question submitted, but also submit with great deference that the adoption of such a rule as he suggests in such a case as now in question, where everyone concerned assumed, throughout a long trial that the jurors understood the English language used, might be fraught with injury to an accused. There is no other class of criminal trials which produces such a strain upon the minds of those concerned as does a trial for murder. There would inevitably result, from a repetition in two languages of all that was expressed, a prolongation of the trial tending to fatigue and inattention on the part of the jurors and possibly a confusion of thought which tiresome reiteration is apt to produce.\nThe just rights of an innocent man might be needlessly jeopardized in such a case. The statutory right given an accused and now in question had originally a deeper import than the mere right to the use of the two languages. The latter right in substance is recognized in the due and proper administration of justice wherever and whenever, and so far as necessary; though not carried to the extent that the law in question does relative to the selection of a jury.\nThe right to a jury de medietate linguae is entirely of English origin, tracing back to Edward I., and so clearly formed part and parcel of English law that I imagine it was by reason thereof that it became law in so many of the United States, until abolished in all save Kentucky. If, instead of what happened by steps needless to dwell upon here, the English law had finally become the law of all Canada as result of the Conquest, it would have been as, of course, part thereof, but the final settlement of that vexed question carried with it modifications of the French law, of which this is one and it, no doubt, was intended to protect him accused from racial prejudices in the jury panel. To impose upon him accused and thus protected the additional risks I have adverted to, when and so far as needless, might tend to force him to waive his privilege, when standing in need of its exercise, for no other reason than that he might desire and need the sympathetic hearing of those of his own or like origin to counteract the possible prejudice of those of another origin.\nI do not think he should be driven to make such a choice. At the same time I must not be understood as implying any limitation upon his right to insist, if so advised, upon the two languages being used throughout the trial.\nIf well advised, common sense will generally govern him and his counsel in regard to the exercise of any such rights. And the court must always be ready to accede to his wishes, as I have no doubt it did herein.\nI cannot imagine that any wrong or miscarriage of justice ensued herein by reason of the course pursued at the trial; with the concurrence of all concerned,\nThe case was not one that, so far as we are informed, needed anything but the ordinary conversational skill in use of language to apprehend what was said.\nCases are conceivable in which terms might be used calling for more than that degree of skill. Then, of course, care must be taken that each set of jurors fully understands the import of what is said.\nIn cases of trial for murder, where there is a possible alternative, of the crime being reduced to one of manslaughter, it frequently happens that nice distinctions of law need to be observed and in explaining such distinctions it might be well for a judge charging a jury to make such distinctions clearly understood by using both languages, lest a juror might not understand same when addressed in another than his mother tongue, even if he had acquired the facility of carrying on an ordinary conversation in another language. But in a murder trial such as this happened to be where it was inevitably either murder or nothing, all the jurors had to understand was the statement of plain ordinary every-day facts.\nI am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed.\nAnglin J.\u2014The facts of this case sufficiently appear in the judgments delivered in the Court of King's Bench. The appeal to this court was confined to two of the four questions submitted by the reserved case\u2014 the first and the fourth\u2014on which the learned Chief Justice of Quebec dissented from the majority view in the Court of King's Bench adverse to the prisoner. The first question is as follows:\u2014\nHaving regard to the facts, that the accused elected to be tried by a jury composed of one-half of persons skilled in the French language, and that the jury in question was in fact composed one-half of persons skilled in the said French language, was there error of law on the part of the presiding judge, occasioning substantial wrong or miscarriage, in not having summed up the case to the jury in the French language in addition to the summing up made in the English language?\nOn the reserved case submitted, it may properly be assumed that the appellant was entitled to be tried by.\na jury composed for the one-half at least of persons skilled in the language of his defence\n(in this case French), that upon arraignment he duly demanded such a jury (27 & 28 Vict., ch. 41, sec. 7, subsec. 2), and that at least six members of the jury impanelled were\nfound in the judgment of the court to be skilled\nin the French language.\nI am inclined to agree with the learned Chief Justice of Quebec that\nafter the election of the accused for a mixed jury, and after the impanelling of such a mixed jury, the case should have been conducted in both languages.\nThat, in my opinion, was a right of the accused implied by the statute. If not, its object would be purely sentimental and no right real and substantial in character would be conferred by it. There is not a little in the record to indicate tacit consent by the accused to the trial being conducted entirely in English. The learned Chief Justice questions the sufficiency of this consent although apparently of the view that\nthe consent of the accused expressly obtained and recorded\nwould have justified that course being adopted. I find it unnecessary to pass upon this aspect of the case.\nNo question is presented as to the effect of the omission to translate into French the evidence given in English. The question submitted is confined to the failure of the trial judge to repeat his charge or summing up in French.\nAssuming in favour of the appellant that the omission to repeat, at least in substance, the charge or summing up was error in law, it would have constituted\nsomething not according to law * * * done at the trial\nand would justify setting aside the conviction and ordering a new trial only if\n\"in the opinion of the court of appeal some substantial wrong or miscarriage was thereby occasioned on the trial.\"\nof the court of appeal some substantial wrong or miscarriage was thereby occasioned on the trial.\" Crim. Code, sec. 1019. I cannot accede to the contention of counsel for the appellant that, because the error complained of was one of omission and not of commission, it is not within the purview of section 1019. The omission of that which should have been done, made that which was done \"something not according to law,\" and, therefore, a matter to which the section applies. The question submitted properly so assumes.\nThe stated case informs us that\neach and every one of the jurors stated to the court at the time of their selection that they understood and spoke both languages. When the first witness speaking English gave his evidence, the French-speaking jurors were asked by the court if they understood the evidence, and they all replied that they did. The Crown prosecutor, in explaining the case to the jurors spoke only in English, and Mr. McDonald, attorney for the accused, in addressing the jury after the evidence had been received, spoke only in English, He was followed by Mr. Gaboury, Crown prosecutor, who addressed the jury in English only and was followed by the presiding judge who addressed the jury in English only. No objection was made by the defence and no request preferred that the charge of the jury be repeated in French.\nIt was also stated at bar that the accused himself gave his evidence wholly in English.\nHaving regard to all these facts, I agree with Mr. Justice Pelletier that the accused suffered no prejudice \u2014that no substantial wrong or miscarriage was occasioned on the trial\u2014by the failure of the trial judge to repeat in French his entire summing up or the substance of it.\nThe affidavits of some jurors tendered by the appellant are, in my opinion, inadmissible and I have not considered them for any purpose.\nThe fourth question reserved is as follows:\u2014\nWas there error of law occasioning substantial wrong or miscarriage in that the judge who presided commented upon the failure of the prisoner to testify to the effect that he had not actually committed the murders mentioned in the indictment?\nAlthough the dissent of the Chief Justice is in terms confined to the first and fourth questions the reasons which he assigns rather indicate that he was not entirely satisfied that the third question should be answered in the negative. Perhaps, however, broadly construed\u2014and I so deal with it\u2014the fourth question may cover the ground of objection which the learned Chief Justice had in mind when he said:\u2014\nIn his address the judge said to the jurors that the accused did not dare to swear that he did not kill the murdered man. Such a comment, in my opinion, is against the spirit of the law. It was not a fair comment and it was of a nature to cause a substantial wrong and miscarriage of justice.\nThe prisoner having testified on his own behalf his evidence was open to comment and observation by the presiding judge in addressing the jury as was that of any other witness. Mr. Justice Cross disposed satisfactorily of this branch of the case. Dealing with the third question, he says of the portion of the charge to which the learned Chief Justice takes exception:\u2014\nIt is to be observed that the jurors were there to hear the evidence and that if there were inaccuracies upon the facts in what the judge said they would not constitute misdirection unless it could be said that they had, or were likely to have, some such effect as to lead the jury to think that some question which they ought to consider was in law excluded from their consideration, or otherwise mislead them as to the law. Whatever may be thought of the learned trial judge's charge from other points of view, however open to criticism it may be as a departure from the standard of impartiality which judges entrusted with the administration of the criminal law in the English courts have thought it proper to adopt, I cannot find in it any error of law such as may properly be made the subject of a reserved case under arts. 1014 et seq. of the Criminal Code. I entirely agree, however, with Mr. Justice Pelletier's observation:\u2014\nIl est \u00e9vident que le juge a tenu un language \u00e9nergique, pour ne pas dire plus, mais il n'y avait dans tout cela aucune direction erron\u00e9e sur aucun point de droit, et je ne crois pas que cela puisse faire annuler le verdict.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, fails.\nBrodeur J. (dissenting).\u2014L'appelant, Veuillette, a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable de meurtre et a demand\u00e9 au juge qui pr\u00e9sidait \u00e0 son proc\u00e8s de r\u00e9server certaines questions pour la d\u00e9cision de la cour d'appel, et notamment celle de savoir si dans le cas o\u00f9 il y a un jury mixte le juge doit faire son allocution (charge) dans les deux langues.\nLe juge ayant refuse cette demande, Veuillette s'est adress\u00e9 \u00e0 la couy d'appel pour obtenir l'autorisation d'appeler de cette d\u00e9cision. Il a produit au soutien de sa demande les affidavits de quatre jur\u00e9s de langue fran\u00e7aise qui ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 n'avoir qu'une connaissance imparfaite de l'anglais; et Fun d'eux, le nomm\u00e9 Demers, a m\u00eame ajout\u00e9:\u2014\nIl y a beaucoup de choses qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 dites pendant le proc\u00e8s de Veuillette et dans la charge au jury du juge Weir que je n'ai pas comprises.\nLa cour d'appel a accord\u00e9 sur cette preuve la permission d'appeler (art. 1015 Code Criminel).\nQuatre questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumises \u00e0 la Cour d'Appel. La premi\u00e8re est dans les termes suivants:\u2014 Having regard to the facts that the accused elected to be tried by a jury composed one-half of persons skilled in the French language, and that the jury in question was in fact composed one-half of persons skilled in the said French language, was there error of law on the part of the presiding judge, occasioning substantial wrong or miscarriage, in not having summed up the case to the jury in the French language in addition to the summing up made in the English language?\nEn vertu de la loi actuellement en force dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, o\u00f9 ce proc\u00e8s criminel a eu lieu, le pr\u00e9venu, s'il est fran\u00e7ais ou anglais, peut demander, lors de sa mise en accusation, un jury mixte\net alors il sera jug\u00e9 par un jury compos\u00e9 pour moiti\u00e9 au moins des personnes qui * * * seront * * * vers\u00e9es dans la langue du pr\u00e9venu. (1864, 27-28 Vict., ch. 41, sec. 7).\nComme on le voit par le texte m\u00eame du statut, c'est un droit absolu pour un anglais ou un fran\u00e7ais dans la province d'\u00eatre jug\u00e9 par six au moins de ses concitoyens qui parlent sa langue m\u00e1ternelle. Ce n'est pas m\u00eame laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 la discr\u00e9tion du juge de d\u00e9cider s'il y a eu lieu ou non d'accorder cette demande du pr\u00e9venu pour un jury mixte. C'est un droit absolu et incontestable. Et du moment qu'il manifeste ce d\u00e9sir, le juge est tenu d'en prendre note et de voir \u00e0 ce que le jury soit mixte.\nCette l\u00e9gislation n'est pas nouvelle. Elle remonte aux premiers jours de la domination anglaise. En 1764 le gouverneur Murray, dans son ordonnance du 17 septembre, d\u00e9clarait que\nIn all tryals in this court, all His Majesty's subjects in the Colony to be admitted on juries without distinction.\nLes canadiens de langue anglaise se sont trouv\u00e9s fort m\u00e9contents de voir que cette ordonnance mettait les anglais et les fran\u00e7ais sur le m\u00eame pied; et, dans un m\u00e9moire en date du 16 octobre 1764, ils disaient que\npersons professing the religion of the Church of Rome * * * have been empannelled on Grand and Petty Jurys even where two protestants were parties.\nIls rappelaient cette disposition de la loi James the Third, ch. 5, sec. 8, qui d\u00e9clarait que no papist * * * shall practice the Common Law as a Chancellor Clerk, Attorney or Solicitor, etc.,\net ils concluaient en disant:\u2014\nWe therefore believe that the admitting of persons of the Roman Religion * * * as jurors is an open violation of our most sacred Laws & Libertys and tending to the utter subversion of the Protestant Religion & His Majesty's Power, authority, right & possession of the province to which we belong.\n(Constitutional Documents, Shortt & Doughty, p. 154.)\nLeurs plaintes furent referees en Angleterre o\u00f9 les officiers de la couronne d\u00e9cid\u00e8rent que les catholiques pouvaient agir comme jur\u00e9s. Et en 1766, le 1er juillet, une nouvelle ordonnance, destin\u00e9e \u00e0 faire dispara\u00eetre la plainte des anglais qu'ils \u00e9taient expos\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre jug\u00e9s par des jur\u00e9s tous fran\u00e7ais a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9e d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant que dans les actions\nbetween British-born subjects and Canadians, the juries are to be composed of an equal number of each, if it be required by either of the Parties.\nShortt & Doughty, idem, p. 173.\nLe jury mixte \u00e9tait \u00e9tabli et ce sur les repr\u00e9sentations et \u00e0 la demande des canadiens de langue anglaise. Nous retrouvons le principe de cette l\u00e9gislation dans nos Statuts Refondus du Bas-Canada, dans la section 31 du ch. 84. Ce dernier statut ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 abrog\u00e9 en 1864, la disposition en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 reproduite dans le statut de 1864, 27 & 28 Vict. ch. 41, sec. 7. C'est la loi maintenant en force.\nMaintenant, quelle est l'\u00e9tendue du droit qui \u00e9tait conf\u00e9r\u00e9 aux pr\u00e9venus?\nOn a pr\u00e9tendu que ce droit ne consistait que dans le choix des jur\u00e9s et ne comportait pas l'obligation pour la cour de voir \u00e0 ce que toutes les proc\u00e9dures soient conduites dans les deux langues afin d'\u00eatre bien comprises par tous les membres du jury.\nCe serait, suivant moi, un droit bien illusoire si, malgr\u00e9 le droit qu'aurait un anglais, par exemple, de choisir un jury mixte, il \u00e9tait permis \u00e0 la couronne de faire entendre les t\u00e9moins en langue fran\u00e7aise et de ne pas traduire leurs t\u00e9moignages en anglais de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que la teneur de ces t\u00e9moignages f\u00fbt comprise par les jur\u00e9s de langue anglaise. Cela constituerait un grave d\u00e9ni de justice.\nIl en serait de m\u00eame pour le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 (charge) du juge. Ce dernier devrait voir \u00e0 ce que son allocution soit comprise de tout le jury.\nIl est vrai que la loi est silencieuse sur la mani\u00e8re dont une cause devra \u00eatre conduite devant un jury mixte. Mais je ne veux pas de meilleure interpr\u00e9tation de la loi que cette pratique, constamment suivie depuis plus de cent cinquante ans, que dans le cas de jury mixte les d\u00e9positions des t\u00e9moins sont traduites dans les deux langues et le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du juge est \u00e9galement fait ou traduit en anglais et en fran\u00e7ais.\nLe gouverneur Murray sentait si bien la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 pour les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s de l'administration de la justice de conna\u00eetre les deux langues, que, dans un rapport qu'il faisait aux autorit\u00e9s imp\u00e9riales il se plaignait que\nour chief Judge and Attorney-General are both entirely ignorant of the language of the natives.\nDe fait, quelques mois apr\u00e8s les autorit\u00e9s imp\u00e9riales, sans motiver leurs raisons, rempla\u00e7aient le Juge en Chef et le Procureur General. Shortt & Doughty, idem, p. 178,\nMais on dit: Il n'y a pas eu de protestation dans la cause actuelle quand le juge a omis de parler en fran\u00e7ais, le prisonnier a donn\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage en anglais, son avocat n'a parl\u00e9 qu'en anglais quand il a fait son allocution aux jur\u00e9s, et, de plus, on a demand\u00e9 aux jur\u00e9s fran\u00e7ais s'ils connaissaient l'anglais et ils ont r\u00e9pondu que oui.\nToutes ces circonstances ne sauraient prouver qu'il y a eu acquiescement formel \u00e0 cette ill\u00e9galit\u00e9. Je me demande m\u00eame si dans un proc\u00e8s pour meurtre un acquiescement formel serait suffisant. La loi criminelle exige que dans les proc\u00e8s qui peuvent entra\u00eener la peine capitale toutes les pr\u00e9cautions doivent \u00eatre prises pour que toutes les r\u00e8gles de la proc\u00e9dure soient suivies avec la plus grande rigueur. (Russell on Crimes, vol. 3, p. 2156.)\nNous avons au dossier une preuve \u00e9non\u00e7ant que certain jur\u00e9 n'avait pas une connaissance suffisante de l'anglais pour comprendre tout ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit par le juge et les t\u00e9moins.\nNous avons \u00e9galement au dossier un fait qui ne porte pas, il est vrai, sur la question que je suis \u00e0 examiner, mais qui d\u00e9montre bien l'importance d'avoir tous les t\u00e9moignages bien traduits. L'un des t\u00e9moins donne son t\u00e9moignage en anglais et rapporte une conversation de l'accus\u00e9 qui \u00e9tait cependant tenue en fran\u00e7ais. On lui demande de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter en fran\u00e7ais le texte de cette conversation. Il y a une variante importante. On la signale au t\u00e9moin et il est oblig\u00e9 de dire:\u2014\nThe way they rattle me up is in French and English. I have a little of both and all the words are mixed up.\nCe t\u00e9moignage est des plus importants dans la cause. Nous voyons que la version anglaise donn\u00e9e par le t\u00e9moin de cette conversation incrimine bien plus l'accus\u00e9 que les mots dont ce dernier se serait servi d'apr\u00e8s ce m\u00eame t\u00e9moin quand il rapporte le texte fran\u00e7ais. Ce texte fran\u00e7ais ne para\u00eet pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 traduit en anglais aux jur\u00e9s et nous trouvons dans le dossier le fait que certains jur\u00e9s ne comprenaient pas du tout le fran\u00e7ais.\nTout cela d\u00e9montre l'importance qu'il y a de conduire la cause dans les deux langues et le danger qu'il y a de ne pas le faire. Pour maintenir le verdict, l'intim\u00e9 se base aussi sur le fait que l'avocat de la d\u00e9fense n'a pas parl\u00e9 aux jur\u00e9s en fran\u00e7ais.\nL'accus\u00e9 \u00e9tait \u00e9videmment un adolescent bien pauvre, sans famille et sans protection. Il a trouv\u00e9 dans son jeune d\u00e9fenseur un homme bien d\u00e9vou\u00e9 qui a \u00e9videmment entrepris cette cause sans l'espoir de toucher un sou d'honoraire. Mais, comme cet avocat le dit lui-m\u00eame dans son factum\nhe was a very young member of the bar, and had not then the advantage of the experience which he has since acquired, was lead into the error of following the action of Crown counsel and of the presiding judge.\nJ'en suis venu \u00e0 la conclusion que dans les circonstances le fait pour le juge de ne pas avoir fait son r\u00e9sum\u00e9 dans les deux langues constitue un tort r\u00e9el \u00e0 l'accus\u00e9 (art. 1019 Code Criminel); et en cela je partage l'opinion de l'honorable juge en chef de la province.\nLe jugement a quo qui a r\u00e9pondu n\u00e9gativement \u00e0 la question dont j'ai donn\u00e9 le texte plus haut devrait \u00eatre renvers\u00e9. La sentence devrait \u00eatre annul\u00e9e et un nouveau proc\u00e8s devrait avoir lieu.\nL'appel devrait \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J.\u2014L'appelant, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 coupable de meurtre par un jury dans le district de Pontiac, province de Qu\u00e9bec, aux assises criminelles y tenues en avril 1918, pr\u00e9sid\u00e9es par l'honorable juge Weir, a obtenu de la cour d'appel que quatre questions de droit fussent r\u00e9serv\u00e9es pour l'opinion de la dite cour. Apr\u00e8s avoir entendu le conseil de l'appelant et le conseil comparaissant pour la couronne, la cour d'appel r\u00e9pondit n\u00e9gativement aux questions soumises et confirma le verdict et la sentence de mort prononc\u00e9e contre l'appelant, l'honorable juge en chef exprimant son dissentiment quant aux r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re et \u00e0 la quatri\u00e8me des questions ainsi r\u00e9serv\u00e9es, auxquelles il \u00e9tait d'avis de r\u00e9pondre dans l'affirmative. Ce dissentiment ayant permis un appel devant cette cour, l'appelant nous demande d'infirmer la d\u00e9cision de la cour d'appel, son appel se trouvant restreint aux questions au sujet desquelles l'honorable juge en chef a exprim\u00e9 son dissentiment. Je vais donc me borner \u00e0 ces deux questions, la premi\u00e8re et la quatri\u00e8me.\nPremi\u00e8re Question.\nHaving regard to the facts that the accused elected to be tried by a jury composed one-half of persons skilled in the French language, and that the jury in question was in fact composed one-half of persons skilled in the said French language, was there error of law on the part of the presiding judge occasioning substantial wrong or miscarriage, in not having summed up the case to the jury in the French language in addition to the summing up made in the English language?\nLe droit d'avoir un jury mixte dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu par la loi pass\u00e9e par le parlement du Canada en 1864, 27-28 Vict. ch. 41, sec. 7, sous-section 2, qui se lit comme suit:\u2014\n2. Si le pr\u00e9venu, lors de sa mise en accusation demande un jury compos\u00e9, pour une partie au moins, de personnes parlant la langue de sa d\u00e9fense, si cette langue est le fran\u00e7ais ou l'anglais, il sera jug\u00e9 par un jury compos\u00e9 pour moiti\u00e9 au moins des personnes dont les noms se trouvent successivement les premiers sur le tableau et qui lors de leur comparution n'\u00e9tant pas l\u00e9galement r\u00e9cus\u00e9es seront, d'apr\u00e8s l'opinion de la cour, vers\u00e9es dans la langue du pr\u00e9venu.\nCette disposition l\u00e9gale est en pleine vigueur, et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 que l'abrogation qu'en a pr\u00e9tendu faire la l\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec par la loi 46 Vict. ch. 16, d\u00e9passait la comp\u00e9tence de cette l\u00e9gislature, le droit criminel et la proc\u00e9dure criminelle \u00e9tant du ressort exclusif du parlement canadien. The Queen v. Yancey[2].\nEn 1873 la cour d'appel, compos\u00e9e du juge en chef Duval, et des honorables juges Drummond, Badgley, Monk et Taschereau, a jug\u00e9, dans la cause de Reg. v. Chamaillard[3]:\u2014 That where it is discovered after verdict, in a case of felony, where half of the jury were ostensibly sworn as being skilled in the French language (being that of the prisoner) that one of such half was not skilled in the French language, the trial and verdict are unlawful, null and void, and will be vacated and set aside on a reserved case by the judge in the court below.\nEn 1897, le juge Wurtele a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans la cause de The Queen v. Shehan[4], que\nWhen the accused asks in the Province of Quebec for a mixed jury, it must be granted as a matter of right; the abandonment, by the accused, of the order for a mixed jury is not, however, a matter of right, but may be allowed by the judge.\nPlus tard, dans la cause de The Queen v. Yancey[5], le m\u00eame juge a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que\nThe words \"language of the defence,\" in subsection 2 of section 7 of the statute of the Province of Canada, 27-28 Vict., ch. 41, which is still in force in the Province of Quebec, mean the language of the prisoner, and not the language in which his defence is to be conducted. The privilege of the prisoner is to claim a jury composed for one-half at least of jurors speaking or skilled in his language.\nEnfin, en 1892, la cour d'appel, compos\u00e9e du juge en chef Sir Alexandre Lacoste, et des juges Blanchet, Hall, Wurtele et Ouimet, a jug\u00e9 dans la cause de The King v. Long[6], que\nWhere an English-speaking prisoner in the Province of Quebec is represented at his trial by counsel speaking the French language, and no request is made for a translation of the testimony of French-speaking witnesses into English, for the benefit of the prisoner, failure to so translate as to enable the prisoner to personalty understand the evidence is not a limitation of his right to make \"full answer and defence'' to the charge, and will not invalidate a conviction.\nLe juge Wurtele a parl\u00e9 au nom de la cour d'appel, et on voit qu'il ne s'agissait pas l\u00e0 d'un proc\u00e8s criminel instruit devant un jury mixte, mais du choix librement accept\u00e9 d'un jury compos\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement de personnes de langue fran\u00e7aise. Le cas ne se pr\u00e9sentait pas sous l'operation de la loi 27-28 Vict. ch. 41, et l'opinion du m\u00eame juge dans les causes de The Queen v. Shehan[7], et The Queen v. Yancey[8], fait voir la distinction qui existe entre ces esp\u00e8ces.\nEnfin, je dois mentionner une cause du Manitoba, o\u00f9 le jury mixte existe \u00e9galement, mais dans l'esp\u00e8ce on ne para\u00eet pas avoir proc\u00e9d\u00e9 devant un jury ainsi compos\u00e9. On a y jug\u00e9 (Reg. v. Earl[9]) :\u2014\nThe fact that one of the jury sworn to try the prisoner did not thoroughly understand the English language is no ground, after trial and conviction, for holding that there has been a mistrial, or for granting a new trial.\nIt is too late to challenge a juror after he has been sworn, even if the ground for challenge was not known at the time.\nIgnorance of the English language would not in this province be a ground of challenge of a juror.\nThe provisions of section 746 of the Criminal Code respecting the granting of a new trial, when it is imperative, and when discretionary, explained.\nRevenant maintenant \u00e0 la disposition de la loi 27-28 Vict. ch. 41, il est clair que cette disposition serait illusoire si, dans un proc\u00e8s instruit devant un jury mixte, les t\u00e9moignages n'\u00e9taient pas traduits du fran\u00e7ais en anglais, et r\u00e9ciproquement, et si l'adresse du juge pr\u00e9sidant le proc\u00e8s n'\u00e9tait pas faite, du moins quant \u00e0 ses parties essentielles, dans ces deux langues. Telle a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 la pratique en la province de Qu\u00e9bec, et le savant conseil de l'intim\u00e9 devant nous, Mtre. Gaboury, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une question que je lui ai pos\u00e9e, a admis que cette pratique \u00e9tait aussi suivie dans le district de Pontiac. Je suis donc d'opinion que le prisonnier qui demande un jury mixte a le droit d'avoir un proc\u00e8s instruit dans les deux langues, fran\u00e7aise et anglaise, ce qui comprend bien l'adresse du juge au jury.\nOn invoque le fait que dans cette cause les jur\u00e9s de langue fran\u00e7aise ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 lors de leur assermentation qu'ils comprenaient l'anglais, que lorsque le premier t\u00e9moin a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en anglais, les jur\u00e9s de langue fran\u00e7aise, interrog\u00e9s par le juge, ont r\u00e9pondu qu'ils avaient compris son t\u00e9moignage, que le d\u00e9fenseur du prisonnier avait parl\u00e9 l'anglais dans son plaidoyer au jury, et que le prisonnier lui-m\u00eame avait rendu son t\u00e9moignage en anglais. De l\u00e0 on conclut qu'il y a eu acquiescement du prisonnier \u00e0 l'instruction du proc\u00e8s dans la langue anglaise.\nJ'h\u00e9siterais beaucoup \u00e0 conclure du silence du prisonnier, ou m\u00eame du fait qu'il a donn\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage en anglais, qu'il a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 un droit indubitable qui d\u00e9coule de son choix d'un jury mixte, celui de faire instruire son proc\u00e8s dans les deux langues. Mais puisje dire qu'il y a dans cette cause ce que la question soumise appelle \"substantial wrong or miscarriage,\" sans quoi, aux termes de l'article 1019 du Code Criminel, un nouveau proc\u00e8s ne peut \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9?\nMon honorable coll\u00e8gue, M. le juge Brodeur, signale un point tr\u00e8s important de la cause, les d\u00e8clarations du prisonnier quant \u00e0 ses agissements le jour du meurtre, o\u00f9 un t\u00e9moin lui pr\u00eate des paroles diff\u00e9rentes selon qu'il rapporte ses paroles en anglais ou en fran\u00e7ais, ce qui semble indiquer que le t\u00e9moin ne se rendait pas bien compte du sens de ses expressions quand il parlait une autre langue que la sienne.\nCependant en d\u00e9cidant s'il y a lieu d'ordonner un nouveau proc\u00e8s, nous sommes li\u00e9s par la disposition formelle de l'article 1019. On Code Criminel. Il ne suffit pas, en effet, aux termes de cet article,\nqu'il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait quelque chose de non conforme \u00e0 la loi pendant le proc\u00e8s,\nil faut encore que\nde l'avis de la cour d'appel, il en soit r\u00e9sult\u00e9 quelque tort r\u00e9el ou un d\u00e9ni de justice.\nJe suis bien d'avis qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait quelque chose de non conforme \u00e0 la loi pendant le proc\u00e8s, c'est-\u00e0-dire que l'accus\u00e9 avait droit \u00e0 ce que le proc\u00e8s f\u00fbt instruit dans les deux langues, et \u00e0 ce que l'adresse du juge au jury f\u00fbt faite ou traduite, au moins dans ses parties essentielles, dans les deux langues, mais puisque le Code Criminel exige en outre que je sois d'opinion qu'il en est r\u00e9sult\u00e9 un tort r\u00e9el ou un d\u00e9ni de justice, je ne puis, dans toutes les circonstances de cette cause, aller jusque l\u00e0.\nJe dois donc, et non sans regret, concourir dans la d\u00e9cision de la cour d'appel sur cette premi\u00e8re question.\nQuatri\u00e8me Question,\nWas there error of law occasioning substantial wrong or miscarriage in that the judge who presided commented upon the failure of the prisoner to testify to the effect that he had not actually committed the murders mentioned in the indictment?\nJe r\u00e9pondrai n\u00e9gativement \u00e0 cette question, car puisque le prisonnier a volontairement donn\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage, le juge pouvait faire des commentaires sur ce qu'il avait dit ou omis de dire J'adh\u00e8re pleinement \u00e0 ce que mon honorable coll\u00e8gue, M. le juge Anglin, dit de ces commentaires. Qu'ils aient \u00e9t\u00e9 excessifs, je suis tr\u00e8s respectueusement port\u00e9 \u00e0 le croire, mais il n'y a pas l\u00e0 erreur de droit. Sur ce point donc je partage l'opinion de la majorit\u00e9 de la cour d'appel.\nJe suis d'opinion de renvoyer l'appel.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] Q.R. 28. K.B. 364.\n[2] Q.R. 8 Q.B. 252.\n[3] 18 L.C.

Stanley Weir K.C. for appellant.\nJos. Walsh K.C. for respondent.\nAnglin J.\u2014The defendant moves for leave to inscribe an appeal from the Court of King's Bench (Quebec) on the list for the current term. He was convicted on the 20th of June, 1916, upon an indictment charging him with having committed treason. The \"overt acts\" alleged, and to which evidence was directed, were the sale of tickets, after war was declared in 1914, to certain subjects of Austria-Hungary to enable them to leave Canada en route to Austria-Hungary for the purpose of assisting the Government of that country, a public enemy, and furnishing them for the same purpose with other documents to further their transportation to Austria-Hungary, and counselling them to falsely assume the character of Roumanians. Having been refused a reserved case by the trial judge on the ground that the verdict was against the weight of evidence, the defendant applied to the Court of King's Bench (appeal side) for leave to appeal. His application was dismissed on the 4th of December, 1917, and from that judgment no appeal was taken. When called up for sentence on the 9th of April, 1918, the defendant moved in arrest of judgment on the ground that the indictment did not charge any indictable offence\u2014did not charge him with assisting a public enemy at war with His Majesty, and did not aver overt acts as required by sect. 847 of the Criminal Code\u2014and also that the trial judge had misdirected the jury by instructing them that the accused had assisted the Empire of Austria-Hungary in three ways, whereas the accused was not so charged. By his motion the defendant also asked for a reserved case on these points. That having been refused, he applied to the Court of King's Bench (appeal side) for leave to appeal and for an order directing that a case should be stated submitting these points. His application was dismissed by that' court on the 21st of June, 1918, Lavergne J. dissenting. The alleged misdirection is not noticed in any of the judgments delivered. Indeed, the appeal on that ground was manifestly frivolous, the charge of the learned trial judge having been not merely scrupulously fair, but distinctly favourable to the accused. The majority of the Court of King's Bench dealt with the motion as depending solely on the sufficiency of the indictment, and the dissent of Mr. Justice Lavergne was based on the ground that the acts charged as \"overt acts\" are insufficient because they failed to \"disclose any hostile intention or action\" on the part of the accused. He construed the indictment as charging the purpose of assisting the enemy against the ticket purchasers and not against the defendant. With deference, I think the learned judge was hypercritical. The statement of the purpose of aiding the enemy in the indictment immediately follows the statement that war was and is being prosecuted and carried on between Great Britain and Austria-Hungary \"as the said Israel Schaefer then and there well knew.\" It is in my opinion reasonably clear that the purpose was charged as that of Schaefer, and not that of the ten ticket purchasers. That the evidence was sufficient to support the finding of the existence of that purpose involved in the verdict of \"guilty\" is res adjudicata under the unappealed judgment of the Court of King's Bench of the 4th of December, 1917. When the learned dissenting judge adds that:\nTo assist persons who are not proved to have assisted the enemy in any way cannot surely be regarded as an offence,\nI venture to think he misapprehends the essential elements of the crime of which the defendant has been convicted. That the rendering of actual assistance to the enemy was prevented by the timely intervention of the Canadian authorities is no answer to the charge.\nI am, with respect, unable to appreciate the force of the learned dissenting judge's objection to the sufficiency of the indictment. \"Overt acts\" and a treasonable purpose in committing them are in my opinion charged by it.\nThe appellant is admittedly in gross default in the prosecution of his appeal to this court. No sufficient reason has been shewn for his omission to inscribe it for the October sittings. His failure to inscribe it for the present sittings is still less excusable. While counsel for the Crown does not actively oppose, he declines to consent to indulgence being extended. Under these circumstances, I think the motion before me should be disposed of on considerations similar to those which determine the granting or withholding of special leave to appeal to this court. Such leave is not granted where in the opinion of the court the judgment against which it is sought to appeal is clearly right. Being of the opinion that the judgment of the Court of King's Bench in the present case is so clearly right that an appeal from it would be hopeless, it would appear to be my duty to refuse the defendant's motion.\n[1] Q.

Co. was operating a line of railway between Montreal and St. Johns, P.Q., and the C.V.R. Co. was also operating a line between St. Johns, P.Q., and St. Albans, Vt. An agreement was entered into between the companies \"to operate jointly, and as one line, the railway from Montreal to St. Albans.'' The same train crew was to remain in charge during the trip; but it was provided \"that each party should pay the train and engine men employed in the joint service for the service performed by them on its own line,\" and \"that * * * the rules and regulations of\" either company \"shall apply while the trains are upon the lines of that company.\" A through train, thus operated between St. Albans and Montreal, met with a collision, on the G.T.R.

The respondent's husband, while attending to his duties as locomotive fireman in the service of the Grand Trunk Railway Co., was killed on this company's line, near Montreal, by an engine belonging to the Central Vermont Railway Co. The respondent obtained before the Superior Court at Montreal, from the Grand Trunk Railway Co., a sum of $2,025 under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act,\" but she took another action, under the common law for $25,000 as damages, against the Central Vermont Railway Co., which then formed an action in warranty against the Grand Trunk Railway Co. in pursuance of an agreement to that effect between both companies. The G.T.R. Co. intervened in the principal action and pleaded inter alia that, having paid already to the respondent the sum of $2,025, all her claims had been extinguished. The Central Vermont Railway Co. also contested the action declining any liability. The trial court awarded $10,000 to the respondent and maintained the action in warranty. The Court of King's Bench affirmed this judgment. Eug. Lafleur K.C. and A. E. Beckett K.C. for the appellant: The Central Vermont Railway Company.\nHenri Jodoin K.C. for the appellant: The Grand Trunk Railway Company.\nE. Fabre Surveyer K.C. and C. G. Ogden K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014At the close of the argument in this case, I entertained no doubt that the appeal of the Central Vermont Railway Co. should be allowed and the action against it dismissed.\nThe accident which caused the death of the plaintiff's husband was due to the negligence of the engineer Frost and the question to be determined was whether at the time of the accident he was in the employment of the Central Vermont Railway Co. or that of the Grand Trunk Railway Co.\nThe former company is a foreign one, and its powers within Canada are limited to running its trains from the international border line to St. Johns, in the Province of Quebec.\nAn agreement had been entered into between that company and the Grand Trunk Railway Co. to run a train jointly between St. Albans, U.S.A., and Montreal, via St. Johns, with provisions, amongst others, that the Central Vermont Railway Co. should pay the wages of train crew as far as St. Johns, and the Grand Trunk Railway Co. should pay them from that point to Montreal. The Central Vermont Railway Co was the engineer's employer till the train reached St. Johns. From that point on to Montreal, the Grand Trunk Railway Co. became his employer, paid his wages, and he was under their direct control. The operation of running the train between St. Albans and Montreal was referred to in the agreement between the two companies as a joint one, but in the light of the facts and the limited powers of the Central Vermont Railway Co., it can only be construed as joint in the sense of being a continuous service, one part being controlled by one company and the other part by the other company.\nHaving reached the conclusion that Frost's employer at the time of the accident was the Grand Trunk Railway Co., which alone had power to run trains on that part of the railway track and which company alone paid and was liable to pay his wages, I am of the opinion that the appeals must be allowed and the action against the Central Vermont Railway Co. dismissed with costs throughout if the companies insist upon collecting them.\nIdington J.\u2014The question raised by this appeal must turn upon whether or not the engine driver, Frost, was at the time and place of the accident in question under the control of the Central Vermont Railway Co. or that of the Grand Trunk Railway Co.\nIt seems to me (with deference to those holding otherwise) impossible to say that either in law or in fact he was under the control of the Central Vermont Railway Co., which had no authority in law to run a train to Montreal.\nThese companies simply entered into an agreement for interchange of traffic on a basis which would enable them to constitute a through train and through traffic by means of lending men and cars and engines to the other when the train ran over the other's line.\nThe agreement as drawn seems to shew clearly that such was the purpose had in view. And to put that beyond doubt, it expressly provided that the pay of men engaged in the service, and incidental expenses, and the consequent damages claimed by third parties, arising from the carrying on of the business, should be borne by that company over whose road said men and material travelled.\nMore than that, the rules and regulations of the company owning the road used were to be those governing the traffic carried over it, and could not in law be otherwise.\nAll the stress laid upon the descriptive expressions \"joint line\" and \"to operate jointly\" used in the agreement do not change its character. And if we could make them the governing factors in determining the nature of what the agreement really is, we might find a partnership which would not help the respondent's cause, but defeat it. Indeed, when we consider the contract as a whole we find these expressions are not entirely inapt if correctly applied.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with one set of costs throughout.\nAnglin J.\u2014Having regard to the limitations upon the charter powers of the Vermont Central Railway Co. and to the terms of the agreement between that company and the Grand Trunk Railway Co., I am clearly of the opinion that the engineer Frost was, at the time of the collision which resulted in the death of the plaintiff's husband, in the employment and under the sole control of the latter company. Far from being inconsistent with this view, the weight of the oral evidence, I think, supports it. The operation of the route from St. Albans to Montreal was \"joint\" only in the sense that the service to be provided was continuous. Each railway company retained full control of the traffic over its own line of railway and, so far as appears, over the earnings of that traffic. The case of one company exercising running rights over the tracks of another is entirely different. North bound trains, while running between St. Albans and St. Johns, were Vermont Central trains in the sense that they were run by and under the exclusive control of that company. At St. Johns, they became Grand Trunk trains in the same sense and so continued until they reached Montreal. The members of the train crews, to whichever company they owed general allegiance, while operating on the Grand Trunk Railway Co., were its employees and under its control. That, as Mr. Justice Cross says,\nis the decisive element which engenders responsibility.\nThe Vermont Central Railway Co., though Frost's original employer, cannot be responsible for the consequences of his negligence in the discharge of his duties while the servant of the Grand Trunk Railway Co., as his patron momentan\u00e9.\nI would, therefore, with respect, allow these appeals and dismiss the action\u2014with costs throughout, if asked.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The question in this appeal is whether the engineer Frost was under the control of the Central Vermont Railway Co. or of the Grand Trunk Railway Co. when he caused the accident which resulted in the death of the respondent's husband. The appellants contended that he was under the Grand Trunk Railway Co.'s control. On the other hand, the respondent claims that he was the Central Vermont Railway Co.'s servant.\nThe judges below, with one exception, maintained respondent's contention.\nThe accident occurred on the Grand Trunk Railway Co.'s line near Montreal. The train in charge of the engineer Frost runs between St. Albans and Montreal by virtue of an agreement between the two appellant companies, the Central Vermont Railway Co. and the Grand Trunk Railway Co.\nThe line between St. Albans, Vermont, and St. Johns, P.Q., is the property of the Central Vermont Railway Co.; and the Grand Trunk Railway Co. is the owner of the line between St. Johns, P.Q., and Montreal. In the ordinary course of business, the Central Vermont trains and engines should not go further than St. Johns; and there the passengers would have to change cars and board Grand Trunk cars for Montreal. The crews and engines should also be changed.\nThose interchanges of trains, crews and engines would entail losses of time, inconvenience for the passengers and larger costs of operation. In order to obviate that, the two companies made in 1896 an agreement \"to operate jointly and as one line\" the railway from Montreal to St. Albans for both freight and passenger business. Each contracting party was to furnish a mileage proportion of engines, cabooses and train crews, and was to pay the train and engine men for the services performed by the latter on its own line,\nand neither of the parties hereto shall be held responsible to the other for the actions of such joint employees while upon the line of railway of the other party.\nThe following stipulations were also found in the agreement:\u2014\nThat each of the parties hereto shall assume all liability for loss or damages sustained in operating said trains on its own line,\nand that\nthe rules and regulations of the Grand Trunk Railway Co. shall apply while the trains are upon the lines of that company.\nThe employees were paid on the mileage basis by each company, and they were receiving rates of wages when working on the Central Vermont line different from those paid for working on the Grand Trunk line.\nThe train which caused the accident was a passenger train composed of crews originally engaged by the Grand Trunk Railway Co. or by the Central Vermont Railway Co. The engineer Frost, whose negligence caused the accident, had been originally engaged by the Central Vermont Railway Co.; but in order to take charge of that through train he had to pass an examination before the Grand Trunk Railway Co.'s authorities. The train was composed of a Central Vermont engine and of Grand Trunk cars.\nOnce that train had reached the Grand Trunk line at St. Johns, it became for all intents and purposes a Grand Trunk Railway train. The crews came under the orders of the latter company and under its control. The movements of the train and the actions of its employees were under the orders of the Grand Trunk, and the Central Vermont lost all control over its own original employees, who received their salaries from the company on whose line they were running. Those employees were liable to be dismissed by the latter company and, in fact, that engineer Frost was dismissed by the Grand Trunk Railway Co.\nArt. 1054 C.C. says that a person is responsible for the damage caused by the fault of persons \"under his control.\" At the time of the accident, Frost had ceased to be under the control of the Central Vermont Railway Co., but he was then in the pay of and was employed by the Grand Trunk Railway Co.\nThe liability stipulated by our Code in art. 1054 C.C. against the employer rests upon the right of the latter to supervise and direct the work (Sirey, 1900-1-56).\nIt was, under the contract in question, the duty of the Grand Trunk Railway Co. and not of the Central Vermont Railway Co. to supervise Frost's work and to give him the necessary directions. It has been suggested that he was under the influence of liquor. If that suggestion be correct, then the Grand Trunk Railway Co. was at fault to have had an engineer in that condition while in charge of the train.\nNow the fact that Frost had been hired by the Central Vermont Railway Co. does not alter the situation. As it had been decided by the Court of Cassation, in a case reported in Sirey, 1903-1-104:\u2014\nLa responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9e par Particle 1384 C.N.\n(which corresponds to art. 1054 C.C.).\ns'applique, en cas d'accident survenu par la faute du pr\u00e9pos\u00e9, non pas au patron habituel mais au patron momentan\u00e9 qui avait ce pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 sous ses ordres et sur lequel il avait une autorit\u00e9 exclusive au moment de l'accident. En cons\u00e9quence, c'est le patron momentan\u00e9 qui doit \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 civilement responsable.\nApplying that principle in the present case, I say: The patron habituel of Frost was the Central Vermont Railway Co., but his patron momentan\u00e9, at the time of the accident, was the Grand Trunk Railway Co.\nIt was said by the learned judge of the Superior Court that the contract between the Central Vermont Railway Co. and the Grand Trunk Railway Co. was with regard to the plaintiff and her husband res inter alios acta and could not bind the employees of the respective companies. Of course, in the case of Frost, he could refuse to work for the Grand Trunk Railway Co., since he had been engaged by the Central Vermont Railway Co.; but he was willing to work for the Grand Trunk Railway Co. since he was paid by the latter company.\nAs to the plaintiff herself or her husband, she was bound, in order to recover, to prove and to establish that the servant who caused the accident was employed by the Central Vermont Railway Co. She proved that he was originally hired by the latter company, but it was shewn also that, by virtue of an agreement between the two railway companies and accepted by the employee himself, the latter became a temporary employee under the control of the Grand Trunk Railway Co. It is not a contract inter alios acta; but it is a contract which determines the contractual relations of the parties and which affect also the relations of third parties with those employers and employees.\nA person is a victim of an accident arising out of the construction of a building. The owner of the building has made with an independent contractor an agreement to carry out that construction. That contract is binding upon all those who would suffer from an accident in the course of that contract. If the victim could sue the owner of the building, then the latter could very well decline any liability on the ground that the servant who caused the accident was the contractor's servant; and the contract which he would invoke for that purpose could not be considered as res inter alios acta.\nFor all those reasons I have come to the conclusion that the accident was caused by the negligence of Frost, and when the latter was under the control of the Grand Trunk Railway Co.\nAs to the costs, I am of opinion that the filing of two contestations by the appellants and the taking of two appeals was unnecessary in view of the intimate relations of the appellants and that there should be granted to them the costs of one contestation and of one appeal.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs of one contestation and of one appeal. MIGNAULT J.\u2014Il y a dans cette cause une question de droit et une question de fait.\nLa question de droit souffre moins de difficult\u00e9, parce que la cour d'appel parait avoir pleinement reconnu la doctrine sur laquelle je me base, et, s'il y a erreur dans le jugement qui nous est d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9, ce n'est que sur la question de fait.\nL'action de la demanderesse est bas\u00e9e sur le dernier paragraphe de l'article 1054 du code civil:\u2014\nLes ma\u00eetres et commettants sont responsables du dommage caus\u00e9 par leurs domestiques et ouvriers dans l'ex\u00e9cution des fonctions auxquelles ces derniers sont employ\u00e9s.\nIl n'y a pas de diff\u00e9rence, si ce n'est d'expressions, entre cette disposition et l'article 1384-3\u00b0 du code civil fran\u00e7ais. Nous pouvons donc nous guider d'apr\u00e8s la doctrine fran\u00e7aise.\nJe trouve cette doctrine tr\u00e8s bien expliqu\u00e9e dans une note de Dalloz: 1909-1-135. La d\u00e9cision comment\u00e9e par l'arr\u00eatiste avait jug\u00e9 que\nla responsabilit\u00e9 civile d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9e par l'article 1384 ayant pour fondement tout \u00e0 la fois le libre choix qu'a fait le commettant de ses employ\u00e9s et le droit de leur donner des instructions ou ordres dans l'accomplissement de leurs fonctions, un arr\u00eat peut condamner un commettant comme civilement responsable des fautes de ses employ\u00e9s, mis \u00e0 la disposition d'un tiers, alors qu'il est constat\u00e9 qu'il avait conserv\u00e9 sur eux le droit de surveillance et l'autorit\u00e9.\nCommentant cette d\u00e9cision de la cour de cassation, l'arr\u00eatiste, dont je supprime les renvois, fait observer que\ncette d\u00e9cision tire une cons\u00e9quence logique du fondement reconnu en jurisprudence \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 du commettant \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ses pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s. La jurisprudence d\u00e9cide, en effet, que la responsabilit\u00e9 des commettants ne suppose pas seulement qu'ils ont choisi leurs pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s, mais encore qu'ils ont le droit de leur donner des instructions et des ordres, qu'ils ont un droit de surveillance et.de direction. On doit en conclure que, lorsque le commettant met son pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 la disposition d'un tiers, pour savoir qui, du commettant ou du tiers, est responsable des fautes du pr\u00e9pos\u00e9, il faut rechercher celui qui a le droit de donner des instructions au pr\u00e9pos\u00e9. Si le tiers acquiert ce droit, c'est lui qui est responsable. Mais si, au contraire, comme dans l'esp\u00e8ce ci-dessus, le commettant a conserv\u00e9 l'autorit\u00e9 et le droit de donner des instructions, lui seul est responsable des fautes commises par le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9; il n'y a pas eu d\u00e9placement de la responsabilit\u00e9.\nJ'ai cit\u00e9 l'arr\u00eat qui a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 ces commentaires et o\u00f9 on a jug\u00e9 qu'il n'y avait pas eu d\u00e9placement de la responsabilit\u00e9, parce que, en fait, le commettant avait conserv\u00e9 l'autorit\u00e9 et le droit de donner des instructions.\nDans un autre arr\u00eat de la cour de cassation, au contraire, et vu que le commettant n'avait pas conserv\u00e9 l'autorit\u00e9 et le droit de donner des instructions, on a jug\u00e9 que\nla responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9e par l'article 1384 c. civ. s'applique, en cas d'accident survenu par la faute d'un pr\u00e9pos\u00e9, non pas au patron habituel, mais au patron momentan\u00e9 qui avait ce pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 sous ses ordres, et sur lequel il avait une autorit\u00e9 exclusive au moment de l'accident (Cassation, 26 janvier 1901. Sirey, 1903, 1-104).\nLa distinction est donc bien claire et, comme je l'ai dit, elle n'est pas contest\u00e9e par la cour d'appel. Tout d\u00e9pend de la solution de fait \u00e0 donner \u00e0 la question suivante: Lequel des deux patrons, la compagnie du Vermont Central ou la compagnie du Grand Tronc, avait le nomm\u00e9 Frost sous ses ordres et avait une autorit\u00e9 exclusive \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, au moment de l'accident qui a co\u00fbt\u00e9 la vie au mari de l'intim\u00e9e?\nJusqu'ici je me trouve en plein accord avec la cour d'appel, mais, en r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 cette question de fait, j'ai le regret de ne pouvoir partager l'opinion de la cour sup\u00e9rieure et de la cour d'appel.\nPour d\u00e9terminer laquelle des deux compagnies, la compagnie du Vermont Central ou la compagnie du Grand Tronc, avait le nomm\u00e9 Frost sous ses ordres au moment de l'accident, il faut consulter la convention intervenue entre les deux compagnies. Cette convention n'est pas, comme le savant juge de la cour sup\u00e9rieure le croit, res inter alios acta \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'intim\u00e9e. A la base m\u00eame de toute action qu'elle pourrait intenter en vertu de l'article 1054 C.C., il y a la question de savoir si Frost \u00e9tait le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de la compagnie du Vermont Central au moment de l'accident. Or, on produit la convention entre cette compagnie et la compagnie du Grand Tronc, et cette convention fait voir que d\u00e8s que le convoi du Vermont Central atteignait Saint-Jean en se dirigeant dans la direction de Montr\u00e9al, tous les employ\u00e9s du convoi venaient sous les ordres et autorit\u00e9 exclusifs de la compagnie du Grand Tronc. Peu importe que cet arrangement d\u00e9signe les trains comme \"joint trains,\" ou le service des convois comme \"joint service.\" Chaque compagnie restait ma\u00eetresse absolue chez elle, elle payait les employ\u00e9s pour le travail fait sur sa ligne, et ces employ\u00e9s, pendant qu'ils se trouvaient sur la ligne de l'une des deux compagnies, n'avaient d'ordres \u00e0 recevoir que de cette compagnie seule. Les articles 6 et 12 de la convention en font foi:\u2014\n6th. That each party hereto shall pay the train and engine men employed in the joint service for the service performed by them on its own line, and neither of the parties hereto shall be held responsible to the other for the actions of such joint employees while upon the line of railway of the other party hereto.\n12th. That in operating the said joint service, the rules and regulations of the Grand Trunk Railway company shall apply while the trains are upon the lines of that company, and the rules and regulations of the Central Vermont Railroad Company shall apply while the said trains are upon the lines of that railroad company, but it is understood that the regulations of both companies shall be such as to facilitate the prompt and safe operating of said joint trains.\nL'honorable juge Cross objecte que la compagnie du Vermont Central aurait pu ordonner \u00e0 Frost de ne pas d\u00e9passer telle ou telle station entre Saint-Jean et Montr\u00e9al. Il n'y a rien dans la preuve qui fasse voir que cette compagnie pouvait, en fait, donner un tel ordre \u00e0 Frost, et, si elle l'avait fait, elle aurait viol\u00e9 son engagement avec la compagnie du Grand Tronc. Du reste, nous devons juger cette cause d'apr\u00e8s la preuve au dossier; et cette preuve, tant testimoniale que documentaire, constate que Frost \u00e9tait, lors de l'accident, sous les ordres et autorit\u00e9 exclusifs de la compagnie du Grand Tronc.\nJe suis donc d'opinion de maintenir l'appel de la compagnie du Vermont Central.\nMais la compagnie du Grand Tronc se porte appelante contre le jugement de la cour d'appel qui a confirm\u00e9 le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 son \u00e9gard. Ce dernier jugement a renvoy\u00e9 sa d\u00e9fense \u00e0 l'encontre de l'action principale et l'a condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 indemniser la compagnie du Vermont Central de la condamnation prononc\u00e9e contre cette compagnie. Puisque dans mon opinion l'action principale de l'intim\u00e9e doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e, l'action en garantie de la compagnie du Vermont Central contre la compagnie du Grand Tronc tombe (Archbald v. DeLisle[2], et autorit\u00e9s y cit\u00e9es).\nIl reste \u00e0 d\u00e9cider du sort de la d\u00e9fense faite par voie d'intervention par la compagnie du Grand Tronc \u00e0 l'encontre de l'action principale et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite le m\u00eame jour que la compagnie du Vermont Central produisait son plaidoyer. Cette d\u00e9fense sur laquelle l'intim\u00e9e a li\u00e9 contestation doit \u00eatre maintenue, et il s'ensuit que l'appel de la compagnie du Grand Tronc doit \u00e9galement \u00eatre maintenu.\nQuant \u00e0 l'action en garantie, je suis d'avis qu'elle doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e.\nAu sujet des frais, je ne puis m'emp\u00eacher de croire qu'il y a eu multiplication inutile de proc\u00e9dures dans la contestation de l'action de l'intim\u00e9e par ces deux compagnies qui paraissent \u00e9troitement li\u00e9es. Deux d\u00e9fenses distinctes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produites le m\u00eame jour par la compagnie du Vermont Central et par la compagnie du Grand Tronc, quand une seule d\u00e9fense par l'une de ces compagnies aurait suffi. De m\u00eame, il y a eu deux appels devant la cour d'appel et deux appels devant cette cour. Usant de la discr\u00e9tion qui appartient au juge en mati\u00e8re de frais, je suis d'avis de condamner l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 payer les frais d'une seule contestation en cour sup\u00e9rieure et d'un seul appel devant la cour d'appel et devant cette cour. Je n'accorderai pas de frais de la demande en garantie.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitor for the appellant, The Central Vermont Railway Company: A. E.

Advances were made and security given as agreed. By similar application the credit was renewed from time to time, and after each renewal the bank took security not only for the present advance but for the total indebtedness of the company to that date.\nHeld, Anglin J. dissenting, that this security taken for the whole debt was only valid for the amount of the loan made at the time it was acquired; but\nHeld, Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that the security acquired for each individual advance was never released and did not merge in the general security so taken; the bank, therefore, was entitled to the benefit of all the securities so acquired.\nIn May, 1912, the company agreed to give to the bank, as further security, a mortgage on its factory site in St. Thomas, Ont., and also a mortgage on land in Montreal. The former was not executed until Nov., 1913, nor the latter until Jan., 1914. In March, 1914, the bank filed a petition for winding-up the company. Held, that in Ontario it is the date of the promise to give the mortgage that governs and as the mortgagor was solvent at that date the mortgage on land in Ontario was valid; but\nHeld, that in Quebec the date when the mortgage was executed can alone be considered, and as the mortgagor was insolvent to the knowledge of the bank when the Quebec mortgage was given it must be set aside.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014Insolvency to the knowledge of the bank at that date was not established; and\nQu.\u2014Can an Ontario Court set aside a mortgage on land in Quebec?\nAfter the petition for winding-up the company had been filed the bank advanced $17,600 on security of the stock in trade and material on hand.\nHeld, Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that if this advance was made, under the terms of section 20 \u201cWinding-up Act,\u201d with the sanction of the liquidator and for the beneficial winding-up of the estate the bank was entitled to the benefit of the security.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (40 Ont. L.R. 245) and of the trial Judge (37 Ont. L.R. 591), reversed in part.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], affirming the judgment at the trial[2], in favour of the defendant bank.\nThe material facts and the questions raised for decision on this appeal are stated in the above head-note.\nHellmuth K.C. and J.B. Davidson for the appellant. Under section 90 of the. \u201cBank Act\u201d a bank can take security for a present loan only. A general security to apply to future advances is invalid. See Bank of Hamilton v. Halstead[3], at p. 241; Bank of Hamilton v. Shepherd[4].\nFor a long time before the winding-up order was made the bank knew that the company was unable to pay its debts and knew that it was insolvent when the two mortgages were given as security. See Molsons Bank v. Halter[5]. D.L. McCarthy K.C. and Shapley for the respondent. The written promise provided for in subsection (b) of section 90 may refer to future as well as present advances. Imperial Paper Mills Co. v. Quebec Bank[6].\nThe promise to give the mortgages was made when the bank had no reason to believe, and evidently did not believe, that the company was insolvent. As to the Quebec mortgage a court in Ontario could not set it aside.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The principal and main question raised and argued on this appeal was as to the proper construction of sections 88 and 90 of the Dominion Act respecting banks and banking.\nSo far as is material for this case, section 88 provides as follows:\u2014\n3. The bank may lend money to any person engaged in business as a wholesale manufacturer of any goods, wares and merchandise manufactured by him, or procured for such manufacture.\n* * *\n6. The security may be taken in the form set forth in Schedule C to this Act, or to the like effect.\nSection 90 enacts:\u2014\n90. The bank shall not acquire or hold any warehouse receipt or bill of lading, or any such security as aforesaid, to secure the payment of any bill, note, debt or liability, unless such bill, note, debt or liability is negotiated or contracted:\n(a) At the time of the acquisition thereof by the bank, or\n(b) Upon the written promise or agreement that such warehouse receipt or bill of lading or security would be given to the bank.\nThe bank\u2019s contention which was adopted and followed in the judgment appealed from was that the written promise referred to in subsection (b) was not one required to be given contemporaneously with a proposed loan or advance or having reference to any specific goods or property to be secured, but was a blanket promise sufficient to cover any future loans or advances which the bank might make the promisor up to the time when it was acted upon and security taken. That time might be as counsel boldly put it in argument five or ten years after the promise given, and would enure to cover as well loans subsequently made from time to time to the promisor as property which was not even in existence when the promise was made.\nThe appellant, on the other hand, submitted that such a written promise as the Act referred to was one having reference to a specific loan then being negotiated for, and to specific goods proposed to be given in security for the loan, stated in the Act as an alternative to the acquisition by the bank of the security itself in those numerous cases in which the loan had necessarily to be advanced to enable the borrower to obtain possession of the goods so that he might give the bank the security.\nI have had no hesitation whatever in adopting the appellant\u2019s contention on that point. In construing such a very important section as the one in question, which validates a secret and unregistered security on personal property not in possession of the grantee, bank and in direct opposition to all provincial laws on the subject requiring registration of such a security, one must exercise one\u2019s common sense and common knowledge. I cannot believe it ever was the intention of Parliament to pass a law having the object and purpose contended for by the bank.\nThe section is a prohibiting one. It declares the bank shall not acquire any warehouse receipt or bill of lading or such security (Form C) as aforesaid to secure payment of any debt or liability unless such debt or liability is contracted at the time of the acquisition of the security, or upon a written promise that such security would be given. To my mind the object, intent and purpose of the section was plain and is sufficiently well expressed, though perhaps not so clearly as to remove all doubt. Primarily the section required that the taking of the security should be contemporaneous with the negotiation or contracting of the debt or loan. If, however, for any reason that could not be done, and scores of reasons arise to one\u2019s mind of conditions in which it could not, then the alternative of a written promise is substituted for the execution of the security. But the written promise to give security had reference, and reference only, not to a future debt or loan to be subsequently made, but to the then debt or loan being negotiated and to the goods and personal property then existing which it was proposed to give security upon, and with reference to which negotiations were taking place. It was only intended in my opinion to cover cases where the actual security could not be given because of the non-possession of the goods or property at the time by the borrower. But it had no reference to future or other loans than the one for a specific amount then being negotiated or to other goods than those specific goods which were to be secured by such loan.\nTake an everyday occurrence and it can be multiplied by scores and hundreds. A merchant purchases a load of produce and it arrives at its destination. The bill of lading and draft for purchase price attached are sent to a bank. The purchaser, to get possession, must pay the draft and possibly the freight, carriage and other charges before he can get possession. He applies to a bank for an advance or loan to enable him to get possession of the goods. The bank makes the loan on his written promise to give warehouse receipt or Form C of the Act, as the case may be, as security when he gets full possession and not till then can he give the warehouse receipt or the statutory security C. So he gives the bank the alternative written promise in the words of the statute\nthat such warehouse receipt or bill of lading or security would be given to the bank.\nThis is only one illustration of the many hundreds of cases in which the \u201cwritten promise\u201d is made by statute sufficient to take the case out of the express prohibition in the section of the bank acquiring any of the securities including Form C mentioned. But the \u201cwritten promise,\u201d so made by the section an alternative to the execution of the security itself where the borrower is not in a position to give the security, does not extend nor relate to any other loan than the specific one being negotiated or to any other goods than those to which specifically the negotiations for a loan relate. It is obvious, of course, that some time must elapse before, in the illustration I have given, the borrower is in a position to give the security, and the alternative of the written promise to give it in subsection (b) of the section is given so that the bank may not be without security for its money which it had to advance to enable the borrower to get the goods.\nI am quite unable to find anything in the case of the Imperial Paper Mills Co. v. Quebec Bank[7], which touches the construction of section 90 or the true meaning to be given to the words \u201cwritten promise\u201d in subsection (b).\nAssuming that I am right in my construction of section 90, I am not sure that it can make a material difference in the ultimate result in this appeal, for the plain reason that the bank in every case where they made a loan to Thomas Brothers, Limited, and took from that firm security in Form C as provided in section 90, included the contemporaneous advance or loan made by them in the amount for which the security was taken. To that extent, therefore, the security would stand. It is true they also included, along with the contemporaneous loan, other loans which they had made to Thomas Brothers, making the security cover as well the amount they had a right to take it for, viz., the contemporaneous loan, as also a very large number of other loans which they had no right to include. This inclusion not being within the statute in my judgment could not, of course, have the effect of making the security effective quoad these outside loans, nor could it invalidate the security so far as the contemporaneous loan was concerned.\nThen as regards the mortgages I am of the opinion that the findings of fact of the trial judge as to the insolvency of the Thomas Brothers, Limited, and as to the absence of knowledge on the part of the bank and its manager of the insolvency, and as to the previous promise made to give such mortgage, confirmed as those findings were by the court of appeal, should not be interfered with so far as the Ontario real estate is concerned. The learned trial judge, in making his finding, evidently did so by accepting the evidence of the bank manager, Anderson, as to the insolvency of the manufacturing company, and as to the promise to give the mortgage. It was to some material extent a question of credibility. I therefore think his finding, with regard to the mortgage of the Ontario real estate, confirmed by the appeal court, should not be interfered with. But with respect to the Quebec real estate different considerations arise. A mortgage of such lands cannot be upheld, as I understand the law, based upon conditions existing when the promise to give the mortgage was made, but upon the conditions existing at the time of the giving of the mortgage. No evidence was given before the trial judge or the court of appeal as to the law of Quebec on the question of the validity of mortgages taken at a time when the mortgagor was insolvent. It is clear that such a mortgage in that province cannot be sustained by virtue of a previous promise. As a federal court it is our right and duty to take judicial notice of Quebec law, and I have reached the conclusion that so far as the mortgage of Quebec real estate is concerned it was invalid and should be so declared because at the time of the giving of the mortgage the Thomas Brothers were insolvent.\nI would therefore allow the appeal as to the mortgage on the Quebec lands with one quarter of the costs of the appeal as the point was a minor one. As to the $17,600 advanced by the bank after the filing or presentation of the petition for liquidation, no point or question was raised by the liquidator on the argument of this appeal. We, however, referred the questions arising out of these advances back to the parties for what they might have to say regarding the rights of the bank respecting them. After reading these supplementary factums or statements we are of the opinion that if the parties cannot agree as to the rights of the bank with respect to these advances, and the proceeds of the goods and chattels which these moneys were advanced to improve so as to enable them to be sold more profitably than in their unfinished state they could be, it should be referred to the proper officer of the court below to determine whether any of these advances were made under section 20 of the \u201cWinding-up Act\u201d in which case the bank should be entitled to the benefit of the securities taken and if not so made to determine whether the advances were made by the bank in the interest of the estate generally and for the completion of the partially manufactured goods and chattels to make them marketable and saleable, in which case the advances so made should be repaid to the bank out of the proceeds of such sales, and any balance left paid over to the liquidator as part of the assets of the insolvent estate.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The most important question raised herein is whether or not the condition upon which a bank is enabled by sections 88 and 90 of the \u201cBank Act,\u201d ch. 29 R.S.C., 1906, to lend money upon the security of goods as therein specified, was duly observed by respondent in its dealings now in question with Thomas Brothers, Limited.\nThe parts of said sections relative to that in question herein, being subsections 3 and 5 of sec. 88, are as follows:\u2014\n(3) The bank may lend money to any person engaged in business as a wholesale manufacturer of any goods, wares and merchandise, upon the security of the goods, wares and merchandise manufactured by him, or procured for such manufacture.\n* * *\n(5) The security may be taken in the form set forth in Schedule C to this Act, or to the like effect.\nSec. 90, sub-sec. 1, is as follows:\u2014\n(1) The bank shall not acquire or hold any warehouse receipt or bill of lading, or any such security as aforesaid, to secure the payment of any bill, note, debt or liability, unless such bill, note, debt or liability is negotiated or contracted:\n(a) At the time of the acquisition thereof by the bank; or\n(b) Upon the written promise or agreement that such warehouse receipt or bill of lading or security would be given to the bank;\nProvided that such bill, note, debt or liability may be renewed, or at the time for payment thereof extended, without affecting any such security.\nAs far back as January, 1908, we are informed, the company owed the respondent about $200,000 and so continued up to the time it was put in liquidation early in 1914. The amount of indebtedness to the bank varied and for some time exceeded that sum. But whatever it was it is claimed by respondent securities had been taken upon goods as specified by writings conformable with Form C in the schedule to the \u201cBank Act.\u201d\nI cannot find that any of said writings, in fact, observed the requirements of the Act.\nIn the latest, dated 12th May, 1914, produced in the printed case as a fair sample of many others in the record, the first, and for our present purpose the most essential, part, reads as follows:\u2014\nIn consideration of an advance of two hundred and thirteen thousand, four hundred ____________dollars, made by the Dominion Bank to the undersigned for which the said Bank holds the following Bills or Notes[8] the products of agriculture, the forest, quarry and mine, the sea, lakes and rivers, the live and dead stock, and the products thereof and the goods, wares and merchandise mentioned below, are hereby assigned to the said Bank as security for the payment of the said Bills or Notes, or renewals thereof or substitutions therefor and interest thereon.\nThis security is given under the provisions of section 88 of the Bank Act and is subject to the provisions of the said Act.\nThose mentioned on the back thereof consist of one hundred and three items headed:\u2014\nDate of Note\nPromisor\nWhen payable\nAmt.\nUnderneath the word \u201cpromisor\u201d is written the words \u201cThomas Bros. Ltd.\u201d and underneath \u201cwhen payable\u201d \u201cdemand.\u201d\nThe dates of these notes run from \u201cSept. 20\u201d to \u201cMay 12.\u201d The year in which given is not stated.\nIf we try to ascertain that, and turn to the foot of the document we find the following:\u2014\nThis security is given pursuant to the written promise or agreement of the undersigned and especially of agreement, dated 29th day of January, 1914.\nDated at St. Thomas the 12th day of May, 1914.\nOn calling the attention of respondent\u2019s counsel to this being founded on a promise dated 29th January, 1914, yet running back to transactions as early as 20th Sept., 1913, if I understand the document aright, he said there were other documents which preceded and covered those items anterior to 29th January, 1914.\nAssuming that to be so, how can respondent justify bringing them forward, as it were, to be incorporated with this document? How can it hope to make this document effective for the purpose of comprehending transactions of an earlier date than the promise relied upon? It certainly could not be permitted to so extend retroactively the operation of the later promise, or the still later lien contract as to include earlier advances than the dates of either the promise or the lien contract or as to include under or by virtue of either a claim upon goods over which Thomas Bros. Ltd. had neither actual nor prospective dominion by virtue of any then existent contract, either when the promise made or lien given.\nThen where are we to draw the line? If we draw it at the date referred to in the instrument as the date of the promise, can we be quite sure that we cover thereby all that might rightfully have been considered as falling within the statute?\nAnd supposing we do assume we are right in our guess, what of the anterior promises evidently contemplated to have been had in view by the contracting parties.\nAgain, which of the written promises or agreements are we to adopt?\nThe draftsman realized as the fact is and, I submit, law also, that the statute contemplates the existence of only a single promise and that in writing which may and must be the basis of the transaction in order to validate it. But then he presents us with the impossibility of selecting some one, out of possibly many written promises or agreements, and that\nespecially of agreement dated 29th day of January, 1914,\nto support this security which I now present as a test of what the judgment of the Appellate Division rests upon.\nI am also oppressed with the language of the instrument presenting the foundation of the whole transaction as, let it be observed, an advance of $213,400.\nIt is not a group or series of transactions that the statute enables the bank to lend in respect of, and then provides for a security to be given therefor, but a single transaction, a single advance, and an existent single article or assortment of goods definitely specified and ascertainable by following the description thereof in the instrument; is respectively what the statute contemplates and provides for, by its express terms.\nIt is the certainty of identification both of the subject matter, and of the intended specific contractual relation in respect thereof, which the statute requires. No doubt facility of identification, in order thereby to prevent fraudulent practices, was also aimed at. But above all a strict and complete compliance with the conditions upon which an exceptional power was given banks, is imperatively required. To go beyond those is to produce that which is ultra vires and hence void.\nAnd the respondent by its systematic course of conduct clearly indicates a conception of its limitations and duty in accord with such a view of the statute by getting, or perhaps pretending to have got, on each new advance a new lien security to cover it; yet, inconsistently with such view, at each of same steps trying to cover something else. It seems to have hoped by a metaphysical process, as it were, to enable the judiciary to reach the conclusion that a repetition once a year or thereabouts of a general promise could be converted, by a transferable mode of thought, into a divisible or multiple promise self\u2011adaptable to meet any such situation that possibly could arise in the course of the contractual relations between itself and the borrower.\nWhy did the inventor of the annual promise plan not proceed a step further and substitute as a counterpart thereof, periodical loans and acceptances of lien securities therefor, modelled after that in Form C professed to be followed? Am I right in surmising that it possibly was felt the judiciary could not be expected to accept or assent to so much at one time?\nHowever that may be, the transaction must be as to an advance to a wholesale manufacturer upon some of such goods, wares and merchandise as manufactured by him, or procured for such manufacture.\nI am unable to see how such an instrument as this resting upon a statute which seems in every line of the relevant sections to contemplate actual specific loans to be made upon the security of specific goods or such as specifically pointed to in writing, or can be manufactured out of those so indicated with such definiteness as to enable them to be effectively traced and identified can be upheld.\nI was at first disposed to think that as to the item for advances made at the time when it was given it might become a security upon the goods described, and hence as these instruments were numerous the respondent\u2019s claim might be maintained for something substantial.\nBut the more I have considered the matter the more absurd does such an instrument seem as a means of executing the power conferred by the statute. In substance as a result of the respective dealings embraced in each, the others are like unto this.\nThen again the only promise relied upon is that contained in the request addressed to the bank for a line of credit.\nThat if held effective would reduce the legislation to something quite ridiculous.\nIt would be equally good as a compliance with the statute if made when a man opened an account, and signed it then, and acted in accord therewith for the life of his business, whether a year or score of years.\nI cannot think that was the sort of thing which was had in view by the conditional requirement of subsection (b) of section 90, quoted above.\nNor can I see how the case of Imperial Paper Mills v. Quebec Bank[9], touches the question at all.\nThe object of the legislation evidently was to limit the power of the banks, when taking security of that kind at all, within the narrow limit of doing so at the time of each transaction; or at that time having a specific promise in writing relative to a specific advance.\nAnd the evidence in this case furnishes abundant evidence of the wisdom of so restricting the power of the bank.\nIt would have been better for respondent and all concerned had the statute been observed in the sense in which I now hold it should be read.\nIn this view the amendment of subsection 4 of section 88 in the \u201cBank Act\u201d as it now stands, need not be considered.\nNor, upon the material before us, need any of the other like securities be considered.\nIf in the long course of dealings between the parties in question there were any isolated cases of securities given, which can possibly fall within the meaning of the statute, there should be a reference, if respondent desires it, to take an account thereof and report, subject to further directions, upon evidence distinctly proving the facts of a present advance, and specific goods being given as security, and not depending merely upon the production of some pieces of paper and evidence of an agent who does not know the facts, but only speaks to a system existent at some time.\nIn the mortgage securities called in question I, as the result of a perusal of the evidence, and especially the correspondence between the head office and local agent, bearing thereon, am quite convinced that the respondent well knew when the mortgage was taken on the Montreal property that the company was insolvent and that continuing in business was, for its own purposes, a better expedient than winding it up.\nIt had only been by careful nursing and direction on its part until that and possibly other securities were got, that the insolvency had not been exposed to the world at a much earlier date.\nI think there is no difficulty in reaching and setting aside such a contract made in this province between the respondent and its debtor, as this was, and of necessity had to be here\u2014though registration as result thereof had to conform with the Quebec law.\nAs to the other security I entertain a different view.\nThe condition of the concern was not so obviously hopeless at the date of the execution of the chief mortgage as of that of the later one.\nAgain that earlier mortgage was preceded by an agreement which may be upheld so far as restricted to antecedent debts, and within those limits may protect the mortgage without rendering it offensive against the prohibition restricting banks from making loans on real estate.\nWith some doubt I have in relation to that aspect of the matters involved, but not touched upon in argument, I incline to hold the mortgage may be upheld.\nYet I must say that with the intimate knowledge the respondent had of the company\u2019s actual financial condition and mode of operating, it is difficult to understand how it could have hoped for any other ultimate result than that of its being forced into liquidation.\nIf called upon to pay, which is the crucial test, it must have been held insolvent by any shrewd business man acquainted with its affairs. It is more in deference to that of others than to my own judgment that I assent to the judgment below in that regard.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout in regard to the main objects of the appeal as indicated herein.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The appellants, who are the liquidator and a creditor of Thomas Bros., Limited, an insolvent manufacturing company in liquidation, brought this action to set aside two mortgages on real estate and pledges of certain goods, purporting to have been made under subsection 3 of section 88 of the \u201cBank Act\u201d (R.S.C. 1906, ch. 29, and 3 & 4 Geo. V. ch. 9), held by the respondent bank for an indebtedness of the company which amounted to about $213,400 on the 12th day of May, 1914, twelve days after the winding-up order was made.\nThe bank apparently received payments and made advances up to that date. The advances between March 25th, the date of presentation of the petition for winding-up, and May 1st, the date of the winding-up order, amounted to $15,400. After May 1st $2,200 more was advanced. The company\u2019s indebtedness to the bank, however, which on March 24th amounted to $228,827, had been reduced on May 12th, when the last advance of $200 was made, to $213,400. The earliest outstanding note on March 25th, 1914, bore date August 16th, 1913. If those outstanding notes represented actual contemporaneous advances, as the bank maintains they did, they would all fall within subsection 4 of section 88 of the \u201cBank Act\u201d which came into force in July, 1913. The bank had put its representative in possession on the 24th of March, 1914. By subsequently realizing on its securities (except the St. Thomas mortgage) it had reduced the company\u2019s debt to $135,000 at the date of the trial.\nExcept as to such of the pledged goods as were dealt in but not manufactured by the company, which are not now in question, the action was dismissed by Sutherland J[10], and on appeal by the plaintiffs the Appellate Division sustained his judgment[11].\nThe attack on the real estate mortgages as fraudulent and void against the liquidator and as calculated to hinder and delay the creditors of the company, which was but faintly pressed at bar, in my opinion fails on the facts stated in the judgment delivered by the learned trial judge and affirmed in the Appellate Division. Anderson\u2019s evidence, having been believed by the judge who saw and heard him give it and by the Appellate Division, should not be rejected here unless under very exceptional circumstances.\nThe Ontario mortgage is supported by the promise of May, 1912. On the facts found by the trial judge and accepted by the Appellate Division, notorious insolvency within art. 2023 C.C. sufficient to invalidate the Quebec security was not established, and the insolvency of the company was not known to the bank when it was taken. Art. 1035 C.C. The plaintiffs\u2019 attack on this mortgage, however, was based entirely on the Ontario statute, R.S.O. ch. 134, sec. 5. They did not invoke the Quebec law. But see Morrow v. Hankin[12], and Logan v. Lee[13]. Before setting aside this hypothec I should have to consider very carefully the jurisdiction of the Ontario courts to do so.\nThe case presented as to the securities under the \u201cBank Act\u201d demands fuller consideration. Some facts in addition to those which I state and extracts from the relevant documents that may serve to make more comprehensible the situation out of which the questions discussed arise appear in the judgments below.\nPrior to 1908 the company\u2019s line of credit with the bank did not exceed $150,000. In that or the next year it was increased to $175,000, and later, in 1909, to $200,000, continuing at about that figure until the date of the insolvency. During the same period the company\u2019s indebtedness to the bank varied slightly. Seldom below $200,000, it would appear to have reached a maximum of $233,000 about the 16th of April, 1914.\nTo quote from the judgment of Maclaren J.A.:\u2014\nThe records of the transaction in question were kept in two separate accounts by the bank, called respectively the purchase account and the sales account. The former contained on the credit side the record of all the demand notes which the company gave from time to time, generally for round amounts ranging from $1,000 to $10,000. On the debit side were entered all cheques given for payment of goods, wages, expenses, interest, etc. On the credit side of the sales account were entered the cash deposited, cheques of customers, drafts for collection, etc. On the debit side the demand notes of the company paid off from time to time, customers\u2019 notes or drafts returned unpaid, etc. As the learned trial judge said, however:\u2014\nThe two accounts had to be looked to to ascertain the exact standing of the customer with the bank, from time to time, and advances were made to the company in the advance account (called by Maclaren J.A. the purchase account), as they had credits in the other account. The two accounts had, of course, relation to each other and seemed in reality to be treated as one account.\nThe evidence of the bank manager establishes with reasonable certainty that each of the demand notes given from time to time for the sums placed to the credit of the \u201cPurchase Account\u201d was not a renewal note in any sense, but represented an actual advance made at the time the note was taken\u2014an actual increase by the amount of the note (through withdrawals of its proceeds made by the company then or within a day or two afterwards) of the company\u2019s indebtedness to the bank as shewn by its net debit balance taking the two accounts together. It should perhaps be noted that discount was not deducted from the notes. Their face amounts were credited to the purchase account and bore interest at six per cent. The learned trial judge says:\u2014\nIt seems to me from the evidence in this case that the bank was from time to time making advances and taking security under section 88 of the \u201cBank Act.\u201d\nAs Maclaren J.A. says, distinguishing this case from Bank of Hamilton v. Halstead[14]:\u2014\nSo far as the evidence goes the company had always the privilege of drawing the full amount that had been put to its credit through the negotiation of the demand notes.\nThe moneys represented by each of the demand notes were actually\nplaced freely at the disposal of the customer,\nas in Ontario Bank v. O\u2019Reilly[15], at p. 432,\nwere placed under the control of the company,\nToronto Cream & Butter Co. v. Crown Bank[16]. In the Halstead Case[17], as pointed out by Meredith C.J., whose judgment was approved in this court,\nNot a farthing of the amounts which the notes represented could be touched by (the customer) or made available by him for any purpose.\nThe practice in the case at bar was from time to time to retire the demand notes longest outstanding by cheques of the customer drawn on its \u201cSales Account\u201d or by charging up the amounts of such notes against its credit balance in that account. The advances were made quite independently of such retirements.\nConcurrently with the taking of each demand note and the placing of the moneys represented by it to the credit of the \u201cPurchase Account,\u201d from which they were subject to withdrawal by the company at its will, the bank took a pledge under section 88 of the \u201cBank Act\u201d on all the raw material, manufactured goods and goods in process of manufacture in the customer\u2019s premises. Down to the 7th of March, 1914, two separate documents were obtained on each occasion, one a pledge or security for the advance then being made (demand note contract), the other an \u201comnibus security\u201d (as I shall term it for lack of a better name), for that advance and such prior advances as were represented by demand notes then outstanding (i.e., not yet retired as above explained), a list of which was indorsed on the back. After the 29th of January, 1914, new forms of the omnibus security were used in which the goods are somewhat more fully described but no special allusion is made to the amount of the concurrent advance. Some ten advances, amounting in all to $17,000, appear to have been made between the 7th of March and the date of presentation of the petition for winding-up, the 25th of March, 1914. No document similar to the early \u201cDemand Note Contracts\u201d was taken as security for any of the advances subsequent to the 6th of March. On the back of the omnibus security obtained when each of them was made was indorsed a list of the then outstanding notes, and the security was stated on its face to be given in consideration of their total amount, the last item in the indorsed list being uniformly the amount of the note for the actual concurrent advance. On the last of these securities taken before the winding-up\u2014that of the 24th of March, 1914\u201477 of the 103 notes in the indorsed list bear dates between the 16th of August, 1913, and the 29th of January, 1914, and only 26 bear subsequent dates. Yet the document purports, as do all the securities taken after that date, to be given pursuant to a written promise or agreement of the 29th of January, 1914. I shall have occasion again to advert to this fact.\nThe securities taken before the 29th of January, 1914, contain no explicit reference to an antecedent written promise, although such a promise that security would be given under section 88 of the \u201cBank Act\u201d had been obtained by the bank annually or oftener when the line of credit for the ensuing period of a year, or less, as the case might be, was arranged for. Whatever may be its value as security for previous advances, I know of no good reason why each of these documents taken on and after the 7th of March, 1914, should not be a perfectly good and valid security under section 88 (3) and clause (a) of subsection 1 of section 90 of the \u201cBank Act\u201d for the actual concurrent advance.\nI am satisfied that all prior securities were not discharged by substitution or merger as the result of the taking of the new general security given when each fresh advance was made. This in my view is really the crucial question in this case, and it is perhaps regrettable that more attention was not given to it in argument. If there was no merger of earlier in later securities\u2014if the securities taken concurrently with each advance are still alive and enforceable\u2014the bank\u2019s position seems to me to be free from difficulty, since the requirements of clause (a) of subsection 1 of section 90 are met. On the other hand, if there was a merger or substitution\u2014if the last security taken absorbed and extinguished all prior securities held for the advances for which the outstanding notes indorsed upon it had been given\u2014the stated consideration included them\u2014it is obvious that it would be necessary to establish that as to such prior advances\u2014past indebtedness\u2014the absorbing or substituted security was given pursuant to a promise or agreement that would satisfy clause (b) of subsection 1 of section 90. The question of merger or substitution is only of importance if the omnibus securities taken on the occasion of each advance cannot be supported in respect of the prior indebtedness included in the stated consideration; and it is on that assumption that it is now discussed.\nStrong as the legal presumption of merger of an earlier security, which arises upon the taking of a new security of a higher nature for the same debt, undoubtedly is (Price v. Moulton[18]),it yields to satisfactory proof of a contrary intention (Commissioner of Stamps v. Hope[19]); and there is no such presumption where the new and the old securities are of equal degree. 7 Hals. Laws of England 457; Preston v. Perton (1601)[20].\nA good prior security will not be held to merge in a later inoperative one.\nChetwynd v. Allen[21], at page 358, per Romer J. Substitution, like merger, is largely a question of intention. Ex parte Whitmore[22]. Where the taking of further security is the real purpose of the new instrument there is no extinguishment of the earlier security. Twopenny v. Young[23]. The principle underlying the equitable doctrine that merger of estates and merger in the fee of a paid-off mortgage security on real estate are questions of intention actual or presumed, and that an intention to keep a charge alive will be presumed when that is for the benefit of the person against whom it is sought to set up merger; In re Pride[24]; Adams v. Angel[25], may well be applied where merger or substitution of securities on personal property is claimed under circumstances such as those now before us. No reason can be suggested why the bank would willingly part with or permit the extinguishment of any security held by it in a case such as this. It would be so contrary to what is commonly well understood to be the practice of bankers\u2014so obviously contrary to the bank\u2019s interest, that I should require clear and convincing evidence that such a merger or substitution was intended before admitting that it had in fact taken place.\nIn the securities taken before the 29th of January, 1914, the customer is made to represent that the goods pledged\nare free from any mortgage, lien or charge thereon.\nI take it that was intended to mean other than liens or charges held by the bank itself, although it would certainly have been more satisfactory had this exception been expressed as it is in the securities taken on the new forms in use after that date. I agree with the observation made by counsel for the plaintiffs in the course of the trial that\nthere is nothing in the documents themselves to shew whether they are in substitution or not.\nYet my inference from them, paying due regard to the surrounding circumstances, would be that no merger or substitution was intended.\nThe question of intention, however, is not left entirely to mere inference. The bank manager was called as a witness by the plaintiffs. In answer to questions put by their counsel on direct examination (of course without objection being taken on behalf of the defendant), he gives this evidence:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Looking again at this last receipt (exhibit 8) taken under section 88 I see it is for $213,400? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014That amount represents the amount of notes going back to what date? A.\u2014Represents the amount of notes going back to September 20th, 1913.\nQ.\u2014All those notes that are represented on the back of this contract were also represented in numerous other contracts which you took after the 20th day of September? A.\u2014All the notes that were unpaid would be.\nQ.\u2014You took a new contract with every note? A.\u2014With every note.\nQ.\u2014So that at the time you took this contract (exhibit 8) did you hold all these other contracts? A.\u2014We held all those other contracts.\nQ.\u2014You held contracts dated the date of each of those notes? A.\u2014We held contracts dated the date of each of those notes.\nLater in his direct examination, in answer to a question pressed by counsel for the plaintiffs, notwithstanding objection, the witness first said positively that there was no substitution of new securities for older ones and, a moment or two later, that\nit never entered into my head until now whether I took it (the later security) in substitution or not.\nThe plaintiffs can scarcely complain if this evidence elicited by them from their own witness is used against them. So far as it may be admissible it goes to confirm the inference that I should draw without it from the circumstances that merger of, or substitution for, earlier securities was not intended.\nFrom the whole case I gather that the banker\u2019s idea in taking securities in this omnibus form after July, 1913, was that something of the kind was necessary in order to obtain security on the new goods brought in to replace those sold and taken away in the ordinary course of business. That I think may fairly be said to be the purport of the bank manager\u2019s testimony. Whatever advantages it may have had before the amendment to the \u201cBank Act\u201d of 1913, this practice has been unnecessarily, and I cannot but think unwisely, continued since. Subsection 4 of section 88, first introduced at that time, provides that in the event of goods held under a security given for money loaned under that section being removed with the consent of the bank and similar goods brought in substitution therefor, the goods\nso substituted shall be covered by such security as if originally covered thereby,\ni.e., by the security held upon the goods so removed. A new security is neither contemplated nor required. The nature of Thomas Brothers\u2019 business leaves no room for doubt that the sale and consequent \u201cremoval\u201d of their products was \u201cwith the consent of the bank.\u201d See, too, the last clause of subsection 4. Securities held upon goods so removed attached automatically under that subsection to goods\nsubstantially the same in character * * * substituted therefor.\nYet we find in the new form of promise adopted by the bank in 1914, presumably drafted because of the amendment of 1913, this clause:\u2014\n6. If with the consent of the bank, the goods or any part thereof are removed, other goods, of substantially the same character and of at least the same value as those so removed, shall be thereupon forthwith substituted therefor and the customer hereby agrees, so often as every such removal and substitution shall take place, to give and shall give warehouse receipts, bills of lading or securities under the \u201cBank Act,\u201d covering such substituted goods, all of which shall be subject to the provisions hereof.\nActing under this clause and taking the further security which it indicated as proper, if not necessary, the bank manager had no idea of relinquishing any security already in hand. To do so would never occur to him.\nElaborate (and perhaps in the respect indicated misleading) as the bank\u2019s new forms of 1914 are, the new form of pledge then adopted omits what should have been one of its prominent features, if, as was apparently the case, it was intended to continue the former practice of including in each new security all outstanding notes, namely, a clause explicitly providing that there should be no merger or absorption in it of, or substitution of it for, any securities given for past advances. Without such a clause the taking of securities in the omnibus form adopted by the bank is unavoidably fraught with the danger of affording some colour to the contention put forward in this case that substitution for, or merger and extinguishment of, prior securities was thereby affected.\nThat no such merger in fact took place was the view of the learned trial judge. He says:\u2014\nIt is contended on the part of the plaintiffs that there was in reality the same course of dealing between the bank and its customer in this case as was held to be invalid in the Halstead Case[26]. It seesm to me, however, from the evidence in this case, that the bank was from time to time making advances and taking security under section 88 of the \u201cBank Act\u201d on the new goods which were coming in. The goods were from time to time changing as old stock was sold and new stock brought in to replace. A separate note and security was taken for each advance. A general security was also taken referring to all outstanding notes as to each of which a previous individual security had been taken. This it seems to me could not be called a substitution, but rather a consolidation. There was consolidation, however, only in the sense that as a convenient method of keeping track of the total secured indebtedness and apparently as something erroneously thought to be necessary in order to secure the benefit in regard to them of subsection 4 of section 88, the outstanding notes were included in the statement of the consideration for each new omnibus security and were scheduled by indorsement upon it. There was no consolidation in the sense of any merger or absorption of the earlier securities such as would extinguish them or render them unenforceable.\nThis question is not dealt with in the opinion delivered by Maclaren J.A. in the Appellate Division probably because he held the omnibus securities good by virtue of the antecedent promises given under clause (b) of section 90, in respect of the past advances which they purported to cover as well as the advances made concurrently.\nI am of the opinion that the lien taken on the occasion of obtaining each of the advances represented by notes that were still outstanding at the date of the commencement of the winding-up may be regarded as a valid and subsisting security on such of the goods covered by it as remained in the hands of the company at that date (including in the case of liens taken after the 1st of July, 1913, substituted goods), since each of such demand notes represented an actual present advance, and the security was given concurrently with the making of it as required by clause (a) of subsection 1 of section 90 of the \u201cBank Act,\u201d and was not merged in or otherwise extinguished by any of the securities subsequently taken in omnibus form.\nSince the 1st of July, 1913, when subsection 4 of section 88 of the \u201cBank Act\u201d (3 & 4 Geo. V. ch. 9) came into force, the advances by the bank amounted to over $300,000. The goods within subsection 3 of section 88 on hand at the date when the winding-up began were valued at $83,637.92. The annual turnover of the company had been over $450,000. The earliest outstanding note when the winding-up began bore date the 13th August, 1913. There can be little room for doubt, therefore, having regard to the provision for substitution made by subsection 4, that all the goods in stock at that time were covered by valid securities in the hands of the bank.\nIn case there should be any difficulty in sustaining its claim under clause (a) of subsection 1 of section 90, counsel for the bank also contended that he was entitled to support each of the omnibus liens taken for all outstanding notes by the promises for security which the bank had obtained annually or oftener from the company. Counsel for the appellants challenged this position, maintaining that a promise in order to meet the requirements of clause (b) of subsection 1 of section 90 must be made contemporaneously with the advance in respect of which the promisor undertakes to furnish security. I am unable to read such a restriction into clause (b).\nSection 90 so far as material reads as follows:\u2014\n90. The bank shall not acquire or hold any warehouse receipt or bill of lading, or any such security as aforesaid, to secure the payment of any bill, note, debt or liability, unless such bill, note, debt or liability is negotiated or contracted:\n(a) At the time of the acquisition thereof by the bank; or\n(b) Upon the written promise or agreement that such warehouse receipt or bill of lading or security would be given to the bank.\nA promise to furnish security for advances to be made in the future is not within the mischief against which section 90 was meant to provide. The mischief aimed at is the taking of security for past indebtedness. The canon embodied in the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius would seem to preclude the narrow construction which the appellants seek to place on clause (b). Clause (a) and clause (b) are independent alternatives. Clause (a) explicitly prescribes that in the case of a security to which it applies, the bill, note, debt or liability, to secure which it is given, must be negotiated or contracted at the time the bank acquires the security. Clause (b) alternatively provides that, if not so taken, the security must be given pursuant to a written promise or agreement to give it, on the faith of which the bill, note, debt or liability has been negotiated or contracted. The mischief against which the section was designed to provide of course excludes from the purview of clause (b) a promise or agreement given or entered into after the advance has been made. But I find nothing to warrant excluding a prior promise\u2014nothing to justify importing into clause (b) the restriction as to time which Parliament has placed in clause (a)\u2014no reason for substituting for the introductory words of clause (b), \u201cupon the,\u201d which clearly mean \u201con the faith of the,\u201d some such words as \u201cat the time of obtaining a.\u201d The use in it of the preterite-subjunctive form of the verb, \u201cwould be given,\u201d tends to confirm this view of the proper construction of clause (b); if the construction contended for by the appellants were correct one would expect to find the verb in the future tense\u2014\u201cwill be given.\u201d\nApart entirely from authority, my view of the proper construction of clause (b) is that the written promise or agreement for which it provides may be given prior to, or at, the time when the bill, note, debt or liability to be secured is negotiated or contracted. Of course it must be possible to identify the advance as one to which the promise was intended to apply, and the goods as property on which the security was promised by it. As Maclaren J.A. points out, however, although not explicitly referred to in the judgment of the Privy Council in Imperial Paper Mills Co. v. Quebec Bank[27], the question now raised as to the construction of clause (b) can scarcely have escaped their Lordships\u2019 attention in view of Lord Shaw\u2019s detailed statement, at page 92, of the course of business pursued, and of the fact that the judgment appealed from[28], at pages 645, 653, 655, itself shewed that in one instance, although the promise for security was made in August, 1905, the demand note for $120,000 and the security therefor were given only in February, 1906, the actual advances having been made from time to time in the interval. This security was upheld.\nThe decision of their Lordships is chiefly valuable, however, as affording an answer to the objection taken by the present appellants to the sufficiency of the description of the goods in the securities taken by the respondent bank.\nNo doubt the promise of the 29th of January, 1914, would not suffice under clause (b) of subsection 1 of section 90 to support the securities subsequently taken in so far as they were for advances represented by notes of earlier date. For that purpose the earlier promises should have been referred to as well. But if there was no substitution for the earlier securities, or merger of them in, or extinguishment of them by, the later securities taken, this omission is not of much moment. In any case, since the earlier written promises in fact existed, I think they might be proved and relied upon notwithstanding the fact that the promise of the 29th of January, 1914, is alone mentioned in the liens taken after that date. A more serious objection to supporting any of the liens as a security for any advance earlier than that actually made contemporaneously with it would seem to be that the promise to give security for such earlier advance was probably fulfilled and satisfied by the security taken at the time it was made and cannot, therefore, be relied on to support subsequent security for it. Except perhaps for the purpose of clause 6 of the \u201cpromise\u201d of the 29th of January, 1914, which I have quoted, there was no promise for any further security.\nBut if the view I hold that the security taken for each advance at the time it was made was efficacious and continued in force is sound, it is unnecessary and it would probably be unwise to dwell further upon other phases of this case. I have referred to them merely to make it clear that I do not share the views upon the construction of clause (b) of subsection 1 of section 90 which I understand some of my learned brothers entertain.\nAs to the advances, amounting to $17,600, made by the bank after the presentation of the petition for winding-up (R.S.C. ch. 144, sec. 5) it can claim only in so far as the liquidator may have sanctioned them as necessary for a beneficial winding-up (ibid. sec. 20), or as the court may consider it entitled under the doctrine of equitable subrogation to the benefit of securities (including under them substituted goods within subsection 4 of section 88) held by it for so much of its indebtedness as was paid off during the same period.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014This is an action by the liquidator and a large creditor of the insolvent company, Thomas Brothers, Limited, to set aside certain securities held by the respondent bank on the goods of that company, and also to set aside two mortgages given in favour of the bank.\nThe courts below dismissed that action, except as to a small item which is not in issue in this appeal.\nIt is claimed by the appellant that those securities are contrary to the provisions of sections 88 and 90 of the \u201cBank Act,\u201d and that the mortgages were signed when the debtor was insolvent to the knowledge of the creditor and that the effect of those mortgages gave the bank an unjust preference over the other creditors.\nDealing first with the securities. I see that from 1906 until the petition for a winding-up order was presented by the bank on the 25th of March, 1914, the company was indebted to the bank for the sum of about $200,000. On the 24th of March, 1914, on the eve of the presentation of the petition, the indebtedness, as appears by the security given that day, was of $228,827. As stated in the document the security was given\npursuant to a written promise or agreement of the undersigned (Thomas Brothers Limited), and especially of agreement dated 29th January, 1914,\nand it was\nin consideration of an advance of $228,827 made by the Dominion Bank to the undersigned for which the said bank holds the following bills or notes:\nand then follows a list of 103 notes ranging in amount from $127 to $5,500 and dated from the 16th of August, 1913, to the 24th of March, 1914. It appears rather peculiar that the security was given in virtue of a promise made in January, 1914, when most of the notes covered by the security were dated before this last date. The promise or agreement relied upon by the bank was in the form of a request signed by Thomas Brothers to the bank\nto makes advances to the undersigned (herein called the customer) from time to time and in consideration thereof the customer doth hereby promise and agree as follows: (1) To give from time to time to the bank security for every advance and interest by way of warehouse receipts, bills of lading or securities under sections 86-87-88 & 90 of the \u201cBank Act.\u201d\nIt cannot be pretended that a promise made under section 90 of the \u201cBank Act\u201d could cover advances made before it was signed. Besides, the terms of the promise itself in this case were not to cover past indebtedness but future advances. So the promise of the 24th of March, 1914, could not validly cover the notes discounted or signed before the date of the promise.\nCould that promise, however, validate notes negotiated after it was made? This is the main question at issue in this case.\nBy section 88 of the \u201cBank Act,\u201d it is provided in subsection 3 that\nthe bank may lend money to any person engaged in business as a wholesale manufacturer of any goods, wares and merchandise upon the security of the goods, wares and merchandise manufactured by him or procured for such manufacture.\nSection 90 of the \u201cBank Act\u201d is the section which has to be construed in order to find out whether the promise above mentioned was valid or not. It provides that the bank shall not acquire any security\nto secure the payment of any bill, note, debt or liability, unless such bill, note, debt or liability is negotiated or contracted:\n(a) at the time of the acquisition thereof by the bank; or\n(b) upon the written promise or agreement that such warehouse receipt or bill of lading or security would be given to the bank.\nThat provision of the \u201cBank Act\u201d is a derogation from the prohibition in section 76 concerning lending money upon the security of goods, wares and merchandise.\nThis section is also a derogation from the law concerning chattel mortgages. In some provinces, statutes relating to bills of sale, to chattel mortgages, etc., have been passed to recognize change of ownership or of legal relations respecting personal property without change of possession or change of possession without change of ownership. Those chattel mortgages have to be registered and are surrounded with provisions which, if not absolutely carried out, render the bills of sale or chattel mortgages null and void. The provincial law surrounds with extraordinary precautions the validity of chattel mortgages and where the procedure enacted by the legislature is not scrupulously followed those mortgages are held not to be valid against the assignee. Gault Bros. v. Winter[29].\nThe Canadian Parliament thought it advisable, however, with regard to the banks to give them the power to take security in the nature of chattel mortgages or bills of sales upon the property of the wholesale manufacturers; and those securities might be taken without any publicity being given to the existence of such chattel mortgages or such bills of sale.\nThen I say, applying the principle that we have laid down in the case of Gault Bros. v. Winter29, that the procedure which is enacted by the legislature should be followed entirely to render valid the securities taken by the bank.\nThe object of the law is not to give to the bank an authorization to take securities or bills of lading, for money which had been previously lent, in other words, for past indebtedness, but the loan must be made contemporaneously with the taking of the security or the giving of the promise. The bill or note must be negotiated at the time the bank acquires the securities or at the time at which a written promise is made that security shall be given; otherwise the bank could for years in advance hold a promise that a security will be given and when they see that their customer is in financial difficulty take a security upon all his goods.\nThat was practically what was done in this case. The promise relied upon was given in the month of January, 1914, and similar promises had been made also in the previous years every time the customer was applying for a line of credit or for the continuation of his line of credit. Then on the 24th of March, 1914, on the day previous to the presentation of the petition for winding-up the company, the bank takes a security upon all the stock of the company. That security given on the 24th of March constituted not only a preference given by an insolvent debtor to one of his creditors who was aware of his insolvency but also constituted a formal violation of the provisions of section 90 of the \u201cBank Act.\u201d\nThen applying the principle that we have laid down in the case of Gault Bros. v. Winter[30], the procedure which is enacted by the legislature should be followed entirely to render valid the securities taken by the bank.\nAs I have said the object of the law is to give to the bank an authorization to take securities for contemporaneous indebtedness. It may happen that a manufacturer has to pay cash for some goods, even before their delivery; then the \u201cBank Act\u201d authorizes the bank to advance the money to the manufacturer on the promise then made that the latter will give it security on those goods. In such a case, the security would be valid. It is the case contemplated by subsection (b) of section 90.\nIt is contended, however, that if the security is not valid as a security based on a promise, it would be valid as a security based upon advances made at the time of its acquisition under the provisions of paragraph (a) of section 90.\nIn that respect it becomes necessary to examine the agreements made after the 29th of January, 1914, and those made before that date, since they were made in different ways.\nAfter the 29th of January, 1914, the securities were all based on the promise of that day and they all contain this provision:\u2014\nThis security is given pursuant to the written promise or agreement of the undersigned and especially of agreement dated 29th January, 1914.\nThose securities profess then to have been given under paragraph (b) of section 90. I do not see how we could now ignore that and say that they should be considered as having been given under paragraph (a) of that section.\nIf it were only a question of agreement between two parties, and there would be some ambiguity, we might perhaps try to find the true intention of the parties and apply with less stringency the ordinary rules of construction, but those securities affect not only the contracting parties but also all the creditors of the party who gave the security. The \u201cBank Act\u201d enacts positively that the banks shall not lend money upon the security of any goods (art. 76, subsec. 2), except as specifically authorized by the Act. It is then of principle that the banks should make advances to their clients without looking for any special security. There are exceptions; but those exceptions must be strictly construed. In the case of a manufacturer the bank could, when they discount a note, take then a security on his stock for the amount of that note, or they could then take from him a promise that in a few days he would give them, to protect their claim, warehouse receipts, bills of lading, or other security; but the provisions of the law in that respect must be rigorously followed. If the customer and the bank have found it advisable to give and take a security based upon a promise, they could not substitute later on a security based upon advances.\nThis court has virtually laid down the above principle in the case of Bank of Hamilton v. Halstead[31]. Mr. Justice Girouard, who rendered the decision for the court, stated that the Act does not authorize the substitution of one assignment for another.\nAs to the agreements made before the 29th of January, 1914, Thomas Brothers were, when they had an advance made, in the habit of giving a security on their goods for that specific sum. That was unquestionably valid.\nBut they were, at the same time, giving a security for all the notes previously discounted, including the one discounted on that day, and the agreement contained the following provision:\u2014\nThis security is given under the provisions of section 88 of the \u201cBank Act\u201d and is subject to the provisions of said Act. The said goods, wares and merchandise are now owned by Thomas Brothers, Limited, and are now in possession of Thomas Brothers, and are free from any mortgage, lien or charge thereon.\nThe agreement with the provision that the goods of Thomas Brothers were free from any mortgage, lien or charge thereon was then handed over to and accepted by the bank. That constituted, according to my opinion, an implied renunciation, on the part of the bank, of the lien or charge which existed before on the goods of Thomas Brothers in its favour.\nThe bank, seeing evidently that this declaration on the part of Thomas Brothers that there was no previous lien or charge was a declaration which might affect the validity of their security, changed the provisions of the agreement and we find later on that the securities contain the following:\u2014\nThe goods, wares and merchandise are now owned by and are now in the possession of the undersigned and are free from any mortgage, lien or charge thereon (excepting only previous assignments to the said bank, if any.)\nI am then on that point of opinion that the securities which have been given before the 24th of March, 1914, or before the petition for winding-up, are not valid and cannot be invoked against the liquidator and creditors of Thomas Brothers and should be set aside.\nNow coming to the question of mortgages, I find that the trial judge\u2014and in that respect he is confirmed by the Appellate Division\u2014was of opinion that the mortgages are valid.\nIn 1912, Thomas Brothers had given a promise that the securities by way of mortgages would be given on or before the 1st of October, 1912. These mortgages were not given at the time stipulated.\nIn 1913, a statement was prepared which seemed to shew a considerable profit in the company\u2019s business to the end of August, 1912. But in the fall of 1913, the bank produced a note by Clarkson & Co. which seemed to shew that the previous statement was inaccurate.\nThis naturally made the bank more anxious and they became insistent as to the real estate securities. They then signed a first mortgage on property situate in Ontario. In view of the findings of fact made by the trial judge, and confirmed on that point by the Appellate Division, I would not be ready to disturb that judgment as far as the Ontario mortgage is concerned; but on the 22nd of January, 1914, just two months before the petition for winding-up was presented, a mortgage was taken upon a property situate in the Province of Quebec.\nI am of opinion that with respect to that mortgage, the law of the place where the property was situate and where the mortgage has been given should govern. According to articles 2023 and 1032 et seq. of the Civil Code, where a creditor has knowledge of the insolvency of his debtor, he cannot take a valid mortgage on the property of his debtor.\nThere is no doubt that on the 22nd January, 1914, the bank knew that Thomas Brothers were unable to meet their liabilities. Then, according to my opinion, the Quebec mortgage should be set aside.\nFor these reasons, the appeal should be allowed with regard to the securities and with regard to the Quebec mortgage with costs throughout.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014I agree with my brother Anglin that there was no merger of previous securities given by Thomas Brothers, Limited, to the respondent by the fact that the prior advances by the latter were mentioned along with the contemporaneous advance made on the date when the new security was given to the bank. Each security was good for the contemporaneous advance and void as to the prior advances, but inasmuch as each of these prior advances was accompanied by the giving of security under section 88 of the \u201cBank Act,\u201d and as these prior securities were not merged in the subsequent security taken by the bank for another advance, the respondent holds securities for all its advances which meet the requirements of clause (a) of subsection 1 of section 90 of the \u201cBank Act.\u201d\nIt may, however, be remarked that the form of these securities is most misleading. Taking, for example, that of the 12th May, 1914, on which date an actual advance of $200 only was made, the contract or security begins by the words:\u2014\nIn consideration of an advance of two hundred and thirteen thousand four hundred dollars, made by the Dominion Bank to the undersigned, for which the said bank holds the following bills or notes:\nThis was almost inviting disaster in view of the imperative terms of clause (a), for out of this so-called advance of $213,400, the sum of $213,200 represented bills, notes, debts or liabilities which were not\nnegotiated or contracted at the time of the acquisition thereof by the bank.\nIt is only because the subsequent security did not supersede the prior securities given to the bank at the time of each advance, that the respondent can claim to have security under section 88 of the \u201cBank Act\u201d for more than the amount actually advanced by it at the time the last security was given by Thomas Brothers, Limited.\nIt was contended, however, by Mr. McCarthy that each security was covered by a prior promise given by Thomas Brothers, Limited, and that this would validate the security as to the prior advances under clause (b) of subsection 1 of section 90. This clause, taken in connection with the first paragraph of subsection 1, states that\nThe bank shall not acquire or hold any warehouse receipt or bill of lading, or any such security as aforesaid, to secure the payment of any bill, note, debt or liability, unless such bill, note, debt or liability is negotiated or contracted:\n(a)...\n(b) upon the written promise or agreement that such warehouse receipt or bill of lading or security would be given to the bank. I think the meaning of section 90, as a whole, is that there must be, when the bill or note is discounted by the bank, either\n(a) The giving of security under section 88 contemporaneously with the discounting of the note; or\n(b) An existing written promise to give such security to the bank at some future time.\nIn my opinion this written promise must be a specific promise to give a specific security at a subsequent date, and not a general promise to give security for any advance which the bank may make to the customer from time to time. It does not appear necessary that the note be discounted at the time the promise is made, provided that the note be discounted by the bank upon, i.e., in pursuance of, such a promise. When this written promise has been given, security may be taken by the bank to cover prior advances made by the bank upon such a specific promise.\nReferring again to the security of the 12th May, 1914, it states:\u2014\nThis security is given pursuant to the written promise or agreement of the undersigned, and especially of agreement dated 29th day of January, 1914.\nThe written promise of 29th of January, 1914, says:\u2014\nThe Dominion Bank (herein called the \u201cbank\u201d) is hereby requested by the undersigned to make advances to the undersigned (herein called the \u201ccustomer\u201d) from time to time, and in consideration thereof, the customer doth hereby promise and agree as follows:\u2014\n1. To give from time to time the bank security for every such advance and interest by way of warehouse receipts, bills of lading, or securities under sections 86, 87, 88 and 90 of the \u201cBank Act.\u201d\nIn my opinion this promise being a general promise referring to no specific security to be given in pursuance of the promise, but merely undertaking to give security for any advance which the bank may make from time to time, does not meet with the requirements of clause (b). I may add that if clause (b) were construed so as to validate securities for any prior advances which the bank might have made to the customer from time to time in pursuance of such a general promise made possibly years before the advances, the whole object of section 90 would be defeated.\nFortunately, however, for the respondent each security taken by it is good for each contemporaneous advance, and the prior securities are not merged into the subsequent ones, so that the claim against Thomas Brothers, Limited, is secured.\nI have referred to the security given to the bank on the 12th May, 1914, merely as an example of the course of dealing between the respondent and Thomas Brothers, Limited. I must say, however, that there is nother difficulty in the way of the respondent. Thee petition putting Thomas Brothers into liquidation was filed on the 28th of March, 1914. Subsequently to that date, the bank advanced to Thomas Brothers, Limited, the sum of $17,600, and took security therefor. The winding-up order bears the date of 1st May, 1914. I have duly considered the supplemental factums filed by the parties with regard to these advances and I fully concur in the opinion of His Lordship the Chief Justice as to the declaration that should be made in the judgment.\nI think that the appeal should be allowed with respect to the hypothec taken by the bank on the Montreal property on the 22nd January, 1914. I have no doubt that at the date of this mortgage Thomas Brothers, Limited, were insolvent. I am also of the opinion that this state of insolvency was known to the bank, for the latter then controlled the business of Thomas Brothers, Limited, and had received a report on their financial position up to August, 1913, shewing a considerable deficit on their operations during the preceding year. This question of the validity of the Montreal hypothec must be determined under the provisions of the Civil Code of the Province of Quebec. Reading article 2023 C.C. with articles 1032 et seq., I think that where a creditor has knowledge of the insolvency of his debtor, whether this state of insolvency be notorious or not, he cannot take a valid hypothec on the property of his debtor.\nOn the whole, therefore, I think the appeal should be allowed to the extent stated in the opinion of His Lordship the Chief Justice.\nAppeal allowed in part with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: John B.

The deed provided that \"the principal (should) be paid out of the first proceeds of the sale of the equity of the mortgagee,\" and there was no covenant of the mortgagor to pay the debt. The evidence of both parties was in direct conflict as to whether the mortgage had been given in payment of the purchase-price or merely as security.\nHeld, that under the circumstances the Court of Appeal was not justified in reversing the finding of fact of the trial judge, who had declared the mortgage to have been given as security only.\nPer Davies C.J.\u2014The absence in the deed of a covenant as to the personal liability of the mortgagor to pay the debt is not material.\nPer Idington and Anglin J J.\u2014The result of the failure to fix a time for payment is that the debt became payable within a reasonable time according to the intentions of both parties and having regard to all the circumstances.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, reversing the judgment of Grant J. and dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head\u2014note and in the judgments now reported.\nGeo. F. Henderson K.C. for the appellant.\nF. H. Chrysler K.C. for the respondent. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The trial judge in this case in all matters where the evidence of the appellant and the respondent was at variance accepted that of the appellant plaintiff and discredited that of the respondent.\nThe action was one brought to recover the price of four-fifth shares in a yacht claimed to have been sold to the defendant respondent by the plaintiff and to have been secured by a third mortgage on certain lands of the defendant.\nThe issues were whether the mortgage was taken and accepted by plaintiff as security only or in payment by way of exchange of the yacht shares for the mortgage, as contended by the defendant. The mortgage, which was drawn up by the defendant respondent, did not contain the usual covenant to pay the amount for which it was given.\nOn the findings of fact made by the trial judge, which I do not think we should disturb or set aside, and the admissibility of the evidence as to what the real bargain between the parties was, as to which I do not entertain any doubt, such evidence not contradicting the written documents, I am satisfied there was not merely an exchange of properties between the parties, nor do I think the acceptance by the plaintiff of the mortgage without a personal covenant to pay which mortgage had been prepared by the defendant discharged the debt which, in my opinion, the facts shew the mortgage was taken to secure.\nI think the payment of the interest on the mortgage for the two years preceding the action admitted by the defendant in his examination for discovery quite inconsistent with his claim that there had been merely an exchange of properties between the parties or an absolute sale of the shares in the yacht without any personal liability on defendant's part to pay the agreed price.\nThe evidence admitted to explain the real bargain did not contradict the written documents.\nAs to the absence of any personal liability of the mortgagor to pay the debt for which a mortgage is given, in which there is not a personal covenant to pay, see Canadian Edition of Fisher on Mortgages (1910), pp. 7, 413, 415, and Halsbury, vol. 21, p. 70.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the trial judge with costs in this court and in the Court of Appeal.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I am of the opinion that the questions raised herein ought to be determined by the facts of whether or not the mortgage taken was accepted as payment or merely as security for the payment of the price agreed on.\nI cannot see how the undoubted principle of law, that when an agreement between parties has been reduced to writing that writing must govern, can help us herein.\nThe actual question to be first determined is whether or not the agreement has been reduced to writing or at all events whether or not what has been reduced to writing was really in truth intended to cover the entire contractual relations in question or not.\nThe reliance placed upon the receipt clause of the bill of sale has very little to support it if we bear in mind the history of our law and its final results in relation thereto. At common law a man signing and sealing a document of that kind was estopped from denying such an acknowledgment. In equity it counted for little and standing alone without a duly endorsed receipt was held to put third parties on inquiry.\nA concise statement of the relevant law and authorities is to be found in Elphinstone on the Interpretation of Deeds, pp. 151 et seq.\nI admit it is a circumstance, even though of minor import, to be had in mind when all the surrounding circumstances have to be considered in order to determine which party's story is correct.\nThen there is another circumstance, also of very minor import, in the absence of a covenant for payment.\nThe general principle of law applicable to a mortgage debt, as stated by Fisher on Mortgages, 5th ed., at par. 8, implying a recoverable debt because it is presumed to be given for a loan, is prim\u00e2 facie applicable. And I do not think that the express statement of the consideration being the price of the sale of same article entirely eliminates the need for observing the general rule.\nI may remark, in passing, that is none the less so, when the instrument has been drawn by a professional man a party thereto to be tendered to another, and contains no restriction upon said rule of law or explanation of what was really intended.\nMoreover in this case the respondent paid the interest from time to time for four years, although he had not covenanted to do so.\nThe following contains the peculiar terms of payment:\u2014\nProvided this mortgage to be void on payment of two thousand dollars ($2,000) of lawful money of Canada, with interest at seven (7) per cent. per annum, as well after as before maturity, as follows: the principal to be paid out of the first proceeds of the sale of the equity of the mortgagee in the said land, the first payment of interest to be made on the nineteenth day of January, 1915, interest thereafter to be paid annually on the 19th day of January in each and every year. The interest was to run, apparently from date, and to continue \"as well after as before maturity;\" but when was maturity? We may try to assume that it was meant to be when the sale of the equity was obtained. Are we on such assumption to conclude that unless and until such a sale was effected as would produce $2,000 there could be no maturity?\nIf we observe literally the language used that would seem to be the case. But if it was found impossible to get more, who was to pay the interest? Was respondent to be presumed bound to supply it? Or was the provision for payment of interest after maturity a mere mockery? And if no more than say $1,000 or $1,500 could be got, what was the purpose of providing for payment of seven per cent. on $2,000 for that is clearly implied? Who was to pay it?\nAgain was all that a solemn mockery? And if only say $100 to $500 was ever, or within a reasonable time, realizable, are we to suppose the parties had so contracted that the four\u2014fifths of the value of the yacht was to pass for that trifle?\nSuch a gamble is conceivable but does the story told, by either party, indicate that such was the nature of the transaction? All these and many more like considerations press upon one in considering what in truth was the essential nature of the bargain entered into.\nThe appellant swears he never considered or inquired what the value of the property was but took the respondent's word as to the probabilities and estimates relative thereto, and there is no attempt made to contradict this statement, or shew facts and circumstances which would furnish contradiction and thereby indicate the intention of the appellant to accept a gambling proposition. Surely if a gamble of that sort really was what the parties were negotiating, he who drew the instrument, and against whom it must, therefore, be most strongly construed, should and would have applied his professional skill to frame something entirely different from that presented for our consideration.\nIt would, I submit, be much more like what the stories given by either or both, so far as reconcilable, should lead us to expect, to infer that the deal was one of bargain and sale at a named price, with a mode and nature of security to be given, for carrying it out, in harmony and consistently with the relations between old friends, whereby there should be a mutual trust and forbearance to be limited by the bounds of what might and should in law be held reasonable.\nTo so interpret the conduct and purpose of the parties and their intentions towards each other under such circumstances that neither suffer an injustice, is what we should aim at, in order to do justice between them, when unfortunately they have been led to entertain what are probably unjust views of each other's conduct.\nFollowing out that line of thought, and bearing in mind the findings of fact by the learned trial judge, it seems to me that there was an actual sale of the four\u2014fifths of the Ailsa at $2,000, and that, not as evidence of contract but to secure the carrying out thereof, there was a rather crudely framed mortgage, intended only as a security, for the execution of the contract, and thus leaving much to be supplied or fulfilled, by the application of the rule of what was, under the circumstances, reasonable.\nIt seems to me that if the parties had not fallen out, there would have been either an earlier sale of the property so put up as security, or greater forbearance in enforcing the claim for the payment. Should the case not have been tried out and treated on some such basis?\nI regret to say that such views received little attention at the trial, and some evidence on that, and other points bearing on the possibilities of realization of the security, has not been presented. We are then left to determine the question of whether or not a reasonable time has elapsed or not to carry out what was the evident intention of the parties.\nTo blame the war for the condition of things during a year preceding it is not very satisfactory.\nI am quite clear the bargain was concluded a year before the war broke out and the execution of the document only postponed to enable respondent to complete his final arrangements with others.\nThe conclusions I have reached are, that there was an actual bargain and sale by which the appellant agreed to pay $2,000 for four-fifths of the yacht; that there was to be given a mortgage to secure such payment; that the time for payment was not specified; and hence must be taken to be within what would be a reasonable time within the contemplation of the parties; that such time was not wholly dependent upon the will of the respondent; that having regard to all the circumstances such reasonable time had elapsed at the time of the institution of this action, and hence the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored with costs herein and of the Court of Appeal.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The issue in this case is whether a mortgage on real estate made by the respondent to the appellant was intended to be given and accepted merely as security for the payment by the respondent of the purchase-price of a four-fifths interest in a yacht bought by him from the appellant or was intended to be given and taken in payment and satisfaction of such purchase-price. Upon that issue parol evidence was, in my opinion, admissible. It in nowise contradicts or varies the written instruments which passed between the parties. The outcome rests entirely upon the credit to be attached to the evidence of the parties themselves who are in direct conflict. The learned trial judge had the advantage of seeing and hearing them, and his conclusion was that the evidence of the appellant was entitled to credit while that of the respondent could not be accepted.\nSo far as the probabilities may be taken into account they would appear to be almost equally balanced. While it is most improbable that the vendor intended to accept a third mortgage on highly speculative real estate as payment, it is at first blush difficult to account for the omission from the mortgage of a covenant for payment if a personal obligation on the part of the purchaser had been assumed. But it must not be forgotten that the mortgage was taken only many months after the sale, when the obligation (if any) to pay the purchase-price had been assumed. On the whole, I incline to think the probabilities rather favour the vendor's contention, because otherwise he would not only have to wait indefinitely for payment, but his prospects of ever receiving anything would depend entirely upon the sale of the mortgaged property for a sum over and above what would be sufficient to satisfy the two prior incumbrances upon it. He would be taking all the risk of the defendant's real estate speculation without any prospect of advantage from it beyond his purchase-price. He might get nothing at all and in no case could he hope for more than his $2,000. The admitted agreement to pay interest on that amount almost implies an obligation to pay the principal.\nBut assuming the probabilities to be equally balanced, which, I think, is the view most favourable to the respondent of which the circumstances admit, with respect, it was, in my opinion, to quote Viscount Haldane, \"a rash proceeding on the part of the Court of Appeal\" to reverse on an issue of pure fact such as that presented, the finding of a trial judge necessarily and expressly made to depend upon the credit to be given to the conflicting evidence of the parties to the transaction whom he saw and heard testify. Nocton v. Ashburton[1].\nThe chief difficulty in the case is to determine when the purchase-price became payable, no definite time for payment having been fixed. In my opinion the result of the failure to fix a time for payment was that the money became payable within a reasonable time having regard to all the circumstances. I think the purpose of the parties was to allow the respondent what might be regarded as a reasonable time in which to make a sale of the mortgaged property in order to place himself in funds to meet the appellant's claim. Such a time, in my opinion, expired long before this action was brought and the purchase money was then exigible.\nI would, therefore, allow this appeal with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and would restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The respondent having paid interest on the mortgage for which he is sued cannot now claim that the mortgage was given in payment of his obligation. This case was principally a question of credibility of the parties. The trial judge having found in favour of the appellant, it seems to me that the Court of Appeal should not have disturbed that finding.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014In this case I am of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored.\nI cannot take the bill of sale, which falsely states that the price of the four\u2014fifths share of the yacht Ailsa II. was paid by the respondent to the appellant, nor the mortgage signed by the respondent as correctly expressing the terms of the agreement of the parties. The learned trial judge has found what this agreement really was, and I would not disturb his finding on this question of fact. It would require stronger evidence than that afforded by these documents to make me believe that the appellant agreed to sell an interest in his yacht on terms that would have given the respondent the right to defer payment until he obtained a satisfactory price for his property in Vancouver, an event which might never occur. The mortgage, like any other mortgage, is an accessory contract and a security for a debt. What this debt was is shewn by the testimony of the appellant, which the learned trial judge accepted in preference to that of the respondent.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the trial court with costs here and in the Court of Appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Bowser, Reid, Wallbridge, Douglas & Gibson.\nSolicitor for the respondent: E.

(Defendant) Respondent.\n1919: May 6; 1919: May 19.\nPresentr: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA.\nNegligence\u2014Joint negligence\u2014Proper direction to jury\u2014Practice and procedure\u2014New ground on appeal\u2014Costs against appellant\u2014Statutory right\u2014Question of costs\u2014Duty of the Supreme Court to interfere\u2014\"Supreme Court Act\" of British Columbia, R.S.B.C. 1911, c. 58, s. 55.\nIn an action for damages, the jury found negligence on the part both of the defendant's employees and of the plaintiff's wife who was driving his automobile; and also found that, after these employees became aware, or should have become aware, that the automobile was in danger of being injured, they could have prevented such injury by the speedy application of the brakes.\nHeld, that the jury should also have been required to find whether or not the appellant's wife after she became, or should have become, aware of danger could herself have avoided the accident by the exercise of reasonable care, and therefore the Court of Appeal was justified in ordering a new trial.\nBrodeur J. dissenting on the ground that, upon the evidence, the accident was entirely due to the negligence of appellant's wife; but\nHeld, Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that, as the \"ground of objection\" before the Court of Appeal had not been \"taken at the trial,\" the order should have been granted with costs against the then appellant, now respondent, pursuant to section 55 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" of British Columbia.\nPer Davies C.J., Anglin and Mignault JJ.\u2014It is within the jurisdiction and duty of the Supreme Court of Canada to reverse an order as to costs, when a party, having a statutory right to receive his costs of certain proceedings from his opponent, has, on the contrary, been ordered to pay that opponent's costs, especially when the appeal to this court, its merits being arguable, was evidently not brought merely for the purpose of introducing the question of costs.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal, (43 D.L.R. 47; (1918) 3 W.W.R. 385,) affirmed as to merits, but reversed as to costs, Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissenting. APPEAL from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], rendered on an appeal from a judgment of Macdonald J. at the trial[2], and ordering a new trial.\nThe action is one for damages to a motor car driven by the wife of the appellant, through a collision between the car and a passenger train of the respondent. The questions put to the jury and the answers were as follows:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Was the damage to the plaintiff's automobile caused by the negligence of the defendant? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014If so, in what did such negligence consist? A.\u2014In delaying the application of brakes.\nQ.\u2014Could the driver of the automobile, by the exercise of reasonable care, have avoided the accident? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014If she might, in what respect was such driver negligent? A.\u2014In not exercising sufficient watchfulness by looking to the right as well as to the left.\nQ.\u2014If, after the employees of defendant became aware or ought (if they had exercised reasonable care) to have become aware that the automobile was in danger of being injured, could they have prevented such injury by the exercise of reasonable care? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014If so, in what manner or by what means could they have prevented the accident? A.\u2014By the speedy application of brakes.\nQ.\u2014Amount of damages? A.\u2014$1,485.\nAfter hearing argument the trial judge directed that judgment be entered for the appellant for $1,485 and costs of the action.\nFrom this judgment the present respondent appealed to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia; and one of its grounds of appeal was that the trial judge should have submitted a further question to the jury\nas to whether, when the driver of the automobile in question became aware, or ought, if she had exercised reasonable care, to have become aware, that the automobile was in danger of being hit by the train, she could have prevented the injury by the exercise of reasonable care.\nSection 55 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" of British Columbia, R.S.B.C. (1911), c. 58, provides that in the event of a new trial being granted\nby the Court of Appeal\nupon ground of objection not taken at the trial, the costs of the appeal shall be paid by the appellant * * *\nThe Court of Appeal, in this case, ordered a new trial, but directed the present appellant, then respondent, to pay the costs of the appeal.\nMartin Griffin for the appellant.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and A. J. Thomson for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The question raised herein is whether or not the learned trial judge in his charge to the jury so adequately dealt with the problems of law presented by the facts for the consideration of the jury, that there was no necessity for a new trial as directed by the Court of Appeal.\nIf the finding of contributory negligence on the part of the appellant's agent in charge of the automobile, did not, as there is much reason for holding it did, deprive him of any right to recover, it could only be so by some very special circumstances, by no means self\u2014evident in the case, requiring direction containing an explanation of the relevant law to enable the jury properly to deal with the possibilities of such a case.\nIf the facts had been such as to permit of the application of the principle acted upon in the Loach Case[3], referred to in the judgments below and properly held inapplicable, one might have expected an exposition of the law bearing thereon. There was nothing in the charge that would adequately fit such a case; probably because of the want of facts calling therefor.\nIf, as may possibly be arguable, the facts called for the application of the principle proceeded upon in the case of Davies v. Mann[4], and many like cases since then, there should have appeared in the charge something more than does appear.\nThe allusion to the illustration of the running down of the donkey tethered in the street should suffice for the lawyer conversant with the law of negligence, but I doubt if even the most intelligent jury would be enabled from what was said, intelligently to apply the principle in question. Indeed the result strongly suggests they did not.\nI suspect it was the absence of the necessary facts in the case that caused the learned judge's terseness of allusion.\nIt is quite possible that the view suggested by Mr. Justice McPhillips which, strictly adhered to, would have involved a judgment of dismissal of the action, should have been the result in appeal. I pass no opinion thereupon, for as I view the case as presented to us there must be a new trial and the less said the better.\nHad there been a cross-appeal claiming a dismissal, I should have felt bound to examine the evidence closely and determine for myself such issue.\nThe appellant is not, in my opinion, entitled to maintain the judgment so obtained and hence the new trial should be proceeded with.\nThe appellant's counsel submitted that in such event he was entitled to the costs of appeal because, as he alleged, and the Chief Justice seemed to admit, the counsel for respondent at the trial did not take the objection to the charge which he should have done.\nIn answer to my inquiry why he did not call the attention of the Court of Appeal to the non-application of the provision of the statute in that behalf, an explanation was given which leads me, in light thereof and of the fact that an objection was taken to the learned judge's charge which he practically disregarded, to infer there had been a misunderstanding.\nThere is, in fact, no ground in this case to apply the new rule adopted in British Columbia for penalizing the party who is silent in presence of a misdirection.\nThe substantial ground of quarrel with the learned judge's charge is that he did not adequately deal with the subject-matter and not that it was absolutely necessary in law to have two or more specific questions submitted than he saw fit to submit.\nThough the learned Chief Justice expressed the view that when such supplementary questions were put another should also be put, the court did not adopt or carry out or proceed thereon, but exercised its substantial power to grant a new trial as it properly might by resting upon the view that it was necessary in order that justice might be done.\nWe have long observed a very salutary rule borrowed from the practice of the court above, never to entertain appeals either for mere errors of practice or procedure or judgments as to costs, unless in some extreme case which, in view of the grounds upon which the majority of the court proceeded, this is not.\nThe decisions are collected at pages 86 et seq. of Cameron's Practice, beginning at foot of said page 86.\nIt is not a question of jurisdiction but of the need to confine the litigious spirit within proper bounds.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. ANGLIN J.\u2014The jury having found negligence on the part both of the defendants' employees and of the plaintiff's wife, who was driving his automobile, in answer to two further questions (Nos. 5 and 6) found that after the employees of the defendants became aware, or ought to have become aware, that the automobile was in danger of being injured, they could have prevented such injury, in the exercise of reasonable care, by the speedy application of the brakes. On these findings the learned judge entered judgment for the plaintiff.\nThe Court of Appeal ordered a new trial. Galliher J.A. and Eberts J.A. assigned no reasons for this order. Martin J.A., while at first inclined to the view that the answers of the jury to the 5th and 6th questions could not be supported on the evidence, thought it safer to order a new trial apparently because in his opinion the trial judge should have complied with the request of counsel for the defendants to direct the jury in accordance with the views expressed by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in Morrison v. Dominion Iron & Steel Co.[5]. McPhillips J.A., while stating at some length reasons which would appear to warrant a judgment dismissing the action on the ground that the evidence did not sustain the answers to the 5th and 6th questions, and that the accident was ascribable solely to the reckless carelessness of the driver of the automobile, concurred in the order for a new trial on the ground that the jury should have been instructed that it was the duty of the driver of the motor car as well as that of the railway employees to have taken all reasonable care to avoid the collision when the danger of it became, or should have been, apparent, and that questions as to her conduct at that stage of the occurrence similar to those with regard to the conduct of the railway employees (Nos. 5 and 6) should have been submitted to the jury. The learned Chief Justice bases his judgment solely on the failure of the learned trial judge to instruct the jury as to\nthe duty of the driver of the automobile to take reasonable care to avoid the collision after she became aware of the danger. * * * As the case was left to the jury, though the obligation of the defendants was submitted, that of Mrs. Gavin was ignored. While no objection in this connection was taken by defendant's counsel at the trial yet it was the duty of the learned judge to leave the issues to the jury with proper and complete directions on the law and as to the evidence applicable to such issues: \"Supreme Court Act,\" sec. 55.\nThe court ordered a new trial and directed that the costs of the appeal be paid by the plaintiff and that those of the former trial should abide the event of the new trial.\nOn examining the charge of the learned trial judge, I find that while it might, no doubt, have been more definite and explicit on these points, it contains the substance of the law as stated in the Morrison Case[6], referred to by Martin J.A., both as to the duties of a traveller on the highway and as to the rights and responsibilities of those in charge of railway trains when approaching highway crossings. An order for a new trial based solely on the ground of non\u2014direction in these particulars, in my opinion, could not be supported. But although the learned trial judge alludes to the duty of a traveller on a highway to be more than ordinarily alert and observant when approaching a railway crossing, and to the allegation of the defence that Mrs. Gavin,\nafter she became aware of the danger, was not able, or could not, on account of incompetency, avoid the danger, and thus brought the accident on herself, adding,\nThere are two phases you have to consider in connection with her conduct that afternoon, i.e., first as to her conduct before she saw the car or was aware of the approach of the car, and as to her conduct afterwards. I think I can hardly be of any further assistance to you on that branch of the case,\nwhen dealing with the 5th and 6th questions, while he discusses the duty of the brakesman to have taken all reasonable means to stop the train when he came, or should have come, to the conclusion that there was danger of collision, he says not a word of the corresponding obligation of the driver of the motor car. As the case was left to the jury the true issue as to \"ultimate negligence\" under the circumstances in evidence, in my opinion, was not fairly submitted to them. I agree, therefore, that a new trial was properly ordered on that ground.\nBut the appellant complains, and I think with reason, that he has been ordered to pay the costs of the appeal to the Court of Appeal in contravention of an explicit provision of sec. 55 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" (R.S.B.C. 1911, ch. 58). That section is as follows:\u2014\n55. Nothing herein, or in any Act, or in any Rules of Court, shall take away or prejudice the right of any party to any action to have the issues for trial by jury submitted and left by the judge to the jury before whom the same shall come for trial with a proper and complete direction to the jury upon the law and as to the evidence applicable to such issues: provided also that the said right may be enforced by appeal, as provided by the \"Court of Appeal Act,\" this Act, or Rules of Court, without any exception having been taken at the trial; provided further that in the event of a new trial being granted upon ground of objection not taken at the trial, the costs of the appeal shall be paid by the appellant, and the costs of the abortive trial shall be in the discretion of the court.\nI have carefully read the objections taken by counsel at the close of the learned judge's charge and I find the statement of the learned Chief Justice, as is usual, fully borne out that no objection in this connection was taken by defendants' counsel at the trial.\nThe questions put to the jury had been submitted to counsel before they made their addresses and counsel for the defendants accepted them as satisfactory. The order for a new trial, if not granted by the Court of Appeal on a \"ground of objection not taken at the trial,\" is, in my opinion, maintainable only on such a ground and it follows that under section 55 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" of British Columbia the appellant (plaintiff) was entitled to the costs of the appeal to the Court of Appeal and was wrongfully deprived of them by that court, either through inadvertence or possibly because the majority of the court (Martin, Galliher and Eberts JJ.A.) were of the opinion that the ground indicated by Mr. Justice Martin, which had been taken by counsel for the defendant in his objections to the learned judge's charge, sufficed to support the order for a new trial.\nWhile this court ordinarily refuses to entertain an appeal which merely involves costs, where, as here, a party entitled by statute to receive his costs of certain proceedings from his opponent has been ordered to pay that opponent's costs, I think it is our duty to interfere. The disposition of the costs in question was in no wise in the discretion of the Court of Appeal. They were erroneously disposed of because of a mistake on a matter of law which affected them. Archbald v. DeLisle[7]; Delta v. Vancouver Railway Co.[8]. If not, this is an extreme case; a statutory right has been ignored and a gross error would appear to have been made. The jurisdiction and duty of this court under such circumstances to reverse an order as to costs, although not interfering with the disposition made of the case itself, has, so far as I am aware, never been disaffirmed. See Smith v. Saint John City Rly. Co.[9]. Moreover, the present appeal was not for costs only. On the merits it was fairly arguable that the answers to the 5th and 6th questions entitled the plaintiff to judgment. This appeal was not brought on colourable grounds merely for the purpose of introducing the question of costs. Inglis v. Mansfield[10].\nWhile sustaining the order for a new trial, therefore, I would set aside the order as to the costs of the appeal to the Court of Appeal and would substitute for it an order that the appellant's (plaintiff's) costs of that appeal should be paid by the respondents (defendants). The plaintiff was obliged to come to this court for redress and is, therefore, entitled to his costs of this appeal.\nBRODEUR J. (dissenting). \u2014 This action was brought by the appellant to recover damages for the destruction of his automobile as the result of a collision with a train of the railway company respondent, on Winnipeg Street, in the Town of Penticton.\nThe action was tried by a jury which found:\u2014\n1. That the damage was caused by the negligence of the defendant in delaying the application of the brakes;\n2. That the driver of the automobile was also guilty of negligence in not looking properly before attempting to cross the railway track; and\n3. That the employees of the railway company could have prevented the injury by a speedy application of brakes after they had become aware that the automobile was in danger of being injured. The evidence shews that the train which struck the automobile was moving reversely and, as required by sec. 276 of the \"Railway Act\" there was stationed, on the part of the train which was then foremost, employees to warn persons crossing, or about to cross, the track of the railway.\nThe speed at which the train was moving was a moderate one and was likely less than the one at which it is authorized to run in the towns.\nNo negligence on the part of the railway company could be found, or has been found in that respect.\nIt seems to me that the only cause of the accident was that the driver of the automobile, Mrs. Gavin, did not look properly to see whether there was danger for her in crossing the track. She gives us an excuse that she had been informed that no train was expected from the right and that she had been looking only to her left.\nA person approaching a highway crossing a railroad track should look and listen for approaching trains with the care and caution of an ordinarily prudent man. She must make a vigilant use of her senses, and she must look in every direction from which danger may be apprehended, and it would be very imprudent for her to rely then on the information of some person who has nothing to do with the administration of the railway. Some judgments go so far as to state that if the person does not look and listen, the court will draw the inference that his act contributed to the injury and will apply this rule although the railway company failed to give the proper cautionary signals, or was guilty of other acts of negligence concurring to cause the injury. Damrill v. St. Louis & San Francisco Ray Co.[11]. A railway train is not bound to stop or to moderate its speed at every highway crossing. The law imposes upon the company the obligation to make some signals. However, it is an obligation on the company to use ordinary care and prudence to protect the person at a highway crossing after discovery of his presence.\nThe travellers and employees who were on the platform of the train when they first saw the automobile never suspected that there was danger of the machine running upon the railway track. They all thought it would stop and in fact it would certainly have stopped if the driver had not been so negligent. When the brakesman of the train saw, however, that there was danger, he warned the driver of the automobile and some pedestrians near by did the same thing. The brakesman at the same time signalled the engineer of the train to stop the train. The brakes were applied, but, unfortunately, it was too late.\nThe evidence, according to my opinion, is very conclusive and discloses the fact that the accident was due entirely to the negligence of the driver of the automobile. The action, in my opinion, should have been dismissed.\nThe Court of Appeal ordered a new trial on the ground that some additional question should have been submitted to the jury as to whether Mrs. Gavin, after she became aware of the danger, could have prevented the accident by the exercise of reasonable care and also on the ground that the trial judge should have charged, as he was asked to do, that those in charge of the train were entitled to rely upon the driver using due care.\nIt seems to me that the evidence does not justify a finding of negligence on the part of the company. There is no cross-appeal on the part of the company and I must, therefore, purely and simply, dismiss the appeal. A new trial will then have to take place.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The Court of Appeal of British Columbia has ordered a new trial in this case, on the appeal of the present respondent. The latter is apparently satisfied with the judgment and has not cross-appealed to this court. For that reason I will refrain from expressing any opinion as to the liability, on the findings of the jury, of the respondent.\nAfter the verdict, the railway company appealed from the judgment of the learned trial judge condemning it to pay $1,485 to Gavin. Its grounds of appeal were five in number. The two first were grounds for the dismissal of the action. The third ground, referring to the alleged improper admission of evidence, and the fourth, pretending that the trial judge should have submitted a further question to the jury\nas to whether, when the driver of the automobile in question became aware, or ought, if she had exercised reasonable care, to have become aware that the automobile was in danger of being hit by the train, she could have prevented the injury by the exercise of reasonable care.\nwere grounds for ordering a new trial. The fifth ground,\nall other grounds appearing in the proceedings at the trial.\nnotwithstanding its generality, was urged, I should think, as a reason for demanding a new trial.\nThe learned Chief Justice of British Columbia adopted the fourth ground of appeal, and was of the opinion that a new trial should be ordered. Mr. Justice Martin favoured granting a new trial on the ground that a direction should be given to the jury as to the commonsense duty of persons crossing railway tracks and the reasonable anticipation of employees in charge of trains in accordance with the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in Morrison v. Dominion Iron & Steel Co.[12]. Mr Justice Galliher and Mr. Justice Eberts gave no reasons, and although Mr. Justice McPhillips' opinion seems to lead to a conclusion favourable to the dismissal of the plaintiff's action, he concurred in ordering a new trial.\nI take it that the charge to the jury of the learned trial judge was sufficient, but I am of the opinion that he should have put the question suggested by the fourth ground of appeal of the present respondent. I therefore, think that a new trial was rightly ordered on that ground only.\nBut this ground was raised, not at the trial, but on the appeal. This brings me to consider the effect of sec. 55 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" of British Columbia, R.S.B.C., 1911, ch. 58, which reads as follows:\u2014\n55. Nothing herein, or in any Act, or in any Rules of Court, shall take away or prejudice the right of any party to any action to have the issues for trial by jury submitted and left by the judge to the jury before whom the same shall come for trial, with a proper and complete direction to the jury upon the law and as to the evidence applicable to such issues; provided also that the said right may be enforced by appeal, as provided by the \"Court of Appeal Act,\" this Act, or Rules of Court, without any exception having been taken at the trial; provided further that in the event of a new trial being granted upon ground of objection not taken at the trial, the costs of the appeal shall be paid by the appellant, and the costs of the abortive trial shall be in the discretion of the court.\nThis section directs that in the event of a new trial being granted upon grounds of objection not taken at the trial, the costs of the appeal shall be paid by the appellant.\nInstead of following this imperative direction the Court of Appeal of British Columbia condemned the respondent on that appeal (the present appellant) to pay the costs of the appeal. I am of the opinion that it could not do so. This adjudication of the costs of the appeal was not a matter lying within the discretion of the court below, which was bound to grant the costs of that appeal to the present appellant. The only discretion that the court below had was as to the costs of the abortive trial, and it directed that those costs abide the event of the new trial. But it could not, under the circumstances, condemn the present appellant to pay the costs of and occasioned by the appeal.\nMuch as I feel reluctant to interfere with a judgment on a question involving costs, I cannot escape doing so here, for the imperative requirement of the statute above referred to has been disregarded. I would, therefore, affirm the judgment appealed from in so far as it orders a new trial, but I would vary it so as to condemn the present respondent to pay the costs of his appeal to the British Columbia Court of Appeal. He should also pay the costs of the appellant here.\nAppeal allowed in part with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Martin Griffin & Co.\nSolicitor for the respondent: N. F.

Brodeur J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[1], Province of Quebec, varying a judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in review, at Montreal[2], and maintaining the plaintiff's action.\nThe plaintiff sued to recover damages from the defendant for a breach of a five year partnership contract in a real estate business in Montreal, about twenty-one months before it would have terminated by effluxion of time. The plaintiff's claim was for $350 000. The trial judge assessed his damages at $80,000; the Court of Review reduced them to $22,000 and the Court of King's Bench gave judgment for $40,000. The appellant seeks the restoration of the judgment of the Court of Review; and the respondent, by way of cross-appeal, demands the restoration of the judgment of the trial judge. An important question of law was in issue: Is the court, in assessing damages for wrongful termination by a partner of a partnership, entitled to consider facts subsequent to the action, or must it ignore them and assess the damages according to conditions existing at the date of the action? The trial judge adopted the second alternative and the Court of Review the first; the Court of King's Bench did not expressly pass upon the question, although appearing to have proceeded on the principle laid down by the Court of Review.\nEug. Lafleur K.C., Aim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and G. H. Montgomery K.C. for the appellant.\nW. N. Tilley K.C., J. L. Perron K.C. and Cook K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I agree with the principles stated by Mr. Justice Lamothe (now Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal of Quebec) in delivering his reasons for judgment in this case in the Court of Review[3], as to the proper method of estimating and assessing damages in such a case as the present. I would myself, however, in applying those principles have increased the amount of the damages somewhat, but I will not dissent on that ground alone and I concur in a lowing the appeal with costs and restoring the judgment of the Court of Review.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant had established a real estate business in Montreal. On the 26th May, 1910, there was incorporated a company to carry on said business under the name of \"Findlay & Howard.\" On the 22nd of August, 1910, an agreement was entered into between the parties hereto who were in fact the substantial members of the aid incorporation, wherein it was stated that in reality the said company was formed by the said parties hereto for the sake of enabling them to more conveniently carry on their business, but as between themselves they intend to operate the said company in somewhat the same manner as if they were co-partners carrying on business under the name of \"Findlay & Howard\" and not merely officers of the company.\nThis agreement was to have continued in force for five years.\nThey carried on business under said name accordingly until the 11th of September, 1913, when appellant requested a termination of same.\nThere ensued a correspondence between them which terminated on the 12th December, 1913, by the forcible ejection of respondent by appellant from the premises wherein the business was carried on.\nImmediately thereupon the respondent instituted this action for damages for breach of the said agreement.\nMeantime, on the 7th October, 1913, a company was incorporated under the name of \"John Findlay, Limited,\" to carry on the business of dealing in real estate and under cover of that name appellant took possession gradually of the entire business which the parties hereto had carried on as aforesaid and continued thereafter to exclude the respondent from any interference therewith, save and except such rights as conceded to him by a partial settlement of their difficulties.\nAll the pretensions of appellant in way of justification for his conduct have been decisively rejected and are not now in question. All that is in question herein is the amount of damages which respondent is entitled to.\nThe last clause of the respondent's declaration which, I think, for reasons I am about to state, seems to have been overlooked, reads as follows:\u2014 41. The plaintiff expressly reserves his right to recover his share and proportion of the assets of Findlay & Howard, Limited, and further expressly reserves his right to take such other proceedings in the premises as may be necessary or advisable for the protection of his interests.\nInasmuch as the business carried on by the parties hereto was carried on in the name of \"Findlay & Howard, Limited,\" and the fruits thereof passed to it, though the subsidiary agreement, on which in a technical sense their action rests, provided for the term of five years' control, and distribution of profits of said corporate business, we should not have to concern ourselves with anything but such loss of profits as the respondent suffered by his exclusion.\nYet I suspect there has, by a confusion of thought, entered into the estimate thereof much that should not have done so.\nAll the profits made by the carrying on of the business of \"Findlay & Howard, Limited,\" became part of the assets thereof and should not enter into consideration in determining the problem of how much the respondent's share of its profits has been impaired by the wrongful conduct of the appellant.\nIt is that problem and nothing else that we have to solve.\nThe remarkable diversity of judicial opinion which this litigation has developed impresses me with the need of emphasizing this proposition which I have laid down for my guide.\nIt sometimes happens that when partners disagree and one excludes the other, the community in which they live take sides and thus the business is seriously impaired.\nThe respondent seems to have possessed so much strong common sense that he did not lend himself to anything necessarily productive of such results. He relied upon this action properly taken, if he could not have obtained an injunction, to preserve his rights and recover his share of whatever loss of profits the business sustained by his exclusion.\nThe learned trial judge finds the business though carried on, after the exclusion, under the name of \"John Findlay, Limited,\" was the same business, only the name being changed.\nThe same staff (substituting one Parker for respondent), the same kind of business and the same prestige, and admittedly the same clientele should, under a continuation of same circumstances, have produced same results in way of profits. But everyone knows the circumstances had changed so remarkably that to estimate the profits on the basis of former years must be illusory.\nIf the trial had been postponed for nine months and appellant then had been forced to produce his books a nearly absolutely correct assessment of damages could have been arrived at.\nThe misfortune is that the trial was too early for that and hence necessarily the result had to be determined by evidence which, in any such like case, must be more or less of a speculative character.\nAdded to this was the view of the law taken by the learned trial judge which has not been shared in by any of the other judges who have had to consider the case. Hence his judgment for $80,000 has been set aside\nThe Court of Review reduced that to $22,000 upon an entirely different view of the law which has been given expression to by Mr. Justice Lamothe, with whose main point of view I agree.\nIn the details thereof I cannot say that I entirely agree. There was before the court an account of the business of \"John Findlay, Limited,\" for the year from the 4th November, 1913, to 30th October, 1914, which was audited by same accountant as had been employed in former years by the parties hereto.\nThe net profits were shewn thereby to have been $13,353.86 which, if presumed to have continued for the balance of the five years' partnership now in question, would have produced to respondent a great deal less than the Court of Review awarded him.\nThat court, however, eliminated certain items of expense from that amount and seems to have assumed that the war conditions pending would have resulted in no profit. I am not quite satisfied with the details by which the award thus reached was fixed at $22,000. I think they are open to some criticism yet the substantial result reached is one I should not if in the place of the Court of Appeal have disturbed.\nThe basis taken was a much more satisfactory one than that taken by the Court of Appeal which took the year ending 30th November, 1913. And apart from other considerations it included many questionable items which should not have entered into a basic computation of the probable profits from current earnings in the following period. Indeed, it seems to me far from furnishing a safe basis for computation.\nHad its record been sifted in such a way as to eliminate items in respect of which there could be nothing analogous in the later period now in question and the case threshed out at the trial on some such basis, it might have been made useful, but I hardly think would have justified the result reached by the Court of Appeal.\nAgain, the Court of Appeal took into consideration the goodwill of the business and in a way that I can find nothing in law or fact to uphold. Goodwill is sometimes a valuable asset of an old partnership. That, however, was the asset of the corporate company and hence excluded by the pleading.\nIf you choose to imagine a valuable asset in a five year term I much doubt its existence.\nI quite agree that the possibility of a more satisfactory result in an amicable dissolution might have been reached, but I cannot say that respondent would have reaped much from that factor in this instance even if the partnership had run its full term.\nA man might, by misconduct, so wreck a firm as to give rise to such a claim, but here it is something intangible.\nThe field was just as open for the respondent at the expiration of the term from all that appears as it ever would have been I imagine.\nAs an outside man, as it were, he never had the same chance of securing a share of the clientele in the end as the inside man who had founded the business as appellant had.\nAs to the respondent not seeking some other occupation or business this was not a case in which any such rule or principle as relied upon can be properly applied.\nIf nothing else, his position as outside man had become such that when the stage of decline in business had been reached he would have been, if staying on in that event, almost in the condition of a gentleman of leisure, as his active occupation would have been gone, and he was entitled to reap that reward with other earnings which his energetic efforts in the outside field had helped to make so successful.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the Court of Review, but I should hesitate to give costs.\nThe cross-appeal should be dismissed. Anglin J.\u2014The plaintiff Howard sues to recover damages from the defendant Findlay for what the latter now admits to have been an unwarranted breach by him of a five year partnership contract on the 30th November, 1913, about twenty-one months before it would have terminated by effluxion of time. The plaintiff's claim was for $350,000, and he expressly excepted from this action, and reserved his right to recover, his share and proportion of the assets of the partnership, and to take such other proceedings as might be necessary or advisable for the protection of his interests. The trial judge assessed his damages at $80,000; the Court of Review, on an appeal by the defendant, at $22,000; and the Court of Appeal, on appeal by the plaintiff, at $40,000. From the latter assessment the defendant appeals to this court seeking a restoration of the judgment of the Court of Review, from which he had not appealed. By a cross-appeal the plaintiff demands the restoration of the judgment of the trial judge.\nAlthough \"Findlay & Howard, Limited,\" was an incorporated company, by an agreement between the plaintiff and the defendant it was arranged that they should\noperate the said business in somewhat the same manner as if they were co-partners carrying on business under the name of \"Findlay & Howard\" and not merely as officers of the company.\nThis action has, therefore, been treated as a claim made by one partner against his co-partner; and I shall so deal with it. Although the defendant's notice of termination of partnership was given on the 11th of September, 1913, to take immediate effect, for convenience the date of breach has been treated as the 30th of November, 1913\u2014the actual date of the closing of the books of the partnership.\nWhile it does not formulate a definite basis for the assessment of the damages, the Court of Appeal appears to have proceeded on the principle laid down by the Court of Review and to have differed merely in its application to the facts in evidence. On the other hand, the difference in principle between the Court of Review and the learned trial judge is fundamental.\nA consid\u00e9rant in the judgment of the trial judge reads in part as follows:\u2014\nConsid\u00e9rant que le juge doit, quand il rend sa sentence, se rapporter \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat de chose existant, au moment de la demande, et placer les parties, dans la situation o\u00f9 elles se seraient trouv\u00e9es respectivement, s'il avait pu statuer imm\u00e9diatement, les plaideurs ne devant pas souffrir des lenteurs de la justice, qui ne leur sont pas imputables, et que de m\u00eame que des dommages r\u00e9clam\u00e9s par suite d'une rupture ill\u00e9gale de contrat, ne sauraient recevoir d'augmentation, par suite de circonstances subs\u00e9quentes, comme une l\u00e9gislation nouvelle, ou de r\u00e9centes d\u00e9couvertes de la science apportant de nouveaux moyens d'exploitation, de m\u00eame qu'ils ne sauraient recevoir de diminution, par suite de circonstances subs\u00e9quentes et d'une nature temporaire, comme le relachement des affaires ou une guerre soudaine, et que si la rupture du contrat que le d\u00e9fendeur a voulu dissoudre, malgr\u00e9 les protestations de son associ\u00e9, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi fructueuse qu'il se l'\u00e9tait imagin\u00e9, par suite d'\u00e9v\u00e8nements qu'il n'a pas su ou n'a pas pu pr\u00e9voir, il ne saurait en avoir le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice, et que le demandeur a droit aux dommages caus\u00e9s par le d\u00e9fendeur et existant, autant qu'il est possible de les constater, \u00e0 la date du 11 septembre 1913, jour de la rupture violente par le d\u00e9fendeur du contrat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nVery early in the course of the trial the learned judge said:\u2014\nWe have to decide the right of the parties at the date of the pleadings, so that what happens subsequently to that we have nothing to do with.\nHe accordingly assessed the plaintiff's damages on the assumption that but for the defendant's breach the partnership would have endured for nineteen months longer (the learned judge was somewhat in error in this computation of time), and that its profits during that period would have been proportionate to the $104,000 earned by it during the twelve months immediately preceding the breach; and on that footing he valued the plaintiff's loss of his share of the profits of the partnership business at $80,000. The following passages from the formal judgment of the Court of Review, on the other hand, indicate the basis on which it proceeded:\u2014\nConsid\u00e9rant que dans l'estimation des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats r\u00e9clam\u00e9s par le demandeur, la cour doit tenir compte du pass\u00e9 de la dite soci\u00e9t\u00e9, des profits qu'elle avait faits jusqu'\u00e0 la dissolution et des profits qu'elle devait rapporter aux associ\u00e9s, et cela en prenant en consid\u00e9ration non seulement les faits qui existaient lors de la dissolution, mais encore les faits survenus depuis la dite dissolution, qu'il \u00e9tait possible d'\u00e9tablir au moment o\u00f9 s'est faite l'enqu\u00eate;\nConsid\u00e9rant qu'il est \u00e9tabli par la preuve que depuis 1911 jusque vers le printemps de 1913, le commerce d'immeubles que faisait la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s prosp\u00e8re, mais que depuis cette \u00e9poque le commerce a subi une d\u00e9pression graduelle jusqu'\u00e0 la d\u00e9claration de guerre qui a eu lieu au commencement d'ao\u00fbt 1914;\n* * * * *\nConsid\u00e9rant que les tribunaux sont cens\u00e9s conna\u00edtre l'existence de l\u2019\u00e9tat de guerre et sa continuation;\nMr. Justice (now Chief Justice) Lamothe, in his opinion, thus states the view of the court:\u2014\nL'action a \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e en d\u00e9cembre 1913; et la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a pos\u00e9 en principe qu'elle ne devait pas prendre connaissance des faits post\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 cette date. Ce principe existe; il doit recevoir son application dans toutes les causes o\u00f9 la r\u00e9clamation est bas\u00e9e purement sur des faits arriv\u00e9s ayant fix\u00e9 d'une mani\u00e8re d\u00e9finite la responsabilit\u00e9 des parties. Mais dans les cas o\u00f9 la r\u00e9clamation est faite pour des dommages futurs, dommages bas\u00e9s sur des faits futurs et probables (savoir sur la continuation pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e d'une certaine s\u00e9rie de faits et de circonstances), la cour doit s'\u00e9clairer \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des faits survenus subs\u00e9quemment, et, alors, au lieu de simples probabilit\u00e9s, la cour a devant elle des faits certains.\nHe also points out certain misleading elements included in the statement of earnings for the twelve months' period before the breach relied on by the learned trial judge. The formal judgment discloses the method of calculation by which the court reached its assessment of $22,000. Of this I shall have something further to say when discussing the quantum of the damages.\nThe Court of King's Bench, without disapproving of the basis of assessment in the Court of Review, finds:\nQue le cour de premi\u00e8re instance lui a accord\u00e9 un montant trop \u00e9lev\u00e9 et que la cour de r\u00e9vision a accord\u00e9 un montant insuffisant; and after alluding to certain alleged oversights in the estimate made by the Court of Review continues:\u2014\nConsid\u00e9rant que le montant le plus probable et le plus \u00e9quitable, devrait \u00eatre un juste milieu entre le montant accord\u00e9 par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et celui allou\u00e9 par la cour de r\u00e9vision, ce qui ferait une somme d'\u00e0 peu-pr\u00e8s $50,000; mais que, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, il est certain, vu la preuve, que le demandeur appelant droit \u00e0 un chiffre minimum de $40,000;\nWhile claiming by his cross-appeal the restoration of the judgment of the trial court, counsel for the respondent in his factum appears partially to admit the soundness of the basis of assessment adopted by the Court of Review in this passage:\u2014\nIt is not pretended that the past profits must be taken as a fixed and settled basis for settling the amount of future profits, for naturally all business is subject alike to periods of prosperity and depression and revenue from business in hand must necessarily be considered as subject to the ordinary trade contingencies, but the earnings of the firm in the past, especially if such earnings cover a period of years, are a good criterion of probable earnings in the future and deserve most serious consideration.\nCiting the case of Wakeman v. Wheeler & Wilson Manufacturing Co.[4], he quotes these two sentences from the judgment:\u2014\nWhen the contract is repudiated the compensation of the party complaining of its repudiation should be the value of the contract. * * * His damages are what he lost by being deprived of his chance of profits.\nThe same principle is enunciated by the Judicial Committee in Wertheim v. Chicoutimi Pulp Co.[5]:\u2014\nThe general intention of the law in giving damages for breach of contract is that the plaintiff should be placed in the same position he would have been in if the contract had been performed.\nAn apt illustration of the application of these principles is afforded by the House of Lords in British Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Co. v. Underground Electric Railways Co. of London[6], the head note of which is as follows:\u2014 Held, that the pecuniary advantage which the railway company derived from the superiority of the substituted turbines (i.e., substituted for turbines supplied by the defendant which were deficient in value), was relevant matter for the consideration of the arbitrator in assessing damages.\nIn Mayne on Damages, 8th ed., at p. 141, the author says:\u2014\nWhere the action is to recover damages for some loss arising from the defendant's acts, evidence is admissible to shew that the injury is not so great as would at first appear.\nIn Arnold on Damages, at p. 23, after referring to the authorities, the learned author says:\u2014\nThe conclusion to be arrived at is that where a contract is broken the cause of action at once accrues. The plaintiff may immediately sue for damages, and the measure of damages must be assessed as being the loss or injury sustained at the date of the breach of contract. But for the purpose of estimating the present loss, probable future events must be considered, and if the bringing of the action be delayed, evidence as to actual subsequent consequential damage or subsequent relevant facts in mitigation of damage may be given.\nIn Batten v. Wedgwood Coal & Iron Co.[7] where a solicitor acting for a receiver failed to fulfil a duty to have money invested in consols he was held liable for loss of interest which would have been earned by the investment, but he was allowed to set off a gain to the client resulting from a fall in the price of consols between the date that the investment should have been made and the date of hearing. The receiver is only entitled to be recouped what he has actually lost.\nIn Laishley v. Goold Bicyle Co.[8], in allowing an appeal from Ferguson J., Garrow J.A., speaking for the Ontario Court of Appeal, thus discusses, at p. 324, the proper basis for the computation of damages analogous to those here claimed:\u2014\nThe breach is clear and admitted, and the only reason, apparently, for not permitting the ordinary consequences of adequate damages being adjudged to the plaintiff, is because such damages are, it is said, too vague and conjectural, which is the question to be determined on this appeal. Damages are very seldom capable of exact calculation, and yet I think many cases can be found in which damages have been awarded where the basis for a calculation was less certain than in this case. To begin with, there is the undisputed fact of the plaintiff's past earnings from commissions in 1898 and 1899; certainly some evidence of what he would probably have earned in 1900 and, indeed, in my opinion, strong evidence, unless affected by counter evidence on the part of the defendants to shew that these past earnings were abnormal, or that the business had depreciated or come to an end. But we have here not merely the past earnings but the fact that the bicycle business was continued under the new company after the plaintiff's dismissal, during the year 1900, but with, it is said, a diminished market. The manager for the new company puts this depreciation at about 40% of the previous year's demand; and another witness called by the defendants at about 50%. Giving credit to these witnesses, it appears to me that there is proper and even sufficient material for a reasonably correct calculation of the amount of the damages in question to which the plaintiff is entitled, having regard, of course, to what the situation and outlook were at the time of the breach in November, 1899.\nThe decision of this court in Cockburn v. Trusts & Guarantee Co[9], proceeds on the same view of the aw as does also our decision in Wood v. Grand Valley Railway Co.[10].\nI have cited the foregoing authorities decided upon English law because many of them are relied on by the parties and because there appears to be a dearth of French authority on the matter under consideration. The principles under which damages are awarded under the law of Quebec in a case such as this are to be found in the following passages from the Civil Code:\u2014\nArt. 1065.\u2014Every obligation renders the debtor liable in damages in case of a breach of it on his part * * * .\nArt. 1073.\u2014The damages due to the creditor are in general the amount of the loss which he has sustained and of the profit of which he has been deprived * * *\nArt. 1074.\u2014The debtor is liable for the damages which have been foreseen, or might have been foreseen, at the time of contracting the obligation, when his breach of it is not accompanied by fraud. Art. 1075.\u2014In the case even in which the inexecution of the obligation results from the fraud of the debtor, the damages comprise only that which is an immediate and direct consequence of its inexecution.\nBefore proceeding to consider the quantum of damages justified by an application of these principles to the facts in evidence, I shall say a word on the merits, merely to indicate how far they influence me in the assessment. The trial judge found that\nla soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 en existence entre les parties pendant environ trois ans et demi, avec un succ\u00e8s ph\u00e9nom\u00e9nal, a \u00e9t\u00e9 dissoute par le defendeur, ill\u00e9galement, sans raison ni cause, d'une fa\u00e7on brutale, in juste, d\u00e9loyale et malhonn\u00eate, que le d\u00e9fendeur, volontairement et d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment, a renvers\u00e9 le superbe \u00e9difice \u00e9lev\u00e9 par l'activit\u00e9, le z\u00e8le, l'industrie et l'habilit\u00e9 des associ\u00e9s, afin d'en faire sortir le demandeur, qui en \u00e9tait le propri\u00e9taire conjoint, et en devenir le seul ma\u00eetre et propri\u00e9taire, etc.\nThe Court of Review held\nque le demandeur a prouv\u00e9 l'all\u00e9gation essentielle de sa demande, \u00e0 savoir; que le d\u00e9fendeur a mis fin, sans cause l\u00e9gitime, au dit contrat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9, et que le d\u00e9fendeur n'a pas \u00e9tabli ses all\u00e9gations sur ce point.\nThe Court of Appeal expressed its view in these terms:\u2014\nConsid\u00e9rant que l'intim\u00e9 a mis fin au contrat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 existant entre lui et l'appelant et cela 21 mois avant l'expiration du terme convenu;\nConsid\u00e9rant que la conduite de l'intim\u00e9 sous ce rapport \u00e9tait arbitraire, in justifiable et inexplicable.\nConsid\u00e9rant qu'aucune raison n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 pour justifier sa conduite, lorsqu'il a pr\u00e9tendu mettre fin \u00e0 la dite soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nHaving declined to hear argument by his counsel on the question how far the defendant's conduct should be deemed morally reprehensible, we should not, in my opinion, treat him as deserving of censure more severe than that pronounced by the judgment of the Court of Review in which he acquiesced.\nBut however gross the violation of the plaintiff's right, however discreditable the defendant's motives, the damages cannot be other than\ncompensation for pecuniary loss naturally flowing from the breach. No punitive or vindictive consideration may enter into the assessment. Art. 1075 C.C. must be obeyed. In the case of fraudulent breach of contract actual damages sustained, though unforeseen at the date of the contract, must be made good. Where the breach is not accompanied by fraud damage which could not have been foreseen cannot be recovered. Whatever may have been the motive that induced the defendant to break the partnership contract, he took that step freely and deliberately and it must be ascribed to a determination to serve some purpose of his own. In the absence of proof of justification, such a breach should, I think, be regarded as falling within art. 1075 C.C. rather than within art. 1074.\nAssuming the conduct of the defendant to merit no more emphatic denunciation than that pronounced by the Court of Review, in regard to such elements of damage as cannot be measured with mathematical exactitude but must be determined on such probabilities as a jury is justified in proceeding upon, he is not entitled to expect that the amount of the plaintiff's compensation shall be weighed in golden scales or to have the sum allowed interfered with on appeal merely because of some trifling error in its computation. On the other hand, he would be entitled to complain of any palpable substantial excess in the award, even were his conduct properly characterized by the vigorous terms employed by the learned trial judge.\nUnder art. 1075 C.C. the plaintiff would have been entitled to any unforeseen damages which were an immediate and direct consequence of the breach although they would not have arisen but for the happening of some events which could not have been anticipated when the contract was entered into. I have no doubt whatever that events which happened after the breach and would have adversely affected the profits that the plaintiff would have made had the contract been carried out until the end of the five year term must likewise be taken into account in estimating the loss for which the plaintiff is entitled to compensation and in determining what actually was the value of the contract to him at the date of the breach.\nThe purpose of awarding damages being to compensate for a loss sustained by the plaintiff, it seems to me, with great respect for those who take the contrary view, to be repugnant to common sense that he should be permitted to recover for loss which facts within the cognizance of the court at the time of the trial shew he did not suffer merely because upon the facts as they stood at the date of the commission of the wrong which subjected the defendant to liability, or even at the time the action was begun, it seemed probable that such loss would be sustained.\nIf there had not been any clear error in the basis of computation in the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, although it increased the amount of the damages allowed by the Court of Review by $18,000, I should have been loath to disturb it on a mere question of quantum, in a case where it is so obviously impossible to ascertain with anything approaching exactitude the amount of the damage actually sustained. But unfortunately for the plaintiff that court, as appears from the opinion of Mr. Justice Pelletier, made the mistake of taking the $104,000 of earnings (which represented $67,000 of profits proper to be taken into account in the opinion of that learned judge) for the year ending the 3rd of November, 1913, the period immediately preceding the breach, as having been received during the year which followed the breach, i.e., the year ending on November 30th, 1914. Proceeding on this erroneous footing the learned appellate judge estimated that the net profits for the latter period, had the plaintiff Howard continued to act as a member of the partnership during it, would have been not the $67,000 actually earned by the defendant, as he understood, but $33 000 more, i.e., $100,000. It was by adding one-hal of this additional amount, $16,500, to the estimated earnings for the twelve months following the breach (November 30, 1913, to November 30, 1914) and a further sum of $9,000 ($750 per month), to cover what would have been Howard's probable share of the earnings for the last year of the partnership term (August, 1914, to August, 1915), for which the Court of Review had allowed nothing, to the $22,000 allowed by that court that Mr. Justice Pelletier reached a sum approximating $60,000 as the amount of the plaintiff's damages which, in order to be \"bien s\u00fbr de ne pas commettre d'erreur,\" he fixed at $40,000. The learned appellate judge apparently quite overlooked the fact that the allowance for profits in the $22,000 and $16,500 was based on figures carried down to the 30th of November, 1914, and that the $750 a month, if a proper addition, should, therefore, have been for nine months and not for twelve months. Of course a judgment based on such a manifest and fundamental error as that in regard to the year in which the $104,000 was earned cannot be sustained. There is nothing to shew that had it not been for this mistake the Court of King's Bench would have disturbed the assessment of the damages made by the Court of Review.\nBut it does not follow that the amount allowed as damages by the Court of King's Bench was clearly wrong or that the assessment of the Court of Review ought to be restored. The judgment of the latter court has been set aside and before we can restore it we must be satisfied that the respondent is not entitled to a larger sum than it awards. We are simply left without the assistance of the opinion either of the trial court or of the Court of King's Bench as to the quantum of the damages, the assessment of the former having been based on an erroneous conception of the law, and that of the latter on a mistaken view of the facts. Under these circumstances we must determine for ourselves, proceeding largely as a jury, what is a fair amount to compensate the plaintiff for the loss of the profits that he would have received had the partnership business been continued until the 22nd of August, 1915, as the contract of the parties contemplated.\nInasmuch as the judgment of the Court of Review is based on a correct appreciation of the law as to the measure of the damages recoverable and has not been appealed from by the defendant, it might at first blush seem to be not unreasonable to limit the inquiry to ascertaining by what sum, if any, the $22,000 which it awards should be increased. On the whole, however, I think this would not be a satisfactory mode of dealing with the case. The basis on which the Court of Review estimated the plaintiff's profits for the eight months from November 30th, 1913, to August 1st, 1914, at $17,800 seems to me, with respect, to be too fanciful. Moreover, there is a patent mistake in its calculation. Estimating the profits of the business from November 30th, 1913, to November 30th, 1914, at $25,663 (as hereinafter indicated), the court in making its calculation took one-half of this amount, $12,800, instead of $8,500 as the plaintiff's share of them for eight months. I, therefore, incline to think it will not be advisable to take as a starting point the $22,000 assessed by it as the plaintiff's damages.\nIn arriving at what would probably have been the profits for the year from November 30th, 1913, to November 30th, 1914, however, the Court of Review, very properly in my opinion, added to the $13,353 profits made by the defendant during that period, as shewn by his statement, several amounts which should not have been deducted from the gross earnings as against the plaintiff, thus bringing the profits actually earned by Findlay in that year for the purpose of its calculation up to $25,633. Having regard to the evidence of the witnesses DeCary, Beausoleil, Browne and Davis that the real estate market was, if anything, better between August, 1913, and August, 1914, than it had been during the preceding twelve months and giving due weight to the testimony of Messrs. Peloquin (50% decline in eight months before the war), Short (falling off began in the summer of 1913), Kirkpatrick, Casgrain, Ogilvy and Avard, in view of the enormous earning capacity of Findlay and Howard during the three years when both partners were co-operating, and especially to the profits of at least $67,000, or $33,500 for each partner, made during the twelve months ending November 30th, 1913, I think there should have been allowed for the diminution of earning capacity due to Howard's absence during the latter twelve months over and above the $4,800 salary paid by Findlay to Parker, who replaced him, an additional sum of about $12,000, making the total probable profits for the year from November 30th, 1913, to November 30th, 1914, had Howard continued in the business, $37,633 instead of the $25,633 estimated by the Court of Review. On that basis the plaintiff's share would have been $18,800.\nNo doubt the sales branch of the real estate business, formerly its most profitable part, amounted to little or nothing during the first year of the war. But, according to the evidence, collections continued to be good. I incline to think that had the partnership business of \"Findlay & Howard\" been conducted during that year, having regard to the volume of its outstanding business, and its very extended connections, by cutting down expenses and \"carrying on\" on a conservative basis some substantial profits might have been realized. Placing them at one-fifth of the earnings in the preceding period of one year (obviously the approximation of a juryman), the plaintiff's share for eight months would have been $2,500\u2014about $300 a month in lieu of the $750 a month which Mr. Justice Pelletier was disposed to allow.\nIf the goodwill of the business of \"Findlay & Howard\" should not be regarded as one of the partnership assets as to which the plaintiff expressly reserved his rights, I am unable to find any appreciable value in it having regard to the character of the business and the events which followed the improper breaking up of the partnership.\nI am not disposed to make any deduction on account of the plaintiff's receipts from assets taken over by him\u2014the effect of that has been already allowed for in the reduced profits\u2014or because of his failure to take steps to earn money in some other capacity than as a real estate agent.\nFully realizing that my estimate of the damages is quite as likely to be inaccurate as that of the Court of Review or of the Court of King's Bench, but discharging the functions of a juryman as best I can, I would, therefore, estimate the plaintiff's damages at $18,800 plus $2,500, or, say, $21,300 in all.\nIt follows that the judgment of the Court of Review for $22,000 should be restored. The appellant should have his costs here and in the Court of Appeal.\nBrodeur J.

Trusts & Guarantee Co.[13]; Halsbury, vol. 18, No. 522.\nMais cette cause ayant origin\u00e9 dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, elle doit \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e suivant les principes du droit en force dans cette province; et, par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 moins que les deux l\u00e9gislations ne soient semblables, je ne puis accepter les nombreuses autorit\u00e9s anglaises cit\u00e9es par l'appelant dans son factum.\nIl est de principe \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire en droit civil que les jugements ont un effet r\u00e9troactif et remontent, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, au jour de la demande et des plaidoiries.\nSi les parties veulent faire adjuger sur des faits post\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 leurs plaidoiries respectives, ils doivent se pourvoir en cons\u00e9quence. Ainsi le demandeur peut pendant l'instance former une demande incidente pour demander un droit \u00e9chu depuis l'assignation (art. 215 C.P.C.). Il en est de m\u00eame pour le d\u00e9fendeur qui peut faire une demande reconventionnelle pour une r\u00e9clamation de deniers qu'il peut avoir r\u00e9sultant d'autres causes (art. 217 C.P.C.). Si certains faits sont survenus depuis la contestation, le juge peut permettre de faire valoir, par voie de plaidoyer ou de r\u00e9ponse puis darrein continuance ces faits nouveaux (art. 199 C.P.C.). Schiller v. Daoust[14]; Duhaut v. Pacaud[15]; Rapport des codificateurs sur art. 199 C.P.C.\u2014La preuve doit ensuite se faire sur les faits mentionn\u00e9s dans la demande et la d\u00e9fense et dans les demandes, incidentes ou reconventionnelles ou d\u00e9fenses ou r\u00e9ponses puis darrein continuance. (Arts. 286, 334, 339 C.P.C.)\nLe jugement qui est ensuite rendu a un caract\u00e8re d\u00e9claratif et a pour objet de constater un droit pr\u00e9existant.\nIl r\u00e9sulte de l\u00e0, dit Dalloz, R\u00e9pertoire Pratique, No. 585, vo. Jugement,\nque les jugements ont un effet r\u00e9troactif et que le droit qu'ils constatent est cens\u00e9 avoir exist\u00e9 ab initio. C'est au jour de la demande qu'il faut se placer pour appr\u00e9cier la situation juridique des parties.\nNous voyons le m\u00eame principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans Garsonnet, par. 1161; Garsonnet & Bru, No. 737; et dans les d\u00e9cisions suivantes; Dalloz, 1868-1-397; Dalloz, 1901-1-621.\nIl r\u00e9sulte de cela que les droits des parties dans cette cause doivent \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9s de la date de l'institution de l'action et non pas suivant les faits et les circonstances qui sont post\u00e9rieurs. Ainsi la Cour de Revision a r\u00e9duit les dommages parce que le commerce d'agence d'immeubles, dans lequel les parties \u00e9taient engag\u00e9es, s'est trouv\u00e9 s\u00e9rieusement affect\u00e9 par la guerre.\nLa guerre a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e en ao\u00fbt 1914. L'action avait \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e en d\u00e9cembre 1913; et, suivant moi, les droits des parties doivent \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9s et les dommages doivent \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9s de cette derni\u00e8re date, c'est-\u00e0-dire du mois de d\u00e9cembre 1913. Si des \u00e9v\u00e9nements post\u00e9rieurs ont influ\u00e9 sur la prosp\u00e9rit\u00e9 ou l'insucc\u00e8s du commerce des parties, nous n'avons pas \u00e0 nous en pr\u00e9occuper. Le juge, en \u00e9valuant les dommages r\u00e9sultant de l'inex\u00e9cution d'une obligation, doit prendre en consid\u00e9ration les \u00e9v\u00e9nements pass\u00e9s et les perspectives de l'avenir. Par exemple, dans le cas actuel, il pouvait bien examiner les profits que les associ\u00e9s avaient faits dans le pass\u00e9, les tendances du commerce \u00e0 augmenter et \u00e0 diminuer, et les pr\u00e9visions ordinaires qui peuvent \u00eatre faites dans ces circonstances pour l'avenir. Mais il doit se placer \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de l'institution de l'action et voir quels \u00e9taient les dommages que les parties pouvaient s'attendre de payer et de recevoir \u00e0 raison de l'inex\u00e9cution de l'obligation. Pouvait-on alors pr\u00e9voir qu'une guerre mondiale \u00e9claterait d'ici \u00e0 quelques mois? Il n'y en avait aucun indice. Vouloir, maintenant que la guerre a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e, prendre en consid\u00e9ration l'effet de la guerre sur les op\u00e9rations commerciales des parties, c'est violer, suivant moi, un des principes \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires du droit civil.\nFindlay a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos, dans l'automne de 1913, de ne pas ex\u00e9cuter son obligation, qui \u00e9tait de maintenir ce contrat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 jusqu'au 22 ao\u00fbt 1915. Alors on doit le condamner aux dommages qui pouvaient \u00eatre pr\u00e9vus et d\u00e9termin\u00e9s quand il a poursuivi.\nDans le cas des expropriations o\u00f9 la loi d\u00e9termine une date \u00e0 laquelle la valeur d'une b\u00e2tisse expropri\u00e9e devrait \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e, si une guerre survient sub-s\u00e9quemment qui d\u00e9truit cette b\u00e2tisse, on doit alors d\u00e9terminer la valeur de cette b\u00e2tisse non pas au jour de la sentence arbitrale mais au jour fix\u00e9 par le statut. McCarthy v. City of Regina[16]; Crisp on Compensation, p. 70.\nLa Gazette des Tribunaux rapporte une d\u00e9cision de la Cour de Paris qui est \u00e0 l'effet qu'il faut se placer pour calculer l'\u00e9tendue du pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 une \u00e9poque voisine du terme fix\u00e9 pour l'ex\u00e9cution du march\u00e9. Il s'agissait dans cette cause de marchandises dont le prix avait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 par la guerre. (1917-2-119.)\nJ'en suis donc venu \u00e0 la conclusion que la Cour de Revision a fait erreur en prenant en consid\u00e9ration l'effet de la guerre sur le commerce des parties.\nMaintenant quels sont les dommages auxquels le demandeur Howard a droit?\nPar les articles 1073 et suivants du Code Civil, les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats sont le montant de la perte qu'il a faite et du gain dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9; et si le d\u00e9biteur n'est pas coupable de dol, il n'est tenu que des dommages qu'on a pr\u00e9vus au moment du contrat; et, dans tous les cas, les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats n\u00e9 comprennent que ce qui est une suite imm\u00e9diate et directe de cette inex\u00e9cution.\nFindlay avait un contrat de soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui le liait pour cinq ans. Apr\u00e8s un peu plus de trois ans il met fin \u00e0 ce contrat; et, au lieu de poursuivre pour le faire r\u00e9silier s'il avait des raisons valables, il se fait justice \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame en formant une nouvelle compagnie et en transportant ou faisant transporter \u00e0 cette nouvelle compagnie toutes les affaires de l'ancienne compagnie Findlay & Howard.\nCette conduite de la part de Findlay le constitue de mauvaise foi; et alors on doit lui appliquer les r\u00e8gles \u00e9dict\u00e9es par l'article 1075 C.C. qui punit le d\u00e9biteur qui se rend coupable de dol. Le dol dont parle cet article ne consiste pas dans ces man\u0153uvres frauduleuses qui ont pour but d'amener quelqu'un \u00e0 contracter et dont il est question dans l'article 993 C.C., mais c'est le fait par lequel le d\u00e9biteur frustre le cr\u00e9ancier de ses droits. Baudry-Lacantinerie, vol. 11, no. 483. Boileux sous art. 1151 C.N. Les profits avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 dans l'ann\u00e9e de la dissolution de $104,000. Dans ce chiffre, se trouve le guide le plus s\u00fbr que les tribunaux doivent suivre pour d\u00e9terminer la perte que Howard a subie par la dissolution de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. On a pr\u00e9tendu que dans l'automne de 1913, c'est-\u00e0-dire lors de la dissolution, le commerce d'immeubles avait une tendance vers la baisse. Sur ce point la preuve est contradictoire. Je vois, entre autres t\u00e9moins, M. D\u00e9cary qui jouit d'une tr\u00e8s grande r\u00e9putation, qui affirme le contraire. Mais si on prend les profits faits par les associ\u00e9s les ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes et ceux faits en 1913, il est \u00e9vident que le commerce d'immeubles subissait une d\u00e9pression. Et alors nous devons prendre ce fait en consid\u00e9ration.\nIl convient de mentionner que de cette somme de $104,000 on doit d\u00e9duire certains profits que Howard devra recevoir sur la part de l'actif qui lui est \u00e9chu par le partage. Ces profits ont \u00e9t\u00e9 estim\u00e9s par le Cour de Revision \u00e0 environ $37,000.\nEn d\u00e9duisant ces $37,000 des $104,000, nous arrivons \u00e0 une somme de $67,000 pour l'ann\u00e9e, ou $5,500 par mois. Du 30 novembre 1913, date \u00e0 laquelle cet \u00e9tat a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9, jusqu'au 22 ao\u00fbt 1915, date o\u00f9 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 se terminait, il y avait encore plus de vingt mois. En multipliant la somme de $5,500 par 20 j'arrive \u00e0 un profit probable, que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 aurait fait, de la somme de $110,000, soit pour Howard une somme de $55,000. On devait pr\u00e9sumer, comme je l'ai dit plus haut, que les profits seraient un peu moindres que cela \u00e0 cause de la tendance du march\u00e9 vers la baisse. Je crois donc qu'en accordant $40,000, c'est-\u00e0-dire la m\u00eame somme que celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e par la Cour d'Appel, nous rendrions pleine et enti\u00e8re justice aux parties.\nJe serais donc d'opinion de renvoyer l'appel et le contre-appel avec d\u00e9pens. Mignault J.\u2014This case raises some important questions on which notable differences of opinion have existed between the different courts that have dealt with it, although in each court the judgment was unanimous. There is before this court an appeal and a cross-appeal shewing that neither party is satisfied with the judgment rendered by the Court of King's Bench. The main respondent and cross-appellant, Howard, would, however, accept the latter judgment if he cannot get the judgment of the Superior Court restored. On the other hand, the main appellant and cross-respondent, Findlay, is now satisfied to abide by the judgment of the Court of Review, which, moreover, is conclusive against him inasmuch as Howard alone appealed from it. The only question at issue under these circumstances is the amount of damages, the liability of Findlay to pay to Howard at least $22,000, the amount granted by the Court of Review, being conclusively established.\nFindlay and Howard had entered into a partnership to carry on a real estate business in Montreal for a term of five years from the 22nd August, 1910, which business they conducted by means of a joint stock company, \"Findlay & Howard, Limited.\" Their profits were phenomenal, especially at first, owing to the real estate boom then prevailing in Montreal and vicinity. The partnership had nearly two years to run when, on the 11th September, 1913, Findlay put an end to it without cause or reason. Howard now claims damages and these must run from a minimum of $22,000, allowed by the Court of Review, to a maxiumum of $80,000 granted by the Superior Court. The Court of King's Bench awarded $40,000.\nThere is, however, an important question of law on which the Superior Court and the Court of Review took opposite sides, but which was not expressly passed upon by the Court of King's Bench. Is the court, in assessing damages for Findlay's wrongful termination of this partnership, entitled to consider facts subsequent to the action and shewing what profits the partnership would have earned had there been no dissolution? Or must it ignore all such facts, the most important of which is the European war which paralyzed the real estate business in Montreal, and assess these damages on the basis of conditions as they existed on the 11th September, 1913, date of the breach of contract? The Superior Court adopted the second alternative, the Court of Review the first.\nThe learned trial judge lays down the rule that damages being, in general, according to art. 1073 C.C.,\nle montant de la perte faite par le cr\u00e9ancier et du gain dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9,\nthe court must, in rendering its decision, go back to the conditions existing at the date of the action, and place the parties in the situation in which they would have been had the judgment been rendered immediately, and that the damages for breach of contract can neither be increased by reason of subsequent circumstances, such as new legislation or recent discoveries of science, nor diminished on account of subsequent facts of a temporary nature, such as a slackening of business or a sudden war.\nI would not feel disposed to quarrel with this rule rightly applied to a proper case. But, as I construe Howard's action, he is claiming, not the value of his share in the partnership as it stood at the date of the breach, for he expressly reserves his right to recover his share and proportion of the assets of Findlay & Howard, Limited, but the value of his share of the profits the partnership would have realized had not Findlay's wrongful act brought it to an end. That is to say, Howard demands really future damages, and I cannot follow the learned trial judge when he estimates the value of the future profits of the partnership by considering only its past profits, as if they were sure to continue, and closes his eyes to events which had happened since the action, but before the trial, and which shewed that these future profits would in no wise have been comparable to those made before the date of the breach. Where future damages are claimed, future conditions must necessarily be considered, and what better evidence of conditions, which were in the future at the date of the breach, can be made than by shewing, at the date of the trial, what has actually occurred since the breach of contract?\nI, therefore, think that in his estimation of the damages granted to Howard, the learned trial judge has adopted an erroneous principle, and consequently his judgment cannot be restored.\nThe Court of Review, on the contrary, lays down a rule which I fully accept as applied to this case, and which I quote:\u2014\nConsid\u00e9rant que dans l'estimation des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats r\u00e9clam\u00e9s par le demandeur, la cour doit tenir compte du pass\u00e9 de la dite soci\u00e9t\u00e9, des profits qu'elle avait faits jusqu'\u00e0 la dissolution et des profits qu'elle devait rapporter aux associ\u00e9s, et cela en prenant en consid\u00e9ration non seulement les faits qui existaient lors de la dissolution, mais encore les faits survenus depuis la dite dissolution, qu'il \u00e9tait possible d'\u00e9tablir au moment o\u00f9 s'est faite l'enqu\u00eate.\nThe judgment of the Court of King's Bench, I have said, does not expressly pass upon the question to which I have just referred, but holding that both the Superior Court and the Court of Review were in error, the former in granting too much, the latter in allowing too little, it comes to the conclusion that\nle montant le plus probable et le plus \u00e9quitable devrait \u00eatre un juste milieu entre le montant accord\u00e9 par la cour sup\u00e9rieure et celui allou\u00e9 par la cour de revision, ce qui ferait une somme d'\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s $50,000, mais que, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, il est certain, vu la preuve, que le demandeur appelant a droit \u00e0 un chiffre minimum de $40,000. If I may say so, with deference, this selection of a juste milieu between the amounts allowed by the Superior Court and the Court of Review, is rather a too rough and ready way of determining the amount which Howard ought to receive, and I cannot feel that I should adopt it. Moreover, Mr. Justice Pelletier, who alone gave reasons for judgment, seems to take it that the partnership realized $104,000 for the year which followed the breach, whereas these profits were for the year which preceded the breach and had only a couple of months to run when Findlay broke the partnership.\nI would, therefore, apply the rule adopted by the Court of Review, and consider the profits made by the partnership during the past up to the date of the breach, and those which it would have made had it continued for its full term, estimating the latter in the light of the circumstances disclosed by the evidence as having happened up to the date of the trial, some of which, like the gradual decline of the real estate boom in Montreal, could have been foreseen in September, 1913, and others, like the European war, were of such a nature that no man not versed in the secrets of diplomacy and of continental politics could have ventured to predict them.\nIn my view, the question of good or bad faith or of fraud, or what the French text of the Civil Code calls \"dol\" in articles 1073, 1074 and 1075 C.C., has little application here, for I am willing to grant that Findlay acted in bad faith in breaking his contract, and he is liable for all damages foreseen or not which Howard suffered through the breach, provided that they directly resulted therefrom. If he is liable for the unforeseen but direct consequences of his breach of contract, he should at least, in an action claiming future damages, have the benefit of unforeseen circumstances, ascertained at the trial, shewing that these future damages were not incurred, or were incurred in a less degree that seemed probable at the date of the breach. This, moreover, is not a case where I would deem myself justified in granting punitive damages, although the conduct of Findlay was very reprehensible, or anything more than real damages, for Howard, who, I repeat, claims damages for the loss of future profits, should not be placed in a better position by reason of the breach of his contract than he would have found himself had the breach not occurred.\nTaking now the past profits of the partnership, they are as follows:\u2014\nFor the first 18 months\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026... $203,318.53\nFor the year ending on the 30th November, 1912\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 161,216.83\nFor the year ending on the 30th November, 1913\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 104,121.05\nand from the latter sum certain amounts mentioned by the Court of Review should be deducted.\nThe evidence shews that the boom was at its height up to the close of 1912, that it then began to decline, and that the bubble\u2014because, like so many other land booms, it was only a bubble\u2014was rapidly nearing the bursting point when the war suddenly broke out to the astonishment of the whole world. The war killed it, and thenceforth, the witnesses say, the real estate business was dead.\nThe decline of the boom is shewn by the figures I have given as it affected Findlay & Howard, Limited. After the breach, Findlay continued the same business in the same premises, with the same subsidiary companies or syndicates formed by the parties, with also the same employees, with the exception of Edward C. Parker whom he engaged to replace Howard, while the latter did not go in the real estate business fearing, he states, had he competed with Findlay, that he might endanger his security for his claim for damages against Findlay, and yet Findlay's profits, for the year ending on the 30th November, 1914, are shewn by his balance sheet to have been only $13,353.86.\nBut the Court of Review refused to take the latter figure as being a fair statement of the profits made by Findlay in the year ending on the 30th November, 1914.

Its figures would shew that, the business having been at a standstill since the 1st of August, 1914, on account of the war, Howard would have received, for the year 1914, one-half of $25,633.86, or $12,816.93, and not its average of $17,500, which would decrease the damages it allowed by nearly $5,000. I fail to see the reason for averaging two years during which the land boom gradually and very rapidly declined, but Findlay is bound by the judgment of the Court of Review, and the amount this judgment granted to Howard cannot be decreased.\nI have said that the judgment of the Superior Court cannot be restored, so the choice is between the judgment of the Court of Review and that of the Court of King's Bench.\nI cannot, with deference, agree with the latter court when it endeavours to arrive at a juste milieu between the judgment of the Superior Court, which proceeded on an entirely wrong principle, and that of the Court of Review whose governing rule as to these future damages I fully accept. And I fail upon due consideration to find any satisfactory reason for the figure of $40,000, allowed by the Court of King's Bench, which it merely says the evidence fully justifies. Had it referred more in detail to this evidence, which after all, is the evidence furnished by the balance sheets, I would have felt more hesitation in rejecting its estimate of Howard's loss, but, with all respect, I must say that Mr. Justice Pelletier seems to me to have been in obvious error when he stated that the Court of Review adopted as its basis $104,000 for the year following the breach of contract, and made thereto certain additions and therefrom certain subtractions, which reduced this figure of $104,000 to $67,000. Then the learned judge adopts $67,000 as the basis of his own calculation of Howard's loss of profits. The error here is that the Court of Review, with reference to the $104,000, reduced to $67,000, was dealing with the year preceding the breach for which Howard received his share of profits, and not with the year following it, and that Mr. Justice Pelletier used the figure of $67,000 as the foundation for his calculation of the profits which would have accrued during the year following the breach.\nThe judgment of the Court of King's Bench also criticises the judgment of the Court of Review because the latter judgment allowed nothing for the goodwill of the partnership. This is a matter of some difficulty, because by the supplementary agreement of the parties, dated the 9th January, 1913, the goodwill of \"Findlay & Howard, Limited,\" was valued at $12,500 in the case of one of the partners dying during the partnership, and the survivor purchasing the concern. But the goodwill of \"Findlay & Howard\" formed a part of its assets and Howard's right to claim his share of these assets was reserved by him, so I cannot look upon it as properly included in his action. It is true that Howard alleges that he has been deprived of all his right and interest in the future profits and goodwill of the partnership, which goodwill, he says, has been utterly destroyed by Findlay's wrongful acts. I am not satisfied, however, that after the beginning of the war this goodwill had any value. Moreover, the goodwill mainly consists in the name and Findlay did not use the name of \"Findlay & Howard, Limited,\" and he agreed to give Howard the first offer of the leases of the business premises. Under these circumstances I do not feel justified in adding anything to the amount allowed by the Court of Review.\nMy opinion in this very difficult case is, therefore, that the appeal of Findlay should be allowed and the cross-appeal of Howard dismissed, with costs in favour of Findlay here and in the Court of King's Bench, and that the judgment of the Court of Review should be restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs; Cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Cook, Duff, Magee & Merrill.\n[1] 27 Que.

Sask., 1909, c. 80, s. 2\u2014\"The Saskatchewan Insurance Act,\" Sask. S., 1915, c. 15 s. 86.\nInsurance policies against fire were issued by the companies respondent on buildings owned by the appellant Shepard with loss, if any, payable to the appellant bank, assignee of a mortgage on the property. The buildings were subsequently destroyed by a fire occurring on the 1st or 2nd April, 1915, of which the agent of the bank informed the companies respondent. In the course of their investigation they suspected some incendiary origin and declined payment for a considerable period. The proofs of loss were furnished on the 29th February, 1916. The statutory condition No. 13 required that the assured should \"forthwith\" give notice in writing to the companies, and, \"as soon afterwards as practicable,\" deliver a detailed account of the loss accompanied by a statutory declaration as to the truth of his statements. According to another condition, no action could be brought after the expiration of one year from the date of the loss. The statutory condition No. 17 also provided that \"the loss shall not be payable until thirty days\" in the case of one policy and sixty days in the case of the other policy \"after completion of the proofs of loss.\" The present actions were commenced on the 22nd March, 1916, before the lapse of the required period, in order that they might be instituted within one year from the date of the fire.\nHeld, that this court should not interfere with the discretion exercised by the trial judge in deciding that the non-performance of condition No. 13 had been due to mistake and that relief should be granted to the assured under sec. 2 of \"The Fire Insurance Policy Act.\"\nPer Idington J.\u2014As the notice was not given \"forthwith after loss\" and the proofs were not delivered as soon afterwards \"as practicable,\" they cannot be regarded as made in compliance with the terms of the policy and, therefore, cannot be used to fix the time when the actions should be brought.\nPer Anglin and Cassels JJ.\u2014The proofs of loss became of value and were \"completed\" only when the trial court exercised its statutory power to give relief; and the effect of granting it was to put the assured in the same position for all purposes as if the proofs had been furnished as required by the statutory condition No. 13. Accordingly, the respective periods, prescribed by statutory condition No. 17, should be deemed to have elapsed and the loss under each of the policies to have been payable before the action upon it was begun.\nPer Mignault J. (dissenting).\u2014Sec. 2 of \"The Fire Insurance Policy Act\" did not give power to the courts to relieve against the requirements of statutory condition No. 17.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (11 Sask. L.R. 259; 42 D.L.R. 746), reversed, Davies C.J. and Mignault J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], reversing the judgment of the trial court, Newlands J.[2], and dismissing the plaintiff's actions with costs. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported\nJ. A. Allan K.C. for the appellant.\nTravers Sweatman for the respondent. The Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014Concurring as I do with the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan and with the reasons for that judgment stated by Mr. Justice Elwood J.A., concurred in by Chief Justice Haultain, I would dismiss these appeals with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014These cases were argued together. The actions were brought to recover insurance moneys respectively due on policies assuring against fire and issued by the respondents respectively in September and October, 1912, to the appellant Shepard, providing in each case for the loss, if any, being payable to the appellant bank.\nThe only questions raised must turn upon the power of the court before which the actions were tried when applied to the relevant facts in evidence, under and pursuant to sec. 2 of \"The Fire Insurance Policy Act\" of Saskatchewan (R.S. Sask. ch. 80), which reads as follows:\u2014\nWhere by reason of necessity, accident or mistake, the conditions of any contract of fire insurance on property in Saskatchewan as to the proof to be given to the insurance company after the occurrence of a fire have not been strictly complied with or were, after a statement or proof of loss has been given in good faith by, or on behalf of, the assured in pursuance of any proviso or condition of such contract the company, through its agents or otherwise, objects to the loss upon other grounds than for imperfect compliance with such conditions, or does not, within a reasonable time after receiving such statement or proof notify the assured in writing that such statement or proof is objected to and what are the particulars in which the same is alleged to be defective and so from time to time or where for any other reason the court or judge before whom a question relating to such insurance is tried or inquired into considers it inequitable that the insurance should be deemed void or forfeited by reason of imperfect compliance with such conditions, no objection to the sufficiency of such statement or proof or amended supplemental statement or proof as the case may be shall in any such cases be allowed as a discharge of the liability of the company on such contract of insurance wherever entered into; but this section shall not apply where the fire has taken place before the first day of January, 1904. The fire in question destroyed, on the first or second of April, 1915, the entire properties insured. The agent of said bank, on or about the fifth of said April, informed the local firm of insurance agents of the said insurance companies, of the said loss, and asked them if there was anything further to be done by him in regard thereto, and was told not.\nThe insurance agents at once communicated by wire and letter with their respective principals (now respondents herein) informing them of the loss.\nThat resulted in the said companies intrusting jointly the investigation and adjustment of the loss to Patterson & Waugh, a firm of professional adjusters in Winnipeg, with local agents in Saskatchewan and Alberta.\nThat firm and the companies turned the matter of investigation and adjustment over to one O'Fallen, a local agent of said firm at Saskatoon, who went on or about the 8th of April to Margo, where the fire occurred and Shepard lived, and spent a day there engaged in the necessary work of investigation.\nOn that occasion Shepard met him and answered all his inquiries and gave him all the information he could.\nIn the course of doing so there were some things said by Shepard which led to a suspicion of some incendiary origin being the cause of the fire. This led in turn to the matter of the origin of the fire being reported to the Superintendent of Insurance for the Province of Saskatchewan, who took some part in making inquiries. Another officer, called a fire commissioner, also took part.\nO'Fallen, on his visit to Shepard and the scene of the fire at Margo, took from him, in order that such investigation as his firm might desire might ''be as full and complete as possible\" a document agreeing that everything done or demand made theretofore or thereafter should not be claimed as a waiver on the part of the insurance companies of any of the terms or conditions of their policies.\nThis only, to my mind, concerns us now as an indication of the thorough nature of the investigation to be made and which, if so made, would reduce the need for the usual formal notice of loss and proof thereof to something utterly superfluous.\nYet it is alleged by respondents that because of the assured's non-compliance with the literal terms of the condition requiring same, his right and those of his co-appellant have been destroyed.\nHence the questions raised as to the power of the court to give the relief provided by the section above quoted. To estimate properly the weight to be attached to this condition under the foregoing circumstances and many others which appear in evidence, let us consider it as gravely as we can.\nCondition No. 12 says:\u2014\nProof of loss must be made by the assured, although the loss be payable to a third party.\nCondition No. 13, so far as involved herein, is as follows:\u2014\n13. Any person entitled to make a claim under this policy is to observe the following directions:\u2014\n(a) He is, forthwith, after loss, to give notice in writing to the company.\n(b) He is to deliver, as soon afterwards as practicable, as particular an account of the loss as the nature of the case permits.\n(c) He is also to furnish therewith a statutory declaration, declaring:\u2014\n1. That the said account is just and true.\n2. When and how the fire originated, so far as the declarant knows or believes;\n3. That the fire was not caused by his wilful act or neglect, procurement, means or contrivance;\n4. The amount of other insurance;\n5. All liens and incumbrances on the subject of insurance. 6. The place where the property insured, if movable, was deposited at the time of the fire.\nUnless for approximately fixing a date and fact, or as a trap, the importance of the notice being in writing is not of any great value, when assuredly there was not only from the bank but from Shepard also oral notice. And the document O'Fallen got him to sign contained all the notice required by the said requirement in subsection (a) of the condition need contain.\nIndeed I submit that in face of such document the plea of want of notice (a) seems unfounded if not improper.\nAs to the requirement in (b), there is not the slightest pretence that the oral statement given by Shepard was incorrect or wanting in particularity and doubtless was noted in writing by O'Fallen.\nSuch pleas under such circumstances formerly were so common that legislation was found necessary to deal with them.\nThe requirement by sub-section (c) of a statutory declaration is a more reasonable requirement and its absence under some circumstances might become a very important omission.\nIts absence in this particular case is reduced in importance almost to nothing; for the respondents were by means of legal assistance placed by law at their disposal enabled to make their investigation thorough, indeed, much more thorough than any declarations such as required by above conditions.\nNot a word is adduced in evidence to indicate that the oral account given as stated failed to supply what items Nos. 1, 2 and 3 require, or were untrue.\nThe evidence does not shew that there was no other insurance and the information was given by the appellant bank as to that and other liens and encumbrances on the subject of the insurance in answer to inquiries of respondents' agents.\nMore than that, the respondents on the trial produced through their cross-examination of appellants' witnesses, very much illuminating correspondence which, taken with that adduced by the appellants, leaves a rather unpleasant impression as to the conduct of respondents or their representatives in relation to the very probable reason for appellant's non-compliance with the condition I am dealing with.\nI do not intend to elaborate or write at length upon all that which a perusal of the entire evidence suggests.\nIt is clear, however, that in fact the bank was the party most deeply interested in the loss and the party most urgent and insistent upon the inquiry coming to a decision or close and evidently was lulled into acquiescence of delay by such representation as reported in the letter from its manager at Saskatoon, to him managing at the agency in Edmonton as follows:\u2014\nThey ask for a full settlement of the bank's claim, but it will not be necessary to make the customary affidavit.\nThe appellant Shepard had enlisted, in July following the fire, to go to the front. Supposing he had reached there shortly after so enlisting, then been killed or taken prisoner, and the respondents' construction of the law being upheld that the bank could not make proof, could any court be got to hold that it could not give relief under said section? I hope not.\nYet wherein does this contention set up differ? It is idle to answer this as counsel did that his agent could make it. No agent in all likelihood ever would have been left to look after what in fact had got to be looked on as the bank's own business.\nIt is clear to my mind that under the circumstances in evidence in this case the failure to put in the necessary proof in conformity with the condition was one of those mistakes from the consequences whereof, whatever they may be, the statute enabled relief to be given.\nAnd as to the pretension that the giving such proofs in February changes the issue to one of not bringing either action within given delays, I agree with Mr. Justice Newlands' view that as the giving such proofs at that time availed nothing, it must be treated as if non-existent.\nI am of the opinion that the power given by the statute covers a defective proof of any kind even if oral or written, and that there is no room for the contention of the respondents' counsel herein and I need not perhaps examine the statute microscopically.\nI may observe that, in looking at the authorities cited in respondents' factum, I find Anderson v. Saugeen Mutual Fire Ins. Co. of Mount Forest[3], contains, to my mind, a decision by the late Chancellor followed by an able judgment of the late Mr. Justice Ferguson, which, in principle, maintains when analyzed the conclusion I have reached so far as the bank is concerned, only by another road.\nThere the condition No. 12 was held as it reads that the assured, being the mortgagor, must make the proof; and hence the usual clause giving the mortgagee entitled to the insurance the right to recover, though the mortgagor had lost his remedy, by reason of sixty days not elapsing from the time when prescribed before expiration of the year.\nThere the learned judges acted upon the said clause. Here, though the clause does not exist, the learned trial judge was right in acting by virtue of the statute in an analogous situation. If the Glens Falls Company respondent instead of denying everything and pleading as it did, had admitted fully the validity of the declaration in February, 1916, as a fulfilment of the conditions 12 and 13, it might have presented an arguable objection based on the condition respecting limit of time to bring an action. That limit means from a valid delivery of proof, which in the case in question never took place and had to be substituted by the relief which the learned trial judge gave.\nIn view of the failure to present a tittle of evidence relative to the charge of arson set up in the pleading, it is to be hoped the law, as claimed to be expressed in the Juridini v. National British and Irish Millers Ins. Co.[4], is, as argued, applicable to such a case, but I have not had time to form an opinion founded thereon which, in my view herein, is unnecessary.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored. But there should be no costs allowed for printing an appeal case that so grossly offends the rules of this court as it does.\nAnglin J.\u2014The facts of these cases sufficiently appear in the judgments of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[5].\nBy sec. 2 of \"The Fire Insurance Policy Act\" (R.S. Sask. ch. 80), the court is under certain circumstances enabled to decline to give effect to a defence based on an \"objection to the sufficiency of (the) statement of proof\" of loss required by statutory condition No. 13. In the present case proofs of loss were furnished on the 29th of February, 1916, the loss having occurred on the night of the 1st-2nd of April, 1915. The only defence which, in my opinion, need be seriously considered on this appeal is based on the 17th statutory condition providing that \"the loss shall not be payable until 60 (in the case of the Glens Falls policy, 30) days after completion of the proofs of loss * * *\"\nThese actions were begun on the 22nd of March, 1916. Under statutory condition No. 22, the last day for commencing them would have been the first or the second of April, 1916.\nThe learned trial judge[6] took the view that upon the facts in evidence the insured was entitled to be excused from strict compliance with condition 13 under the powers conferred by sec. 2 of the statute, and granted relief accordingly. The sufficiency of the case made to justify this course was not questioned by the Court of Appeal. The existence of the power itself is undoubted (Bell v. Hudson Bay Ins. Co.[7]; Prairie City Oil Co. v. Standard Mutual Fire Ins. Co.[8]), and after carefully considering all the facts in evidence I am satisfied that the discretion exercised by the trial judge should not be interfered with.\nBut the majority of the appellate judges (Haultain C.J. and Elwood J.), in this reversing the learned trial judge, held that the power conferred by section 2 does not extend to relieving the insured from a disability created by the 17th statutory condition; and when the case is one of disability arising solely out of that condition I entirely concur in their view.\nWith great respect, however, I am of the opinion that there has been a misconception of the true nature of the defences in these actions based on condition No. 17. They are that the actions were prematurely brought because the period after the completion of proofs of loss which, under that condition, must elapse before action, had not in either case expired. Otherwise stated, the pleas are that the proofs of loss had been completed too late to permit of the actions being begun when they were. They, therefore, rest upon an \"objection to the sufficiency of the statement of proof.\" The assumption of these pleas is that the proofs were completed when delivered to the companies on or about the 29th February. In the case of the British Dominions' policy, if the view taken by the Appellate Court is correct, the necessary result would be a forfeiture of the policy by reason of imperfect compliance with condition 13, since action could not have been brought more than 60 days after the 29th of February and yet within one year from the date of the loss as required by condition No. 22. In the case of the Glens Falls policy, however, if the delivery of the proofs on the 29th of February was a good delivery in compliance with that condition, action might have been brought on it after the lapse of the 30 days prescribed by condition 17 and yet before the expiry of the limitation of one year imposed by condition 22.\nBut the delivery of proofs on the 29th of February was not a compliance with the requirement of the 13th statutory condition prescribing that proofs of loss shall be made \"as soon as practicable,\" and the companies declined to accept these proofs as sufficient for that reason. That is one of the defences in each of the records in these actions. The proofs of loss became of value and were \"completed\" only when the court exercised its statutory power to relieve against the failure to comply strictly with the 13th condition. That necessarily took place after the actions were brought. The effect of granting relief under sec. 2 of the \"Insurance Act\" was, in my opinion, to put the insured in the same position for all purposes as if proofs of loss had been furnished, as was required by the 13th statutory condition, \"as soon as practicable afterwards,\" i.e., after the giving of the notice in writing directed to be given \"forthwith after loss,\" with the result that, treating the proofs as having been completed, nunc pro tunc, \"as soon as practicable\" after the loss, the respective periods prescribed by the 17th condition should be deemed to have elapsed and the loss under each of the policies to have been payable before the action upon it was begun. To hold otherwise would be to enable defendants to take advantage of their own wrong-doing since it was their misleading conduct that produced the situation which rendered it inequitable that they should be allowed to insist on anything resulting from the plaintiffs' non-compliance with the 13th statutory condition as a defence.\nMignault. J. (dissenting):\u2014The same questions arise in both these cases, the point mainly argued being whether the actions of the appellants could be maintained in view of conditions 13 and 17 of the insurance policies, being statutory conditions of the Province of Saskatchewan.\nThese conditions read as follows:\u2014\n13. Any person entitled to make a claim under this policy is to observe the following directions:\u2014\n(a) He is, forthwith after loss, to give notice in writing to the company.\n(b) He is to deliver, as soon afterwards as practicable as particular an account of the loss as the nature of the case permits.\n(c) He is also to furnish therewith a statutory declaration declaring:\u2014\n1. That the said account is just and true.\n2. When and how the fire originated, so far as the declarant knows or believes; 3. That the fire was not caused through his wilful act or neglect, procurement, means or contrivance;\n4. The amount of other insurance;\n5. All liens and incumbrances on the subject of insurance.\n6. The place where the property insured, if movable, was deposited at the time of the fire.\n(d) He is, in support of his claim, if required and if practicable, to procure books of account, and furnish invoices and other vouchers, to furnish copies of the written portion of all policies, and to exhibit for examination all the remains of the property which was covered by the policy.\n(e) He is to produce, if required, a certificate under the hand of a justice of the peace, notary public, or commissioner for oaths, residing in the vicinity in which the fire happened, and not concerned in the loss, or related to the assured or sufferers, stating that he has examined the circumstances attending the fire, loss or damage alleged, that he is acquainted with the character and circumstances of the assured or claimant and that he verily believes that the assured has by misfortune and without fraud or evil practice sustained loss and damage on the subject assured to the amount certified.\n17. The loss shall not be payable until sixty days (in the case of Glens Falls Co., this delay is 30 days, in that of the British Dominions Co. it is, as above indicated, sixty days) after the completion of the proof of loss, unless otherwise provided for by the contract of insurance.\nSection 2 of \"The Fire Insurance Policy Act,\" ch. 80, Revised Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1909, which has since been re-enacted as sec. 86 of \"The Saskatchewan Insurance Act, 1915,\" is in the following terms:\u2014\n2. Where by reason of necessity, accident or mistake, the conditions of any contract of fire insurance on property in Saskatchewan as to the proof to be given to the insurance company after the occurrence of a fire have not been strictly complied with or where after a statement or proof of loss has been given in good faith by or on behalf of the assured in pursuance of any proviso or condition of such contract the company through its agents or otherwise objects to the loss upon other grounds than for imperfect compliance with such conditions or does not within a reasonable time after receiving such statement or proof notify the assured in writing that such statement or proof is objected to and what are the particulars in which the same is alleged to be defective and so from time to time or where for any other reason the court or judge before whom a question relating to such insurance is tried or inquired into considers it inequitable that the insurance should be deemed void or forfeited by reason of imperfect compliance with such conditions no objection to the sufficiency of such statement or proof or amended or supplemental statement or proof, as the case may be, shall in any of such cases be allowed as a discharge of the liability of the company on such contract of insurance wherever entered into; but this section shall not apply where the fire has taken place before the first day of January, 1904.\nThe fire in question occurred on the 1st of April, 1915, and the proofs of loss, although dated the 29th February, 1916, were furnished, Mr. Allan stated, on the 1st of March, 1916. The actions were taken on the 22nd of March. Among other contentions made at the argument, the respondents claimed that condition 13 was not complied with; that even granting that the trial court could, under sec. 86 of \"The Saskatchewan Insurance Act,\" treat the filing of the proofs of loss on the 1st March as a sufficient compliance with condition 13, the appellants were required by condition 17 to allow a delay of 30 days, in the case of the Glens Falls Company, and of 60 days, in the case of the British Dominions Company, to elapse before taking their action, and further that inasmuch as any action would be absolutely barred, under condition 22, on the 1st April, 1916, no action was possible on the 22nd March against the British Dominions Co., although the appellants, by waiting until the 31st March\u2014and thus giving a full delay of 30 days for the the completion of the proofs of loss\u2014might have taken an action against the Glens Falls Company, assuming that they could be relieved from non-compliance with condition 13.\nThe learned trial judge, Mr. Justice Newlands, relieved the appellants from the consequences of noncompliance with condition 13 in the following terms:\u2014\nI also find that the notice of loss and proofs of loss were not given according to the terms of the policy.\nAs plaintiffs have asked to be relieved under sec. 2 of the \"Fire Insurance Policy Act,\" and as I am of the opinion that it was through mistake that the plaintiffs did not perform these conditions, I will relieve them from the consequences thereof.\nThen as to the defence of the respondents that the actions were premature under condition 17, he said:\u2014 This action was brought on the 22nd of March, less than thirty days after such formal notice and proofs were given. These were not given forthwith nor as soon afterwards as practicable, and were, therefore, not a compliance with the terms of the policy and as I cannot accept them as such, they cannot be used to fix the time when the action should be brought.\nThis judgment was set aside by the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Lamont dissenting.\nI have carefully read all the correspondence filed by the parties, and I cannot help thinking that the appellants have only themselves to blame if they filed the proofs of loss at as late a date as the 1st March, 1916. Shepard was in the premises at the time of the fire, as he stated in his statutory declaration of the 29th of February, 1916, yet he took no steps whatever to claim the insurance, probably because no moneys thereunder would go to him. He subsequently enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Forces, but the other appellant, the Merchants Bank, located him with apparent ease at Regina when it became concerned about the furnishing of the proofs of loss. It is a matter of surprise that this concern only came to the bank about February 12th when its solicitors addressed a letter to Shepard at Margo, where he no longer was, inquiring whether he had sent in proofs of loss. The whole matter was in the hands of the bank's solicitors as early as October, 1915, and it must have been perfectly obvious to them that it would be necessary to take legal proceedings to recover the amount of insurance.\nHowever, the learned trial judge, under the authority conferred by sec. 86 of \"The Saskatchewan Insurance Act,\" relieved the appellants from the consequence of their failure to furnish notice and proofs of loss according to the terms of the policy. I am not inclined to interfere with the discretion of the learned judge. But I cannot see how this can deprive the respondents of the benefit of the delay for payment which must, under condition 17, run from the completion of the proofs of loss. The learned trial judge has not ordered \u2014if indeed he could do so\u2014that the proofs of loss furnished on March 1st be taken as having been given nunc pro tunc, but he says that these proofs were not given forthwith \"nor as soon afterwards as practicable,\" and were not, therefore, a compliance with the terms of the policy, and as he could not accept them as such, they could be used to fix the time when the action should be brought. With all deference, I cannot concur in this reasoning, which would mean that when the assured has given notice and furnished proofs of loss several months after a fire, he could take his action the very next day, provided the judge was satisfied that, by reason of necessity, accident or mistake, the condition of the contract as to the proof to be given to the insurer after the occurrence of the event insured against has not been strictly complied with. Indeed, the reasoning of the learned trial judge would lead to the consequence that the assured would be in a better, and the insurer in a worse, position when the proofs of loss have, as in the present case, been furnished several months after the fire, provided the assured can obtain the indulgence of the court as to the strict compliance with condition 13. I can find no authority in section 86 to dispense with the requirements of any condition of the contract, save that obliging the assured to give notice and proofs of loss to the insurer. It certainly does not allow me to disregard a condition granting a delay to the insurer to pay the loss insured against after proofs and particulars of loss have been furnished him by the assured. Even in this case the appellants could have given the Glens Falls Co. a delay of thirty days to pay the insurance without allowing a full year to elapse before taking their action, while, with regard to the British Dominions Company, they furnished proofs of loss at a date when it was impossible to allow the company a delay of sixty days and take their action within the year. I cannot, upon due consideration, think that I can come to their assistance under section 86, and it is, therefore, my duty to give effect to condition 17 which has not been complied with.\nI have carefully considered two previous decisions of this court in which a provision similar to section 86 was construed and applied.\nIn Prairie City Oil Co. v. Standard Mutual Fire Ins. Co.[9], the question was whether sec. 2 of \"The Manitoba Fire Insurance Act\" applied to a condition of the insurance policy obliging every person entitled to make a claim \"forthwith after loss to give notice in writing to the company,\" and it was decided that under this section the court could relieve the assured from non-compliance with this condition.\nIn Bell Bros. v. The Hudson Bay Ins. Co.[10], it was held that the N.W. Terr. Ord., 1903 (1st sess.), ch. 16, sec. 2, applied to non-compliance by the assured with conditions requiring prompt notice of loss to the company and obliging the assured, in making proofs of loss, to declare how the fire originated so far as he knew or believed.\nWhile I am undoubtedly bound by these decisions so far as they go, I think, with all possible deference, that they should not be extended to a condition such as the one here in question giving to the insurer a certain delay to pay the loss after he has been furnished with notice and proofs of loss. If section 86 can be extended to such a condition, there would really be no condition of the insurance contract that could not be brought under its provisions. This would virtually permit the court, in any case where strict compliance with the statutory conditions might appear inequitable, to remake the contract for the parties. I cannot agree that such a power is given to the court, and in declining to apply section 86 to condition 17 of these policies, so as to deprive the insurers of the delay therein stipulated, I do not believe that I am in any way in variance with these decisions so far as they go, for they are clearly distinguishable from the case under consideration.\nIt is, of course, conceivable that a case may arise where the insurer has himself fully investigated the cause of the fire and the damage thereby caused\u2014and I think that was what had happened in the cases referred to\u2014so that it would be unnecessary for the assured to furnish any proofs of loss under condition 13. In such an event, it might be difficult to determine the starting point of the delay mentioned in condition 17, so that it might not be reasonable to apply this condition as regards an insurer who has voluntarily undertaken such an investigation, thus implicitly relieving the insured from the duty incumbent on him under condition 13. But here the assured has himself furnished proofs of loss and the insurer has done nothing to free him from this obligation, so assuming that section 86 would permit the court to declare that there has been a sufficient compliance with condition 13, I cannot find any satisfactory reason for disallowing an objection based on condition 17 which clearly provides that the loss shall not be payable until the delay of thirty or sixty days has elapsed.\nFor these reasons, I am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs. Cassels J.\u2014I have had the privilege of perusing the reasons of judgment of Mr. Justice Anglin. I concur entirely both in his reasons and his conclusions. If it were necessary for the decision of this case I would go further.\nIn my opinion, under the circumstances of this case, the proofs of loss were entirely dispensed with.\nThe companies took upon themselves, through the assistance of adjusters, to ascertain the amounts of the loss and dispensed with the proofs.\nOne cannot read the correspondence as I read it without coming to this conclusion.\nFurthermore, it seems to me that as the defendants repudiate the whole contract on the ground of arson, they cannot avail themselves of the defences. I am not basing my opinion solely upon the allegation in the defence.\nBefore action the correspondence shews that the companies had pointed out as a reason why the settlement was not likely, viz., on account of arson. Jureidini v. National British and Irish Millers Ins. Co.[11] may be referred to.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Allan, Gordon & Gordon.\nSolicitors for the respondents: McCraney, MacKenzie & Hutchinson.\n[1] 11 Sask.

The Province of Quebec intervened in this appeal. Henry K.C. for the appellant. Section 43 of the \"Bank Act\" was never intended to deprive one province, in this case Quebec, of its right to tax property of great value and give that right to another.\nThe situs of the property must be determined by the rule as to partnership. See Lindley on Partnership (7 ed.) pages 628-9.\nAs to partnership property the situs is the place where the partnership business is carried on. In re Goods of Ewing[2], at page 23; Laidlay v.

Lovitt[14], per Lord Robson, at page 218.\nHenry K.C. for the appellant\nNewcombe K.C. and Jenks K.C. for the respondent\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This appeal comes to us from a judgment delivered by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia on a special case stated under the provisions of the Nova Scotia \"Judicature Act.\"\nThe facts agreed upon which are essential for decision of the appeal are that one Wiley Smith departed this life intestate at Halifax, Nova Scotia, on the 28th day of February, 1916, and at the time of his death had his domicile within the said Province of Nova Scotia; that the aggregate value of the property passing on the death of the said intestate exceeded (within the meaning of the \"Succession Act,\" 1912) one hundred thousand dollars, consisting inter alia of 2,076 shares of capital stock of the Royal Bank of Canada of the value of $442,168 or thereabouts; that the bank had its head office in Montreal, Province of Quebec, and at the time of the passing of said property, and previously thereto, had maintained within the Province of Nova Scotia a share registry office under the provisions of section 43 of the \"Bank Act\" (Canada), at which the shares of shareholders resident within the Province of Nova Scotia were required to be registered, and that the shares in question were so registered there.\nThe question for our opinion is whether under the circumstances stated the said shares are subject to succession duty for the use of the province. I am of opinion that inasmuch as the deceased died intestate domiciled in Nova Scotia owning these shares in the bank the shares are liable to succession duty in that province.\nThe judgment now in question was based on the ground that as the shares were registered in the Province of Nova Scotia in the registry established pursuant to the 43rd section of the \"Bank Act,\" where alone they could be registered, transferred or otherwise effectively dealt with, their situs was in Nova Scotia and succession duty was payable on them there.\nThe only doubt I have had is whether that ground is the true and proper one on which to base the conclusion the court reached. In other words, whether the liability to pay succession or legacy duty does not depend upon the application of the principle mobilia sequuntur personam. I am inclined to think that that principle is the one that should govern and that the law of domicile prevails over that of the locality of the property taxed.\nIn the case of Harding v. Commissioner of Stamps for Queensland[15], which was approved of in the case of Lambe v. Manuel[16], it was held that section 4 of Queensland's \"Succession and Probate Duties Act,\" 1892, defining a \"succession\" (being the same as section 2 of the English \"Succession Duty Act\" of 1853) must be read in the sense affixed to the English Act by the English tribunals; and that it did not include movables locally situated in Queensland which belonged to a testator whose domicile was in Victoria; and it was held further that the amendment Act of 1895, section 2, was not retrospective in its operation. The amendment which was held not to be retrospective provided that succession duty was chargeable with respect to all property within Queensland although the testator or intestate may not have had his domicile in Queensland, but that if it had been retrospective it would have been conclusive. This finding of the Judicial Committee no doubt was reached because the powers of the legislature in that colony were plenary and not limited, and they could, if they chose to do so, displace the domicile rule.\nBut I am of opinion that the powers granted to the provinces of Canada under the 92nd section of the \"British North America Act,\" 1867, are not plenary but limited.\nAmong the legislative powers granted to them under sec. 92 of the said Act is subsec. 2\ndirect taxation within the province for the raising of revenue for provincial purposes.\nThe taxation imposed, therefore, must be on property \"within the Province\" and what is personal property \"within the Province\" must be determined by the rule so firmly established in Great Britain with respect to it at the time of the passing of the \"British North America Act\" as that embodied in the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam under which all the decedent's personal property wheresoever situate is brought within the province or country of his domicile and made liable for all succession or legacy duties there imposed upon it.\nAfter a careful study, not for the first time, of all the cases cited at bar bearing upon the question before us, I have reached the same conclusion with respect to the domicile being the determining factor as to what property is liable for succession and legacy duties as my brother Anglin and I concur in his reasons for the conclusion reached by him. The broad ground on which that judgment rests is that the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam embodies the principle applicable to the succession of property of a domiciled decedent of any province of Canada for succession and legacy duties, as distinct from probate or estate duties; that in regard to those special succession and legacy duties the domicile of the decedent and not the physical or artificial situs of the property must prevail; that this was the law in England decided in a series of cases before the \"British North America Act\" was passed and that the power of taxation within the province granted to the provinces in subsec. 2 of sec. 92 of that Act must be construed in accordance with the English law as it then was decided to be; that accordingly each province has the power of levying succession and legacy duties only upon the personal property passed by a domiciled decedent of the province, which either is locally situate therein physically or by virtue of the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam is drawn into such province by reason of the domicile; that while the Imperial Legislature itself or a colony possessing plenary powers of taxation could at any time overrule the principle embodied in the maxim (see Harding v. Commissioner of Stamps for Queensland[17], above quoted), the several provinces of Canada being limited in their powers cannot do so or by any enactment of their own enlarge or extend the powers of taxation granted to them by section 92 of the \"British North America Act;\" that any other construction of these powers of taxation would create endless, if not insuperable, difficulties and would subject the same property to possible double liability to succession duty taxation, one in the province where the domiciled decedent owned the property and the other in which it was locally situated at his death. The result of the holding, in which I concur, would be that the domicile of the decedent would be the test in Canada of the right to levy succession duties upon his personal property wherever it might be locally or physically situate and that such taxation could only be levied by the province of the domicile.\nIf I am wrong in my concurrence with my brother Anglin that the domicile of the decedent is the determining factor on the right of the province to levy succession and legacy duties, then I would uphold the judgment appealed from on the ground it is based, namely, that the bank shares in question were at the time of the death of the domiciled decedent registered in the Province of Nova Scotia where alone \"they could be registered\" and where alone \"and not elsewhere\" they could be transferred or effectively dealt with.\nI do not think the mere fact of the head office of the bank being in Montreal and the board of directors meeting there to manage the affairs of the bank, could be held to affect or alter the situs of the shares from their place of registry where alone they could be effectively dealt with.\nIdington J.\u2014The question raised herein by a stated case is the right of respondent to collect, from appellants, succession duty upon shares held by the testator in the Royal Bank of Canada, having at his death its head office in Montreal.\nIn the stated case it is, with other things, admitted as follows:\u2014\n1. Wiley Smith departed this life intestate at Halifax, in the County of Halifax, Province of Nova Scotia, on the 28th day of February, A.D. 1916, and at the time of his death had his permanent domicile and residence within the said Province of Nova Scotia. 2. Letters of administration were on the 6th day of March, 1916, duly granted to Harriet W. Smith, L. Mortimer Smith, and the Montreal Trust Company by the Probate Court for the probate district of the County of Halifax.\n*****\n6. The said the Royal Bank of Canada, on and previous to the said 28th day of February, 1916, as well as after the said date, had its head office in Montreal, in the Province of Quebec.\n7. The said The Royal Bank of Canada, at the time of the passing of said property, and previously thereto, maintained within the Province of Nova Scotia a Share Registry Office under the provisions of section 43 of the \"Bank Act\" (Canada), at which the shares of shareholders resident within the Province of Nova Scotia were required to be registered.\nThe claim to collect succession duties must rest upon the following sections of the Act:\u2014\nThe \"Succession Duty Act,\" 1912 (Nova Scotia), being chap. 13 of the Acts of 1912 as amended by chap. 57 of the Acts of 1913, and chaps. 14 and 36 of the Acts of 1915.\nSection 2. For the purpose of raising a revenue for provincial purposes, save as is hereafter otherwise expressly provided, there shall be levied and paid, for the use of the province, a duty at the rates hereinafter mentioned upon all property which has passed on the death of any person who has died on or since the 1st day of July, 1892, or passing on the death of any person who shall hereafter die, according to the fair market value of such property at the date of the death of such person.\nSection 6. The following property, as well as all other property subject to succession duty, shall be subject to duty at the rates hereinafter imposed:\n(1) All property situate in Nova Scotia, and any income therefrom passing on the death of any person whether the deceased was at the time of his death domiciled in Nova Scotia or elsewhere.\nThe place of residence of the executors is not stated, but in argument as I understood admitted, as to the Smiths, to be in Nova Scotia.\nThe Supreme Court of Nova Scotia held that the appellants were liable.\nThe answer to the question submitted seems to me to be concluded by the case of Lambe v. Manuel[18], and in principle the case of The Attorney-General v. Higgins et al[19]. The former decision was upon a claim by the appellant therein representing the Province of Quebec and claiming upon its behalf succession duties upon shares held, by a testator residing in Ontario, in the Merchants Bank of Canada, having its head office in Montreal, as well as in respect of other bank shares. The Quebec courts held respondent there was not liable to pay duties, in respect of such shares, to the Province of Quebec, and this holding was maintained by the court above in a judgment written by the late Lord Macnaghten, whose opinion alone must ever be held as entitled to the highest respect.\nTrue the Quebec Act has been changed since and rendered more intelligible, as the result, I presume, of the case of Cotton v. The King[20].\nBut in principle, so far as relates to the claim of that province herein, I am unable to see any distinction resting upon such amendment that can be made relevant to this case distinguishing it from Lambe v. Manuel[21].\nThe domicile of the testator in question there was in Ontario, and that of the testator in question herein was in Nova Scotia. And as far as the \"Banking Act\" and its operation is concerned in relation to the situs of the property in shares, the Act has been amended by section 43 of that Act rendering it imperative to have a local provincial register where shares can be transferred, and thereby strengthening the claim of the province where the testator at death was domiciled.\nIn conformity with such requirement the bank in question had, as stated, a provincial register in Nova Scotia. That provision seems to put beyond doubt what, in the then doubtful frame of the Act, very able counsel in the Manuel Case (2) had at their hand, to press, and no doubt did press for all it was worth, the argument founded upon the registry for transfers of shares there in question being in Quebec.\nI have considered the constitutional argument put forward relative to the limitations of the Dominion Parliament in regard to property and civil rights.\nI cannot accede thereto. Indeed it seems to me futile in view of the language of section 91 of the \"British North America Act\" assigning to\nthe exclusive authority of the Parliament of Canada\nby subsection 15\nbanking, incorporation of banks, and the issue of paper money,\nand ending that section as follows:\u2014\nAnd any matter coming within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in this section shall not be deemed to come within the class of matters of a local or private nature comprised in the enumeration of the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.\nThere does not seem to me to be the slightest foundation for pretending that the power conferred by this enactment has been exceeded by the requirement for a local registry of shares. I repeat that this case falls in principle within the case of the Attorney-General v. Higgins[22], so far as what has to be determined under the Nova Scotia \"Succession Duties Act\" can be affected by legislation defining the character and situs of shares in a corporation, but the respondents' claim does not rest upon that alone.\nThe prim\u00e2 facie effect of the observance of the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam, subject to its many limitations which have to be borne in mind, when the necessity arises, for determining what may or not fall within the legislative jurisdiction of a province to impose a succession duties tax supports respondents' claim. For example, we had to determine recently the situs of a debt due under an Alberta mortgage, registered there, and payable there, to a testator dying in Ontario. We held its situs to be in Alberta and that province entitled, under an Act worded similarly to that of the Nova Scotia Act here in question, to recover the succession duties alleged to be payable in respect of said mortgage.\nAnd in passing I may say that the supposed case presented in argument, of shares in an insolvent bank being wound up might, though I express no definite opinion in that regard, in like manner give rise to very different considerations from those we have herein to deal with.\nAgain, on the other hand, we should bear in mind the provision in the \"Banking Act,\" sec. 51, subsecs. (a), (b) and (c), which read as follows:\u2014\nSection 51:\u2014\nNotwithstanding anything in this Act, if the transmission of any share of the capital stock has taken place by virtue of the decease of any shareholder, the production to the directors and the deposit with them of\n(a) Any authenticated copy of the probate of the will of the deceased shareholder, or of letters of administration of his estate, or of letters of verification of heirship, or of the act of curatorship or tutorship, granted by any court in Canada having power to grant the same, or by any court or authority in England, Wales, Ireland, or any British colony, or of any testament, testamentary or testament dative expede in Scotland; or\n(b) An authentic notarial copy of the will of the deceased shareholder, if such will is in notarial form according to the law of the Province of Quebec; or\n(c) If the deceased shareholder died out of His Majesty's dominions, any authenticated copy of the probate of his will or letters of administration of his property, or other document of like import, granted by any court or authority having the requisite power in such matters, shall be sufficient justification and authority to the directors for paying any dividend, or for transferring or authorizing the transfer of any share, in pursuance of and in conformity to the probate, letters of administration, or other such document as aforesaid. I submit it impliedly recognizes the place where probate should issue as the situs of the property, and I infer the registration of any transfer by the executors must be transferred by registration in the province at all events when the executors resided there.\nI asked counsel if anything more explicit in the Act but they could not refer me to anything further on the subject.\nThe argument put forward as to the bank shares being analogous to property in a partnership, I submit to be effective must be addressed elsewhere, in light of the decision we arrived at in the recent case of Boyd v. The Attorney-General for British Columbia[23].\nLike the mobilia sequuntur rule we found that the ordinary rule as to the situs of what had been partnership property, could not have a universal application determining either the situs of such property or its taxability by a province.\nThis case is not within the lines presented in The King v. Lovitt[24], though regard may well be had to what was in fact involved therein, when it was held that a deposit in a New Brunswick branch of a bank was taxable within the terms of the Act there in question. The testator there in question was domiciled in Nova Scotia.\nIf the proposition put forward by appellants and left by them to be maintained by the Province of Quebec, appearing as an intervenant herein, be tenable, that all shares in banks having a head office in Montreal are properly situate there, then not only can that province tax all such bank shares by way of death duties, but also from year to year for ordinary purposes. I imagine such an exercise of its alleged power which would apply also to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company shareholders, might awaken some people and they might produce a realization of how little dependence can be placed on mere theories no matter how plausible, and only useful as arguments to be tried on a court.\nA business tax has been successfully imposed in some such like cases (see Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[25]), but I respectfully submit that proceeded upon an entirely different basis.\nI am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs of the respondent, and that the intervenant should have no costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014The late Wiley Smith, who was domiciled and died intestate at Halifax, in the Province of Nova Scotia, owned 2,076 shares in the Royal Bank. The head office of that bank is at Montreal, in the Province of Quebec, but it maintains a share registry office at Halifax, under subsec. 4 of sec. 43 of the \"Bank Act,\" and, as prescribed by that subsection, Smith's shares were registered and transferable there and not elsewhere. The question presented by the stated case before us is whether these shares are liable to taxation under the Nova Scotia \"Succession Duties Act\" (2 Geo. V. ch. 15). Had they a situs in contemplation of law at Montreal or at Halifax? If at Montreal, does the Nova Scotia statute, properly construed, apply to them? If it does, is such taxation within the legislative power of the province under sec. 92 (2) of the \"British North America Act\"\u2014is it\ndirect taxation within the province in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial purposes?\nThese were the questions discussed at bar. I cannot agree with Mr. Newcombe's suggestion that bank shares may have no situs other than the Dominion of Canada at large because that is\nthe locality of the business of the bank, of its legislative control, and of probate or administration for any purpose looking to the realization or enjoyment of the property.\nFor the purposes of taxation, probate and succession bank shares must have a local situs. Neither can I accede to Mr. Henry's contention that if change of situs would result from the operation of section 43 (4) of the \"Bank Act,\" as enacted in 1913, that fact would render it ultra vires. The control exercised by that provision over the registration and transfer of bank shares is, I think, undoubtedly within the legislative jurisdiction conferred on the Dominion under subsec. 15 of sec. 91\u2014\"banking (and) the incorporation of banks''\u2014a power which, as Lord Watson says in Tennant v. Union Bank of Canada[26],\nis not confined to the mere constitution of corporate bodies with the privilege of carrying on the business of bankers (p. 46),\nand\nmay be fully exercised although with the effect of modifying civil rights in the province (p. 48).\nSee, too, Cushing v. Dupuy[27], and compare Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Attorney-General of Canada[28].\n\"The pith and substance\" of the enactment being clearly intra vires any interference with civil rights which follows as an incidental consequence cannot affect its constitutional validity. Whether section 43 (4) in fact changes or affects the situs of bank shares to which it applies is, of course, quite another question and one by no means free from difficulty.\nAs at present advised I am not convinced that for some purposes the situs of the shares now in question was not at the head office of the bank. The authorities cited by the learned judge who delivered the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia are certainly not conclusive in favour of a situs at the place of registry. The case chiefly relied upon as\nmost directly in point, if not on all fours with the present case,\nwas Attorney-General v. Higgins[29]. The question there at issue was liability for probate duty, not succession duty. The head office and the place of registration were identical. Of three learned judges who heard the case only one, Martin B.\u2014no doubt a judge of eminence\u2014took the place of registration of the railway shares there in question as decisive of their situs. Watson B. merely alludes to the fact that \"the railway is in Scotland.\" Pollock C.B. only determines that the shares did not cease to be property in Scotland because a statute intended to facilitate their transfer provided for the registration of it on production of an English probate. That was indeed all the case really decided. In Attorney-General v. Sudeley[30], at p. 361, Lord Esher M.R. says of Attorney-General v. Higgins29:\u2014\nThe head office of the railway company was in Scotland. The shares were, therefore, payable in Scotland.\nA reference to the foot-note (d) will shew that the passage cited by the learned Nova Scotia judge from 13 Halsbury Laws of England, at p. 310, likewise affords little or no assistance. In Attorney-General v. New York Breweries[31], a modern case cited for its approval of the Higgins decision, both the head office and the registry of shares were situated in England\u2014as both had been in Scotland in the Higgins Case (1). Liability to probate duties was likewise the question at issue. The situs for that purpose was held to be in England. In the view I take, however, I find it is not necessary to determine the situs of these bank shares for any purpose other than their liability to succession duties under the Nova Scotia statute. In none of the taxation cases cited in the judgment below did the statute under consideration resemble it.\nAlthough the duty is imposed by the Nova Scotia Act on the principal value of all property which passes on the death of the owner and is made payable at his death, or within eighteen months thereafter, but before distribution, by his personal representative to the extent of the property received by him\u2014in these respects somewhat resembling an estate duty\u2014having regard to the exemption of all bequests under $500, of all bequests for religious, charitable or educational purposes to be carried out in the province, and of bequests to certain classes of relatives where the estate does not exceed $25,000, to the higher rate of duty imposed where property passes to beneficiaries other than immediate relatives of the decedent owner, and to the fact that the legislature has itself styled the statute a succession duty Act, I am disposed to think that the taxes imposed by it should be classed as succession duties rather than estate duties. In re Earl Cowley's Estate[32], at pages 374-5; Winans v. Attorney-General[33], at pages 39-41. Lord Gorrell thus sums up the difference between the two classes of Acts:\u2014\nThe broad point with regard to the duties is that the first three (\"probate duty,\" \"account duty\" and \"temporary estate duty\") dealt with the duty on the amount of property passing, whatever its destination, while the other two (\"legacy duty\" and \"succession duty\") dealt with the duty on the value of the interests taken, and the duty varied with the relationship of the person taking to the person from whom the interest was derived or the predecessor.\nAlthough the Nova Scotia statute does not impose the tax on the transmission itself, as is the case in the Quebec legislation (Lambe v. Manuel[34]; Cotton v. Rex[35]), it imposes it on the property transmitted\u2014the property passing on the death\u2014\"the succession\"\u2014as was the case under the English \"Succession Act\" of 1853 (16 & 17 Vict. ch. 51, secs. 1 and 10; Hanson's Death Duties, 6th ed., p. 614), and the duty varies with the relationship of the person taking to the person from whom the interest is derived or the predecessor.\nThe features of the New Brunswick \"Succession Duty Act\" which led Lord Robson in Rex v. Lovitt[36] at p. 223, to treat it as imposing a tax rather in the nature of probate duty than a succession duty are entirely absent from the Nova Scotia statute.\nThe actual situs of tangible effects, the situs immputed by law to intangible effects, without regard to the domicile of the owner, carried with it liability to probate or estate duty. But under the English \"Legacy Act\" and \"Succession Duty Act\" the contrary rule has prevailed and the maxim mobilia sequunter personam has been applied to subject to these imposts foreign movables of domiciled decedents and to exempt from their operation the English assets of foreigners. Winans v. Attorney-General[37], at pages 31-34. Succession duty is exigible only in respect of movables which pass under English law\u2014to which the beneficiary obtains title under English law. Wallace v. Attorney-General[38], at pages 6-9; Dicey on Conflict of Laws (2nd ed.), pp. 750 et seq.\nBy the law of England, therefore, which obtains in Nova Scotia, for the purpose of succession duties, as distinguished from probate duties and estate duties, personal property has its situs at the domicile of the decedent owner. I therefore reach the conclusion that whatever should be deemed their situs for other purposes, for that of the succession duties imposed by the Nova Scotia statute the bank shares in question had a situs under English law at Halifax, because of the applicability of the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam\u2014because title to them passed under the law of Nova Scotia.\nAlthough the Nova Scotia Act is not expressly made applicable, as was the New Brunswick statute dealt with in Rex v. Lovitt[39],\nto all property whether situate in this province or elsewhere,\nthere are in it some indications of an intent to subject foreign personal property of a domiciled decedent to its operation. Thus by section 2 the duty is declared to be leviable and payable in respect of all property which passes on the death of any person. By clause (b) of subsec. 1 of sec. 3 property includes everything real and personal capable of passing on the death of the owner. Section 6 enacts that \"the following property\" (inter alia \"property situate in Nova Scotia\"),\nas well as all other property subject to succession duty shall be subject to duty at the rates hereinafter imposed.\nSections 3 (a) and 6 (1) on the other hand, leave no room whatever to doubt that the intention of the legislature was that the personal property of a non-domiciled decedent situate in Nova Scotia should be liable for the duties imposed by the Act. The intention to exclude the application of the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam in regard to such personal property is abundantly clear. With the validity of the imposts on this class of property, however, we are not now concerned. But see Boyd v. Attorney-General for British Columbia[40]. The presence of these latter provisions, however, does not suffice to take from the statute its distinctive character as a succession duty Act.\nAlthough the statute makes no distinction between real and personal property it would seem to me impossible that the legislature meant to attempt to tax foreign real estate of a domiciled decedent. Following the principles established by Thomson v. Advocate-General[41]; In re Ewing[42]; Wallace v. The Attorney-General[43]; and Harding v. Commissioner of Stamps for Queensland[44], at pages 773-4, I would also be inclined to hold that the words \"person\" and \"property\" in section 2 should be restricted respectively to a person domiciled in Nova Scotia and to property which may properly be made the subject of succession duties according to English law. For the same reason I would construe \"all property situate in Nova Scotia\" in clause 1 of section 6 as meaning property having a physical situs in that province; (Cotton v. Rex[45], at p. 186); and the words\nall other property subject to succession duty\nin the opening paragraph of section 6 as intended to bring in personal property which, although it has not a physical situs in the province, English law would regard as within it for the purpose of succession duties. While, having regard to the constitutional limitation on its powers of taxation, I should, if it imposed probate or estate duties, hesitate to find in the provisions of the Nova Scotia Act to which I have referred a sufficiently clear expression of intention to subject to them personal property having a physical situs or an artificial situs in contemplation of law outside of the province, there is certainly nothing in the Act calculated to prevent the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam having the full operation given to it by English law for the purpose of succession duties in the case of all personal assets of the domiciled decedent.\nThe only authority at all in conflict with this view is Woodruff v. Attorney-General for Ontario[46]. But the conflict is more apparent than real. The property there in question consisted of bonds and debentures of a foreign company which were at the date of their transfer and remained in the custody of a New York deposit company. The transmission of them was not by will or upon an intestacy but by instruments inter vivos which took effect under the law of the State of New York. There was no succession or transmission by virtue of Ontario law. The ground on which the maxim mobilia sequuntur personam is applied in this case, therefore, did not exist in Woodruff's Case (1). Moreover, in speaking of that case in Cotton v. Rex[47], at p. 196, Lord Moulton delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee said:\u2014\nThe circumstances of that case were so special, and there is so much doubt as to the reasoning on which it is based, that their Lordships have felt that it is better not to treat it as governing or affecting the present decision.\nBefore parting with this appeal I desire to reiterate my dissent already expressed in Lovitt v. The King[48], at p. 161, and Boyd v. Attorney-General for British Columbia[49], at p. 536-7, from the view that a provincial legislature whose powers of taxation are restricted to \"taxation within the province\" may, for purposes of taxation, give to property a situs within the province although according to the general law of the province applicable under the circumstances its situs would be outside. If it can, the words \"within the province\" are practically deleted from subsec. 2 of sec. 92 of the \"British North America Act\"; the same property may be subject to taxation identical in character in more than one province, and the exclusive right to tax property locally situate within the province, which section 92 (2) was undoubtedly meant to confer, is non-existent. The case of Rex v. Lovitt[50], is cited as opposed to this view and no doubt certain passages from Lord Robson's judgment are in conflict with it. With great respect, however, his Lordship, in applying the decision in Harding v. Commissioners of Stamps for Queensland[51], would seem to have momentarily overlooked the fact that no restriction of its powers of taxation similar to that imposed upon Canadian provincial legislatures (taxation within the province) applied to the Legislature of Queensland. But all that the Lovitt Case (1), determined was that a debt (to which English law attributes a local situs at the residence of the debtor), held upon the facts to be payable at the St. John, New Brunswick, branch of the Bank of B.N.A., was liable to a New Brunswick tax which, in the opinion of the Judicial Committee, was assimilated to a probate duty. For that the Lovitt Case (1), is authority, but for nothing more. As Lord Moulton says of it in Cotton v. Rex[52], at p. 196:\u2014\nIn the case of Rex v. Lovitt50 no question arose as to the power of a province to levy succession duty on property situate outside the province. It related solely to the power of the province to require as a condition for local probate on property within the province that a succession duty should be paid thereon.\nI would dismiss the appeal. Brodeur J.\u2014This is a question of succession duty on the bank shares which the late Mr. Wiley Smith had in the Royal Bank. The deceased had his domicile in Nova Scotia. The Royal Bank has its head office in Montreal, in the Province of Quebec, and has a branch in Halifax, in the Province of Nova Scotia. According to the provisions of the \"Bank Act\" (sections 43-4), it had opened in the latter place a share registry office at which the shares of Mr. Smith had to be registered and were registered. A stated case had been submitted by the Smith estate and by the Provincial Government of Nova Scotia for the opinion of the court as to whether those shares are subject to the payment of succession duty for the use of the Province of Nova Scotia.\nThe Supreme Court of that province decided that those shares were subject to that duty.\nAn appeal has been made by the estate to this court, and the Attorney-General of the Province of Quebec has intervened to support that appeal. He contends with the appellant that the Royal Bank, in establishing a share registry office in a province, does not change the situs of the shares from the head office of the bank to the place where the registry office is kept.\nThe appellant and the intervenant contend also that if the section of the \"Bank Act\" bears that construction, it is to that extent beyond the powers of the Federal Parliament. But that constitutional aspect of the case was simply mentioned at bar and not pressed.\nThe \"Succession Duty Act,\" of 1912, of Nova Scotia enacts that for the purpose of raising a revenue for provincial purposes * * * there shall be levied and paid for the use of the province a duty * * * upon all property * * * passing on the death of any person * * *\nBy section 3 of that Act it is declared that the words ''passing on the death\" should be construed as meaning passing immediately on the death or after an interval either certainly or contingently and either originally or by way of substitutive limitation, whether the deceased was at the time of his death domiciled in Nova Scotia or elsewhere.\nBy section 6 it is provided that all property situate in Nova Scotia is subject to duty. We have then to find out whether these Royal Bank shares belonging to the Smith estate are situated in Nova Scotia.\nThe law of the domicile of the owner governs movable property. But when it comes to determining the distinction or nature of the property, the contestation as to the possession or the rights of the Crown, the law of the situs governs. If it were a question of tangible movable property, there would be no difficulty. But when it comes to intangible property, like simple contract debts, specialty debts, bonds and bank shares, the question is more complicated.\nIt has been decided that specialty debts owing by persons outside of the jurisdiction are assets where the instrument happens to be. Stamp Commissioner v. Hope[53].\nSimple contract debts, whether the title is evidenced or not by bills of exchange or promissory notes, are assets where the debtor resides; Attorney-General v. Pratt[54]; Attorney-General v. Bouwens[55]; Rex v. Lovitt[56].\nIn the case of bank shares, it was decided in the case of Attorney-General v. Higgins[57], that where by statute the evidence of title to shares is the register of shareholders the property is located where the register is.\nI think that the latter decision has a great bearing upon the question at issue in this case because it determines conclusively that the situs of bank shares is the place where they are registered.\nFormerly the banks could open branch offices in different parts of the country and could open also share registry offices where shares could be registered and transferred. Under the provisions of that Act, it was decided in a case of Hughes v. Rees[58], that shares in a bank whose head office was in Ontario, but which were registered in Quebec, were situate in Ontario. The reason of the judgment was that the change had been made by the bank for convenience sake, but that the bank stock was, however, virtually situate in Ontario.\nA similar decision was also rendered in the following case of Nickle v. Douglas[59].\nBut it is submitted that sec. 43, subsec. 4, of the \"Bank Act\" has changed the law in that respect because it enacts that shares shall be registered at agencies within the province in the case of shares owned by residents of that province. The banks are not bound to open those branch offices, but once they have done so the law declares that all the shares of the\nshareholders resident within the province shall be registered at that office at which and not elsewhere such shares may be validly transferred.\nIt is argued that in this case it is not a question of transfer; it is a question of transmission of shares by death. I do not think that this constitutes any difference. Section 50 of the \"Bank Act\" says that if the transmission of shares is made by intestacy the probate of the will or the letters of administration should be produced and left with the general manager, or other officers or agents of the bank. That manager or agent shall then enter in the register of shareholders the name of the person entitled under the transmission. It may be that for convenience sake the documents shewing the title to the shares would have to be referred to the head office of the bank; but the transmission should be entered in the register of shareholders where those shares were entered. In this case the documents might have been sent to Montreal to be examined by the authorities of the bank there, but they had been entered in Halifax, where the shares were entered in the share registry office.\nIn the case of Attorney-General v. Sudeley[60], the Master of the Rolls said that the head office of the railway company in question in that case was in Scotland and that the shares were, therefore, payable in Scotland.\nThe case of In re Clark[61] is conclusive on the point.\nIn that case a testator domiciled in England by his will bequeathed all his personal estate in the United Kingdom to certain persons whom he calls his home trustees upon certain trusts, and he bequeathed all his personal estate in South Africa to certain other persons whom he calls his foreign trustees upon other trusts. At the time of his decease, the testator was possessed of bonds payable to bearer of a waterworks company in South Africa, and of shares in mining companies in South Africa. The mining companies were constituted according to the laws of Transvaal and Orange Free State, and had their head office in South Africa where the registry of shareholders was kept and where the directors met; but they also had an office in London, where a duplicate registry was kept and the shares could be transferred. The testator's name was on the London register of the company and all his bonds and share certificates were at his bankers in London.\nIt was held that the shares passed under the bequest to the home trustees.\nLord Justice Farwell, deciding the case, said:\u2014\nThe property I have to deal with is a share and that is represented by a certificate without which no transfer can take place. The actual effective transfer can be done equally effectually in South Africa or in England, and the only conceivable distinction that I can discover in point of locality is the possession of the certificate which for this purpose is essential to complete the title to the shares. Therefore I hold that where the certificates of the shares in these companies were in England they passed under the gift of property situated in England, and not under the gift of property in South Africa.\nIn the case of Clark[62] the transfer could have been made in two places, in South Africa and in England. In this case, I think, under a proper construction of the \"Bank Act,\" that the transfer could be made only at Halifax where the shares were already registered. I may quote in support of that contention Stern v. The Queen[63]; Winans v. Attorney-General[64]; Attorney-General v. New York Breweries[65].\nFor these reasons I have come to the conclusion that the situs of those bank shares was in Halifax and that they were liable to succession duty in the Province of Nova Scotia.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. Mignault J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco, on a stated case submitted by the respondent (plaintiff in the court below) and the appellants (defendants in the court below), under the provisions of the Nova Scotia \"Judicature Act,\" order 33. The Attorney-General of the Province of Quebec (claiming to have an interest in the question at issue) has intervened before this court and prays for the reversal of the judgment.\nThe whole question is whether succession duty can be claimed by Nova Scotia in respect of 2,076 shares of the Royal Bank of Canada, which the late Wiley Smith, of the City and County of Halifax, in the Province of Nova Scotia, owned at the time of his death. Wiley Smith died intestate at Halifax on the 28th February, 1916, and the appellants are his administrators. At the time of his death, and ever since, the head office of the Royal Bank was in Montreal, Province of Quebec, but the bank had in Nova Scotia a share registry office, where the shares of shareholders resident within that province were required to be registered under section 43 of the \"Bank Act,\" and the shares in question were duly registered there at and before Smith's death. The Provincial Treasurer of Nova Scotia, under the provisions of the Nova Scotia 'Succession Duty Act,\" 1912 (2 Geo. V. ch. 13), claims to be entitled to the payment of succession duty on these shares, and the question submitted, and which the court below has answered in the affirmative, is whether, under the said Act, succession duty is payable upon the said shares.\nThe provisions of the Nova Scotia \"Succession Duty Act,\" 1912, so far as pertinent to the present inquiry, may be briefly stated.\nIt is provided by section 2 that For the purpose of raising a revenue for provincial purposes, save as is hereafter otherwise expressly provided, there shall be levied and paid for the use of the province, a duty at the rates hereinafter mentioned upon all property which has passed on the death of any person who has died on or since the 1st day of July, 1892, or passing on the death of any person who shall hereafter die, according to the fair market value of such property at the death of said person.\nSection 3 defines certain terms. I will quote two of these definitions given respectively by subsections (a) and (b).\n(a) The words \"passing on the death\" mean passing either immediately on the death or after an interval either certainly or contingently, and either originally or by way of substitutive limitation, whether the deceased was at the time of his death domiciled in Nova Scotia or elsewhere.\n(b) \"Property\" includes real and personal property of every description and every estate and interest therein, capable of being devised or bequeathed by will or of passing on the death of the owner to his heir or personal representatives.\nBy section 6 it is provided:\u2014\n6. The following property, as well as all other property subject to succession duty, shall be subject to duty at the rates hereinafter imposed:\n(1) All property situate in Nova Scotia, and any income therefrom passing on the death of any person, whether the deceased was at the time of his death domiciled in Nova Scotia or elsewhere.\n(2) Debts and sums of money due and owing from persons in Nova Scotia to any deceased person at the time of his death, on obligation or other specialty, shall be property of the deceased situate in Nova Scotia without regard to the place where the obligation or specialty shall be at the time of the death of the deceased.\nIt is also provided by section 9 as follows:\u2014\n9. Any portion of the estate of any deceased person, whether at the time of his death such person was domiciled in Nova Scotia or elsewhere, which is brought into this province to be administered or distributed, shall be liable to the duty in this chapter imposed.\nThe concluding portion of section 9 need not be given here. Its effect is merely to provide that if the property so brought into the province has paid succession duty elsewhere equal to or greater than the duty payable in Nova Scotia, no duty shall be paid; if the amount so paid elsewhere is less than that payable in Nova Scotia, the difference in amount has then to be paid. It is under these provisions that succession duty is claimed on the bank shares owned by the intestate, who at the time of his death was domiciled in the Province of Nova Scotia.\nThe court below decided that inasmuch as the shares were registered in Nova Scotia, they were property situate in Nova Scotia, and subject to succession duty under the Nova Scotia \"Succession Duty Act,\" 1912.\nAfter due consideration I have come to the conclusion that this is a case where the rule of law mobilia sequuntur personam applies. This rule has been followed in England in cases where the question to be decided was whether personal property in Great Britain accruing on the death of its foreign owner was subject to succession duty or legacy duty, properly so called, in Great Britain.\nThus in the case of Thompson v. Attorney-General[66], the testator, who was domiciled in Demarara, where the Dutch law prevailed and no legacy duty existed, had loaned money in Scotland, and the House of Lords applied the rule mobilia sequuntur personam to this money to the exclusion of provisions imposing legacy duty in the United Kingdom. This decision was followed by Lord Cranworth L.C: in a subsequent case, Wallace v. Attorney-General[67].\nThis affords a simple solution of the problem submitted to this court, and it would not be necessary to decide the question whether, in view of the fact that the bank shares were registered in Nova Scotia, they acquired an actual situs in that province. But as this latter question was argued at great length by the learned counsel of the parties, it has seemed to me advisable that I should give it full consideration. The bank shares owned by Mr. Smith at his death were registered in the Nova Scotia share registry office of the Royal Bank; as required by section 43, subsection 4, of the \"Bank Act,\" while the head office of the bank was in Montreal.\nSubsec. 4 of sec. 43 is in the following terms:\u2014\n4. The bank may open and maintain in any province in Canada in which it has resident shareholders and in which it has one or more branches or agencies a share registry office to be designated by the directors at which the shares of the shareholders resident within the province shall be registered and at which, and not elsewhere, except as hereinafter provided, such shares may be validly transferred.\nThis is a comparatively recent amendment of the \"Bank Act,\" and prior to its enactment it was optional for a shareholder to have his shares registered either at the head office of the bank or at any share registry office which the bank had opened elsewhere for the convenience of its shareholders.\nIndependently of the new enactment of subsec. 4 of sec. 43 of the \"Bank Act,\" I would be of the opinion that if bank shares, being intangible or incorporeal property, can have any actual situs other than the domicile of their owner, this situs should not be placed at the share registry office where the shareholder has chosen to cause his shares to be registered.\nNor do I think, because it is now compulsory to register bank shares at the share registry office established in the province where the shareholder resides, that the situs of the shares, which previously might have been registered elsewhere, is in any way changed by the fact that they must now be registered at the provincial share registry office. It is entirely optional for the bank to open such an office, and after opening it, it may close it. Moreover, a bank might change the location of a provincial share registry office from one city to another in the same province, and then, under subsection 4, the shares of shareholders resident within the province would have to be registered at the new location. To maintain that the situs of the shares would thus, on account of their registration, be shifted from one place to another, while the head office and the residence of the shareholder remain unchanged, would require the support of more conclusive authority than that on which the court below relied to decide that the place of registry of the shares determines their location.\nThe principal authority cited by Mr. Justice Chisholm is the case of Attorney-General v. Higgins[68]. There the testator domiciled in England owned shares in railway companies in Scotland, the head offices of which were also in Scotland. The Attorney-General argued that\nthe chief offices of these railways are in Scotland and therefore the shares in question are personal property in Scotland.\nThe court was composed of Chief Baron Pollock and Barons Martin and Watson. Baron Martin said that the argument of the Attorney-General had perfectly satisfied him. He added :\u2014\nIt is clear that by the 19th section of the 8 & 9 Vict. sec. 17, the evidence of title to these shares is the register of shareholders, and that being in Scotland, this property is located in Scotland.\nNeither of the two other judges expressed any opinion as to the register of shareholders determining the locality of the shares, and it is obvious that the Attorney-General merely relied on the fact that the head office was in Scotland and that, therefore, the shares were also in Scotland. If this authority has any effect, it would support the contention that shares in such a company are located at the head office, rather than the claim that their situs is at a share registry office which may have been established elsewhere. The case of In re Clark[69], is not more conclusive than the Higgins Case[70]. The testator was domiciled in England and bequeathed his personal estate in the United Kingdom to certain persons whom he called his \"home trustees,\" and his personal estate in South-Africa to other persons whom he termed his \"foreign trustees.'' He possessed bonds and shares in South Africa companies which had offices, share registers and directors both in London and in South Africa. The testator's name was on the London register, and all his bonds and share certificates were at his bankers in London. Mr. Justice Farwell said that as between England and South Africa, the only conceivable distinction that he could discover in point of locality is the possession of the certificate which is essential to complete the title to the shares. The certificates being in England, he held that the shares went to the home trustees.\nThe case of Attorney-General v. The New York Breweries Co.[71], does not support the conclusion adopted in the court below that the situs of the shares was at the share registry office. This was a case where probate duty\u2014entirely different from succession duty\u2014was claimed on the shares of an English company, whose head office and register of shares was in England. To deal with these shares and transfer them some act had to be done in England, and this sufficed to render the shares subject to probate duty.\nI find, therefore, no conclusive authority for the proposition that where a share registry office of bank shares is established in a province other than the province in which the head office of the bank is situated, the shares are located at the place where the share registry in which they are registered is kept. I would think that the authorities to which I have referred would lend more support to the contention that the shares are located at the head office of the bank rather than to the claim that their situs is at the share registry office.\nIt is, however, unnecessary to choose between the head office of the bank and the provincial share registry office, because the intestate being domiciled in Halifax where the share registry office was kept, the shares, in so far as liability for succession duty is concerned, must be considered as situate at his domicile under the rule mobilia sequuntur personam.\nI would, therefore, basing my opinion on this rule, answer the question submitted in the affirmative. The appeal should be dismissed with costs against the appellants. The intervention should also be dismissed with a recommendation that the respondent be paid his costs on the same.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. A.

Idington J. dissenting.\nThe finding of the trial judge that a foreign manufacturer and its agent in Canada conspired to defraud the owner of its trade name, and the profits to be derived therefrom, should not be interfered with on appeal. Idington J. dissenting on the ground that the evidence did not justify such finding.\nIn an action asking for an injunction to restrain the defendant from passing off its cards for those of the plaintiff.\nHeld, that though there is no evidence of actual passing off by the defendant the injunction should be granted if the defendant has offered for sale cards which could be passed off for those of the plaintiff, and there is sufficient evidence of an intention to do so.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s relief in such case would be a judgment for nominal damages with an inquiry at its own risk if it claimed to be entitled to substantial damages. A.G. Spalding Bros. v. A.G. Gamage Co. (113 L.T. 198) fol.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (39 Ont. L.R. 249); 34 D.L.R. 745), reversed in part and that of the trial judge (37 Ont. L.R. 85; 31 D.L.R. 596) restored in part.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], varying the judgment at the trial[2], in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe material facts are sufficiently indicated in the above head-note. D.L. McCarthy K.C. and Britton Osler for the appellant.\nMoss K.C. and Heighington for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014In regard to the claim herein made, and so far as founded upon mere passing off, the appellant obtains by the judgment in question herein all it is entitled to on the evidence presented for our consideration, and, I incline to think, a little more.\nThere is not, in my view of the evidence, enough therein to maintain a case merely of passing off, as defined and applied in such recent cases as A.G. Spalding Bros. v. A.W. Gamage[3]; Horlick\u2019s Malted Milk Co. v. Summerskill[4]; Universal Winding Co. v. George Hathersley & Sons[5]; Singer Mfg. Co. v. Loog[6]; Standard Ideal Co. v. Standard Sanitary Manufacturing Co.[7], at page 86.\nI am unable to agree with the learned trial judge that there was evidence of a conspiracy such as he finds between respondent and his employers. Indeed, the use, by the Goodall Company, as evidenced by their catalogue, 1898-1899, of the pictorial representation of a bicycle design on one of their cards, five years before the respondent entered their employment, seems destructive of the basis of such finding and none the less when we are assured by appellant\u2019s counsel that the production of that catalogue is the result of industrious search on the part of appellant.\nThere is indeed evidence of a somewhat earlier use by Goodall & Co. of the pictorial design of a bicycle. Like much else in this case the inquiry suggested by these facts does not seem to have been prosecuted. It may be, as suggested by counsel for respondent, his misfortune arising from war conditions rather than his fault. Be that as it may we are limited to what is before us.\nAgain I am unable to accept the theory put forward in argument that by reason of the mere word \u201cbicycle\u201d having been appropriated as a trade mark by appellant, the respondent was debarred thereby from the use of any design into which entered the pictorial representation of a bicycle or any part thereof, or of either coupled with a rider thereon, or anything else to attract the eye.\nIt is the right of every one of His Majesty\u2019s subjects to decorate his goods with any symbol he pleases, so long as that symbol has not become, by use or by virtue of registration, the individual property of another. It is equally his right to use language descriptive thereof so long as deception is not intended or likely to arise therefrom.\nYet it is mainly by disregard of these rights that the case for appellant has been built up; and largely by a confusing mass of evidence, much of it by leading witnesses who evidently had no correct appreciation of the matters they were talking about. In many parts of their evidence they confuse the design on the card with the trade mark which they seek to establish.\nNevertheless if we could properly find as a fundamental fact that there was a conspiracy of the kind claimed to have existed, then, even such unsatisfactory evidence might be made more or less properly serviceable to prove the actual execution of the purpose of such a conspiracy. I admit that from circumstances attendant upon the execution, or even attempted execution, of an unlawful purpose, we may occasionally be able to infer the existence of a conspiracy.\nBut here I can find nothing sufficiently substantial in the respondent\u2019s acts and the circumstances relied upon to demonstrate either the existence of such a conspiracy or a course of conduct which can only be attributable to the purpose of illegally depriving appellant by means of deception of that property it had in the goodwill or prosperity of its business, or whatever the legal right in question may be.\nNor can I find in the evidence that degree of probability of injury having been, or at the institution of this action, being, suffered by the appellant, from anything done by the respondent, which is necessary in order to maintain the action for a passing off, when there is not a vestige of direct evidence on the point.\nThere would not, in my opinion, have been the slightest chance of any wholesale dealer, or retailer buying from him, being deceived by reason of all that which is put forward in this case, and alleged to be a means of deception, into buying the Goodall cards instead of the appellants\u2019.\nAnd those buying from the retail dealer cards for use are not of the stupid variety of mankind whose eyes, when cast upon a card, are likely to be readily misled.\nIn so far, therefore, as this case rests upon a passing off, as claimed, I think it should have been dismissed.\nIn regard to the claim by appellant for an infringement of its trade marks, which are but an artificial means, as it were, for the protection of the rights which are liable to be invaded by a passing off, the exact nature in law of what such a trade mark is must be correctly appreciated before we proceed to consider the proof of infringement.\nIt may be still held in a passing-off action (as I have assumed for that part of this case) to have a meaning and effective force independently of that assigned it in our \u201cTrade Mark and Design Act\u201d but in light of section 20 thereof, which reads as follows:\u2014\n20. No person shall institute any proceeding to prevent the infringement of any trade mark, unless such trade mark is registered in pursuance of this Act,\nI think all the appellant can complain of herein, resting alone upon its claims for infringement of its trade marks, must fall within the meaning of Part I. of said Act.\nIn expressing my assumption that for the purposes of this case I have considered the trade mark as if possibly an effective force, had there been anything coupled therewith to make out a case of passing off, I must not be taken as having formed a decided opinion. The imperative language of prohibition in the section just quoted may, in a passing-off case, some day be argued as depriving a plaintiff, or as enough to deprive him, of any support to be derived from a trade mark, unless it had been registered in course of what is alleged in the case.\nOn the principle that a man cannot do indirectly what he is forbidden to do directly, why should he get the benefit of an unregistered trade mark?\nSection 4 defines and differentiates \u201cgeneral\u201d from \u201cspecific\u201d trade marks.\nAll those in question herein are of the latter class, which is defined as follows:\u2014\n(b) \u201cSpecific trade mark\u201d means a trade mark used in connection with the sale of a class merchandise of a particular description.\nThen follows section 5 (which has a marginal note \u201cWhat shall be deemed to be a trade mark\u201d) and reads as follows:\u2014 5. All marks, names, labels, brands, packages or other business devices, which are adopted for use by any person in his trade, business, occupation, or calling, for the purpose of distinguishing any manufacture, product or article of any description manufactured, produced, compounded, packed or offered for sale by him, applied in any manner whatever either to such manufacture, product or article, or to any package, parcel, case, box or other vessel or receptacle of any description whatsoever containing the same, shall, for the purposes of this Act, be considered and known as trade marks.\nSection 19 of the Act reads as follows:\u2014\n19. An action or suit may be maintained by any proprietor of a trade-mark against any person who uses the registered trade mark of such proprietor, or any fraudulent imitation thereof, or who sells any article bearing such trade mark or any imitation thereof, or contained in any package of such proprietor or purporting to be his, contrary to the provisions of this Act.\nWe are confined by virtue of Part 1 of the Act, and especially by these two sections, to an enforcement only of the rights which may be rested upon a correct interpretation and construction of the language therein.\nThe question raised herein must, therefore, be whether or not the respondent has in fact used in the manner indicated in the said section 19, any of the appellant\u2019s registered trade marks, or any \u201cfraudulent imitations\u201d thereof.\nI observe the change in the language in the first part of the section dealing with the use of the mark, to that in the second part dealing with him who sells any article bearing such trade mark, or any imitation thereof.\nI incline to hold that the meaning of the word \u201cimitation\u201d in any case resting upon either branch of the section must be a \u201cfraudulent imitation.\u201d\nThe registration by appellant of the word \u201cbicycle\u201d took place on the 17th day of July, 1906, and that seems to be the most important of the four trade marks in question, if we take the attention devoted to it in the case as a measure of its relative importance. Now it is only the use of that word itself by respondent in the like manner to that which section 5 indicated to be the measure of appellant\u2019s right, that can be complained of as an infringement.\nAnd, by the express terms of section 5, it must be a use falling within the words,\nfor the purpose of distinguishing any manufacture, etc. * * * manufactured * * * applied in any manner whatever either to such manufacture, etc., * * * or to any package, parcel, case, etc., * * * of any description whatsoever containing the same,\nthat can be the basis of the right of action given in section 19.\nI do not think these words can be stretched to cover the use of the word \u201cbicycle\u201d in an advertisement as alone sufficient to found an action upon.\nMuch less can they be held to cover any pictorial representation of a bicycle or of any part thereof.\nEliminate these two grounds of alleged offence and I find nothing in what respondent has done since the registration by appellant of the word \u201cbicycle\u201d which can fall within the meaning of the words in section 5 of the Act.\nIt is only by a confusing use of the word \u201cbicycle\u201d so as to make it cover any and every sentence in which that word can be found and thus extend the meaning of the trade mark beyond its limitations that the appellant can hope to succeed on this ground of complaint relative to the word \u201cbicycle.\u201d\nAs to the objection taken by appellant founded upon the use of pictorial representation of a bicycle or any part thereof as an equivalent of the word, its own acts of registration furnish a complete answer by way of argument.\nBefore registering \u201cbicycle\u201d as a word, it had registered same day a representation of a bicycle and a rider thereon, and followed both by another pictorial representation of a bicycle and much else.\nIf the single word \u201cbicycle\u201d should be applied to cover all sought for it to cover herein, such a proceeding must have been useless.\nTrue these trade marks are alleged in evidence and argument to be respectively applicable to different grades of cards. Assuming that to be so and possible within the meaning of the Act I imagine there should be something on record to distinguish what is intended to be covered.\nThere does not seem to be anything more than an intended use in the sale of playing cards indicated in the applications for these several trade marks in question. I doubt much if that is a compliance with the Act and fulfils the purpose thereof, but in my present view I need not follow that suggestion.\nAs to the other trade marks in question I can find no actual imitation thereof much less a fraudulent imitation. Indeed the Goodall Company, as already indicated, in dealing with the other phase of this complicated case, had been using for seven or eight years before these registrations cards having its own pictorial designs thereon.\nBefore parting with this case I may say that during the argument I had a decided impression that Mr. Moss\u2019s objection that a design on the back of a card could not properly be registered as a trade mark was unfounded. Much reading of evidence herein which exhibits the mind of those engaged in the manufacture of cards, and a further consideration of the Act, led me to doubt the propriety of such registrations.\nI need not say any more in view of the conclusions I have reached and expressed. I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs here and below; the cross appeal allowed and action dismissed with costs, but as there were no costs by reason of a cross-appeal as such\u2014as sometimes is found to exist\u2014this should mean only one set of costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014My subsequent study of this case has confirmed the impression left on my mind by the argument that the findings of the learned trial judge, most of them confirmed in the Appellate Division, cannot be disturbed. Where the Appellate Division has interfered the evidence and the reasonable inferences from it, in my opinion, so far support the trial judge\u2019s conclusions of fact that they should be restored. He held, upon facts which, if they did not compel, at least warranted, such a finding that\nthe proper inference from all the evidence is that Hurst and the Goodalls conspired together to defraud the plaintiff of its trade name and of the profits legitimately its, as the result of its advertising and enterprise,\nI am not inclined to differ from the learned judge who saw the witnesses on the question whether the defendant was an honest man or not, and where there is a finding such as we are here confronted with I am little disposed to make nice refinements or subtle distinctions in order to cut down what has seemed to an experienced trial judge to be necessary for the protection of the holder of a trade mark. Perry & Co. v. Hessin[8], at pages 527-8, 532.\nThe only question on which I think there is room for any doubt is whether the plaintiffs did not adopt the word \u201cbicycle\u201d as a grade, quality or style mark rather than as a trade mark\u2014(U.S. Playing Card Co. v. Clark[9]). If this question be open under our statute (R.S.C., ch. 71, secs. 5 and 13 (2) and 19), I think the better conclusion is that the finding of the trial judge in favour of the trade mark, affirmed in appeal, should not upon the evidence before us be disturbed.\nThe amendment to the 4th paragraph of the judgment made by the Appellate Division, however, is probably quite proper. The infringement therein dealt with would seem to have been of the specific trade mark mentioned by Mr. Justice Hodgins rather than of the several trade marks set out in paragraph 5 of the judgment of the trial court. Moreover, the judgment, as varied by the Appellate Division in this respect, seems to afford full protection to the plaintiffs.\nBut I cannot say the same of the amendments made to paragraphs 1, 5 and 7. These would seem to open the door to use of the word \u201cbicycle\u201d (for instances in the phrase \u201cBicycle Series\u201d as used by Goodalls, the word \u201cBicycle\u201d being in large letters on one line and the word \u201cSeries\u201d in smaller letters on the next line), quite inconsistent with the measure of protection necessary to insure to the plaintiffs the full benefit and enjoyment of their trade mark for that word. In my opinion the declaration and injunction granted by the trial judge were not too wide for that purpose (Singer Manufacturing Co. v. Loog[10]; Apollinaris Co. v. Norrish[11], and should be restored.\nThere remain the questions as to passing off and the assessment of damages.\nIt is common ground that no instance of passing off has been shewn. But in the opinion of the learned trial judge intention to pass off was abundantly proved and all means necessary to facilitate passing off were provided. These circumstances, in his view, made it unnecessary for the plaintiffs to shew that the opportunity thus afforded had been actually taken advantage of. In the Appellate Division it was thought on the other hand that the presence of the manufacturer\u2019s name on cards (the ace of spades), tuck cases and cartons would so probably preclude even retail customers being taken in that evidence of actual passing off was essential and that the plaintiffs should fail on this branch of the case because they had not established \u201ca reasonable probability of deception.\u201d In this connection the evidence of Donald Bain, a leading retail stationer in Toronto, is important:\nQ.\u2014Do you remember whether any card of Goodall\u2019s during the time you were in business had any bicycle design on it or anything of that kind? A.\u2014Latterly they brought out a card with a bicycle design, more after the design of the American card, to take its place.\nQ.\u2014Would you say when that was? A.\u2014I would not like to say the year.\nHis Lordship:\u2014About how many years ago? A.\u2014Of course, that is about fifteen years ago.\nMr. McCarthy:\u2014About fifteen years ago they brought out\u2014do you know how they graded that card\u2014what they called it? A.\u2014I think they called it, if I remember rightly, the \u201cBicycle\u201d card, too.\nQ.\u2014Then what was the result as far as the trade was concerned, with regard to using the word \u201cBicycle\u201d when they brought that out? A.\u2014There was a good many of their cards sold, if you were a smart enough clerk, you could sell them in place of the American cards.\nQ.\u2014If you were a smart enough clerk, you could sell them instead of the American card\u2014in the trade what was meant by the \u201cBicycle\u201d card after Goodall brought out his? A.\u2014It was an infringement.\nWhile it would, no doubt, have been more satisfactory had there been evidence by several men engaged in the business similar to that given by Mr. Bain, and, better still, if actual passing off had been proved, I incline to accept Mr. Justice Middleton\u2019s view that enough was shewn to establish a reasonable probability of deception, which would suffice to sustain his judgment. A.G. Spalding v. Gamage[12], at pages 199, 203; Saxlehner v. Apollinaris Co.[13]; Iron\u2011Ox Remedy Co. v. Co-operative Wholesale Society[14]; Liebig\u2019s Extract of Meat Co. v. The Chemists Co\u2011operative Society[15]; Claudius Ash Sons & Co. v. Invicta Mfg. Co.[16], at pages 475, 476; Albion Motor Car Co. v. Albion Carriage & Motor Body Works[17].\nAs to the damages, with great respect, the fixing of them at $250 would seem to have been purely conjectural and arbitrary. It is true that the defendant\u2019s interests were in a measure protected by the offer of a reference at his own risk as to costs\u2014a provision of which its omission from the formal judgment indicates that he declined to avail himself. But although the proof of infringement and the establishment of a case of passing off entitle the appellants to nominal damages, and the probability that actual damages were sustained entitles them to inquiry at their own risk, that, I think, is the full measure of relief that should be accorded. A.G. Spalding Bros. v. A.W. Gamage, Ltd.[18], at page 199. The formal judgment of the Appellate Division directing a reference would seem to indicate that the appellants had accepted the provision made by Mr. Justice Hodgins for an inquiry, should they desire it, with a reservation of costs. The case of Provident Chemical Works v. Canada Chemical Manufacturing Co.[19], cited by the learned judge, is scarcely in point, however, because, as Mr. Justice Moss points out, it there\nappear(ed) from the evidence that no purchaser had been misled into buying the defendants\u2019 product instead of the plaintiff\u2019s.\nHere this negative has not been established.\nWith the modifications indicated I would restore the judgment of the trial judge. The appellant should have its costs of the appeal to this court and the cross-appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Appellate Division of Ontario varying a judgment of the Supreme Court rendered by Mr. Justice Middleton.\nThe action had been brought to restrain certain alleged infringements by the respondent of the trade marks claimed by the appellant with respect to playing cards and to restrain the respondent from passing off the respondent\u2019s playing cards as cards of the plaintiff. These trade marks consisted of the word Bicycle applied to playing cards and in three designs called respectively, Safety, Expert and Acorn, on which the bicycle was a characteristic feature.\nMr. Justice Middleton held that those trade marks had been infringed upon and the injunction prayed for was maintained.\nThe Appellate Division confirmed the injunction as to passing off and as to the trade marks, Safety, Expert and Acorn. As to the trade mark \u201cBicycle,\u201d the Appellate Division varied the judgment by deciding that the cards bearing a design representing a bicycle were not an infringement of the patent and that the use also of the words Bicycle Series did not constitute an infringement; but that the defendants should be retrained from using the word bicycle on tucks and cartons and should use the words bicycle cards generally. The nominal damages which had been granted by Mr. Justice Middleton were set aside by the Appellate Division. The plaintiff appeals to this court from the judgment of the Appellate Division and, on the other hand, the respondent cross-appeals and, therefore, all the questions which had been raised by the pleadings are now in issue before this court. The evidence shews that in 1885 the appellant company was manufacturing four grades of playing cards which were known respectively as Tigers, Tourist, Army and Navy, and Congress. Those cards were of different prices, qualities and finish, two of those grades being expensive cards and two of a cheaper kind.\nIt was found advisable, in order to satisfy the demand in the trade for a playing card of another grade lying intermediate between the expensive and the cheap grade, to create a fifth grade. A name had to be given to that card; and, as at that time the use of the bicycle was becoming very popular, they thought of giving the name of Bicycle to that grade; and, as the requirements of the trade demanded, different designs of bicycles were used on the back of the cards; and in that way the Acorn, the Expert and the Safety were manufactured and put on the market. Some other designs of the bicycle idea were also put on the market; some were successful and were maintained, like the Expert, the Safety and the Acorn; some others were less successful; and in 1906 trade marks were applied for and obtained.\nAbout the time those designs were registered as trade marks another trade mark was obtained by the appellants for the word bicycle. It appears that large sums of money were spent by the appellant company to advertise their cards, and particularly the bicycle card. The result was that those bicycle cards were in great demand on the Canadian market and also in the United States, where, in all probability, the appellant company were the largest manufacturers.\nIn Canada one or two companies manufactured some playing cards; but it does not appear by the evidence that it was done on an extensive scale. The sales of playing cards appear, on the contrary, to be divided on the Canadian market between the appellant company and the large English firm of Charles Goodall & Co.\nHurst, the respondent, was a traveller for a wholesale stationery firm of Toronto; and, as such, was selling playing cards of the appellant company and of the Charles Goodall Company, and he was thoroughly familiar with the playing card trade in Canada. In 1901 he solicited from Charles Goodall & Co. the Canadian agency for the sale of their cards; and, having obtained that agency, he devoted himself entirely to it.\nIt appears that before that date the Goodall firm had in some cases also used the word \u201cbicycle\u201d in connection with their playing cards; but it was done in a very quiet way and the Canadian trade did not seem affected at all by it; but after Hurst became their sole Canadian agent their hesitation in that respect seemed to cease and they began to use extensively the word \u201cbicycle\u201d in connection with their cards, called the \u201cViceroys\u201d and the \u201cImperial Club.\u201d Their sample books began to display in a conspicuous way the word \u201cbicycle.\u201d It became pretty clear that the use of this word either by Goodall or by Hurst interfered with the trade of the appellant company; and the present action was instituted to restrain Hurst in connection with his playing cards.\nIt is contended that playing cards are not a proper subject matter of trade mark registration. There is absolutely nothing in the statute which prevents the word \u201cbicycle\u201d or the designs mentioned in those trade marks from being the subject of a trade mark. It cannot be claimed that the word was descriptive of the article to which it was applied. It was a fancy word which certainly could be used in connection with the playing cards. The respondent himself admits that the term \u201cbicycle\u201d used in connection with the playing card trade had a definite meaning as referring to the manufacture by the appellants.\nOur statute states, (ch. 71, sec. 5), that all marks, names, labels, packages or devices which are adopted for use by any person in his trade for the purpose of distinguishing any goods manufactured by him be considered and known as trade marks. The word \u201cbicycle\u201d and the design in question had been in use for a great number of years by the appellant company. They were known in the trade as such and I have no doubt that they could be made the subject of a trade mark.\nOn that ground the trial judge and the Court of Appeal express the same view in which I concur.\nIf the Goodall Company had used, previous to the registration, the word \u201cbicycle,\u201d it could not have affected the rights of the plaintiff company which had been using this description of goods for a great number of years and had established a trade by which those cards came to be known as bicycle cards. I am unable to agree with the Appellate Division in its variation of the decision of the trial judge. If the word \u201cbicycle\u201d has become known in the trade as connected with the goods of the appellant company, it seems to me that the word used in some way or other by some competitive firm would be illegal. Whether the respondent would claim the Goodall cards to be part of the Bicycle Series or whether designs would be put on the back of those cards representing a bicycle, I think that either would constitute an infringement upon the trade mark of the appellant company.

By clause six of the contract D. had the right to sell said lots, remitting to the company half of every payment by a sub-purchaser until the whole price of his purchase was paid and the balance due on any sale when a deed was demanded by the sub-purchaser; the company to have the right, each month, to examine D.\u2019s books. By clause nine, if D. did not sell fifty lots every six months from December 1st, 1914, the company could cancel the agreement and then neither party would have any recourse against the other except that D. would be liable for the balance due on any of his sales for which a deed was demanded. In the six months ending 31st May, 1916, D. did not sell fifty lots. On 4th July the company wrote him demanding payment of arrears due on sales and threatening to cancel if adjustment was not made by the 15th. On 5th July they wrote saying that by D.\u2019s statement for June, which included sales made in that month, $53 should be added to the amount demanded. On 19th July they gave notice of cancellation.\nHeld, Davies C.J. and Brodeur J. dissenting, that the notice of cancellation was invalid.\nPer Idington and Mignault JJ., Davies C.J. and Brodeur J. contra that the company, by demanding in July payment of moneys due knowing that a part of the same was for sales made in June, had elected not to cancel the agreement for default in the six months ending 31st May:\nPer Anglin J. The company having in July intentionally demanded payment of monies received in June in the exercise of their rights under clause six, which rights could be exercised only while the contract was in force, that unequivocal act was an election to recognize it as still subsisting which precluded cancellation for default on May 31st. APPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario affirming the judgment at the trial by which the action was dismissed.\nThe facts are fully stated in the above head-note.\nC.C. Robinson and Cohen for the appellant.\nA.C. MacMaster for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014This was an appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of Ontario dismissing an appeal from the judgment of the trial judge which dismissed plaintiff\u2019s action and directed judgment to be entered on defendant\u2019s counterclaim for $400.\nThe only point upon which I entertained any doubt as to the correctness of the judgment appealed from arose out of the contention by Mr. Robinson for the appellant that there had been an election on the part of the defendant company which destroyed the defendant company\u2019s right of cancellation of the agreement made by them with plaintiff for the sale of certain lands to him by the company, to be resold by him to purchasers on the terms and conditions in the agreement specified.\nThe right to cancel the agreement for default on the part of the plaintiff in reselling a stipulated number of the lots sold to him by the company defendant accrued on the 31st May, 1916. No immediate action was taken by the company regarding cancellation, but at the beginning of July the president of the company made an inspection of the plaintiff\u2019s books at Niagara Falls, and on the 4th July wrote plaintiff a letter stating the result of such inspection and demanding payment in accordance with the agreement of the instalments of purchase moneys which had been received by the plaintiff from the sub-purchasers and intimating that if a \u201csatisfactory adjustment\u201d was not made with the company by the 15th of the month they would avail themselves of their right of cancellation of the agreement. On the following day, the 5th July, the president of the company again wrote plaintiff saying he had received from the Niagara Falls office a statement for the month of June and found that according to that statement $53 had to be added to the total amount given in his letter of the previous day as due to the company by the plaintiff.\nThe letter does not state, and there is no evidence shewing, whether $53 which had been received in the month of June were on account of sales made in June or previously.\nThe contention is now made that this demand made after the date when the company became entitled to cancel (31st May) constituted an election not to cancel I cannot agree with that. The company had notified the plaintiff on the 4th that they would give him till the 15th to adjust accounts with them and that failure on his part to do so would result in their then cancelling the agreement. That was a reasonable concession, and though accompanied with a demand for payment of the amount which the president\u2019s inspection and the Niagara Falls statements shewed as being due to them from plaintiff, that demand in no way could be construed as an election not to cancel. The formal cancellation was made as threatened on the 19th, four days after the date fixed, and I am quite unable to see how the previous demands of the 4th and 5th July can be construed as an election not to cancel or as in any way affecting their right to cancel. Such right to cancel was one dependent entirely upon plaintiff\u2019s failure to sell a stipulated number of lots. It had no reference to the non-payment of moneys he might have received on the lots he did sell, and plaintiff\u2019s letters expressly stated that the right of cancellation would be exercised if a satisfactory adjustment of the balance due was not made.\nThe formal cancellation, the plaintiff having failed to adjust his accounts with the company, was, in pursuance of the notice they had given him, made on the 19th. It took effect then and did not relate back or have any reference to default on plaintiff\u2019s part in paying over moneys he had received. No such action in demanding payment of the moneys can be construed as an election to continue the agreement and destroy the company\u2019s express right of cancellation.\nUnder these circumstances I am of opinion that Mr. Robinson\u2019s able argument as to election arising out of the demand for payment of the moneys due the company cannot be accepted, nor can the defendant company\u2019s express right of cancellation arising out of failure on plaintiff\u2019s part to sell a stipulated number of lots within a given time, be affected.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant entered into an agreement, dated 6th November, 1914, to purchase from respondent, the Western Realty Limited, at $65 a lot, a little over four hundred lots in a subdivision known as Lundy Park, in the Township of Stamford, of which said respondent was the owner subject to a mortgage to respondent Davidson and one Huntler who were parties to the agreement. It was a speculative venture based on the expectation that the purchaser would resell said lots at the rate of at least fifty each six months after said date. The appellant bound himself to expend within the first six months from said date, $500 of his own money for advertising and expenses in connection with the said resales and to produce proof thereof to said company.\nThe company bound itself to spend $500 in other ways preparatory to and for the purpose of promoting such resales, and also to pay taxes on the whole up to and inclusive of the year 1917.\nThe appellant was not only to have the right to resell to sub-purchasers any or all of said lots, but also to have a conveyance made to any of such sub-purchasers freed from said mortgage so soon as $90 a lot paid said company for any lots in a specified district, and for the rest at. the rate of $65 a lot until the total price owing the company was paid.\nThe company was not to get interest on any part of the price until after three years from said date.\nThe appellant was to get the first $15 a lot out of the purchase moneys got on his resales, and the company the next $15 a lot thereout, and thenceforward the balance to be divided as specified in the agreement.\nTo secure due observance of the foregoing terms and others I am about to set forth, the company had expressly given it a right to examine and check the books\nand accounts and agreements of the appellant once a month in order to verify the amount payable by the\nappellant to the company.\nIn fact, accounts were rendered to facilitate this.\nThe appellant engaged respondent Bettel to assist him in carrying out the scheme of resale as designed and he was in charge of said business until the events I am about to advert to. The agreement contained the following clause:\u2014\n9. If the Party of the Second Part does not sell at least fifty Lots of the said Lots during the six months beginning with the 1st of December, 1914, or if commencing with the month of June, 1915, the Party of the Second Part does not sell at least fifty of the said Lots during each and every succeeding six months\u2019 period thereafter until the whole of the said Lots are sold by the Party of the Second Part, the Company has the right to cancel this agreement forthwith by notice in writing addressed to the Party of the Second Part at Number 70 Victoria Street, in the City of Toronto. And the Party of the Second Part has the right at any time after the expiration of six months from the date hereof to cancel this agreement by notice in writing to the Company addressed to the Company, c\/o Hunter & Hunter, Temple Building, Toronto. Upon the termination of this agreement none of the parties hereto shall have any recourse against the other or others of them, except that the Company shall be entitled to collect from the Party of the Second Part at the time any sub-purchaser is entitled to and demands a conveyance and discharge of the Lot or Lots purchased by him the balance of the amount necessary to discharge the said Lots according to the terms of discharge and conveyance set forth in paragraph Number 7 hereof.\nThe appellant was so successful that during the first year and a half he had sold a total of over a hundred and fifty lots, but unfortunately fell short a few less than fifty in the last six months of that period, which expired on the 31st May, 1916, though taking the whole period he made that average of fifty lots per each six months.\nHe had entered on the fourth six-monthly term and made four sales in June, fell ill in July, and was in the hospital when complaint reached him from the company that he was falling behind. Despite his appeal for delay till he had recovered, the company served, on the 19th July, 1916, appellant with a notice claiming under, and by virtue of, the above quoted clause to terminate the agreement.\nThe respondents proceeded to try and get the fruits of appellant\u2019s labour and expenses by forcing or inducing sub-purchasers from him to surrender his agreements and respectively accept agreements from the company in substitution thereof. The company, and Davidson, who was its vice-president, took part in such proceedings and induced respondent Bettel to enter the employment of the company to conduct in the future the business in question.\nHence this action for restraining the respondents from asserting that the agreement has been terminated and pursuing such a course of conduct and for damages.\nThe objection is now made by counsel for the appellant that the notice served on the appellant was too late to be effective and, in any event, that the respondent company had, before such notice, by the unequivocal act of accepting and crediting appellant with proceeds of sales made in June, 1916, when the fourth six-monthly period had been entered upon, had elected in law to overlook the non-observance of the literal terms nominated in the bond, and hence could not so late as 19th July, 1916, rescind or terminate the agreement.\nI think the point is well taken and the notice void.\nI have no doubt of respondent company\u2019s knowledge of the fact of the sales in June. They had no right to accept a dollar of proceeds of any such sales affirming thereby the continuance of the contract, and then attempt to terminate it by such a notice as now in question.\nWhen we find that a successful effort to do so would deprive appellant of all he earned and would yet be entitled to receive out of the proceeds of his resales, which would amount to $8,000 or over, and for which the rigorous terms of this contract would deprive him of any recourse against respondent company, one cannot see how, as suggested below, this is a one-sided contract giving the advantage only to the appellant. It seems to me rather a case of diamond cut diamond.\nThe contract binds the respondent company to observe the rights of the appellant as against his sub-purchasers and all that is implied therein, even though he might have had no recourse against the company in the event of a successful termination under above quoted clause. With those rights it had no right to attempt to interfere.\nEach of the sub-purchasers was accountable to appellant and should have been amply protected in claiming from the company such conveyance as the agreement in question entitled them to.\nThe action is not, as the court below seemed to assume, brought for specific performance.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs throughout as against the company and Davidson, and the injunction granted as prayed for against all concerned, with nominal damages against Bettel.\nThere should be a reference to take accounts as prayed for if the parties cannot agree, and also to fix the damages done the appellant by the acts of the respondent company and Davidson, to be assessed separately as against each of the two lastly named parties if so desired by either.\nFurther directions should be reserved until the report of the referee.\nThe judgment entered for $400 against appellant should be set aside.\nThere was no agreement to return such money to the company.\nI think the utmost that can be said as to that is that in the ultimate accounting it might be chargeable against the appellant as intimated in the correspondence, and I would allow it to be set off in taking the accounts between the parties which seems to be a necessary result of this appeal.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The facts of this case sufficiently appear in the reports of it in the Supreme Court of Ontario[1].\nMr. Robinson\u2019s admirably lucid and concise argument in support of the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the attempted cancellation by the defendants of their agreement with him was ineffectual failed to convince me that default had not been made by his client which entitled the defendants, on the 1st June, 1916, or within a reasonable time thereafter, to exercise their option to cancel. I thought he also failed to establish the estoppel which he urged because of lack of evidence of any change of position by the plaintiff induced by the defendants\u2019 conduct. But he satisfied me that the letter of their president of the 5th July demanding payment of $53 shewn to be due to them by the plaintiff\u2019s statement of the June payment made by his sub\u2011purchasers, as an unequivocal act in affirmance of the continued existence of the agreement, amounted to an election not to exercise the right of cancellation which had accrued to them under its terms on the 1st of June.\nThe argument that there had been such an election by the letter of 5th July was based on two distinct grounds: (a) the demand of moneys payable in respect of sales made in June; (b) the demand under clause 6 of the agreement of moneys received by the plaintiff in June in respect of sales whenever made.\n(a) By knowingly claiming proceeds of sales made by the plaintiff in June, the defendants would have unequivocally recognized his right to act under the agreement notwithstanding his default during the period ending on the 31st May and would have precluded themselves from exercising their right to cancel the agreement for that default.\nMr. Robinson urged that the inference from the documents (the president\u2019s letter of 4th July shewing the result of his inspection of the plaintiff\u2019s books made on the 24th June, and the plaintiff\u2019s statement of June receipts, coupled with the admission of counsel that the McCully sales shewn in it had been made in June) that the defendants\u2019 president, when writing the letter of 5th July, had \u201ca conscious appreciation\u201d of the fact that the moneys thereby demanded included proceeds of sales made in June is irresistible. No doubt a powerful case is made in support of that inference. But, although the president was examined as a witness at the trial, he was not confronted with it. While it may be urged that, under the circumstances, the burden was on the defendants to shew that the letter of July 5th was written in ignorance of this vital fact, yet it the appellant intended to rely upon the inference that he now seeks to have drawn, not having pleaded it, it was his duty at least to have directed attention to it at the trial\u2014if not to have cross-examined Mr. Metcalfe in regard to it\u2014in order that an opportunity for explanation might be afforded. Not having done so, he should, in my opinion, not be allowed now to rest a claim of election upon that inference which might, had opportunity been afforded, have been shewn to be unwarranted.\nConfronted with this difficulty, Mr. Robinson contended that knowledge of the June sales was not essential\u2014that the right to elect to cancel rested solely on the December-May default, and that knowledge of it was indisputable and sufficed to make the letter of 5th July conclusive as an election. In support of this contention he relied on a distinction drawn by Mr. Ewart in his recent work on \u201cWaiver Distributed\u201d (pp. 75-6) between facts giving rise to the right to elect and facts calculated to influence the exercise of that right, and urged (again citing Mr. Ewart\u2019s book, pp. 84-88) that if the act relied on as constituting the election be unequivocal, the intention with which it is done is immaterial. Scarfe v. Jardine[2]. But we are here dealing not with what Mr. Ewart terms an \u201cinfluencing fact,\u201d but with a fact which is relied upon to give significance and character to the act set up as an election. It may be that even ignorance of such a fact cannot be invoked to negative an election which would be indubitable and incontrovertible had it been known. I desire to leave this an open question finding it unnecessary now to pass upon it because, in my opinion, the alternative ground on which Mr. Robinson rests his assertion of the election is unanswerable.\n(b) There can be no doubt that the demand for payment in the letter of the 5th July was made, and consciously and intentionally made, in the exercise of the defendants\u2019 rights under the 6th clause of the agreement. I think it is equally clear that those rights could be exercised only while the agreement was subsisting and in force. Upon cancellation entirely different rights would arise under the 9th clause. Instead of the plaintiff\u2019s obligation being from time to time to hand over to the defendant certain portions of payments made to him by sub-purchasers, as it was while the agreement was in force, upon cancellation he would have been obliged to make payment to the defendants only when a sub-purchaser should be entitled to a conveyance and then of \u201cthe balance of the amount necessary to discharge\u201d the lot or lots to be conveyed. If it was intended that any rights under clause 6 might be preserved after cancellation, not only is that intention not expressed, as it should have been, but the words of clause 9 express the contrary intention,\nupon cancellation none of the parties * * * shall have any recourse against the other or others of them except, etc.\nas above indicated.\nThe defendants were fully aware of the facts entitling them to cancel and of their right to elect to do so. They knew that the moneys demanded by their letter of July 5th were on account of June payments\u2014the fact which gave character and significance as an election to that demand for payment under clause 6. Their president made that demand deliberately. Having done\nan act which would be justifiable if he had elected one way (not to cancel) and would not be justifiable if he had elected the other way (to cancel)\u2014the fact of his having done that unequivocal act to the knowledge of the person concerned is an election. Per Lord Blackburn in Scarfe v. Jardine[3].\nOther authorities are cited in Ewart on \u201cWaiver Distributed\u201d loco cit.\nI am, for these reasons, of the opinion that the attempted cancellation was ineffectual and that the appellant is entitled to judgment declaring the acts of the respondents of which he complains unwarranted and illegal, for an accounting by them in respect of moneys received from his sub-purchasers and for damages sustained by him as a result of their wrongful interference with his rights under subsisting agreements with sub-purchasers and also with his right to continue the sale of lots until his agreement with them was duly terminated. The last item may involve only a negligible amount.\nIf any of his agreements with sub-purchaser are still in such a position that they can be enforced he is entitled to have them delivered up to him and to an injunction restraining interference with his enforcement of them.\nThere is nothing to sustain the defence of abandonment by the plaintiff.\nI should, perhaps, add that, if I had been of the opinion that the attempted cancellation was effectual, on the construction of clause 9 I should have held the appellant entitled to the like damages, accounting, etc., in respect of the agreements of sub-sale which were subsisting at the time it took place. There is no provision entitling the respondent company to deprive him of the benefit of these agreements.\nFor the reasons given in the Appellate Division I think the judgment for the respondents upon their counterclaim for $400 should not be disturbed.\nThe appellant is entitled to his costs throughout.\nBRODEUR J. (dissenting)\u2014One of the questions raised on this appeal is whether or not the respondent company could cancel the agreement of the 6th November, 1914.\nThat agreement provided for the sale to the appellant Diamond by the Western Realty Company of a subdivision known as Lundy Park for the price of $65 a lot. The purchaser was bound to sell at least fifty lots during the six months commencing with the month of June, 1915, and fifty lots during each and every succeeding six months until all the lots would be sold; and if he did not sell that number of lots during one of those six months\u2019 periods the vendor had the right to cancel the agreement.\nDuring the six months from December, 1915, to May, 1916, the purchaser sold only 14 lots, and on the 19th of July, 1916, the vendor cancelled the agreement.\nThe evidence shews that Diamond had intimated that he could not go on with the carrying out of his contract. He had left Ontario to go and reside in Detroit, and the few sales he had made in the six months\u2019 period above mentioned shewed that the sale of those building lots could not be successfully carried out.\nThe parties went into negotiations to put an end to the agreement of sale; but those negotiations fell through as to the terms on which the sub-purchasers should be dealt with and the money due by Diamond on his purchase price should be paid. Then the company had to exercise the right of cancellation.\nIt is claimed by the appellant that the company had no right to cancel the agreement because there had been a substantial performance of the contract.\nIt is true that during the two first six-months\u2019 periods Diamond sold a certain number of lots but most of those sales had been cancelled, likely for failure of payment on the part of sub\u2011purchasers. It is also in evidence that during the last period of six months Diamond sold only fourteen lots and was then far from carrying out the obligation which he undertook in the contract to sell during each of these six months\u2019 periods at least fifty lots.\nI am convinced that if Diamond had made to the company the remittance which he was bound to give under his contract out of each sale of lots which he had made, the company would not have exercised its right to cancel the agreement. But Diamond was in arrears in his payments, had practically left the province to go and reside in the United States, and had told the company that he was unable to meet his obligations.\nThere is no doubt that the terms stipulated were of the essence of the contract, as the purchaser had to pay by handing over to the company a part of what he would have received from his sub-purchasers.\nIt is contended also on the part of the appellant that the company had waived its right to cancel and had elected not to exercise that right.\nI am unable to find in the evidence any such waiver or any such election. It is true that the last six months\u2019 period expired on the 31st May, 1916, and that the cancellation was made on the 19th July of the same year; but negotiations were pending to bring about a settlement which would be satisfactory to both parties. The appellant should certainly not take advantage of those negotiations to say that there was on the part of the company waiver when this delay occurred just for the purpose of helping him to raise money which he had to pay to the respondent company.\nAs to the election which is alleged by the appellant, that contention is based upon six sales made in June which sales, according to the appellant, were known to the company. He relies in that respect on a statement of account handed over to the company for the June collections.\nIt is not clearly and conclusively shewn that the company in making a claim with regard to those payments knew that a small sum of money was coming from sales made after the 31st May, 1916. Of course, if the company had known that such sales had taken place after the 31st May, the situation might be different; but I am unable to find in the evidence the necessary element to shew that they possessed that knowledge. I am then of opinion that the company had the right to cancel the contract in question; and in that regard the appeal should be dismissed.\nBut another question comes up with regard to the right of the appellant concerning the contracts made with the sub-purchasers and the moneys paid by the latter. When the contract was cancelled the company obtained, through one of the respondents who was the clerk of Diamond, the agreement covering these subpurchasers and they started to collect the money due under those agreements or to make some new contracts with those sub-purchasers.\nThe provisions of the contract between Diamond and the Western Realty Company do not disclose very clearly what should be done with sub-purchasing agreements in case the contract would be cancelled. That right of cancellation was stipulated not only in favour of the vendor but also in favour of the purchaser. Diamond had himself the right, after three months, to cancel the agreement if he did not find it satisfactory. On the other hand, as I have already said, the company had the right to cancel, if the purchasers did not sell so many lots during each of the six months\u2019 periods.\nIt had been provided in the contract that Diamond had the right to sell any of the lots to sub\u2011purchasers and the money collected from those sub-purchasers was practically to be divided between Diamond and the company until the amount of $65 per lot would be paid; and it was stipulated that the amount in excess of $65 per lot should be applied upon the balance of the purchase money payable. Now the contract having been duly cancelled by the vendor, who has the right to collect the money from the sub-purchaser?\nI am of opinion that this money should be collected by Diamond. He is bound to hand over that money to the company until all the lots have been paid for; but if there was enough money due by those purchasers in order to cover the old purchase price which he owed to the company, then that balance would come to him.\nIn those circumstances, I think that the company had no right to interfere with those sub\u2011purchasers and that it should render an account to Diamond of the money which it had received from those sub-purchasers since the cancellation of the contract.\nThe appeal should be allowed to that extent, each party paying his own costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014I can entertain no doubt that, assuming the respondent had the right to cancel its agreement with the appellant under clause 9, for failure of the appellant to sell at least fifty lots during the six months\u2019 period ending on the 31st May, 1916, the respondent could not take possession of the contracts which the appellant had made with persons to whom he had sold lots, and give to the latter notice to pay to the respondent and not to the appellant amounts due the appellant under these contracts. Clause 9 of the agreement provided that:\u2014\nUpon the termination of this agreement none of the parties hereto shall have any recourse against the other or others of them, except that the company (the respondent) shall be entitled to collect from the Party of the Second Part (the appellant) at any time any sub-purchaser is entitled to and demands a conveyance and discharge of the lots or lot purchased by him the balance of the amount necessary to discharge the said lots according to the terms of discharge and conveyance set forth in paragraph number 7 hereof. In so far, therefore; as the respondent interfered with contracts made by the appellant with sub-purchasers\u2014and it did so interfere\u2014it was clearly-wrong and the appellant can demand to have these contracts delivered up to him and is entitled to an injunction to prevent the respondent from interfering with the sub-purchasers.\nThe question whether the respondent had effectually exercised its right of cancellation under clause 9 of of the agreement is not so free from doubt. I think that the letters of the president of the respondent company, written to the appellant on July 4th and July 5th, 1916, should be read together. It is noticeable that neither of these letters refer to the only ground upon which the respondent could cancel its contract with the appellant, i.e., the failure of the latter to sell, during the six months\u2019 period ending on the 31st May, 1916, at least fifty lots. On the contrary, the letter of the 4th July mentions the obligation assumed by the appellant under clause 6 to make remittances to the respondent on sales made by him, and alleges that the appellant is indebted in the sum of $370 for lots sold by him, besides a claim for taxes and amounts received on account of lots resold. It intimates that unless a satisfactory adjustment be made by the 15th July, the respondent will avail itself of its right of cancellation. And the president\u2019s letter of the 5th July, based on the appellant\u2019s June statement, claims $53 in addition. The June statement mentioned new sales made by the appellant in June, 1916, the respondent\u2019s counsel in the court below admitting four new sales in June.\nReading, therefore, together the letters of July 4th and 5th, the respondent is in the position that it demanded from the appellant payment of all moneys received by him to June 30th, including payments received by him on at least four sales of lots made by him in June, and notified him that if he did not make this payment, the contract would be cancelled.\nIt is obvious that, under the agreement, the right of cancellation could not be exercised by reason of the appellant\u2019s failure to make remittances to the respondent of the portion of the moneys due to it out of payments received by him from sub-purchasers. So when the respondent now seeks to justify its notice of cancellation of the 19th July on the ground that the appellant had not made the required number of sales in the six months\u2019 period ending the 31st May, 1916\u2014the notice of cancellation of the 19th July made no such complaint\u2014it is, in my opinion, prevented from so doing because, by demanding payments on sales made in June by the appellant and claiming benefit thereunder, it had acquiesced in the continuation of the agreement after the 31st May, notwithstanding that the appellant had not made the required number of sales during the six months\u2019 period ending on that date.\nThe complaint now made by the respondent that the appellant had failed to make the required number of sales seems to me to be an afterthought, probably suggested by counsel, but I cannot think that it was present in the president\u2019s mind when he wrote the letters of July 4th and 5th. It does not appear in the correspondence that the respondent ever made such a complaint to the appellant. What seems evident is that the respondent assumed that if the appellant did not make the remittances demanded within the delay specified in the letter of the 4th July, it could on that ground cancel the contract. Unfortunately for its notice of cancellation, it had been preceded by a demand of payment of moneys received on account of June sales, and in view of this fact, I think that the respondent could not, on the 19th July, cancel the contract because the appellant had not made at least fifty sales between the 1st December, 1915, and the 31st May, 1916.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be allowed with costs, but I would not disturb the judgment of the trial court on the counterclaim of the respondent.\nAppeal allowed in part with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Abraham Cohen.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Hunter & Hunter.\n[1] 12 Ont.

V. c. 7, s. 3.\nAn appeal from the court of final resort in any province except Quebec in a case of prohibition under sec. 39 (c) of the \"Supreme Court Act\" will not lie unless the case comes within some of the provisions of sec. 48 as amended by 8 & 9 Geo. V. ch. 7, sec. 3.\nSec. 39 (c) allows an appeal from the judgment in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of prohibition \"not arising out of a criminal charge.\"\nHeld, per Davies C.J. and Anglin and Mignault JJ. that application for a writ of prohibition to restrain a magistrate from proceeding on a prosecution for violating the provisions of the \"Nova Scotia Temperance Act\" arises out of a criminal charge and no appeal lies from the judgment thereon.\nPer Mignault J. in Chambers.\u2014An order to stay proceedings on a judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada for purposes of a proposed appeal to the Privy Council will not be granted in a case in which the Court has determined that it is without jurisdiction to hear the appeal.\nAPPEAL from an order of the Acting Registrar refusing to affirm the jurisdiction of the court and approve the security.\nThe reasons given by the Acting Registrar for refusing the order are the following:\u2014\nActing Registrar.\u2014\"Application before me as Acting Registrar to affirm jurisdiction and approve of bond filed as security for costs. The applicant, a licensed vendor of liquor in Halifax under the 'Nova Scotia Temperance Act,' was charged before a magistrate with unlawful selling of liquor contrary to the provisions of the Act. The charge was heard but judgment was stayed pending an application for a writ of prohibition to restrain the magistrate from convicting. The writ was refused and from such refusal the applicant seeks to appeal to this court.\n\"Two questions are raised affecting the right to appeal to this court. The 'Supreme Court Act,' section 39 (c), allows an appeal in a case of habeas corpus or prohibition not arising out of a criminal charge. The first question then is whether or not the charge in this case was a 'criminal charge' within the meaning of section 39 (c).\n\"This question came before the Supreme Court in the case of In re McNutt[1]. In that case the appellant, Mrs. McNutt, had applied for discharge by habeas corpus from imprisonment on conviction for an offence under the same Act as in this case, the 'Nova Scotia Temperance Act.' The case was heard by the six judges of the court. Three of them held that the application for the writ arose 'out of a criminal charge;' one held that it did not and one seriously doubted that it did; the remaining judge expressed no opinion on the point but quashed the appeal on another ground.\n\"Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, one of the three who held that it was criminal, is no longer a member of the court. If this case, then, should come before the present bench of judges the position would be that two of them are on record as holding that the charge was criminal, practically two that it was not, and two whose views are entirely unknown. I consider, therefore, that the question is at large and my personal opinion being in accord with that of Mr. Justice Duff, I would be prepared to affirm the jurisdiction so far as this first question is concerned.\n\"The second question is one of greater difficulty for the applicant. At the last session of Parliament, section 48 of the 'Supreme Court Act,' which had previously been confined to appeals from Ontario, was extended to cover appeals from all the provinces except Quebec. It is necessary, therefore, to decide whether or not the case before us is governed by that section.\n\"It is settled by authority that it is so governed. Not only has the court held, before the amendment, that an appeal in an Ontario case of mandamus must comply with the requirements of section 48 (Attorney-General v. Scully[2]), and also in the case of a municipal by-law (Town of Aurora v. Markham[3]), as to both of which the appeal is allowed by section 39, but it has lately held that an appeal in a case of prohibition from the Province of Quebec must comply with the requirements of section 46, the counterpart, for Quebec, of section 48. (Desormeaux v. Village of Ste. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se[4].\n\"As the case before me does not come within the terms of section 48 there is no appeal as of right, and the motion to affirm jurisdiction must be dismissed. No costs. If the jurisdiction was affirmed the bond filed is sufficient.\n\"C. H. Masters,\n\"Acting Registrar.\"\nThe applicant appeals from this decision to the Supreme Court. Power K.C. for the appellant.\nBethune for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014As to the meaning of the language \"not arising out of a criminal charge\" in sub-section (c) of section 39 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" I adhere to the opinion I expressed in In re McNutt[5].\nAnd as to the appellant's right of appeal to this court de piano as taken in this appeal and which right the appellant sought to have affirmed by the Assistant Registrar, I am of opinion that this officer was right in refusing to affirm our jurisdiction to hear the appeal.\nThat jurisdiction is defined and limited by section 48 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" and appellant failed to bring himself within its provisions, Aurora v. Markham[6]. Sections 37, 38 and 39 must be read and construed together with section 48 and subject to it.\nIn the present case there is no amount involved in the appeal or other ground which could possibly give a right of appeal under that section.\nIdington J.\u2014I do not think this appeal should be allowed inasmuch as the amendment of the \"Supreme Court Act\" contained in 8 & 9 Geo. V. ch. 7, seems to forbid it.\nAs to leave to appeal the application is too late for this court to grant and can only be given now by the court sought to be appealed from.\nAnglin J.\u2014I have seen no reason to change the view which I expressed in In re McNutt5, as to the construction of the phrase \"not arising out of a criminal charge\" in section 39 (c) of the \"Supreme Court Act.\" Section 48 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" made applicable by the legislation of 1918 to all the provinces other than Quebec, is, in my opinion, conclusive against a right of appeal de piano in this case. Sections 37, 38 and 39 are subject to section 48 just as they are subject, in Quebec appeals, to section 46. Desormeaux v. Ste. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se[7]; Bouchard v. Sorgius[8]. That would be so without the introductory words \"except as hereinafter otherwise provided'' found in each of these sections. But the presence of that phrase leaves no room for argument.\nIn Trusts and Guarantee Co. v. Rundle[9], very much relied upon by Mr. Power, section 48 was not and could not have been invoked, the amount involved in the appeal being over $1,000, viz., $1,068.27, expenditure allowed in the Surrogate Court and disallowed by the Court of Appeal, and $100 of the guardian's remuneration fixed by the Surrogate Court, likewise disallowed.\nThe appeal from the order of the Acting Registrar fails on both grounds and should be dismissed with costs.\nThe application for special leave to appeal is too late. Goodison Thresher Co. v. Township of McNab[10].\nBrodeur J \u2014This is a motion by way of appeal from an order of the Registrar declaring that the court has no jurisdiction to hear this case.\nThe court below refused a writ of prohibition in a prosecution against the appellant for selling liquor contrary to the \"Nova Scotia Temperance Act\" and he now wants to appeal to this court. One of the objections made to his right to appeal is that section 48 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" as amended in 1918, precludes him from entering this appeal.\nBy section 39 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" an appeal to the Supreme Court in cases of prohibition is given but that appeal is limited and controlled by section 48 of the same Act which declares that no appeal will lie unless the judgment a quo relates to title to real estate, affects the validity of a patent, puts in controversy a matter exceeding $1,000, or relates to an annuity.\nNone of these conditions are to be found in that judgment.\nApplying the decisions rendered by this court in Attorney-General v. Scully[11]; Desormeaux v. Ste. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se[12]; and in Bouchard v. Sorgius[13], I am strongly of the view that the appellant has no right to ask this court to adjudicate on his writ of prohibition.\nAnother ground urged against this appeal is that under section 39 the appeal lies in proceedings for a writ of prohibition \"not arising out of a criminal charge\" and that the writ of prohibition in this case has reference to a criminal charge.\nThe statute in violation of which the appellant has been prosecuted is a provincial statute; and in deciding the point raised we might curtail the legislative powers of the provinces without giving an opportunity to the provinces to be heard.\nIn view of the conclusions I have reached on the first point above mentioned, I do not see any reason for me to express my views upon the second point.\nThe appellant asks also in the alternative that he should be granted leave to appeal. It was decided in Goodison Thresher Co. v. McNab[14], that after the expiration of sixty days from the pronouncing of the judgment a quo this court is without jurisdiction to grant special leave.\nThe motion should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014Two questions arise under this appeal from the decision of the Acting Registrar refusing to affirm jurisdiction in favour of the appellant:\n1. Do the appellant's proceedings for a writ of prohibition arise out of a \"criminal charge?\"\n2. Assuming that this first question be answered in the negative, has the appellant a right of appeal to this court, in view of the provisions of section 48 of the \"Supreme Court Act?\"\nFirst question.\u2014In the case of In re McNutt[15], in which six judges sat, three judges, Fitzpatrick C.J. Davies and Anglin JJ. expressed the opinion that a trial and conviction for keeping liquor for sale contrary to the provisions of the same Act, the \"Nova Scotia Temperance Act,\" were proceedings on a \"criminal charge\" within the meaning of section 39 (c) of the \" Supreme Court Act.\" Mr. Justice Duff was of the opinion that the proceedings did not arise out of a \"criminal charge,\" within the meaning of that sub-section, and Mr. Justice Idington and Mr. Justice Brodeur expressed no opinion on this point. The learned Acting Registrar, therefore, considered the question as being an open one, although he rejected the motion of the appellant to affirm jurisdiction upon the second ground above referred to.\nUnder the circumstances, I think it is incumbent on me to express my opinion upon both these questions which were fully argued by the learned counsel for the appellant.\nIt is almost unnecessary to say that the jurisdiction of this court is statutory, that is to say, that it must appear in any case brought before this court that the statute properly construed confers jurisdiction, and if this is not shewn jurisdiction is negatived.\nThe \"Supreme Court Act\" refers several times to ''criminal charges\" and to \"criminal cases,\" and the answer to the question I am considering depends upon the construction to be placed upon these words. I will refer very briefly to some of the provisions of the Act.\nIn the first place, the introductory section 35 states that this court has \"civil and criminal jurisdiction\" within and throughout Canada.\nAs the words \"civil\" and \"criminal\" are here employed in contradistinction to each other, they must certainly be understood as being used lato sensu, and, therefore, \"criminal\" matters comprise all matters which can come under the general term according to the well-known test that\nthe proper definition of the word \"crime\" is an offence for which the law awards punishment. Per Littledale J. in Mann v. Owen[16], at p. 602.\nWhen, therefore, in the next section, section 36, we find the general right of appeal granted by section 35 restricted by the proviso that no appeal lies from a judgment\nin any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, certiorari or prohibition arising out of a criminal charge,\nthe ordinary rules of construction would give to the word \"criminal\" the same meaning as in section 35, and, therefore, I would say that it is here used in the wide sense, according to the test I have indicated above.\nSub-section (b) of section 36 further states, as a part of the same proviso, that\nthere shall be no appeal in a criminal case except as provided in the Criminal Code.\nThis is a reference to sec. 1024 of the Criminal Code by the terms of which the right of appeal is restricted to convictions for indictable offences affirmed on an appeal taken under sec. 1013 of the Code, to the Court of Appeal, where the latter court is not unanimous in affirming the conviction. Whatever restricted meaning, therefore, might be given to the words \"criminal case\" in sub-section (b) by reason of the reference to' the Criminal Code, cannot, in my opinion affect the construction of the words \"criminal charge\" as used in sub-section (a).\nComing then to the words \"criminal charge\" in sub-section (c) of section 39, where it is said that an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court\nfrom the judgment in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, certiorari or prohibition not arising out of a criminal charge,\nthere can be no doubt whatever that the words \"criminal charge\" must receive the same construction as in sub-section (a) of section 36, and, therefore, my opinion is that they are used in the wide sense as allowing an appeal in matters of prohibition merely when they arise out of \"civil\" as distinguished from. \"criminal\" proceedings.\nWe next find the words \"criminal case,\" already met with in sub-section (b) of section 36, in section 62 which says that\nevery judge of the court shall, except in matters arising out of any claim for extradition under any treaty, have concurrent jurisdiction with the court or judges of the several provinces for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment in any criminal case under any Act of the Parliament of Canada.\nIt is to be observed that the words \"criminal case,\" which otherwise would be of general application, are qualified here by the addition of the words\nunder any Act of the Parliament of Canada.\nIt would not appear to me that because we have an express qualification here, we should read that qualification into the previous sections where the expression \"criminal\" is used without any qualifying words. On the contrary, I find that when it was desired to qualify or restrict the generality of the term \"criminal,\" parliament has used apt words to express the qualification, and I know of no rule of construction that would authorize me to imply that qualification in cases where it is not expressed.\nIn section 67, sub-section 4, there is a provision that this section\u2014which governs the removal of cases from the provincial courts to the Supreme Court where the constitutionality of an Act of Parliament or of a legislature is in question\u2014\nshall apply only to cases of a civil nature.\nThe word \"civil\" is here used lato sensu and excludes anything that can come under the description of \"criminal\" matters, which seems to me to harmonize with the restriction expressed in sub-section (a) of section 36, and in sub-section (c) of section 39.\nThe only remaining provision of the \"Supreme Court Act\" where the word \"criminal' is used is section 75 with reference to security for costs which is not required, inter alia, as to appeals \"in criminal cases.\" These criminal cases are obviously those referred to in sub-section (b) of section 36, and in section 1024 of the Criminal Code. I would, therefore, conclude\u2014and I also rely on the reasoning of Fitzpatrick C.J. and of Davies and Anglin JJ. in the McNutt Case[17]\u2014that the words \"criminal charge\" in sub-section (a) of section 36, and in subsection (c) of section 39, are used in a wide and not a restricted sense. No question whatever as to the power to legislate with respect to criminal law under the \"British North America Act\" arises here, and no consideration of the respective powers of parliament and of the legislatures with regard to criminal or penal matters can be of any assistance in the construction of the sections of the \"Supreme Court Act\" to which I have referred and which undoubtedly, however wide may be their application, are intra vires of the Canadian Parliament.\nI, therefore, answer the first question in the affirmative, and consequently I hold that this court has no jurisdiction to pass on the appeal which the appellant seeks to bring before it, for the proceedings he has taken arise out of a criminal charge.\nSecond question. There can be absolutely no doubt, under the previous decisions of this court, that even assuming that I could answer question 1 in the negative, the appellant cannot appeal to this court inasmuch as his case does not come within the ambit of section 48. This section was amended in 1918 by 8 & 9 Geo. V., ch. 7, and now applies to all the provinces, with the exception of Quebec. It is the counterpart of section 46 with respect to Quebec appeals, and this court held in Desormeaux v. Ste. Th\u00e9r\u00e8se[18], and more recently in Montreal Abattoire, Limited v. City of Montreal (unreported, 14th November, 1918), that no appeal lies to the Supreme Court from a judgment of a court in the Province of Quebec in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of prohibition, unless the matter in controversy falls within some of the classes of cases provided for by section 46. Similarly an appeal in the case of proceedings for or upon a writ of prohibition in Nova Scotia does not lie to this court unless the matter in controversy, even though it were not excluded by sub-section (a) of section 36, or sub-section (c) of section 39, falls within some of the classes, of cases provided for by section 48, which, since the amendment of 1918, applies to that province. The second question should be answered in the negative.\nI think, therefore, that the appeal from the decision of the Acting Registrar should be dismissed with costs.\nThe appellant asked that should this court be of opinion that he cannot appeal as of right, he be granted special leave to appeal under sub-section (e) of section 48.\nI think the answer I have given to the first question would preclude me from granting leave to appeal in a case where, in my opinion, the right of appeal is expressly taken away by the statute. But for another reason the prayer of the appellant cannot be granted by this court inasmuch as more than sixty days have elapsed since the judgment a quo was rendered. Goodison Thresher Co. v. Corporation of McNab[19].\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nMOTION FOR STAY OF PROCEEDINGS.\nThe appellant then applied to Mr. Justice Mignault in chambers for an order staying further proceedings in this court until an application could be made to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for leave to appeal to that Board. The order was refused for the following reasons:\nMignault J.\u2014In this matter I am of the opinion that inasmuch as this court has declared that it has no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal of the appellant from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Crown side, herein, and has dismissed the appeal taken by the appellant from the decision of the Acting Registrar refusing to affirm jurisdiction, I cannot grant the stay of proceedings asked for by the appellant.\nMoreover, the affidavit of the appellant does not shew whether he intends to take a direct appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, or whether he purposes to apply to the Judicial Committee for leave to appeal from the judgment of this court dismissing his appeal from the decision of the Acting Registrar refusing to affirm jurisdiction, and under these circumstances I am of the opinion that a proper case has not been made out for granting a stay of proceedings.\nThe motion of the appellant is dismissed with costs.\n[1] 47 Can.

Idington J. dissents.\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia (52 N.S. Rep. 112; 39 D.L.R. 640), affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1], affirming the judgment.\nOne Blinn was convicted at Bridgetown, N.S., of haying obtained money under false pretences. After the conviction the court made an order for compensation, having the effect of a judgment, under section 1048 of the Criminal Code, which order was initiated by appellant who was counsel for the prisoner. Appellant on the next day took from the prisoner a mortgage on land in King's County, N.S., and had it registered before the judgment. The judgment creditor then brought action for an order declaring that his judgment had priority.\nThe trial judge granted such order and his judgment was upheld by the court en banc.\nMorse, appellant in person.\nO'Connor K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I concur in the reasons for judgment of my brother Anglin and would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nIdington J. (dissenting) \u2014 Notwithstanding the elaborate history of the law submitted I am of the opinion that this case should be decided by the construction of the relevant sections in the \"Registry Act,\" R.S.N.S., 1900, ch. 137.\nAs I read same the bare fact that a mortgagee has notice of outstanding unregistered judgments against him giving the mortgage in no way touches the rights acquired by the mortgagee taking and registering a mortgage.\nTo hold otherwise would lead to rather alarming consequences.\nFollowed out logically a judgment debtor who was notoriously insolvent never could give a valid mortgage, not even for an actual advance of cash paid him:\nSection 16 of the Act in question only makes registration of a judgment effective \"from the date of such registry.\" And if a mortgagee cannot rely upon that I do not see how any man can safely take a mortgage if he has reason to believe there is a judgment anywhere against his mortgagor.\nIf the facts had been as Mr. Justice Drysdale through error states them, then an entirely different case would have been presented. For I think it is at least fairly arguable that if a man by theft or fraud deprives another of specific money which can be clearly traced into an investment in the purchase of real estate, a mortgagee taking with full knowledge thereof a mortgage upon such real estate would have some difficulty in maintaining his security against the party so defrauded.\nHere it is neither alleged in the pleading nor attempted to be proved that appellant knew that the money which was invested in the real estate in question was that which had been obtained by false pretences.\nIt is alleged in the pleading that the said money was that so obtained.\nWhy the plaintiff so carefully abstained from alleging that appellant knew that alleged fact I cannot understand on any other hypothesis than that plaintiff did not believe such a charge and hence properly refrained from making it.\nThe temptation to make the charge I should surmise must have been great.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014This appeal from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, involving merely a question of priority between a judgment for $71 and a mortgage for $80 upon land said to be of a value insufficient to satisfy both claims, illustrates the necessity for further restricting the right of appeal to this court. The defendant, a barrister and solicitor, acted as counsel for one Blinn, accused of obtaining $71 by false pretences from the plaintiff. After convicting Blinn the County Court Judge, on the 14th of March, 1917, made an order for compensation against him under section 1048 of the Criminal Code, which is by that section given the force and effect of a judgment for debt. The defendant initialled the order to evidence his approval of its form. With this actual notice of it but, so far as the record shews, without any intention of defeating the plaintiff's judgment or of embarrassing him in its recovery and without any knowledge of the fact that the $71 fraudulently obtained had been invested in the property covered by it, the defendant on the 15th of March obtained from Blinn a mortgage on some real estate for $80, the amount of his fees for Blinn's defence, and immediately caused it to be registered. The plaintiff's judgment was registered only on the following day. By this action the plaintiff seeks\nan order * * * declaring that the compensation order * * * may have precedence and priority on the records of the registry of deeds at Kentville in the County of King's over the said mortgage obtained by the said defendant from the said James F. Blinn.\nThe trial judge granted this relief and his judgment was unanimously affirmed on appeal.\nMuch of the argument at bar was devoted to the question whether the plaintiffs judgment gave him a lien on Blinn's real property before its registration. A judgment in nowise affected the debtor's lands at common law. Until the Statute of Westminster 2nd (13 Ed. 1, ch. 18) provided the writ of elegit the debtor's lands were not liable in satisfaction. Black on Judgments (2 ed.), sec. 397 et seq. Whatever might have been the case under the earlier Nova Scotia \"Docketing Acts\" of 1758 and 1822, I think it is perfectly clear that under the registry legislation in force in March, 1917 (R.S.N.S., 1900, ch. 137) no lien arises until registration. But, in my opinion, the plaintiff's claim in this action does not depend on the existence of such a lien before registration.\nSections 2 (a), 15 and 16 of the \"Registry Act\" of 1900 are as follows:\u2014\n2. In this chapter unless the context otherwise requires:\u2014\n(a) The expression \"instrument\" means every conveyance or other document by which the title to land is changed or in any wise affected, and also a writ of attachment, a certificate of judgment, a lease for a term exceeding three years, and a vesting order; but does not include a grant from the Crown, a will, or a report of commissioners appointed to make partition.\n15. Every instrument shall, as against any person claiming for valuable consideration and without notice under any subsequent instrument affecting the title to the same land, be ineffective unless such instrument is registered in the manner provided by this chapter before the registering of such subsequent instrument. R.S., ch. 84, sec. 18.\n16. A judgment, a certificate of which is registered in the manner by this chapter provided in the registry of any district, shall from the date of such registry, bind and be a charge upon any land within the district of any person against whom such judgment was recovered, whether such land was acquired before or after the registering of such certificate, as effectually and to the same extent as a registered mortgage upon such land of the same amount as the amount of such judgment. R.S., ch. 84, sec. 21.\nSection 3 of ch. 170, \"The Sale of Land Under Execution Act,\" is as follows:\u2014\n3. The land of every judgment-debtor may be sold under execution after the judgment has been registered for one year in the registry of deeds for the registration district in which the land is situated. R.S., ch. 124, sec. 1 (part).\nThe plaintiff's right after obtaining his order for compensation was to cause it at any time to attach to the judgment-debtor's lands in any particular registration district by registering a certificate of it in the Registry Office of that district under section 16. With actual notice of that right the defendant took his mortgage. His position is, I think, not distinguishable from that of an English mortgagee or purchaser taking his mortgage or deed with notice of the right of a judgment-creditor to attach the lands of the mortgagor or vendor by suing out a writ of elegit, or, if they were situated in a county having a registration system, by registering it in the Registry Office of such county.\nThe principle of equity on which such a mortgagee or purchaser is held to take subject to the rights of the judgment-creditor as against the mortgagor or vendor is perhaps most clearly stated by Vice-Chancellor Sir W. Page-Wood in Benham v. Keane[2]. After reviewing the earlier cases (Hine v. Dodd[3]; Tunstall v. Trappes[4]; Robinson v. Woodward[5]), he says, at p. 704:\u2014\nNo person having notice of a judgment can by contract with the debtor put himself in a better position than the person with whom he contracts.\nThe same principle was acted on by Lord Elgin in Davis v. Earl of Strathmore[6], approved in Greaves v. Tofield[7].\nAs put by Lord Hatherly (formerly Page-Wood, V.-C.) in Rolland v. Hart[8], at p. 684:\u2014\nActual notice must be shewn, which amounts to fraud in the person who, having such actual notice, attempts through the medium of the \"Registration Act\" to get priority. * * * The authorities have been uniform in holding that the proof of notice must be very clear and distinct; but if actual notice is proved, then a man cannot take advantage of his registration to invalidate a previous unregistered security.\nThis doctrine is so firmly embodied in the English Equity system that nothing short of explicit legislation will suffice to render it inapplicable where that system is in force. We had to consider such legislation in the recent case of Union Bank v. Boulter-Waugh[9].\nThe language of the English \"Registry Act\" dealt with in the cases above cited was more explicit than section 16 of the Nova Scotia Act. The Registration Act for the West Riding of Yorkshire (5 & 6 Anne, ch. 18) contained this provision as section 4:\u2014\nNo judgment * * * shall affect or bind any manors, lands, tenements or hereditaments, situate, lying and being in the said West Riding but only from the time that a memorial of such judgment shall be entered at the Registry Office.\nThe \"Middlesex Registry Act,\" 7 Anne, ch. 20, by sec. 18, provides that:\u2014\nNo judgment * * * shall affect or bind any honours, manors, lands, tenements or hereditaments, situate, lying and being in the said county of Middlesex, but only from the time that a memorial of such judgment * * * shall be entered at the said Registry Office expressing, etc.\nI read the affirmative provision of section 16 of the Nova Scotia Act as implying the negative expressed in both these English statutes and formerly found in the word \"only\" of the Nova Scotia statute of 1832, ch. 51, sec. 3; the R.S.N.S. 1851, ch. 113, sec. 20; the R.S.N.S. 1859, ch. 113, sec. 22; and the R.S.N.S. 1864 (Appendix), ch. 113, sec. 22, which was dropped in the revision of 1873, ch. 79, sec. 22.\nI agree with Mr. O'Connor that it is the defendant and not the plaintiff who must seek the aid of section 15 of the Nova Scotia \"Registry Act\" to obtain a priority which equity denies him and that he is excluded from its operation because he is not \"a person claiming * * * without notice,\" and possibly also because a judgment is not an \"instrument\" within the definition of that word in the statute. In any case, while unregistered, a judgment does not affect the title to land within the meaning of section 15.\nTwo cases were cited by the appellant as in conflict with the view which I have stated. In Neate v. The Duke of Marlborough[10], the judgment-creditor had not sued out a writ of elegit and it was accordingly held that having no legal right against his debtor's land he could not invoke the auxiliary jurisdiction of a court of equity to reach his debtor's equitable interest. That decision has no bearing on the equitable doctrine as to the effect of actual notice. It might be in point if the plaintiff here were suing without having registered a certificate of his judgment.\nThe personal equity affecting the conscience, referred to by Lord Cranworth, in Johnson v. Holdsworth[11], which prevents a purchaser sheltering himself behind the \"Registry Act\" to the prejudice of a judgment-creditor of the vendor, with notice of whose judgment he paid his purchase-money, is equally applicable to a mortgagee. The true principle is that stated by Page-Wood V.-C., that no person can by contract made with notice gain a better position than that of the person with whom he contracts. Here, although the debt as security for which the defendant's mortgage was taken was incurred before the plaintiff's judgment had been obtained, the mortgagee had not and \u00edrom the very nature of the case in the absence of legislation similar to 33 & 34 Vict., ch. 28, sec. 16 (Imp.), he could not have had before that time, any equitable lien or claim upon the land in question, such as might have arisen had the debt been incurred on a valid promise to secure it by mortgage\u2014not dissimilar to the equitable interest of a purchaser who has paid over his purchase-money on the promise of a conveyance.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I concur with my brother Anglin.\nMignault J.\u2014I also concur.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Harry Ruggles.\nSolicitor for the respondent: John Irons.\n[1] 52 N.S.

The contract provided that the appellant's engineer might \"at any time while the works are in hand, increase, alter, change or diminish the dimensions * * * or vary the form of dimensions of any part of the said work\" (clause 7); and that \"in the event of delay to the works\" for certain reasons, including \"extra work,\" \"such additional time as may be deemed fair and reasonable shall be allowed by the\" appellant if notified in writing by the respondent: (clause 11). By clause 12, it was also provided that \"the time of beginning, rate of progress and time of completion are essential conditions of this contract; and if the contractor shall fail to complete the work by the time specified, the sum of twenty-five dollars per day, for each and every day thereafter as liquidated damages, together with all sums which the corporation may be liable to pay during such delays until such completion, shall be deducted from the moneys payable under this contract, and the engineer's certificate as to the amount of this deduction shall be final. This sum shall be in addition to any penalties otherwise specified, and shall be paid by the contractor to the corporation, or deducted from any moneys due to the contractor in the event of a failure to complete said work as herein agreed, and in no event as a penalty, but to the full amount thereof, and in addition to any other damages sustained, or the amount may be recovered from the sureties.\" Clause 13 provided that \"any extra work, changes,\" etc., should not \"lengthen the delay within which the works were to be completed\" and \"shall be considered as if originally in (the) contract.\" The appellant, a few days after the contract was signed, authorized the construction of 700 additional feet of sewer. On the first of July, 1912, the appellant notified the respondent that two months' extra time would be allowed for the completion of the work. The engineer's certificates as to the amounts due to the respondent were calculated, even after the first of September, 1912, without making any deductions for delay. On the 12th of January, 1914, when the engineer delivered a \"final\" certificate establishing as the date of the completion of the works the 21st of December, 1913, the appellant retained in its possession 20% of the contract price.\nHeld, Idington and Anglin JJ. dissenting, that, under the circumstances of this case, the conduct of the appellant and its engineer constitutes a waiver of the provisions making time the essence of the contract and of the clause fixing damages for delay in completion.\nPer Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\u2014The sums payable under clause 12 must be regarded as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty.

Lafleur K.C. and Marcus for the appellant.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. and H. P. O. Savary for the respondent.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014I am of the opinion that the provisions in the contract in question for liquidated damages falls as such well within the rules laid down by Lord Dunedin in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. Ltd. v. New Garage & Motor Co.[2], at pp. 89 et seq., for testing whether the sum named is to be treated as a penalty or, as the express language of the contract designates it, as liquidated damages.\nIn the very nature of the things the parties were contracting about, it seems to me most appropriate that they should contemplate the loss to the appellant by a daily deprivation of the use of that which was being contracted for; and none the less so when in all probability there would have been paid by it ere the time for the clause in question becoming operative, the substantial part of the cost price of the work and hence intend to anticipate and decide what would be reasonable damages. Having regard to the sum involved and paid and the result of the deprivation of the use of the work, the daily payment fixed does not seem so harsh or extravagant as to suggest a mere penalty was only being considered.\nThe case of Jones v. St. Johns College[3], seems to answer the objection in law relative to the construction of the instrument involved in the provisions for extra work as an excuse for relief.\nAnd as a matter of fair dealing I think the engineer's allowance of time in that regard covers the ground, and I suspect was in fact intended to be in conformity with the expectation implied in the contract though not literally observing its terms.\nAnd in the same sense I think the view of the learned Chief Justice below, as to the final estimate of the engineer being taken as substantial completion, should be adopted.\nI fail to find any ground of waiver on which respondents should be permitted to rest. I think the appeal should be allowed and judgment go in the manner the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Stuart in the court below indicated, and with costs of appeal here and below.\nDUFF J.\u2014The appeal turns in my judgment upon the construction and application of articles 11 and 12 of the contract. These articles are in the following terms:\n11. If the engineer or corporation should at any time be of the opinion that the work is unreasonably or unnecessarily delayed, or that the contractor is not on his part fulfilling this contract, or that the force employed is not sufficient to complete the work within the time herein provided; the said engineer shall thereupon require said contractor to proceed within such delay as may be mentioned in the notice with such force as he shall direct, and in case of his refusal or neglect to comply with such requirements, or if at the expiration of the time specified for the completion of the works embraced in this contract, such works are not fully completed, the said corporation may put on sufficient force as it may see fit or take possession of and complete said work at the expense of said contractor, as herein provided in case of failure or insolvency, and all money paid by the corporation in such case shall be deemed payment made on account of this contract. But in the event of delay to the works by reason of strikes or combinations on the part of the workmen employed, or by extra work, or by any act or omission of the corporation, such additional time as may be deemed fair and reasonable shall be allowed by the corporation: provided that the contractor notify the engineer in writing within 24 hours of the cause of such delay otherwise he shall have no claim.\n12. The time of beginning, rate of progress and time of completion are essential conditions of this contract; and if the contractor shall fail to complete the work by the time specified, the sum of twenty-five dollars per day, for each and every day thereafter as liquidated damages, together with all sums which the corporation may be liable to pay during such delays until such completion, shall be deducted from the moneys payable under this contract, and the engineer's certificate as to the amount of this deduction shall be final. This sum shall be in addition to any penalties otherwise specified, and shall be paid by the contractor to the corporation, or deducted from any moneys due to the contractor in the event of failure to complete said work as herein agreed, and in no event as a penalty, but to the full amount thereof, and in addition to any other damages sustained, or the amount may be recovered from the sureties.\nThe sums payable under article twelve must, I think, be regarded as liquidated damages, and not as a penalty.\nThe judgment of Lord Dunedin in Commissioner of Public Works v. Hills[4], at p. 375, furnishes the appropriate test. The question is, can the sums mentioned be considered as a genuine pre-estimate of the creditor's probable or possible interest in the performance of the contract? If so, it is immaterial that the parties may be reasonably supposed to have relied upon the clause as an \"instrument of restraint.\" As Lord Robertson pointed out in the Clydebank Engineering Co. v. Ramos[5], at pp. 19 & 20, the intention that such agreements shall so take effect in some degree may always be assumed to be present. That is nevertheless of no importance unless you come to the conclusion, to use Lord Halsbury's phrase in the same case, \"that the parties only intended\" the agreement \"as something in terrorem.\"\nI have no doubt that this article must be construed as a genuine appraisal of the value of a real interest of the municipality in the performance of the contractor's principal obligation.\nArticle twelve contemplates the deduction of the penalties as the primary method of recovery. It does not differ materially in this respect from the article construed by the Exchequer Chamber in Laidlaw v. Hastings Pier Co.[6], at pp. 15 and 16, in which it was provided that the penalty was\nto be paid to and retained by the company as ascertained and liquidated damages.\nThe provision for drawback does not, I think, materially affect this point.\nThe power to extend time was given to the engineer, and the granting of certificates by him, from time to time, subsequent to the date fixed for completion, without deduction for penalties, was treated as overwhelming evidence of the intention to exercise this power. Here the power is given to the municipality. But article eleven does more than vest in the municipality the power to extend the time, it creates in the cases specified in article eleven an obligation to do so if the contractor shall reasonably be entitled to demand it.\nIn the case before us, certificates were granted by the engineer, without deduction, and paid by the municipality, without deduction. Coupled with the circumstance that the municipality had taken possession, and with the correspondence, these facts constitute, I think, sufficient ground for requiring us to draw the inference that the time for completion was extended until the date when the works were substantially completed by the contractor in July, 1913.\nANGLIN J. (dissenting).\u2014The facts of this case, so far as material, may be found in the opinions delivered by the learned judges of the Appellate Division[7].\nSeveral questions are presented on this appeal\u2014\n(1) Whether a provision of the 12th clause of the contract that\nif the contractor shall fail to complete the work by the time specified, a sum of twenty-five dollars per day for each and every day thereafter as liquidated damages * * * shall be deducted from the money payable under this contract, and the engineer's certificate as to the amount of this deduction shall be final,\nshould be regarded as a contractual pre-ascertainment of damages for delay or as in the nature of a penalty; (2) Whether by directing an extension of the sewer for 700 feet at its lower end, from which the work was to begin, the city waived the provision of the contract making time of its essence and thus rendered the clause fixing the amount of damages for delay inapplicable;\n(3) Whether certificates given by the city engineer for amounts payable to the contractor, and particularly his certificate of the 12th of January, 1914, marked \"final,\" in which no deduction was made for damages for delay in completion, preclude the city from claiming such damages;\n(4) Did the city by making partial use of lower portions of the sewer as constructed waive the provision for damages for delay in completion of the entire work?\n(5) If damages at the rate stipulated are recoverable, for what period should they be allowed?\nThe date fixed by the contract for completion was the first of July, 1912. The additional 700 feet of sewer (the original length was 12,000 feet, for the construction of which the contract allowed eleven months), was authorized by the engineer a few days after the contract was signed and before actual work upon it was begun. The contract expressly provided that the engineer might\nat any time while the works are in hand, increase, alter, change or diminish the dimensions * * * or vary the form of the dimensions of any part of the said work\n(clause 7), and that extra work, changes, alterations, increases or diminutions should not lengthen the delay within which the works were to be completed but must themselves also be completed by the 1st of July, 1912, as if originally in the contract (clause 13). I agree with the learned Chief Justice of Alberta that this latter provision distinguishes the case at bar from Dodd v. Churton[8], at p. 567, relied on by the learned trial judge and the two learned appellate judges who affirmed his judgment, and brings it within the authority of Jones v. St. Johns College[9].\nThe works were \"in hand\" from the moment when the contract was executed. It stipulated that they should be commenced immediately. The contract further provided that should the works be delayed by extra work, if the contractor should advise the engineer of such delay and its cause, the corporation should allow such additional time for completion as might be deemed fair and reasonable (clause 11).\nIf, as I incline to think and as all parties seem to have treated it, the addition of the 700 feet was \"extra work\" within the meaning of the foregoing provisions, no notice of delay thereby occasioned or of its cause was given by the contractor. Nevertheless, the city engineer, either proprio motu or by direction of the municipal corporation, by letter of the 1st of July, 1912, formally notified the contractor that two months' extra time would be allowed it for the completion of the work on account of the extra 700 feet. I think the city may fairly be held bound by this act of its official and that the time for completion should therefore as against it be regarded as having been extended to the 1st of September, 1912. Not having taken advantage of the provision in its favour made by clause 11, the contractor cannot complain that it has not been allowed for delay entailed by extra work. But, if it could, the allowance of two months for 700 feet additional seems eminently reasonable in view of the fact that the time for construction of the 12,000 feet originally contracted for was eleven months. I agree with Harvey C.J. that the city engineer's estimate of the 12th of January, 1914, certifying to work done up to the 31st of December, 1913, and marked \"final\" should also be taken to establish that the works were completed on that date so that the contractor's default should be computed as from the 1st of September, 1912, to the 31st of December, 1913, or 487 days in all. There is no evidence in my opinion that would justify a finding that the works had been completed at an earlier date. Moreover, under clause 4 of the contract it was the function of the engineer to determine all questions as to its execution and his decision is made\nfinal and conclusive and unimpeachable for any cause.\nIf, on the other hand, the additional 700 feet was not \"extra work\" which the contract allowed the engineer to direct, but should be regarded as an independent undertaking upon which the contractor was at liberty to enter or not as it might elect, its doing so did not affect its rights or obligations under the existing contract and would not entitle it to an extension of time for its completion.\nConnecting with lateral sewers as sections of the trunk sewer were finished was quite a usual course and must from the first have been contemplated by the parties to the contract. Such partial user of the trunk sewer as these connections entailed would not involve the waiver of the provision fixing damages for non-completion of the entire work.\nThe engineer's certificates of amounts due the contractor calculated without making any deductions for delay at first blush present a little difficulty. But when it is borne in mind that the city retained a drawback too of 20%, amounting to $36,489.22 on the final estimate of the 12th of January, 1914, that difficulty largely disappears. It was, no doubt, intended by the engineer that any damages the city should be entitled to for delay in completion and other matters should be taken from the sum so withheld on the final adjustment of accounts with the contractor. The omission of a deduction for delay from the certificates therefore does not imply any abandonment of the city's right to claim it or any judgment of the engineer adverse to such a claim. In his letter of the 31st of July, 1912, granting the contractor the two months' extension\non account of the extra 700 feet of sewer laid at the lower end and sundry unforeseen and unavoidable delays\nthe engineer expressly notified them that after September 1st\nthe penalty clause in your contract will be enforced,\nadding\nit would be to your advantage therefore to put on such extra force and appliances to ensure a speedy closing up of your contract.\nThe effect of this letter was to put matters in the same position as if the date originally fixed for completion of the works had been the 1st of September, 1912, instead of the 1st of July, 1912. The contract conferred power on the corporation to make this change and it was exercised by its officer. From time to time we find letters to the contractor complaining of delay and urging, the employment of more men\u2014a night shift\u2014more rapid progress. But no further extension of time was ever granted and I fail to find in the correspondence and certificates or in the conduct of the corporation and its engineer a waiver of the provisions making time of the essence or of the clause fixing damages for delay in completion.\nWe had in the comparatively recent case of Canadian General Electric Co. v. Canadian Rubber Co. [10], to consider with some care when a clause providing for the payment of a fixed sum for each day's delay in completing a contract should be regarded as\na genuine covenanted pre-estimate of damage,\nand when it should be deemed a penalty. The English authorities were there so fully discussed that further reference to them is scarcely necessary. The parties in the present instance have themselves designated the sum fixed as \"liquidated damages;\" it is payable on only one event, not on the occurrence of one, or more, or all of several events, some of which may occasion serious and others trifling damage: it is not extravagant or unconscionable under the rule indicated by Lord Davey in Clydebank Engineering & Shipbuilding Co. v. Don Jose Ramos[11], at p. 17, being in fact slightly less than the equivalent of interest on the contract price at 5%: there were no adequate means of ascertaining either before or after the default the damage attributable to the breach of the contract. All these tests of\na genuine covenanted pre-estimate of damage\nindicated by Lord Dunedin in the Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. v. New Garage & Motor Co.[12], at pp. 87-8, are present here. It is in such a case that the parties might be expected to have intended to contract that they should estimate the damages for default at a certain figure and thus dispense with the extremely difficult, if not impossible, proof of the actual damage to which delay in completion of the work would subject the municipal corporation.\nA reported case resembling this in its nature and circumstances is Law v. Local Board of Redditch[13], where in default of completion by a specified date of sewerage works to cost \u00a3630 the contractor agreed to pay the sum of \u00a3100 and \u00a35 for every seven days during which the work should be uncompleted after the date fixed as and for liquidated damages. It was held by the Court of Appeal that these sums were recoverable as liquidated damages.\nOn the whole case I think judgment should be entered as indicated in the opinion of the learned Chief Justice of Alberta, including the disposition of costs. The appellant is entitled to its costs of the appeal to this court.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The question in this appeal is whether the appellant corporation is entitled to claim $25.00 a day from the respondent company for delay in the construction of the sewer the latter undertook to build. The trial judge dismissed that claim and the judges of the Appellate Division being equally divided the decision of the trial judge stood confirmed.\nIt is not necessary for me to decide whether the clause upon which the corporation based its claim was a penalty clause or constituted liquidated damages, because I have come to the conclusion that this clause was waived.\nBy the contract the engineer of the corporation is the sole judge to determine the amounts of work to be paid and to decide all questions which may arise relative to the interpretation and execution of the contract; and his estimates, directions and decisions are final and unimpeachable for any cause.\nCash payments were to be made monthly oh the written certificate of the engineer\napportioning same in accordance with the actual value of the work done in proportion to the contract as a whole.\nThe contract should have been completed on the 1st July, 1912: but an extension of two months was given by the engineer for some extra work. The engineer, from September, 1912, to October, 1913, gave very frequently progress estimates and in none of those estimates does he claim any damages for delay in the execution of the contract. It would have been however very easy to do that because a sum of $25.00 a day had been stipulated for such delay; but for reasons which appealed, I suppose, to the sense of justice of the engineer he did not find it advisable that the contractor should pay that penalty.\nNow that the work is completed and accepted by the municipal authorities, the corporation of Calgary claims, when they are sued for the payment of the balance due on the contract that a penalty exceeding $12,000 should be paid.\nIt seems to me that the engineer had been satisfied that the work had been carried out properly or that the provision of the time limit had ceased to operate after the extension of the work. In that case, the city lost its right to demand the penalty or liquidated damages.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The principal question here is whether the appellant is entitled to claim from the respondent the sum of $25.00 a day for delay in completion of a sewer which the respondent contracted to build and built for the appellant. The contract allowed eleven months for its construction, and under clause 12 the appellant, when sued for the balance due the respondent, claimed the sum of $28,125.00 for liquidated damages at the rate of $25.00 per day from September 1st, 1912, to October 1st, 1915. The trial judge, Mr. Justice Ives, dismissed the appellant's counterclaim and allowed the respondent the sum of $9,288.10. He also found as a fact that the work was completed on July 5th, 1913, while the date fixed by the contract for completion was July 1st, 1912, the appellant admitting that it cannot complain of any delay prior to September 1st, 1912; Both parties appealed from the judgment of the trial court, the appellant in order to get judgment on its counterclaim, the respondent because it was not satisfied with the rate of interest granted by the learned trial judge. In the Appellate Division, the learned judges were equally divided, so the judgment of the trial court stands unless it is interfered with by this court.\nThe first point to be considered is the nature of the right claimed by the appellant under clause 12 of the contract. Is it a penalty or liquidated damages? The learned trial judge held that it was a penalty, while Chief Justice Harvey and Mr. Justice Stuart were of the opinion that it was liquidated damages. Mr. Justice Beck (Mr. Justice Hyndman concurred with him but gave no reasons), held that the appellant had waived any right to this sum of $25.00 per day and did not think it necessary to discuss the nature of the claim.\nThis, however, is the first point to be dealt with. I will cite clause 12 of the contract between the parties:\nPENALTY.\n12. The time of beginning, rate of progress and time of completion are essential conditions of this contract; and if the contractor shall fail to complete the work by the time specified, the sum of twenty-five dollars per day, for each and every day thereafter as liquidated damages, together with all sums which the corporation may be liable to pay during such delays until such completion, shall be deducted from the moneys payable under this contract, and the engineer's certificate as to the amount of this deduction shall be final. This sum shall be in addition to any penalties otherwise specified, and shall be paid by the contractor to the corporation, or deducted from any moneys due to the contractor in the event of a failure to complete said work as herein agreed, and in no event as a penalty, but to the full amount thereof, and in addition to any other damages sustained, or the amount may be recovered from the sureties.\nThe language of this clause is not aptly chosen, and very likely it was modified or added to in the drafting. It obviously opens the door to two constructions. Apparently, but of course this is only a surmise, the parties, as the title shews, started out with the idea of providing for a penalty in case of delay in completion, and then it was thought better to make it a stipulation for liquidated damages. Possibly a doubt was felt whether some kind of damages should not be expressly provided for, so it was agreed that the sum of $25.00 per day of delay should be paid\ntogether with all sums which the corporation may be liable to pay during such delays until such completion.\nSo the \"liquidated damages\" do not include these sums, which obviously are damages caused by the delay to complete the works during the time prescribed.\nThen the clause says that\nthis sum shall be paid in addition to any penalties otherwise specified * * * and in addition to any other damages sustained.\nViewing the whole clause and the portions to which I have specially referred, I cannot say that the learned trial judge was wrong in holding that this sum of $25.00 per day was a penalty and not liquidated damages, and if this be so, cadit questio, for no proof of damages for delay has been made.\nIt appears further that this sum was to be\ndeducted from the moneys payable under this contract, and the engineer's certificate as to the amount of this deduction shall be final.\nAs a matter of fact, the engineer gave a certificate which he marked \"final\" on January 12th, 1914, and in this certificate no deduction of the $25.00 per day was made, and he certified that $2,740.86 was then due the respondent. It is true that the certificate shewed that 20% of the contract price was held back, amounting to $36,489.22, but this retention of 20% was governed by clause 20 of the contract, and its object was not to cover the $25.00 per day for delay in completion: It was to be held back until 33 days after the completion of the works,\nto pay thereout the claims of all persons who have done work or furnished material in execution of any part of this contract to or for the contractor.\nAfter the 33 days, 15 per cent. was to be paid to the contractor, and the appellant was to keep 5% for twelve months to cover repairs or the cost of finishing work. It therefore cannot be said that the retention of the 20% on the certificate of January 12th, 1914, was a reservation of the right of the engineer to deduct the $25.00 per day, the more so as the work, as found by the trial judge, had then been completed for more than six months.\nMr. Craig, the engineer, first claimed this penalty in an estimate dated November 30th, 1917, nearly four years after his final estimate of January 12th, 1914, and in his evidence says that he never rendered an account for the $25.00 per day before that time. I cannot help thinking that the claim first made by the appellant on November 30th, 1917, was an afterthought, to defeat the right of the respondent to be paid the drawback, and it does not commend itself to my mind as coming within any rule of fair dealing between the parties to such a contract.\nI may add that immediately after the contract, the appellant ordered the respondent to begin the sewer at a point 700 feet further away from the point determined in the contract for its starting point. Without stopping to enquire whether this was an extra. or an independent contract, it is obvious that this addition to the work changed all the time conditions of the contract. After this order of the appellant, I would think the parties were at large in so far as the penalty for delay in completion is concerned.\nI would not interfere with the judgment of the learned trial judge as to the interest he allowed the respondent, that is to say five per cent. which is the legal rate.\nIn the result the appeal should in my opinion be dismissed with costs here and in the Appellate Division. The respondent should not have the costs of its cross-appeal to the latter court.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 14 Alta.

Respondents.\n1919: May 12; 1919: October 14.\nPresent: Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN.\nSale\u2014Principal and agent\u2014Written contract\u2014Evidence\u2014Acceptance \u2014Verbal representations\u2014Warranty\u2014Return of goods.\nThe respondent ordered from the appellant \"one Case 40 Horse Power Case Gas Engine.\" The agreement provided that \"the purchaser\" could claim.\" the return of moneys paid * * * only * * * after he has returned the * * * goods to the place where he received them\"; and that \"no representations, warranty or conditions, expressed or implied, other than those herein contained nor * * * any agreement collateral hereto be binding upon the vendor unless it is in writing.\" The engine was delivered to the respondents, accepted by them in May, 1915, and never returned to the appellant. A promissory note due in November, 1915, was paid by the respondents without any protest. The engine had two tanks, one labelled \"kerosene\" and one \"gasoline.\" An agent of the appellant represented to the respondents that the engine would also operate on kerosene and promised to send experts; but it stopped whenever so operated.\nOn an action by the appellant for the price of sale, the respondents alleged fraud and misrepresentations.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that, upon the evidence, the engine delivered was accepted by the respondents as the engine ordered in the written agreement of sale.\nPer Duff J.\u2014The written contract is explicit, and its terms are not susceptible of modification by evidence of contemporary or antecedent negotiations.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014The agreement contained no warranty that the engine would run on kerosene, breach of which would support a claim for damages. Schofield v. Emerson (57 Can. S.C.R. 203), distinguished.\nPer Brodeur J.\u2014By paying their promissory note without protest and, per Brodeur and Mignault JJ. by not returning the engine to the appellant, the respondents waived any right they might have to rescission.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1919] 1 W.W.R. 101), reversed, Idington J. dissenting. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], affirming the judgment of Taylor J. at the trial[2], and maintaining the plaintiff's action, and less certain deductions, without costs. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nLafleur K.C. and Bastedo for the appellant.\nBelcourt K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J. (dissenting)\u2014I agree so fully with the reasoning upon which the judgments of the learned trial judge and that of Mr. Justice Lamont on behalf of the majority of the Court of Appeal proceed, that I must dissent from the judgment herein allowing entirely this appeal.\nI may be permitted to add that the generic term \"gas engine\" is in the circumstances ambiguous and fails to describe accurately what beyond doubt all concerned had in mind; and regard must be had to the conduct of the parties and collateral inscription on the machine in order to make clear what kind of gas engine was meant.\nI have an impression in view of the state of the pleading that possibly a new trial limited to the determination of what would have been the proper sum to allow for the engine might well have been directed, but in view of the decided opinions of my colleagues I have not seen any good purpose to be served by fully examining that aspect of the case.\nDuff J.\u2014The written contract declares in explicit words that the terms of the agreement between the parties are to be found in the writing and in the writing exclusively. In face of this provision it is not, in my opinion, competent for a court of law to resort to contemporary conversations or prior conversations or even to the legend on the article for the purpose of discovering a contract differing in its terms from that expressed in the unambiguous language of the instrument.\nAnglin J.\u2014After some hesitation I concur in the allowance of this appeal. This case is distinguishable from Schofield v. Emerson Brantingham Implement Co.[3], inasmuch as the evidence here establishes acceptance by the defendants of the engine supplied to them as that which they had agreed to purchase from the plaintiff. Their letters of the 20th and 26th of October, 1916, afford practically conclusive proof of that fact. Moreover, there is no warranty that the engine contracted for would run on kerosene, such as I thought existed in the Schofield Case3, in regard to the rated horse power, breach of which would support a claim for damages. The defendants may have relied on some promises made to them by employees of the plaintiff that the engine would be made satisfactory to them but their contract precludes effect being given to such promises. The provisions of a formal written contract executed without fraud, mistake or surprise, cannot be entirely ignored.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This is an action by the appellant company to recover from the respondents the amount due by virtue of promissory notes which defendants have signed for the price of some agricultural machinery.\nIn 1915, the defendants, who are farmers and dealers, bought a separator and a 40 horse-power engine with different attachments for the price of $4,410. Those different articles were all delivered by the plaintiff company to the defendants on the 21st May, 1915. The defendants then gave a second-hand engine in part payment and made in favour of the plaintiffs three notes amounting to $3,660, falling due on the first of November, 1915, 1916 and 1917 respectively.\nOn the 1st November, 1915, a note became due and it was duly paid without any protest on the part of the purchaser.\nIn 1916, a few days before the payment became due, the defendants wrote a letter to the plaintiffs stating that they did not intend to make their payment this year until they were given their commission certificates on their machinery and, namely, on this gas engine and separator which they had received on the 21st May, 1915.\nThat letter remained unanswered. The appellant company did not feel disposed to pay any commission or to issue these commission certificates and the defendants failed to pay the notes which became due on the 1st November. An action was then taken by the plaintiffs a short time after, for the payment of the balance of the purchase price of the machinery, viz., $2,928. The defendants pleaded fraud and misrepresentations, claiming that it had been represented to them that the engine was a kerosene burning engine and that they had not received delivery of the machinery purchased. They counterclaimed also, repeating the allegation of fraud.\nThe trial judge found[4], that there was no fraud or misrepresentation but gave the defendant a set-off in damages for $1,885 on the implied condition that the engine was to be a kerosene burning engine. This judgment was confirmed by the Court of Appeal[5], Mr. Justice Newlands dissenting.\nIt seems to me that this defence of the respondents is the result of an afterthought. The machinery which was sold and delivered was a gas engine. The gas could be formed either by kerosene or by gasoline; in fact, there were two tanks on which the words kerosene and gasoline were painted. There seems to be no doubt that it did not work properly with kerosene (at least the evidence is conflicting on that point) but it worked very well with the use of gasoline. If the defendants were not satisfied with the machine as it was, why did they not return it in due time? Or why did they not then take proceedings to that effect? But they kept the machine for a year and made during that year enough profit to pay the cost of the whole machine. They paid their note which became due during that year, without any protest; and then, a year after, they would have paid the notes which then became due if the company had been willing to pay them some commission for which, I suppose, they had a claim more or less legitimate.\nThey seem to have waived in that way the rights which they might have if the machine did not run properly with kerosene; and in that respect they are too late now to claim what they virtually abandoned.\nI am then, with deference, obliged to differ from the opinion expressed in the courts below.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs of this court and of the courts below.\nMignault J.\u2014The appellant claims from the respondents the price of certain farming machinery sold to them, among which was a gas traction engine, and the respondents have refused to pay because this engine, which apparently was designed to work with gasoline and kerosene as a fuel, would not run on kerosene. The respondents signed an order for the machinery on May 21st, 1915, while the appellant's engine was loaded on the cars, and it was immediately after delivered to them. This order or contract contains very strict conditions to which the respondents submitted by signing it, among others the following:\u2014\n4. Said goods are warranted to be made of good material, and durable with good care, and to be capable of doing more and better work than any other machine made of equal size and proportions, working under the same conditions on the same job, if properly operated by competent persons, with sufficient power, and the printed rules and directions of the manufacturers intelligently followed.\n6. The purchaser shall not be entitled to make any claim for any breach of warranty unless he within ten days after his first using the said goods sends by registered letter a notice of the defect complained of, describing the same, and stating when it was discovered, addressed to the home office of the vendor, and to the dealer through whom this order was taken and unless the vendor fails to remedy such defect within a reasonable time after the receipt by it of such notice.\n8. In no event shall the purchaser have any claim whatever under the agreement against the vendor for any damages but only for the return of moneys paid and securities given, and his claim for such shall only arise after he has returned the said goods to the place where he received them.\n11. Nothing done by either party shall operate as a waiver of any of the provisions of this agreement unless the same is evidenced by writing signed by the party to be charged with such waiver.\n12. The whole contract is set forth herein. There are no representations, warranties or conditions, expressed or implied, other than those herein contained, nor shall any agreement collateral hereto be binding upon the vendor unless it is in writing hereupon or attached hereto and duly signed on behalf of the vendor at its said home office.\nThe undersigned hereby acknowledge to have received a full, true and correct copy of this order, and that no promises, representations or agreements have been made to or with me not herein contained.\nHenry J. Mitten,\nWilliam J. Mitten.\nThe learned trial judge, who decided in favour of the respondents, and whose judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan, Mr. Justice Newlands dissenting, has found that there was no misrepresentation on the part of the appellants, but that the respondents had previously purchased from the latter a gas engine which, when delivered, admittedly proved unsatisfactory in that it would not pull the load when working on kerosene. The appellant, the learned trial judge finds, agreed to take back this engine and credit the respondents with $750.00 on the purchase of another gas engine, the one in question, which, it was distinctly understood between the parties, was to be a kerosene burning engine. A casual examination of the engine, he adds, would lead to the belief that it was of a type specially designed to operate with kerosene, for it had two tanks, the larger one labelled \"kerosene,\" and the smaller one for gasoline which was to be used only for starting the engine. He also finds that the appellant's agent Given had previously represented to and assured the respondents that the engine would operate on kerosene, and that he had seen engines of this type operating on kerosene, using 3\u00bd gallons of kerosene to plow an acre of land. When it was attempted to run the engine on kerosene, it stopped, and the appellant, the learned trial judge finds, promised the respondents to send experts to make it work on kerosene, and did so, but to no avail.\nUnder these circumstances the learned trial judge held that the action of the respondents in relying on the undertaking of the appellant to make the engine work on kerosene, was entirely reasonable. He adds that he is satisfied that the respondents agreed to purchase one kind of engine, that that kind was never delivered to them, and that the engine actually delivered was worth at least $1,885.00 less than the engine they should have received. And in answer to the contention of the appellant that this engine answers the description in the order \"one case 40 Horse Power Case Gas Engine,\" he finds that this description is ambiguous, applicable to any type of gas engine, warranting the admission of evidence to shew which type of engine was intended.\nThe whole question is whether on these findings of fact, the appellant is entitled to recover from the respondents. The position of the latter is weakened not only by the terms of their contract, but also by the letters which they wrote to the appellant, which, up to that of the 11th November, 1916, do not mention the grievance that the engine would not run on kerosene, but merely complain that certain commission certificates which they claimed from the appellant had not been sent to them.\nI have looked at this case from every possible angle, but notwithstanding Mr. Belcourt's able argument for the respondents, it all comes back to the question whether the respondents can escape from the obligations of the contract they have signed. The learned trial judge has found that there were no misrepresentations on the part of the appellant and therefore the contract stands. It is no doubt a very rigorous one, but persons who sign such a contract cannot expect a court of law to relieve them from its obligations because its terms seem harsh. The respondents strenuously argued that the engine they contracted for was not delivered to them. If this means that the appellant did not deliver the engine mentioned in the order, the contrary is proved and even admitted by the respondents. If it means that the engine delivered was defective and did not come within the description and warranties of the contract, the respondents have not returned the engine as required by paragraph 8 of their contract. Although the respondents allege in their plea that the engine was returned to the appellant, such is not the fact, and the respondents in their factum admit that they are liable to pay what the engine is worth. The appellant did not specifically deny this averment of the respondents (see Rule 153 of the Saskatchewan Rules of Court), but when the objection founded on paragraph 8 of the contract was argued before this court, the respondents did not suggest that the engine was returned, and they could not do so in view of the evidence and the judgment of the trial court which shew that the engine was never returned, but has been dealt with by the learned trial judge as having been sufficiently paid for. Under these circumstances, Rule 153 does not relieve me from my duty to deal with this case according to the state of facts which appear by the record.\nI am for these reasons forced to the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout, and that the appellant's action should be maintained and the respondents' plea and counterclaim dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Gilchrist & Hogarth.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.

The company never took any steps to interfere with such public user of the road and no prosecution was ever brought against any one for such user under the provisions of the Nova Scotia \"Railway Act\" which, in its 264th section, provided as follows:\u2014\n264. Every person, not connected with the railway, or employed by the company, who walks along the track thereof, except where the same is laid across or along a highway, is liable on summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding ten dollars.\nThis provision of the Act was virtually a dead letter so far as this section of this railway was concerned.\nThe undisputed facts as I gather them were that the deceased was killed on the evening of the 10th day of February, 1917. An engine and tender had left Joggins Mines during the afternoon helping a heavily loaded train out beyond Strathcona. The engine and tender took a side track to permit the loaded train to go by and then backed to Joggins Mines. The whistle was out of order on the return trip and could not be used. Darkness had set in. There were no lights on either the engine or tender. Snow was falling fast and the wind was high and blowing in the direction from Joggins Mines to Strathcona. The fireman gave evidence that the frost on the window prevented him seeing; that he didn't see anything; that he could not see out. The driver gave evidence that he could not see and again that he could not see much, sometimes he could see the tender and sometimes he could not. The snow was resting on the ground unevenly so that in some places the rails were covered and in other places they were bare. It was on this return trip from Strathcona back to Joggins Mines that the deceased was overtaken by the defendant's engine and tender, and killed. The accident occurred between Strathcona and River Hebert. The deceased was a physician residing in the village of River Hebert. On the afternoon in question he had gone out to Strathcona on the loaded train before referred to, to make a professional call, and after making this call he was seen to return to the railroad and start towards River Hebert. He was not seen again alive.\nThe plaintiff contends that she is entitled to recover because of the habitual and unchecked use by the public of the railroad to the knowledge of, the company's servants and employees, and of the facts that the engine which ran down the deceased was not at the time of the accident equipped with either a whistle or with lights, and was running backwards, making it difficult, if not impossible, for the men in the engine cab to observe a man on the track owing to the obstruction caused by the tender and that owing to its defective whistle it had not given the usual signal at the railway crossing a short distance from the place of the accident to warn persons on the track.\nIn my opinion, the evidence in the case amply warranted the several findings of the jury.\nThe chief defence relied upon by the company was that the deceased in walking on the track as and when he did was, under the section of the statute quoted above, a trespasser to whom they did not owe any duty beyond that of not wilfully injuring him.\nApart altogether from the statute I do not entertain any doubt whatever of the liability of the company.\nThe findings of the jury supported, in my opinion, by ample evidence substantially were that the absence of lights and the defective whistle were the proximate cause of the accident which the deceased, though careless, could not have avoided; that the public habitually travelled along the defendant's railway at the place in question, of which fact the company had notice but never interfered to stop or prevent; that the deceased had no reason to believe an engine would overtake him without blowing a whistle at Pugsley's crossing, and without carrying lights, and that the absence of the whistle and the lights prevented deceased from knowing the engine was coming along; that such an engine without lights and not sounding a whistle at Pugsley's crossing was more likely to kill a foot passenger at the point where the deceased was killed than an engine with lights which sounded a whistle at Pugsley's crossing, and that the running of such an engine under the circumstances was a careless but not a reckless disregard of human life.\nUnder these findings upon which I think the case must be determined it seems to me clear that the deceased was not a mere trespasser on the track, but that he was, at the time he was killed, there by the tacit permission and consent of the company and at the lowest was a bare licencee to whom, however, they owed a duty not, indeed, of the same character as that which they owed to a passenger on their train but still a duty clear and defined, namely, not to increase the normal or ordinary risks which the licensee would\" incur when exercising the permission or licence granted to him. In the case of Gallagher v. Humphrey[7], Cockburn C.J. in delivering the judgment of a very strong court, stated the law to be as follows:\u2014\nI doubt whether on the pleadings and this rule it is competent to enter into the question of negligence, and whether the whole matter does not turn upon the question whether permission was or was not given to the plaintiff to pass along the way. But I should be sorry to decide this case upon that narrow ground. I quite agree that a person who merely gives permission to pass and repass along his close is not bound to do more than allow the enjoyment of such permissive right under the circumstances in which the way exists; that he is not bound, for instance, if the way passes along the side of a dangerous ditch or along the edge of a precipice to fence off the ditch or precipice. The grantee must use the permission as the thing exists. It is a different question, however, where negligence on the part of the person granting the permission is superadded. It cannot be that, having granted permission to use a way subject to existing dangers, he is to be allowed to do any further act to endanger the safety of the person using the way. The plaintiff took the permission to use the way subject to a certain amount of risk and danger, but the case assumes a different aspect when the negligence of the defendant\u2014for the negligence of his servants is his\u2014is added to that risk and danger.\nI have not found any case where this statement of the law is either challenged or impugned.\nIn a later case of Thatcher v. The Great Western Rly. Co.[8], Lord Esher M.R. said\nthat if a person was on the premises of another with that other's consent, the latter had a duty to take reasonable care not to act in such a way as to cause personal injury to the former. It was the business of a railway company to carry as passengers persons who came to their stations for the purpose of travelling to various destinations. It was a matter of every day occurrence that, when persons intending to be passengers came to railway stations, their friends came with them to see them off. The company knew that it was the practice of passengers' friends so to come to their stations, and they permitted them to come. They knew that whenever two persons came to the station it might well be that one of them was not intending to travel, but merely came to see the other off. What duty had the railway company to those persons? No doubt in strict logic they had not the same amount of duty to them as they had to persons who paid them money in consideration of being carried as passengers. But, so far as regarded the taking of means for providing for personal safety, it was impossible to measure the difference between their duty to the one class of persons and their duty to the other. In short, it was their duty to take reasonable care with regard to both. The defendants, therefore, owed the plaintiff the duty to take reasonable care not to do anything to endanger his personal safety. Such duty had been recognized in Holmes v. North-Eastern Railway Co.[9], and Watkins v. Great Western Railway Co.[10]. The case of Tough v. North British Railway Co.[11], decided by the Court of Session, Scotland, in 1914, consisting of Lords Salvesen, Guthrie, Ormidale and Lord Justice Clerk, approves entirely of the judgment in Thatcher v. The Great Western Rly. Co.[12], referred to above and decided that\na person who goes upon premises as a mere licencee is not there at his own risk if he suffers injury through the negligent act of the servants of the owner committed, in the course of their employment, after the licensee has entered the premises. (1).\nThe latest case on this branch of the appeal is that of Lowery v. Walker, decided by the House of Lords[13], reversing the decisions of the Divisional Court and also of the Court of Appeal.\nThe material facts in this case were that the defendant, who owned a savage horse which he knew to be dangerous to mankind, put it, without giving any warning, into a field of which he was the occupier and which he knew the public were in the habit of crossing without leave on the way to a railway station. The plaintiff in crossing that field was attacked, bitten and stamped on by the horse. The County Court judge found as a fact that the defendant was guilty of negligence in putting a horse which he knew to be ferocious in a field which he knew to be habitually crossed by the public and gave judgment accordingly.\nThe House of Lords, reversing the decisions of the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal which had held the defendant occupier not liable, held that the effect of the learned judge's finding that the plaintiff appellant was in the field without express leave but with the permission of the defendant entitled the plaintiff to recover.\nThe Lord Chancellor, Lord Loreburn, says, at page 12:\u2014 I think the substance of the finding (of the trial judge) amounts to this, that the plaintiff was not proved to be in this field of right; that he was there as one of the public who habitually used the field to the knowledge of the defendant; that the defendant did not take steps to prevent that user; and in those circumstances it cannot be lawful that the defendant should with impunity allow a horse which he knew to be a savage and dangerous beast to be lodged in that field without giving any warning whatever, either to the plaintiff or to the public, of the dangerous character of the animal.\nThe other Law Lords all concurred expressing themselves substantially to the same effect as the Lord Chancellor, viz., that, although the plaintiff was not proved to be in the field as of right, he was one of the public who habitually used the field to the occupier's knowledge and without his having taken steps to prevent the user and in those circumstances was liable for the injuries inflicted on the plaintiff by the savage horse.\nApplying to this case the principles on which Lowery v. Walker[14], was decided, I cannot see, leaving for the moment the question of the statute aside, how it is possible for the company in this case successfully to argue their non-liability for the death of the deceased doctor. Instead of a savage horse as in the Lowery Case14, we have in this case as Mr. Justice Ritchie says in his judgment\nan engine running on a windy stormy night, backwards, an extra trip, not a regular train, without lights and a defective (in fact, useless) whistle put on the track and set in motion.\nThe jury have found this constitutes negligence and that the deceased was prevented from knowing that the engine was coming by the absence of the whistle and lights.\nIf the jury had found that the running backwards under the circumstances of such an engine shewed a reckless disregard of human life, I cannot believe the company would not be held liable. The fact that they found it was only a careless disregard of human life, cannot, in my judgment, absolve the company from liability.\nDublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway Co. v. Slattery[15], is in some aspects instructive on this appeal. For instance, on the question of notices having been put up forbidding persons to cross the line at a particular point, it was held that these notices having been continually disregarded by the public and the company's servants not having interfered to enforce their observance, the company could not in the case of an injury occurring to any one crossing the line at that point, set up the existence of the notices by way of answer to an action for damages for such injury.\nThe English text books on the subject are to the same effect as to the liability and obligations of the railway company to a licencee. See 21 Halsbury, sec. 660 and notes, and Salmon on Law of Torts, pp. 400 to 404.\nThe decisions of the courts in the United States, though of course not binding on us, are to the same effect as those English cases to which I have referred with respect to the rights of licencees or persons permitted to use lands or premises of an occupier or owner.\nIn the case of Davis v. Chicago and North West Ely. Co.[16], it was held by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, after citing amongst other authorities that of Gallagher v. Humphrey[17], and quoting Chief Justice Cockburn's judgment in that case with approval, that\nwhere the right of way of a railway company has been in constant use by travellers on foot for more than 20 years, without objection from the company, it is for the jury to say whether the company acquiesced in such user. Such a user, while not establishing a public highway upon the company's right of way, would relieve the persons passing over the same from being treated as trespassers by the company. There is a clear distinction between the care which a railroad company is bound to exercise towards mere trespassers and towards those who are on its right of way by the licence of the company, and in case of a long and constant user of such way the company and its servants are charged with notice of it, and cannot neglect precautions to prevent danger to persons travelling thereon. Wilful injury is not the only ground of liability in such a case.\nIn Corrigan v. Union Sugar Refinery[18], Gray J. in delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court of that State, said:\u2014\nThe material question is, whether the keg fell upon the plaintiff's head by reason of the negligence of the defendants' servants. If it did, then whether this was a public or a private way, and whether the plaintiff was passing over it in the exercise of a public right, or upon an express or implied invitation or inducement of the defendants, or by their mere permission, he was rightfully there, and may maintain this action. Even if he was there under a permission which they might at any time revoke and under circumstances which did not make them responsible for any defect in the existing condition of the way, they were still liable for any negligent act of themselves or their servants, which increased the danger of passing and in fact injured him.\nSee also to the same effect the judgment of the Court of Appeal, State of New York, Barry v. New York Central and Hudson River Railroad Co.[19].\nFrom all the cases I have referred to I find the law of England and of Scotland and of many of the United States of America is the same, namely, that while a mere licencee entering upon premises of the owner does so at his own risk with regard to all normal and ordinary risks which he may incur or be subject to on the premises, the licenser, owner or occupier remains liable to him for injuries caused to him by abnormal and extraordinary risks brought about or introduced through the negligence of the licenser or his servants.\nPassing now from this branch of the case to the effect of the provision of the Nova Scotia Railway Act, sec. 264, before cited, it will be observed that the section only makes every person not connected with the railway or employed by the company who walks along the track thereof liable to a penalty not exceeding ten dollars.\nThe section does not intend or purport to deal with the rights or obligations of such person so offending to the company or with those of the company to such person.\nWhether such person, being one of the general public, had express or implied authority from the company to walk upon the railway would not matter as affecting his liability for the penalty.\nIf sued for the penalty, proof of such express or limited authority would not be any defence. The section was passed as a matter of public policy and was not intended in any way to interfere with the rights or obligations of the parties to each other in the exercise of a permission by the company to walk on the track.\nWhen the legislature intended to interfere with or take away such civil or private rights they said so in express terms. See sections 189 and 262(3), the former of which says\u2014\n189. The persons for whose use farm crossings are furnished, shall keep the gates at each side of the railway closed when not in use; and no person, any of whose cattle are killed by any train owing to the non-observance of this section, shall have any right of action against any company in respect to the same being killed.\nand the latter of which reads as follows:\u2014\n262. If the cattle of any person, which are at large contrary to the provision of this section, are killed or injured by any train at such point of intersection, he shall not have any right of action against any company in respect to the same being so killed or injured.\nThe legislature, in the section we are interested in, merely imposed a penalty for walking on the track. It uses no language which can be construed as interfering with the relative legal rights of the offending person and the railway. It simply declares a public policy breach of which gave rise to a penalty.\nWhile therefore, in my judgment, no railway could alter that policy or prevent the attached penalty from being enforced against any offender by any consent it might give, on the other hand, the section carefully abstained from interfering with the private or civil rights or obligations which might arise between the parties by reason of any person walking on the railway track with the permission of the railway.\nThe penalty for breach of the public policy was absolute whether the railway assented to the breach or not. The obligations of the railway to one to whom it gave permission so to walk were not interfered with or done away with. Could it for a moment be successfully contended that a wilful injury done to such a licencee from the railway, by its servants, was without remedy. I certainly think not and that such a result never was intended and equally so do I think it was not intended to take away the civil right from such licensee of suing for damages sustained by the negligence of the company in adding additional dangers and risks to those which the licensee assumed in accepting the licence and from which additional dangers and risks he suffered damage. The case of Davis v. North Western Railway Co.[20], above cited by me on the other branch of the case, expressly determines that such a statute making it an offence to walk upon the track does not alter the rule. No authority was cited to us in support of the appellant's contention that the section imposing a penalty merely made a person violating it a trespasser and took from him civil rights which he otherwise would possess as licencee against the company giving him such licence. It seems to me, however, that the language used by the Judicial Committee in the case of Rex v. Broad,[21], is an authority to the contrary of appellant's contention. It was there held that sec. 191, sub-sec. 2 of the Public Works Act, 1908, of New Zealand, suspended during the period therein referred to the absolute right of the public to pass along a highway over a level crossing but left unaffected the right of those who did so pass to have reasonable care exercised by the railway authority in using the line. Lord Robson, who delivered their Lordships' judgment, says, at page 115:\u2014\nThe language of the sub-section is amply satisfied by holding that on the specified approach of a train the public's absolute right to pass is suspended leaving unaffected the question of other rights if nevertheless persons do pass.\nI adopt this language and think it peculiarly applicable to the penalty clause in question.\nOn the whole I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIdjngton J.\u2014This is an action by respondent, the widow and administratrix of the late Dr. Herdman, for damages arising from his death alleged to have been caused by the wrongful act or negligence of the appellant.\nDeceased on returning from a professional visit to a patient attempted to do so by walking on the railway track of appellant instead of travelling by the common highway, and is found to have met his death by a locomotive and tender moving backward at the rate of about ten miles an hour and overtaking and knocking him down.\nThis occurred after dark in the evening in February, 1917, in the midst of a snowstorm described by some as \"an awful storm\" and by others as \"blustery and very cold.\"\nThe locomotive and tender were returning from a short run taken to assist a train up a heavy grade of a mile or more to a station a few miles distant from River Hebert, the home town of deceased, and the station where this ancilliary engine was kept. The case was tried before Mr. Justice Drysdale with a jury, who answered ten questions submitted to them, and in answer to the eleventh assessed the damages at $6,000 for which judgment was entered; and that has been maintained by a majority of the Court of Appeal.\nThe first two questions and answers are as follows:\u2014\n1. Was the proximate cause of the accident that killed Dr. Herdman the negligence of the company? If so, state it. What was it? Yes, not having lights and a defective whistle.\n2. Notwithstanding such negligence, could Dr. Herdman, by the exercise of reasonable care, have avoided the accident? We think the doctor was careless but could not have avoided the accident.\nThe accident did not take place at or so near to any crossing, at or approaching which there might have been involved the breach of a statutory duty to give warning.\nThe only statutory duty seems to have been, in that regard, to either ring a bell or whistle at certain distances from a highway crossing.\nThese obligations were fully discharged, as sworn to by the engine driver and fireman in charge, and there is no contradictory evidence on the point.\nThe whistle was in fact by reason of the frost, as I understand, out of service.\nThe sole ground of complaint in law, upon which the judgment rests, is that people in the neighbourhood had been habitually using the railway track, as so often happens, when inclined to take a shorter way in pursuit of any chance errand; and that no one had been prosecuted for doing so though the evil practice had been of such frequent occurrence that local officials of the appellant might be presumed to have had notice of its existence.\nThe railway track was fenced in, and not the slightest suggestion was made that it had been conceded as a public highway.\nIt is merely the toleration of such an evil practice, as pedestrians in many instances adopted, knowing, as some of them frankly said, they did it at their own risk, or, as many others said, without ever thinking of the consequences, that is relied on.\nThere was a railway bridge over the river in the vicinity, on which some of them crossed; and as an electric line was carried over it a large printed notice had been posted in 1915, by direction of appellant's superintendent, at each end of it, on which was inscribed a warning:\u2014\nDanger, keep off; this means you.\nNo other notices of warning against trespassing are in evidence.\nThe statute law of Nova Scotia contains a provision prohibiting the walking on any railway track, and providing for a penalty being imposed upon any such trespassers.\nThere is not in that province any provision, such as exists in some provinces, for punishing in like manner petty trespassers on other property.\nIt is thus clear that what the deceased, on the occasion in question did, and others had been doing, in the way of walking on the track was illegal and rendered him liable to a penalty.\nThe appellant relies, and I think rightly, upon the decision of this court in the case of the Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Anderson[22], and other eases holding that there can be no recovery for damages suffered under such circumstances unless something else, than apparent herein, shewing gross negligence, or wilful misconduct on the part of those concerned on behalf of the railway company.\nThe learned trial Judge relied upon the case of Lowery v. Walker[23].\nThe charge of the learned trial judge to the jury was obviously influenced by his view of the said decision and hence some of the findings of the jury.\nThe Court of Appeal adopt the same view and think it is supported by other cases.\nI cannot agree that there is anything in that or other cases relied upon, which in principle is applicable to the undisputed facts in this case, and that they did not present a case which should have been submitted to a jury.\nI fail to see the resemblance between a railway company running its engine, in course of its daily and hourly exercise of right and discharge of duty, and that of a man who has in fact permitted a pathway to be used across his field with no dangerous animals therein, suddenly and without warning rendering the pathway highly dangerous by turning a vicious animal at large therein.\nEven assuming all that is alleged to be true, as to the use by pedestrians of appellant's track, to the knowledge of its management, the risk has never been increased or use of the track for what it was built for changed in the slightest.\nIf the right of way had been out of use for a time and then suddenly and without warning put into active service, some analogy might be found in doing so to what the Lowery Case[24] presents.\nBut in fact this engine was running just as it was accustomed to do about the same hour, if not daily, at least on an average every other day in the week.\nThe distance home for the deceased, where he was going, was shewn to be some three hundred feet longer by the railway than by the road.\nThe circumstances shew that he chose the railway track instead of the highway because the latter was deeply covered with snow and the railway track not so, because the cars and engines were running thereon and brushing aside or crushing down the snow.\nIt is not for the courts to impose a new mode of running a railway, or upon those doing so, a new code of regulations for the protection of trespassers.\nThere are cases such as in evidence in the well known Slattery Case[25], where the station arrangements were such as to mislead, or regulations at crossings such as in The King v. Broad[26], make the conflicting duties of those using the highway and those running the railway often the subject of anxious inquiry, and require a rigorous enforcement of statutory regulations, lest the unwary and accidental trespasser may be caught and a case to submit to a jury arise.\nWe had such a case in Garside v. Grand Trunk Railway Co. (not reported) a year or two ago in which I had no doubt the deceased was technically trespassing upon the unfenced land of the railway company, yet we maintained the right of action because of the neglect by those running an engine to observe the statutory duties of giving warning.\nIt was attempted there to shew that a bar across the highway served same as in the Broad Case[27], since reported, took away all right to cross and with it a remedy for killing the pedestrian.\nWherever there is a statutory duty imposed it must be observed. We have no right to create such a duty.\nNo obligations rested upon the appellant towards the protection of the deceased in the way of lights or whistles.\nOf course its servants would have no right to run him down knowingly or recklessly, any more than the defendant in the case of Davies v. Mann[28], had a right to run down the donkey tethered in the highway, or many a like offender has done since.\nThere is nothing to bring this case within that line of cases. I think the appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs throughout.\nAnglin J. (dissenting) concurs with the Chief Justice.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs of this court and of the courts below for the reasons given by my brother Idington.\nMignault J.\u2014This is a case of very considerable difficulty.\nThe respondent's husband, Dr. W. W. Herdman, who lived at River Hebert, was killed while walking on the track of the appellant company, on the evening of the 10th February, 1917, between the village of River Hebert and Strathcona, Nova Scotia. The appellant there operates a line of railway which crosses the river on a bridge and goes up by a rather steep grade toward Strathcona and then continues on to a place called Jubilee. On the afternoon in question a regular train left Joggins, the other side of River Hebert, a little after 4.30 p.m., and was hauled, on account of the grade, by two engines, the front one, an old engine, driven by Forrest, the engineer, with Landry as fireman. This front engine was used for getting the train up the grade and at Jubilee it usually returned backwards, tender first, to Joggins. Dr. Herdman, that afternoon, took the train at River Hebert to visit a patient at Strathcona, where he got out, made his visit and then telephoned at 6.30 p.m. to his wife that he would immediately return. The night was a cold and very stormy one, with some snow and a high wind blowing across the railway. Dr. Herdman wore a raccoon coat and started out pulling up his collar and pushing down his cap over his ears. Unfortunately he chose to return by the railway track, a short cut which, the evidence shews, was very commonly used by men, women and even children in preference to the road which Dr. Herdman could have taken but which probably on such a night would have been a difficult one for a pedestrian to travel on. Later in the evening Dr. Herdman's body was found between the rails a short distance from the railway bridge.\nHe was killed by Forrest's engine which was returning to Joggins from Jubilee, tender first and without any headlight or any light on the tender. Forrest started from Joggins about 6.15 p.m., and having got his engine under way, shut off the steam and ran down the grade at a moderate speed. His whistle had become disconnected before reaching Jubilee, and he was unable to repair it on account of the escaping steam before he started to return. He therefore could not whistle at Pugsley's crossing, just before Strathcona, but his fireman rang the bell more or less continuously, with however some interruption, the latter says, when he got down from his seat to feed his fire. Both Forrest and Landry say that the storm was so severe that they could not see out of the cab window on account of the frost, and they did not think any one would be on the tracks on such a night. They never saw the victim and did not know that he had been killed until his body was found.\nThe case was tried before Mr. Justice Drysdale and a jury, and the latter have found as follows:\u2014\n1. Was the proximate cause of the accident that killed Dr. Herdman the negligence of the company? If so, state it. What was it? Yes, not having lights and a defective whistle.\n2. Notwithstanding such negligence, could Dr. Herdman by the exercise of reasonable care have avoided the accident? We think the doctor was careless but could not have avoided the accident.\n3. Up to the time that Dr. Herdman was killed did the public habitually travel along the defendants' railroad between the villages of Strathcona and River Hebert? Yes.\n4. If so, did the defendant company have notice of it? Yes.\n5. Before Dr. Herdman was killed did the defendant company interfere with persons so travelling along the railway? No.\n6. Had Dr. Herdman reason to believe that an engine would overtake him without blowing the whistle at Pugsley's crossing and without carrying lights? No.\n7. Was Dr. Herdman prevented from knowing that the engine was coming by the absence of the whistle and lights? Yes.\n8. Was an engine running without lights and not sounding a whistle at Pugsley's crossing, more likely to kill a foot passenger at the point where Dr. Herdman was killed than an engine with lights and sounding a whistle at Pugsley's crossing? Yes.\n9. Was the running of the engine which killed Dr. Herdman, without lights and without sounding a whistle at Pugsley's crossing a reckless disregard of human life? No, but consider it careless.\n10. What amount of damages do you find; and how much do you allow to the widow and how much to the daughter? $6,000, divided as follows: widow $2,500, daughter $3,500.\nIn accordance with this verdict judgment was entered against the appellant for $6,000.00, and on an appeal to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, this judgment was affirmed by a court consisting of Russell, Longley and Ritchie JJ. Mr. Justice Longley dissenting. The appellant now appeals to this court.\nThe jury having negatived contributory negligence on the part of Dr. Herdman\u2014and I do not think that I should interfere with their finding, whatever doubts I might feel on this point in view of all the circumstances\u2014the appellant can, in my opinion, succeed only if it shews, 1st, that Dr. Herdman was a trespasser on its line, and 2nd, that assuming he was a trespasser, it has discharged any duty it owed to him as such trespasser.\nTo answer the first question regard must be had to the facts found by the jury that up to the time that Dr. Herdman was killed the public habitually travelled along the appellant's railroad between the villages of Strathcona and River Hebert; that the appellant had notice of it and did not interfere with persons so travelling on the railway. Assuming these facts, was Dr. Herdman a trespasser?\nSection 264 of chapter 99 of the R.S.N.S., enacts that\nevery person, not connected with the railway or employed by the company who walks along the track thereof, except where the same is laid across or along a highway, is liable on summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding ten dollars.\nThe courts below relied on the decision of the House of Lords in Lowery v. Walker[29], which in their opinion is not distinguishable from the present case. There the respondent, without giving any warning, put a savage horse which he knew to be dangerous to mankind, in a field of which he was the occupier and which he knew the public were in the habit of crossing without leave on their way to the railway station. The appellant in crossing the field was attacked, bitten and stamped on by the horse. The County Court judge found as a fact that the respondent was guilty of negligence in putting a horse which he knew to be ferocious into a field which he knew to be habitually crossed by the public, and gave judgment for the appellant. This judgment was reversed by the Divisional Court[30], and by the Court of Appeal[31], but the House of Lords set aside both these judgments, holding that the effect of the trial judge's finding being that the appellant was in the field without express leave but with the permission of the respondent, the appellant was entitled to recover.\nIn this case their Lordships construed the finding of fact of the trial judge as meaning that the appellant was in the respondent's field not as a trespasser but with the permission of the respondent, and they applied the law to this finding of fact.\nThe appellant cites another case, Grand Trunk Rly. Co. v. Barnett[32], where the respondent was undoubtedly a trespasser on the platform of a railway car where he was injured. The case was considered upon this basis by the Judicial Committee, and the respondent's action claiming damages for his injuries was dismissed. Lord Robson, speaking for the Privy Council, held that the obligation of the railway company was merely not to wilfully injure the respondent, that is to say\nthey were not entitled, unnecessarily and knowingly, to increase the normal risk by deliberately placing unexpected dangers in his way.\nThe real difficulty, to my mind, is the statute which I have cited, and I have not been able to convince myself that what the House of Lords decided in Lowery v. Walker[33], with respect to a field over which, according to the findings of the trial judge, as construed by the House of Lords, the owner or occupier permitted the public to pass, can be applied to a railway line where the law punishes with a fine\nevery person not connected with the railway or employed by the company who walks along the track thereof.\nIf mere passiveness of a railway company could be regarded as a defence against a criminal action for trespass, the statute, which undoubtedly was enacted for the protection of the public as well as of railway companies, would soon become a dead letter. Dr. Herdman chose to walk upon the track, as hundreds of people had done before him, probably because he was hurrying to attend a sick call, and his motive was no doubt a good one, but he did so at his own risk and was, in my opinion, a trespasser on the railway. On this point I think Lowery v. Walker[34], is clearly distinguishable from the present case and moreover their Lordships there proceeded upon a statement of facts found by the trial judge which, as construed by them, went further than the facts found in this case by the jury.\nWhen the evidence as to this user by the public of the railway tracks is examined it is seen that two witnesses, Charles A. Smith and Stuart Rector, say they walked on the railway track at their own risk, one, Rufus S. Hibbard, supposed that in doing so he was a trespasser, and William McIsaac admits that he did not think he had any right to walk on the track. All these were witnesses for the plaintiff. Other witnesses never considered whether or not they had a right to thus use the railway, but did so because they saw others walking along the tracks. The railway was fenced in and a notice of warning was placed on the railway bridge. All this evidence shews a state of facts materially different from what was found in Lowery v. Walker[35].\nThe second question is, assuming that Dr. Herdman was a trespasser on the right of way, did the appellant discharge any duty it owed him not to injure him wilfully, according to the rule laid down by the Privy Council in Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Barnett[36]. In other words did it\nunnecessarily and knowingly increase the normal risk by deliberately placing unexpected dangers in his way?\nThe findings of the jury do not justify an affirmative answer to this question, which would involve a reckless disregard of human life. The jury refused to find any such reckless disregard of human life and they would not go any further than to state that the running of the engine without lights and without sounding a whistle at Pugsley's crossing was careless. I therefore must answer this question in the negative.\nThe case is one where every sympathy may legitimately be felt for the victim of this accident, who, I think, was hurrying to attend to a sick call when he was unfortunately killed. But this sympathy would not justify me in making the appellant pay damages in a case where I am convinced no legal liability exists.\nThe appeal must therefore, in my opinion, be allowed and the plaintiff's action dismissed. The appellant is entitled to its costs here and in the courts below if it thinks fit to collect them from the respondent.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: John S.

[1906] c. 37, s. 155.\nWhere land is injuriously affected by construction of railway works, the owner is not entitled to compensation for loss of business profits resulting therefrom. Such compensation can be given only when land is taken.\nIn the construction of section 155 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d the English decisions under the \u201cRailway Clauses Consolidation Act\u201d of 1845 to the above effect should be followed. Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissenting.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (45 Ont. L.R. 1; 47 D.L.R. 587), reversed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], setting aside the award of arbitrators and referring the case back for reconsideration.\nThe appellant company by constructing a subway on Yonge street, Toronto, so lowered the grade of the street in front of respondent\u2019s shop as to practically destroy access thereto. An arbitration was had to fix the compensation for such injury and the award gave appellant, inter alia, $4,500 for injury to her business. The Appellate Division held that she was entitled to indemnity for loss of business but that the arbitrators had estimated it on a wrong basis and referred the award back to be dealt with as stated in the judgment. Geary K.C. and Colquhoun for the appellant. Respondent is not entitled to compensation for loss of business when no land is taken. Metropolitan Board of Works v. McCarthy[2]; Caledonian Railway Co. v. Walker\u2019s Trustees[3]; Powell v. Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Ry. Co.[4]; Leblanc v. The King[5].\nH.J. Scott K.C. for the respondent. The English cases respecting compensation for loss of business are not applicable in Canada owing to the difference between our \u201cRailway Act\u201d and the Acts on which those decisions were founded. See Parkdale v. West[6], at p. 613. Section 155 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d obliges the company to make full compensation for injury, which means to place the injured party in as good a position as he was before.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE. \u2014 I concur with my brother Anglin.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The question raised by this appeal is confined to whether or not under section 155 of the \u201cRailway Act, \u201cwhich reads as follows,\n155. The company shall, in the exercise of the powers by this or the special Act granted, do as little damage as possible, and shall make full compensation, in the manner herein and in the special Act provided, to all persons interested, for all damage by them sustained by reason of the exercise of such powers,\nthe compensation recoverable thereunder is limited by the exact market value of the property taken or, in the case of its being injuriously affected, by the exact difference in such market value before and after it has been so injuriously affected by the exercise of the power in question. In view of the uniform approval heretofore of this and other courts to the allowance of ten per cent. generally added by arbitrators to the market value of the property taken, the proposition that the market price is the utmost limit seems a little startling.\nYet such a proposition seems to be the basis of this appeal which has one merit that it is confined to one exceedingly narrow point.\nTrue this case in which the question is raised seems to be one in which the right of property which was invaded was a taking away in two places of the means of access to, and egress from, same to the public highway, and the incidental support an owner is entitled to for his buildings; and thus in one way of looking at the matter may be fairly arguable as a case of injuriously affecting the property.\nI incline to agree with the learned arbitrator, as I understand him, that there has been taken from the owner a very substantial part of that which constituted her dominion over or ownership of the property as its owner and that the case is not merely an injurious affection such as might arise from a neighbouring nuisance.\nWe held in the case of Canadian Northern Ontario Rly. Co. v. Holditch[7], that where the railway company did not touch or legally injure, by the exercise of its powers, a parcel of land as defined by the plan of its survey, the owner could not recover any compensation on either ground and in this were upheld by the court above[8]. How that and numerous other well known cases cited here and below can affect the question to be resolved herein, I fail to see.\nIt is admitted that the respondent had a very substantial right to indemnity under the Act and all that is before us, as counsel for appellant frankly admitted, is whether or not a person so damnified as to be entitled to indemnity is confined to the difference between the market value of the property when the works touched it and when completed and is not entitled to have any consideration extended to her by reason of the forcible taking away of her rights in any way, such as in this case the disturbance of her business carried on in the premises in question.\nWe are not called upon to decide anything in relation to the measure of such damages, or the bearing of any of the elemental facts to demonstrate the cause of such loss or the extent to which they should be considered.\nThe bare right to any consideration of how injuriously or otherwise the exercise of the power may have affected the owner or her business is denied save as to diminution in market value of the land itself or buildings thereon.\nI am and long have been of a different opinion, as evidenced by what I may be pardoned for shewing by quoting from my opinion in the case of Dodge v. The King[9], at page 155, as follows:\u2014\nThe market price of lands taken ought to be the prim\u00e2 facie basis of valuation in awarding compensation for land expropriated. The compensation, for land used for a special purpose by the owner, must usually have added to the usual market price of such land a reasonable allowance measured by possibly the value of such use, and at all events the value thereof to the using owner, and, the damage done to his business carried on therein, or thereon, by reason of his being turned out of possession\nThat opinion was concurred in by the majority of the court.\nIt is fair to say that the exact question raised herein was not what was in fact under consideration therein and hence binds no one but myself; yet it was the result of much consideration of many decisions and other authorities.\nThe usual ten per cent. allowance I therein referred to is intended to cover contingencies of many kinds. Experience teaches me it has served to prevent injustice in many cases and in most covers incidentally the loss for disturbance of business and possible removal. It is not a rule of law though sometimes it has been sought to be made so for the service of those who actually bought lands they expected to be expropriated and gain thereby. In such like cases it has been discarded by this court when observing that its misapplication had been sought.\nThe rule now sought by this appeal to be laid down as the meaning of the section 155 in relation to damages for which compensation is to be given certainly never could have been thought to be law or the allowance of such percentage should have been discarded long ago.\nIn the case of Lake Erie and Northern Rly Co. v. Schooley[10], the question of business value came up in this court in another way and the several judgments evidence how the question was viewed by the different members of this court. I may say that was for many reasons an unsatisfactory sort of case.\nThe then Chief Justice aptly put the point by relying upon the decision of the Judicial Committee in the case of Pastoral Finance Association v. The Minister[11], from which, on page 417, he quoted as follows:\u2014\nThe substantial ground on which the majority of the court based their decision was that the appellants were not entitled to anything beyond the market value of the land * * * Their Lordships have no hesitation in deciding that the principle underlying this decision is erroneous. The appellants were clearly entitled to receive compensation based on the value of the land to them.\nThis last sentence illustrates what runs through all the cases where the question has fairly come up, and whether put under the name of \u201cspecial adaptations\u201d or designated by other like phrase, means nothing more nor less than that justice must be done the owner whose land is taken or affected.\nIn resorting to English authorities decided on the meaning of the \u201cLands Clauses Consolidation Act,\u201d we must ever be on our guard; for, as has been often and well said, the provisions differ so essentially from our provisions in the \u201cRailway Act\u201d and other legislation dealing with compensation to be given parties damnified by the exercise of powers given to expropriate that little value is to be attached to most of these English decisions that are usually and herein cited for determining such questions as raised herein.\nThe difference is not to the casual reader quite evident. It is when one has to examine the process of reasoning and difference of opinion by which the result was reached in the earlier leading cases, such as Hammersmith and City Ry. Co. v. Brand[12], and the consequences flowing therefrom in so many cases, that one feels we better observe the express terms of our own legislation which does not give occasion for the application of the same process of reasoning. It is idle to read only two sections, one from each Act, and compare the words when we know, or ought to know, that the said decision did not turn upon the consideration of only a single section in the English Act.\nFor this opinion I need not rely upon what a consideration of many such cases has impressed upon my mind but am content to submit the following quotation cited to us in argument herein by respondent\u2019s counsel from the judgment of the court above in Parkdale v. West[13], at page 613:\u2014\nThere is a marked difference between the provisions of the Dominion Act and those of the \u201cEnglish Land Clauses Consolidation Act,\u201d 1845, and decisions upon the English Act * * * afford little assistance. In the Dominion Act the taking of land, and the interference with rights over land, are placed on precisely the same footing.\nIt is the last sentence of this that was important there and is herein for that was a case wherein deprivation of access as herein was the essential feature invoked.\nIts due observance coupled with regard to the rule that it is the value of the land to him from whom it is taken for such purposes as he may have been using it that must be primarily observed.\nIn the great majority of cases of compensation the mere market value is decisive and in all cases must be had in mind, but it should never be forgotten that there are cases such as this where that rule is only to be taken in its prim\u00e2 facie sense as the basis for whatever else is done in order to do justice.\nI am not to be taken as expressing any opinion on the merits of the case or coinciding with what the learned arbitrator accepted as his guide for fixing damages.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The grade of the street immediately in front of the respondent\u2019s shop having been so lowered in the course of the construction of a subway ordered by the Board of Railway Commissioners as practically to destroy access to the premises, on an arbitration to fix compensation under the \u201cDominion Railway Act\u201d she was awarded in all $10,866, which the arbitrator, in the written reasons delivered with his award, apportioned as follows:\u2014$6,366 for injury to property and $4,500 for injury to business.\nOn appeal to the Appellate Division the award as to the injury to property was upheld, but the majority of the court being of the opinion that, while the claimant was entitled to compensation for the loss of business occasioned to her by the execution of the work in question in addition to compensation for depreciation in the value of her property, the three year basis on which the arbitrator had fixed the amount of her business loss\nattributable to injury to the good-will of the property\nas distinguished from injury \u201cof a personal character\u201d (about two-thirds of the whole net profits) was erroneous, judgment was pronounced so declaring and referring the matter back to the arbitrator to ascertain the entire compensation to which the claimant is entitled, including as a part thereof such compensation for loss of business as he may see fit to allow her having regard to the declaration of the court[14].\nFrom this judgment the contestant appeals on two grounds:\n(1) That the plaintiff is not entitled to compensation for loss of business in addition to full compensation for depreciation in the value of her property occasioned by the lowering of the street level; and\n(2) That the compensation allowed for the property itself should be reduced by $192, the arbitrator having in computing it deducted from the gross value of the property before the works were begun, ascertained by him to have been $9,274.00, not the $3,100 realized on the sale of it after the works were completed but only $2,908, the difference of $192 representing the claimant\u2019s costs incurred in effecting such sale. Neither the right of the claimant to compensation for depreciation in the value of her property occasioned by the construction of the works nor the power of the Appellate Court to refer the matter back to the arbitrator instead of itself pronouncing the judgment which should have been given is contested by the appellant. As to the former the claimant\u2019s right would seem to be indisputable. There was \u201ca physical interference with a right which the owner was entitled to use in connection with his property\u201d which substantially diminished its value. Metropolitan Board of Works v. McCarthy[15]; Caledonian Rly. Co. v. Walker\u2019s Trustees[16], at page 303; Wood v. Stourbridge Rly. Co[17]; Chamberlain v. West End of London and Crystal Palace Rly. Co.[18] Bowen v. Canada Southern Rly. Co.[19], at pages 8-9, and Mason v. South Norfolk Rly. Co.[20] As to the latter\u2014the power to refer back\u2014the view which I have taken of the merits of this appeal renders it unnecessary to deal with that aspect of the matter. But see Canadian Northern Rly. Co. v. Holditch[21].\nFor the respondent it is contended that the cutting off of immediate access from the property to the highway on which it abuts is tantamount to taking part of the land itself and that compensation should therefore be assessed upon the footing that part of the claimant\u2019s lands had been taken. This appears to have been the opinion of the learned arbitrator based on the view that\nall the rights which go to make the land available for use are part of the land itself. I am clearly of the opinion, however, for the reasons indicated by Mr. Justice Riddell in the Divisional Court and upon such authorities as Wadham v. North Eastern Rly. Co.[22]; McCarthy\u2019s Case[23]; Walker\u2019s Trustees\u2019 Case[24]; Macey v. Metropolitan Board of Works[25], and Bowen v. Canada Southern Rly. Co.[26], that the arbitrator\u2019s view is erroneous and that where no part of the owner\u2019s land is taken, but access to it merely is interfered with, however close the interference and however complete the destruction of the access, the case is one not of the taking of land but of injurious affection.\nWhile, as is stated by the learned writers of the article on \u201cCompulsory Purchase of Land and Compensation\u201d in Halsbury Laws of England, vol. VI., at p. 32, no clear principle can be deduced from the English authorities why the measure of compensation should be more liberal in the case of a taking of land than in that of mere injurious affection, the distinction is too well established in England to admit of further discussion there. In the former case loss of good-will and loss of business in so far as they enhance the value of the land to the owner, including all that forms part of it in the eyes of the law, may be taken into consideration in estimating the compensation. The learned authors of Browne & Allen on Compensation (2 ed., p. 101) suggest that\nthis is because it is the owner\u2019s interest in the land that is to be assessed.\nBut it is equally \u201cthe owner\u2019s interest,\u201d that is affected\u2014it is the value of the land to him that is diminished\u2014in the case of injurious affection. Yet in the latter case to entitle the owner to any compensation the injury must be such as affects the land\u2014lessens its value\u2014apart from the use to which any particular owner or occupier might put it; and profits of a business carried on on the property can properly be considered only in so far as they indicate not any special or exceptional value to the present proprietor, but the value of the property as a marketable article to be employed for any purpose to which it may legitimately and reasonably be put, including of course such a purpose as that for which the present proprietor makes use of it. Wadham v. North Eastern Rly. Co[27]. This decision is very much in point because it deals with a case of injurious affection by cutting off access to a public highway. The street in which the house in question was built had been stopped up. See too Beckett v. Midland Rly. Co.[28], at pages 94-5. The English authorities are collected in Browne and Allen on Compensation (2 ed.) ubi sup. and at p. 116; 6 Halsbury Laws of England, No. 36 and Nos. 49 and 53; and Cripps on Compensation (5 ed.), pp. 107-8 and 146. Many of them are reviewed in the opinions delivered in the Divisional Court in the present case. Under English law an award for loss of business profits in a case of injurious affection cannot be maintained.\nCounsel for the respondent further contended that under s. 155 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d (R.S.C. 1906, ch. 37) she is entitled to compensation for all injury occasioned to her by the exercise of powers conferred by that statute, and that owing to the difference between the provisions of the Dominion \u201cRailway Act\u201d and those of the English \u201cRailway Clauses Consolidation Act\u201d of 1845, and the English \u201cLands Clauses Act\u201d the decisions upon the latter Acts do not govern the construction to be placed upon s. 155 of the Dominion \u201cRailway Act\u201d that under the Canadian Act the taking of land and the injurious affection of land are precisely on the same footing.\nPrior to the enactment in 1888, as s. 92 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d of that year (ch. 29), of the provision now found in the \u201cRailway Act\u201d of 1906 as s. 155, Canadian courts applying the provisions of the \u201cConsolidated Railway Act\u201d of 1879, ch. 9, and the earlier Acts; 31 Vict. ch. 68; C.S.C. ch. 66 and 14 & 15 Vict. ch. 51; had upheld awards of full compensation for all injury occasioned, whether ascribable to the construction of the railway or to its future operation, in cases where an entire parcel of land had been taken, or where part of a parcel had been taken and the injury to the remainder of it was ascribable to the operation of works constructed on the part taken. Great Western Rly. Co. v. Warner[29]; Atlantic and North West Rly Co. v. Wood (expropriation in February, 1887)[30]. But, following English decisions, they had refused to recognize the right of the owner to any compensation where neither his land itself nor a right incidental to its ownership had been physically interfered with so as to lessen the value of the land, In re Widder and Buffalo and Lake Huron Rly. Co[31]; Widder v. Buffalo and Lake Huron Rly. Co.[32]; or for injury due to operation as distinguished from construction where none of his land was taken; In re Devlin and Hamilton and Lake Erie Rly. Co.[33]; or where the works, the operation of which caused the injury, had not been constructed on the portion of his land taken. In Bowen v. Canada Southern Rly. Co.[34], where the lowering of a street in front of two town lots affecting access to them and thus depreciating their value was held to be an injurious affection of land entitling the owner to compensation, Osler J.A. at p. 3, speaking of s. 5 and s.s. 5 of s. 11 of the C.S.C. ch. 66 (the \u201cRailway Act\u201d preceding those of 1868 and 1879), says:\nThese clauses are substantially similar to those in the \u201cRailway and Lands Clauses Consolidation Act\u201d (Imp.)\nSec. 155 of the Act of 1906 (ch. 37) takes the place of s. 5 of ch. 66 of the C.S.C, and s.s. 5 of s. 11 has its counterpart to-day in s. 191.\nIn The Queen v. Buffalo and Lake Huron Rly. Co.[35], at page 211, Draper C.J., delivering the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench, speaking of the English statute, 8 Vict. ch. 18, and particularly of s. 68, and of the 6th section of the English statute 8 Vict. ch. 20, said:\nWe see no solid distinction between the language of these English statutes and that used in our own (C.S.C, ch. 66.)\nThe applicability of the English decisions establishing the distinctions between the measure of compensation in cases where land is taken and that in cases of mere injurious affection would seem to have been fully recognized. See also Widder v. Buffalo and L. Huron Rly. Co.[36]; Paradis v. The Queen[37]; The Queen v. Barry[38]; Leblanc v. The King[39], at page 221; Sisters of Charity v. The King[40] at page 394; The King v. MacArthur[41].\nWith the law in this position, s. 92 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d of 1888, ch. 29, was enacted as a new provision presumably to supply the omission from the Acts of 1868 (ch. 68) and of 1879 (ch. 29) of the express provision for compensation found in s. 5 of the former \u201cRailway Act\u201d, C.S.C. ch. 66, into which it had been carried from 14 & 15 Vict. ch. 51, s. 4; Bowen v. Canada Southern Rly. Co.42, at page 9. The right to compensation under the Acts of 1868 and of 1879 both in regard to land taken and land injuriously affected depended upon the general principle of the law that, unless the contrary clearly appears, legislative intention to authorize the taking away of, or injury to, property without payment of compensation will not be presumed and the almost irresistible inference to be drawn from the provision made for its ascertainment. Burton J.A. thought the omission from the Act of 1879 of a provision similar to s. 5 of ch. 66 of the C.S.C. quite immaterial. Bowen v. Canada Southern Rly. [42], at page 4. Sec. 92 of the Act of 1888 was not meant to create new rights in regard to compensation. At least that was the view taken of it by the courts notwithstanding the patent differences between its terms and those of s. 5 of the C.S.C. ch. 66, and the difference between its collocation in the Canadian \u201cRailway Act\u201d and that of the proviso in the English statute. Section 92 was certainly an adaptation of the proviso of s. 16 of the \u201cRailway Clauses Consolidation Act\u201d of 1845, ch. 20 (Imp.), the language of that proviso being reproduced, with some additions immaterial in the present case. At the date of its introduction there was no provision in the Dominion \u201cInterpretation Act\u201d such as is now found in R.S.C. ch. 1, s. 21, s.s. 4.\nThe construction of this new section so far as applicable to cases of injurious affection was carefully considered in the Ontario Court of Appeal in Powell v. Toronto Hamilton and Buffalo Rly. Co.[43], at page 215, Osler J.A. says:-- The damage intended by s. 92 is some actual injury or damage to lands occasioned by the exercise of the powers of the railway. It is, in short, damage of the same character as that for which compensation is recoverable under the English Acts where no land is taken * * *. Under the Canadian Act * * * it must be held as under the Imperial Acts that, arising as it does from works authorized by the legislature, it must be such as would apart from the statute have been the subject of an action, and it must also be such as to diminish the value of the property irrespective of any particular use which might be made of it.\nMaclennan J.A., at p. 218, refers to the identity of s. 92 with the proviso to s. 16 of the English \u201cRailway Clauses Act,\u201d and adds\nour law is, therefore, substantially the same as the English law.\nMoss J.A. at p. 220, said:\u2014\nThe damage sustained for which compensation is to be made is damage to land, either from taking materials or on account of its being injuriously affected by the exercise of any of the powers granted to the railway. And it is well settled that the compensation recoverable in respect of lands injuriously affected must be based on injury or damage to the estate or land itself and not on personal inconvenience or discomfort to the owner or occupier.\nA similar view had been expressed by Ferguson J. in In re Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Rly. and Kerner, in 1896[44], at page 20. That learned judge regarded as in point Ford v. Metropolitan Rly. Co.[45], where Cotton L.J. points out, at p. 25,\nthat the inconvenience or injury which arises solely from the particular use to which the particular occupier puts the buildings must not be regarded\nand that\ninjuries sustained by them in carrying on their business\ncannot be made the subject of compensation.\nIn St. Catharines Rly. Co. v. Norris[46], in 1889, Galt C.J., following English authorities, held that injury to trade as distinguished from injury to property did not entitle the owner to compensation for injurious affection. With these decisions before it Parliament re-enacted s. 92 of the statute of 1888 in the \u201cConsolidated Railway Act\u201d of 1903, as s. 120 (ch. 58) and again re-enacted it in the revision of 1906 as s. 155 (ch. 37) in ipsissimis verbis. Although s.s. 4 of s. 12 of the \u201cInterpretation Act\u201d (R.S.C. ch. 1, in force since 1890 (53 Vict., ch. 7, s, 1), declares that\nParliament shall not be re-enacting any Act or enactment or by revising, consolidating or amending the same be deemed to have adopted the construction which has, by judicial decision or otherwise, been placed upon the language used in such Act, or upon similar language.\nWe\ncannot assume that the Dominion Legislature when they re-enacted the clause verbatim (in 1903 and again in 1906) were in ignorance of the judicial interpretation which it had received. It must on the contrary be assumed that they understood that (s. 92 of the Act of 1888) must have been acted upon in the light of that interpretation.\nCasgrain v. Atlantic and North West Ry. Co[47], at page 300.\nIt is unreasonable to suppose that if Parliament were not satisfied that its intention had been thereby given effect to it would have re-enacted the section in the same terms. As already pointed out, when the proviso to the English s. 16 was first introduced into Canada we had no such interpretation provision as is now found in s.s. 4 of s. 21 of ch. 1 of the R.S.C. 1906. Arnold v. Dominion Trust Co.[48], at pages 448-9. Under these circumstances, although not bound by the dicta of the eminent Ontario judges to which I have referred, even if I entertained doubts as to the meaning of s. 155 in the present Act, I\nwould have declined to disturb the construction of its language which had been (so often) judicially affirmed.\nCasgrain v. Atlantic and North West Rly. Co.47; City Bank v. Barrow[49], at pages 673, 679. In Canadian Pacific Rly. Co. v. Gordon[50], the applicability of English decisions in regard to the right of compensation in cases of injurious affection under the Dominion \u201cRailway Act\u201d was again recognized by Clute J., who delivered the principal judgment in the Appellate Division in the case now at bar.\nThe decision of the Privy Council in Holditch v. Canadian Northern Rly. Co[51], certainly overrules the view expressed by Armour C.J. in In re Birely and Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Rly. Co.[52], (already \u201cscotched\u201d in Powell v. Toronto Hamilton and Buffalo Rly. Co.[53], that the introduction of s. 92 into the Dominion \u201cRailway Act\u201d of 1888 had effected such a material change in the scope of the provisions for compensation in that Act that in cases where no land had been taken compensation might thereafter be recovered for injuries due to the operation of the railway. Their Lordships there point out (p. 544) that that section (now s. 155) is taken from s. 16 of the English \u201cRailway Clauses Consolidation Act,\u201d 1845, and they approve the application of the English decisions to determine its purview in the Canadian statute. Their earlier decision in Grand Trunk Pacific Rly. Co. v. Fort William Land Investment Co.[54], points in the same direction.\nNotwithstanding the passage from Lord Macnaghten\u2019s judgment in Parkdale v. West[55], at page 616, in which he says\u2014of course obiter\u2014\ntheir Lordships were asked by the appellants to express an opinion as to the measure of damages in case the appeal should be dismissed. It appears to their Lordships that, as the injury committed is complete and of a permanent character, the respondents are entitled to compensation to the full extent of the injury inflicted, to which I allude merely to make it clear that it has not been overlooked, the utmost use that can be made of evidence of loss of business ascribable to the exercise of powers conferred by the \u201cRailway Act\u201d in cases of injurious affection is indicated in my opinion in the following passage from the judgment of Lopes L.J. in Howard v. Metropolitan Board of Works,[56]quoted by Clute J.:\u2014\nThe plaintiff\u2019s house was injuriously affected by the execution of the works and the jury awarded compensation, not for the loss to trade, which would not, per se, be a legitimate head of damage, but for the deterioration in the value of the house as measured by the loss of trade.\nIt is as to the necessity for payment of compensation before interference with the right that cases of injurious affection are held by Lord Macnaghten to stand under the Canadian Act on precisely the same footing as cases of actual taking, in that respect differing from the like cases under English Lands Clauses Consolidation Act of 1846. Parkdale v. West[57].\nIn Parkdale v. West[58], the corporation was held liable as a wrongdoer not protected from the consequences of its tort by any statutory provision, and it was on that basis that Lord Macnaghten thought the municipality liable \u201cto the full extent\u201d and that damages were assessed against it.\nI am, for these reasons, of the opinion that the construction of s. 155 of the Canadian \u201cRailway Act\u201d of 1906 is governed by the English decisions on the purview of the proviso of s. 16 of the \u201cRailway Clauses Consolidation Act\u201d of 1845, and that the respondent is not entitled to compensation for loss of business occasioned by the execution of the works in question. The award should therefore be reduced by $4,500. The respondent has been allowed the full benefit of evidence of loss of business in so far as it affected the value of her property as \u201ca marketable article.\u201d The $9,724 found by the arbitrator to have been its value before the works were begun, represented a valuation on the same basis as the \u00a31,550 allowed in Wadham\u2019s Case[59], i.e., it included any special value which the premises had as a stand for the particular class of business carried on by the respondent.\nThere should also be a further reduction of $192 as claimed by the appellant from the $6,366 allowed for injury to the land for the reasons indicated by Riddell and Kelly JJ. in the court below. The award will therefore stand for the sum of $6,174\u2014and costs.\nThe appellant is entitled to its costs in this court and in the Appellate Division.\nBRODEUR J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario which referred back to the arbitrator an award concerning lands for which the respondent claims compensation.\nThe appellant company for the purpose of building a subway in the City of Toronto on Yonge street had lowered the level opposite the respondent\u2019s property and practically left it without access to the street.\nThe arbitrator to whom the question of compensation was referred awarded $6,366 for the bare depreciation of the land and $4,500 for loss of business based on an estimate of profits for three years.\nThe Appellate Division held that the respondent was entitled to compensation for the loss of business but that the amount had been arrived at by an erroneous principle and the case was referred back to the arbitrator to ascertain the compensation which the respondent was entitled to in that regard.\nThere is no dispute as to the depreciation of the property itself. The only question then is whether some compensation should be given for the loss of trade, or the diminution of the claimant\u2019s good-will in her business, consequent on the destruction of the access to the premises in which the business was carried on. Section 155 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d is the law under which the claim of the respondent to compensation is made. It reads as follows:\u2014\nThe company shall in the exercise of the powers by this or the special Act granted, do as little damage as possible, and shall make full compensation in the manner herein and in the special Act provided, to all persons interested, for all damage by them sustained by reason of the exercise of such powers.\nThere is no doubt that the respondent is an interested person, since the access to the street which she had before is virtually destroyed. Nobody disputes that she is entitled to damages. If some land had been taken, there is no doubt under the authority of the English cases that the measure of damages would be the difference between what the premises as a running concern would be worth to the expropriated party and the value of the land afterwards, and would include compensation for loss of business.\nBut a distinction is made in England as to the measure of damages in the case of lands taken and in the case of lands injuriously affected. When in the case of lands taken full compensation including loss of business is given, in the case of lands injuriously affected the compensation does not include personal inconvenience.\n1856, Caledonian Railway Co. v. Ogilvy[60]; 1864, In re Stockport Timperley and Altringham Rly. Co.[61]; 1862, Chamberlain v. West End of London and Crystal Palace London Railway Co.[62]; 1865, Brand v. Hammersmith and City Rly. Co.[63]; 1867, Beckett v. Midland Rly. Co.[64]; 1867, Ricket v. Metropolitan Rly. Co.[65]; 1871, Duke of Buccleuch v. Metropolitan Board of Works[66].\nThese decisions in England are somewhat conflicting and not very satisfactory. The Lord Chancellor in Ricket\u2019s Case65, stated that it was a hopeless task to attempt to reconcile the contradictory decisions which have been rendered on the questions at issue.\nBut should those decisions be invoked here under our Canadian legislation?\nI do not hesitate to say no, because our own legislation differs from the English statutes and I rely in that respect on the views expressed by Lord Macnaghten in Parkdale v. West[67], where he said at page 613.\nThere is a marked difference between the provisions of the Dominion Act and those of the English \u201cLands Clauses Consolidation Act,\u201d 1845,, and that decisions upon the English Act, such as Hutton v. London and South Western Railway Co.[68], which was referred to in the argument, afford little or no assistance in the present case. In the Dominion Act the taking of land, and the interference with rights over land, are placed precisely on the same footing.\nIn view of that decision in the Parkdale Case67, I say that we should not refer to decisions rendered under English statutes, but we should find whether the provisions of s. 155 might cover the loss of trade in cases where lands have been simply injuriously affected.\nSection 155 enacts that compensation should be made for all damage caused. There is no distinction in this section in case of lands taken and in case of lands injuriously affected. We have to revert to the ordinary rule governing torts and find whether the damage is the necessary result of the injury done.\nWhen the clause of the statute applies, the party is entitled to recover full compensation for all damage in respect of the diminution in value of his property Buccleuch\u2019s Case[69].\nThe loss to an owner includes not only the actual value of the lands but all damage directly consequent on the taking thereof under statutory powers. The arbitrators called upon to fix the compensation should take into consideration the probable diminution in the value of the claimant\u2019s good-will in his trade.\nSee decisions quoted by Cripps, 4th ed., pp. 98 and 99; In re Davies and James Bay Rly. Co.[70]; Caledonian Railway, Co. v. Walker\u2019s Trustees[71], at p. 276.\nI am unable to find that the court below was in error in stating that the respondent was entitled to compensation for loss of business.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the very full and carefully considered reasons for judgment of my brother Anglin, and with some hesitation, caused by the very wide language of s. 155 of the \u201cRailway Act\u201d (R.S.C. 1906, ch. 37), I have finally come to the conclusion that my brother Anglin is right in his construction of this section. Section 155, if I may use the term, is a condition of the grant of extensive powers to a railway company. It is taken almost verbatim from the proviso of s. 16 of the English statute, the \u201cRailway Clauses Consolidation Act,\u201d 1845, and if it is to receive the same construction as the English courts have given to the latter section, damages for loss of business carried on on lands not taken but merely injuriously affected by the construction of the railway cannot be granted. There appears to be no escape from the conclusion that the wide language of s. 155 must receive some limitation, and this has been done with respect to damages caused by the operation of the railway as distinguished from its construction, Holditch v. Canadian Northern Ontario Railway Co.[72], which would be damages caused by the exercise of the powers of the company. And if s. 155 be construed as s. 16 of the \u201cRailway Clauses Consolidation Act,\u201d 1845, has been construed, damage for loss of business in respect of land not taken but injuriously affected cannot be awarded. This does not mean that I can appreciate the reason for the distinction which has been made between cases where land is taken and cases where land is not taken but merely injuriously affected, but this distinction is now clearly and authoritatively established, and, as I have said, no damages are granted for loss of business where lands are not taken but only injuriously affected. There is no doubt much force in the contention of the respondent that the construction of s. 16 of the English statute has been influenced by other provisions of the Imperial statutes, but looking at our own \u201cRailway Act\u201d and its enactments\u2014perhaps rules of procedure\u2014governing the taking and using of lands and compensation and damages (ss. 172 to 214 inclusive, and more especially ss. 191 and 193), it seems to me that these sections can be compared to the other provisions of the English statutes referred to by Mr. Justice Clute as having influenced the construction of s. 16. So we have a construction authoritatively placed on the proviso of s. 16 which has been copied into the Canadian Act, and after due consideration I feel that this construction should be adopted here.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs here and in the Appellate Division, and restrict the compensation to the sum of $6,366.00 awarded by the learned arbitrator for damage caused to the respondent\u2019s property, deducting however the sum of $192.00, expenses of the auction sale effected by the respondent after the construction of the appellant\u2019s works. The learned arbitrator valued the respondent\u2019s property as it stood before the construction of the works and deducted from this gross value the net proceeds of the auction sale. It is obvious that if the respondent had sold her property at the higher valuation before it was injuriously affected, she would have incurred the necessary expenses of the sale, so that it seems to me a fallacy to compare the gross value before the construction of the works to the real value, less expenses of sale, after the property had become depreciated. The deduction of this sum of $192 reduces the compensation to $6,174, and costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: William Johnston.\nSolicitor for the respondent: William Laidlaw.\n[1] 45 Ont.

V., c. 7, s. 3.\nA Board of Enquiry, proceeding under the \"Immigration Act,\" ordered the deportation of the respondent, who thereupon applied for a writ of habeas corpus. The writ was refused by the trial judge; but the Court of Appeal granted it and ordered the respondent's discharge.\nHeld, that an appeal from the court of final resort in any province except Quebec in a case of habeas corpus under sec. 39 (c) of the \"Supreme Court Act\" will not lie unless the case comes within some of the provisions of sec. 48, as amended by 8 & 9 Geo. V., ch. 7, sec. 3. Mitchell v. Tracey (58 Can. S.C.R. 640; 46 D.L.R. 520, followed.\nPer Duff and Anglin JJ.\u2014The words \"criminal charge\" in sec. 39 (c) of the \"Supreme Court Act\" mean a charge preferred before a tribunal authorized to hear such a charge either finally or by way of preliminary investigation; and the Board of Enquiry under the \"Immigration Act\" is not a tribunal by which the respondent could have been convicted of a criminal offence.\nPer Duff and Anglin JJ.\u2014The right of appeal given by sec. 39 (c) in cases of habeas corpus, does not exist where the court below has ordered the release of the person, the legality of whose custody was in question in the court below and that person is at large. Cox v. Hakes (15 App. Cas. 506), followed[1]. Mignault J. dubitante.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[2], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Murphy J.[3], allowing an application for a writ of habeas corpus and ordering that the respondent should be accorded his liberty and freed from the order for deportation issued by the Board of Enquiry under the \"Immigration Act\" (9 & 10 Edw. VII., ch. 27, sec. 73, sub-s. 7, as amended by 1 & 2 Geo. V. ch. 12).\nA motion was made to quash the appeal on three grounds: (1) That the right of appeal is taken away by section 48 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" as amended by 8 & 9 Geo. V. ch. 7, sec. 3; (2) That the proceedings for habeas corpus arise out of a criminal charge and are therefore not within clause (c) of section 39 of the \"Supreme Court Act\"; (3) That the fact that the respondent was at large under an order for his discharge precludes any right of appeal.\nSir Charles Tupper K.C. for the motion, referred to Cox v. Hakes[4], and Barnardo v. Ford[5]. R. V. Sinclair K.C. contra.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014We were all of the opinion at the close of the argument on this motion that it must succeed.\nThe appeal sought to be quashed clearly does not come within any of the classes of enumerated cases stated in section 48 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" as amended, within which an appeal as of right to this court is given, and as no special leave to appeal as provided for in sub-section (e) of that section was obtained, we are clearly without jurisdiction to hear the appeal.\nThis objection being, in my opinion, a fatal one, I do not discuss the other important points raised at the hearing of that motion.\nAs to the question of allowing costs, we were of the opinion that, as the case was not one within the rules requiring a notice of motion to quash to be given within the definite time prescribed by Rule 4 of the Supreme Court Rules (it being a habeas corpus appeal in which no security is required), the motion was in order; the applicant was not in fault or default, and was entitled to costs of his motion.\nThe order of the court, therefore, is to grant the motion to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction, with costs both of the appeal and of the motion to quash.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014Under and by virtue of the amendment of section 48 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" it seems to me hopeless to contend that, without leave, this case is appealable. The appeal should, therefore be quashed for want of jurisdiction, with costs.\nThe suggestion of Mr. Sinclair to let the case stand on the docket until the Crown had applied to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia to allow an appeal, seems at first sight, in view of what we have done in some cases, plausible, but after due consideration of all the facts leading up to this appeal and to the hearing of this motion, and no attempt having been made to invoke the sanction of the Court of Appeal, until now, I think we should not encourage such neglect or even suggest that it is a proper case for now giving leave to appeal.\nDUFF J.\u2014A fatal objection to the jurisdiction arises out of the provisions of the recent amendment of section 48, the appeal clearly not coming within any of the classes enumerated in that section and leave to appeal not having been granted; but it is desirable, I think, to deal with another exception to the jurisdiction of this court taken by Sir Charles Tupper which appears to be well founded. Section 48 is a negative section which prescribes essential conditions, but it does not in any way dispense with the conditions prescribed by other provisions of the Act. A ground for jurisdiction must therefore be found under the enabling sections and the provision to which appeal is made 39(c). It is argued that the proceedings in this case arise out of a criminal charge but it is plain enough that \"criminal charge\" in this provision means a charge preferred before a tribunal authorized to hear such a charge either finally or by way of preliminary investigation. The board which directed the deportation of Jeu Jang How is clearly not a tribunal of that description.\nAnother objection, however, is advanced by counsel for the respondent, to which I think effect must be given, and that is that the right of appeal given by section 39(c) in cases of habeas corpus does not exist where the court below has ordered the release of the person, the legality of whose custody was in question in the court below and that person is at large. In Barnardo v. Ford[6], it was held unanimously by the House of Lords that an order directing the issue of a writ of habeas corpus to test the right to the custody of a child was an order within the meaning of section 19 of the \"Judicature Act\" of 1873 and as such appealable to the Court of Appeal. This view of section 19 that orders and judgments in matters of habeas corpus were appealable under that section, was not considered incompatible with the decision of the House\n[Page179]\nof Lords in Cox v. Hakes[7], to the effect that under the same section no appeal would lie to the Court of Appeal from an order in habeas corpus proceedings discharging a detained person from custody.\nThe decision last mentioned was based upon two grounds which are best expressed in the judgments of Lord Herschell and Lord Halsbury.\nSection 19 gives to the Court of Appeal general jurisdiction and power to hear appeals from \"any judgment or order.\" It was not denied that an order for the discharge of a person in custody was prim\u00e2 facie an order to which the section applied, but it was held that the provision following this general provision (a provision which has its analogue in section 39 of the \"Supreme Court Act\") is obviously intended to make the power of review complete and effectual by furnishing the means of enforcing it. As in such a case\u2014when the person in custody has been discharged\u2014the order made by the High Court could not be effectively interfered with by the Court of Appeal, it was considered that such an order did not belong to the class of orders within the intendment of section 19 in respect of which a right to hear and determine appeals is given.\nThe other reason for the decision was that the granting of the right of appeal in such cases would, to adopt the language of Lord Halsbury, amount to a sudden reversal of the policy of centuries in regard to the summary determination of the right of personal freedom and that such a reversal of policy ought not to be inferred from general language which, having regard to the context, was reasonably open to another view as to its effect. These reasons appear to me to govern the construction of section 39(c).\nANGLIN J.\u2014A Board of Enquiry proceeding under sec. 73, sub-sec. 7, of the \"Immigration Act\" (ch. 27, 9 & 10 Edw. VII., as amended by ch. 12,1 & 2 Geo. V.), ordered the deportation of the respondent and an appeal by him to the Minister of Immigration and Colonization was unsuccessful. Thereupon he applied for a writ of habeas corpus which was refused him by Murphy J. On appeal the Court of Appeal of British Columbia granted the writ and ordered the prisoner's discharge. He is now at large in the Province of Alberta. The Crown and the Controller of Immigration at Vancouver appeal to this court from the judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nThe respondent moves to quash the appeal on three grounds:\n(1) That the right of appeal is taken away by section 48 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" as amended by 8 & 9 Geo. V. ch. 7, sec. 3;\n(2) That the proceedings for habeas corpus arise out of a criminal charge and are therefore not within clause (c) of section 39 of the \"Supreme Court Act\";\n(3) That the fact that the respondent is at large under an order for his discharge precludes any right of appeal.\nOn the opening of the motion counsel for the appellant admitted (very properly, having regard to our recent decision in Mitchell v. Tracey[8], that section 48 presents a fatal obstacle to the appeal unless leave to appeal can be obtained from the British Columbia Court of Appeal and he asked that the motion to quash and the hearing of the appeal should be adjourned to permit of his making application for such leave. While it is not unusual to grant this indulgence, before doing so the court should be satisfied that in the event of leave being granted the appeal would lie. It therefore becomes necessary to consider the second and third objections taken by counsel for the respondent.\nI am satisfied that the proceedings for the writ of habeas corpus do not arise out of a criminal charge. The respondent could not have been convicted on the proceeding before the Board of Enquiry of any criminal offence. Provision for that purpose is made by section 7(b) of the \"Chinese Immigration Act,\" ch. 95 of R.S.C., 1906, as amended by 7 & 8 Geo. V. ch. 7.\nBut I think the third ground on which counsel for the respondent claims that the appeal should be quashed is well taken. The principle of Cox v. Hakes[9], would seem to me to be applicable to section 39(c) of the \"Supreme Court Act.\" I concur in what my brother Duff has said on this aspect of the case.\nSince, therefore, leave to appeal if obtained would be futile, the application to adjourn the motion to quash and the hearing of the appeal to permit of such leave being asked for should b\u00e9 refused and the motion to quash should now be granted.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014Concurs with the Chief Justice.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014I would not care to say that in my opinion the principle laid down in Cox v. Hakes[10], and especially in the passage from Lord Herschell's judgment at p. 527, quoted in the decision of this court I n re Charles Seeley[11], has the effect of restricting or cutting down the generality of the terms of section 39(c) of the \"Supreme Court Act.\" This section, which is not found in any English statute that I know of, gives (subject of course to the other sections of the \"Supreme Court Act\") a right of appeal from the judgment in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus not arising out of a criminal charge. But the policy of the law seems to me to be clearly against interfering with an order of discharge or release obtained by means of the writ of habeas corpus. On that ground I concur in the judgment quashing the appeal, which of course must be quashed in view of section 48 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" without suspending our adjudication so as to permit the appellant to apply for leave to appeal. Had the appellant applied to this court for leave to appeal, I would not, under the circumstances of this case, have granted him leave, and had he obtained leave from the Court of Appeal, for the reason I have stated, I would not have interfered with the judgment discharging the respondent. I therefore simply concur in the judgment quashing this appeal in view of the terms of section 48 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nAppeal quashed with costs.\n[1] REPORTER\u2019S NOTE.-See also Fraser v.

These two lots formerly belonged to one Hart, who, in 1832, sold lot No. 694 to one Woolsworth. One clause of the deed reads as follows: \"Il est convenu et arr\u00eat\u00e9 entre les parties que Erastus Woolsworth aura droit \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9 de b\u00e2tir, accoter contre et sur le mur en pierres et en briques du pignon nord-ouest du magasin et maison du dit sieur vendant et \u00e9rig\u00e9e sur l'autre partie du dit lot de terre, lequel pignon sera mitoyen entre les parties.\"\nHeld, that the right of mitoyennet\u00e9 claimed by the appellants is a conventional servitude and not a servitude par destination du p\u00e8re de famille.\nHeld, that in the clause quoted the word \"pignon\" means not merely the triangular gable at the top of the wall but the entire northwest gable end of the grantor's house, and the whole wall, including its foundation, has been declared mitoyen by the deed of sale. Duff and Mignault JJ dissenting.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 28 K.B. 14) reversed, Duff and Mignault JJ. dissenting. Delorme v. Cusson (28 Can.

(dissenting)\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Mignault.\nAnglin J.\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the opinions prepared by my brothers Brodeur and Mignault. I concur in their view that the servitude or right of mitoyennet\u00e9, which the plaintiffs (appellants) assert, is conventional in its origin. Evidence of facts existing in 1832, when the deed creating it was executed, which would warrant classifying it as a servitude by destination of the proprietor\u2014servitude par destination du p\u00e8re de famille (art. 551 C.C.)\u2014is lacking.\nWhile I incline to think with my brother Brodeur that the servitude intended to be created was defined with sufficient precision in the Hart-Woolsworth deed, if it was not, I accept the view of the Court of King's Bench that the parties have by their conduct supplied any deficiency in that respect and that the admission in the defendants' plea of the existence in 1908 of actual conditions which conformed to the rights claimed by the plaintiffs fully meets the difficulty which the learned judge of the Superior Court found insuperable. This admission also answers any objection based on the omission from intermediate conveyances in the plaintiffs' chain of title of all reference to the servitude or right of mitoyennet\u00e9 which they claim, and, as the Court of King's Bench has said, fixes its nature and extent. The plea states explicitly that the building owned by the Bank of Hochelaga (under which the plaintiffs claim) prior to its destruction on the 22nd of June, 1908, \"appuyait sur celle des d\u00e9fendeuxs conform\u00e9ment au droit de servitude dont il est question en cette cause.\"\nNor do I find the lack of precision in the plaintiffs' claim which the Court of King's Bench deemed fatal to their action. They no doubt, as is not unusual claim more than they are entitled to. But when the evidence is applied to their demand it enables the court in my opinion to determine with reasonable certitude, within the limits of what they assert, the measure of their right.\nThe terms in which the right in question is conferred by the deed of 1832\u2014notably that it should exist in perpetuity and that the north-west gable end (pignon) shall be a party wall (mitoyen) between the parties\u2014in my opinion make it clear that it was not intended that that right should last only so long as the house then upon the grantor's land should remain standing, but that it should be a true right of mitoyennet\u00e9 entailing all the incidents, including obligations of reconstruction, etc., indicated in arts. 512 et seq. of the Civil Code, so far as they are applicable having regard to its conventional origin.\nI agree with my brother Brodeur that the word \"pignon\" as used in the deed in question means not merely the gable of the wall but the entire northwest gable end of the grantor's house. The right conferred is to build \"contre et sur le mur * * * du pignon nord-ouest\"\u2014against and upon the wall of the northwest gable end. It is inconceivable that the parties intended that the right of mitoyennet\u00e9 should exist only in the triangular gable at the top of the wall.\nNo doubt the fact that there is a common or mitoyen lane between the two properties, which is to be kept open to a height of nine feet, over which the plaintiffs have the right to build, would present a difficulty if we were dealing with a claim of mitoyennet\u00e9 made under the common law. But in this, as in other matters, the convention of the parties, if not illicit, constitutes their law. (Art. 545 C.C.). Whether on the true construction of the deed of 1832 the title to the whole lane is common (mitoyen), or each party owns the half of it lying to his side of its central line, as the description in the conveyance would indicate, the wall in question has been declared mitoyen in explicit terms and it must, I think, be so treated as a whole, including its foundations. Foundations and a wall to the height of nine feet adequate to carry above it a mitoyen wall sufficient to meet the legal requirements of the plaintiffs are essential to the enjoyment of the right conferred by the deed. Both parties are interested in the foundations and lower wall and equity requires that they should bear equally the cost of their construction and maintenance. The only reasonable and fair inference from the instrument taken as a whole is that while the entire wall was thereby made mitoyen, the right of the plaintiffs' predecessor in title to use it as such was restricted to the part of it above nine feet from the ground\u2014 a provision perhaps quite unusual in regard to mitoyen walls but not illegal and therefore within the power of contracting parties to make should they see fit. The use and the extent of (conventional) servitudes are determined according to the title which constitutes them. (Art. 545 C.C.).\nOf course the height and length of the wall existing in 1832 would measure in those respects the extent of the plaintiffs' rights. The defendants may not be compelled to build a wall either higher or longer than that in which Hart gave to Woolsworth rights of mitoyennet\u00e9. (Arts. 522 and 558 C.C.). By the defendants' admission, however, the right as enjoyed by the plaintiffs' predecessor in 1908 was in conformity with that deed and may therefore be taken as the measure of what they are entitled to.\nIt is well established that the length of the party wall in 1908 was twenty-nine feet. The land on which it stood having since been expropriated by the city to a depth of 14 feet, 2 inches, no wall can be built on that portion of it. The plaintiffs' rights therein have been extinguished. (Art. 559 C.C.). But on the remaining portion, 14 feet, 10 inches in length, they continued, and to a party wall of that length and built on that land they are now confined.\nI agree with my brother Brodeur that the case of Delorme v. Cusson[2], is readily distinguishable from that at bar which is neither a case of an improvement made in good faith under common error as to title nor of tacit acquiescence in the doing of an act, which the plaintiffs might have prevented, inconsistent with the right they now assert. I also accept my learned brother's view that, notice not having been given the plaintiffs or their predecessor by the defendants of their intention to build the wall of which demolition is now sought and that wall being admittedly insufficient to serve as a party wall, the defendants must bear the expense of its removal to the extent necessary to permit of a proper party wall being constructed; and I agree in the detailed disposition which he suggests of the appeal in other respects.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Il s'agit d'une action confessoire et en demolition institu\u00e9e par l'appelante contre les intim\u00e9s au sujet d'un mur qu'elle all\u00e8gue \u00eatre mitoyen.\nLe litige porte surtout sur l'interpr\u00e9tation d'un contrat de vente par Moses Hart \u00e0 Erastus Woolsworth le 21 f\u00e9vrier 1832.\nMoses Hart \u00e9tait alors propri\u00e9taire de tout le lopin de terre qui forme aujourd'hui les nos. 694 & 695 du cadastre de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res. Par l'acte de vente en question il a c\u00e9d\u00e9 ce qui forme le no. 694 \u00e0 Woolsworth et le terrain vendu y est d\u00e9crit comme suit:\u2014\nUne part du lot de terre faisant le coin nord-ouest des rues du Platon et Notre-Dame et par derri\u00e8re par une ligne qui sera tir\u00e9e parall\u00e8lement \u00e0 la dite rue Notre-Dame dans et par le milieu de la porte de cour actuellement existante sur la rue du Platon et ce depuis icelle jusqu'\u00e0 la ligne de division entre le terrain sus vendu et le terrain de Pierre Deveau, tenant d'un c\u00f4te au nord-est \u00e0 la dite rue du Platon et d'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 au sud-ouest au dit Pierre Deveau avec une maison sus \u00e9rig\u00e9e.\nDeux autres dispositions de cet acte de vente doivent \u00eatre cit\u00e9es textuellement afin de conna\u00eetre l'\u00e9tendue de la servitude r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par l'appelante qui est aux droits de Woolsworth. Elles se lisent comme suit:\u2014\nIl est convenu et arr\u00eat\u00e9 entre les parties que Erastus Woolsworth aura droit \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9 de b\u00e2tir, accoter contre et sur le mur en pierre et en briques du pignon nord-ouest du magasin et maison du dit sieur vendant et \u00e9rig\u00e9e sur l'autre partie du dit lot de terre, lequel pignon sera mitoyen entre les parties.\nEt il est de plus convenu et arr\u00eat\u00e9 entre les parties qu'elles laisseront \u00e0 toujours un passage de huit pieds de largeur et de neuf pieds de hauteur entre la maison du dit sieur vendant et celle d\u00e9j\u00e0 construite ou \u00e0 construire du dit sieur acqu\u00e9reur pour aller et communiquer dans leurs cours respectives, lequel passage sera mitoyen entre les parties, leurs hoirs et ayant cause \u00e0 l'avenir.\nCet acte, il me semble, est assez clair. La propri\u00e9t\u00e9 vendue s'\u00e9tend pour le bas jusqu'au milieu de la porte de cour dans le passage mitoyen. Pour la partie sup\u00e9rieure du passage, elle s'\u00e9tend jusqu'au mur de la maison de Hart, puisque ce dernier donne \u00e0 son acheteur le droit d'appuyer sa b\u00e2tisse sur ce mur. De plus, le mur, quoiqu'il ne se trouve pas dans le bas aux extr\u00e9mit\u00e9s des h\u00e9ritages respectifs, est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 mitoyen par les parties contractantes.\nNous avons donc une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qui pour neuf pieds de haut s'\u00e9tend \u00e0 quatre pieds du mur en question mais qui au del\u00e0 des neuf pieds s'\u00e9tend jusqu'au mur lui-m\u00eame. Et afin qu'il n'y ait pas de doute sur la nature du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du mur, on le d\u00e9clare mitoyen, c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 construit par Hart seul, son voisin Woolsworth en acquiert de lui la communaut\u00e9. Pothier, \u00e9d. Bugnet, vol. 4, no. 129, p. 313.\nWoolsworth et ses ayants cause construisirent audessus du passage mitoyen et appuy\u00e8rent leurs b\u00e2tisses sur ce mur d\u00e9clar\u00e9 mitoyen. Le passage fut toujours conserv\u00e9 mitoyen.\nEn 1908 la ville de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res \u00e9tait presqu'enti\u00e8rement incendi\u00e9e; et, entr'autres b\u00e2tisses d\u00e9truites se trouvaient les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s en question en cette cause.\nLes intim\u00e9s, qui \u00e9taient les propri\u00e9taires du terrain no. 695, reb\u00e2tirent leur maison ou magasin; et, dans la ligne de s\u00e9paration, ils \u00e9rig\u00e8rent un mur qui pouvait \u00eatre suffisant pour eux mais certainement trop faible pour supporter l'\u00e9difice que l'appelante, qui est propri\u00e9taire du terrain Woolsworth, le no. 694, voudrait construire. Ils ont fait ce mur sans en avertir cette derni\u00e8re qui est maintenant forc\u00e9e de se pourvoir en justice pour faire reconna\u00eetre les droits qu'elle a dans ce mur mitoyen.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour d'Appel[3] ont renvoy\u00e9 l'action, mais pour des motifs diff\u00e9rents.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure s'est bas\u00e9e sur le fait que le contrat de 1832 constituait une servitude \u00e9tablie par destination de p\u00e8re de famille et qu'elle n'avait pas la nature et l'\u00e9tendue que l'article 551 du Code Civil exige pour ces servitudes.\nLa Cour d'Appel a \u00e9galement exprim\u00e9 l'opinion que c'\u00e9tait une servitude \u00e9tablie par destination du p\u00e8re de famille, mais que les admissions des d\u00e9fendeurs dans leur plaidoyer avaient suppl\u00e9\u00e9 \u00e0 l'insuffisance de pr\u00e9cision de l'acte de 1832. Elle a renvoy\u00e9 l'action en s'appuyant sur la cause de Delorme v. Cusson[4], parce que la demanderesse n'avait pas protest\u00e9 quand les d\u00e9fendeurs avaient \u00e9rig\u00e9 le mur apr\u00e8s l'incendie.\nD'abord, est-ce bien l\u00e0 une servitude \u00e9tablie par la destination du p\u00e8re de famille? Je n'h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 dire que non.\nQu'est-ce que la destination du p\u00e8re de famille? C'est le cas o\u00f9 celui qui poss\u00e8de deux h\u00e9ritages peut s'en servir de mani\u00e8re que l'un soit assujetti \u00e0 l'autre. Cette disposition que fait un propri\u00e9taire peut devenir servitude lorsque les deux h\u00e9ritages cessent d'appartenir \u00e0 la m\u00eame personne. (Desgodets, B\u00e2timents, vol. 1er, page 298). Et alors, suivant l'article 551 du Code Civil, la destination du p\u00e8re de famille, lorsqu'elle est par \u00e9crit et que la nature, l'\u00e9tendue et la situation en sont sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9es, constitue une servitude valable.\nLa servitude r\u00e9clam\u00e9e par l'appelante n'est pas le r\u00e9sultat d'une destination faite par Hart quand il \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire des deux h\u00e9ritages; mais elle est consign\u00e9e dans un acte entre Hart et l'acqu\u00e9reur d'une partie de son terrain. Et alors ce serait une servitude conventionnelle ordinaire et non pas une servitude \u00e9tablie par la destination du p\u00e8re de famille. Les cours inf\u00e9rieures ont donc fait une erreur en classifiant la servitude en question en cette cause parmi les servitudes cr\u00e9\u00e9es par la destination du p\u00e8re de famille.\nLe mur originaire, qui \u00e9tait de pierre et de brique, \u00e9tait assez fort pour appuyer l'\u00e9difice de la demanderesse; mais il a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconstruit, apr\u00e8s l'incendie de 1908, en brique et en bois; et alors il est certainement trop faible, de l'aveu m\u00eame des d\u00e9fendeurs, pour qu'on puisse y \u00e9tayer la moindre poutre.\nLes intim\u00e9s ont voulu, lors de la plaidoirie, donner au mot pignon mentionn\u00e9 dans l'acte un sens trop restreint; et ils ont invoqu\u00e9 \u00e0 cette fin le dictionnaire de Larousse, qui d\u00e9finit le mot pignon comme signifiant la partie sup\u00e9rieure et triangulaire d'un mur. Mais les termes m\u00eames de l'acte et la preuve d\u00e9montrent que le terme pignon n'a pas rapport seulement \u00e0 la partie sup\u00e9rieure et triangulaire du mur mais \u00e0 tout le mur lui-m\u00eame. Le mot a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 dans son sens ordinaire et populaire. Ainsi, quand on parle du pignon nord ou sud d'une maison, on r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 tout le mur qui se trouve du c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord ou du c\u00f4t\u00e9 sud de cette maison et non pas \u00e0 la partie sup\u00e9rieure et triangulaire seulement de ce mur.\nQuand il est dit dans l'acte que l'acqu\u00e9reur pourra s'appuyer sur le mur du pignon nord-ouest du magasin, on voulait certainement dire tout le mur qui se trouvait du c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord-ouest. Cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 avait, en effet, deux \u00e9tages pleins et un toit triangulaire qui faisait le troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tage. Alors comment l'acqu\u00e9reur, qui avait le droit de b\u00e2tir au-dessus du passage \u00e0 neuf pieds de terre aurait-il pu appuyer ses poutres sur le mur s'il ne pouvait utiliser que le pignon lui-m\u00eame, qui se serait trouv\u00e9 au moins dix pieds plus haut?\nJohn Bourgeois est examin\u00e9 sur la longueur du mur des d\u00e9fendeurs avant le feu, et sa r\u00e9ponse est comme suit :\u2014\nLe mur du pignon de la maison des d\u00e9fendeurs avait, avant le feu de 1908, vingt-neuf pieds.\nCette r\u00e9ponse bien simple d'un arpenteur et d'un ing\u00e9nieur civil d\u00e9montre bien clairement que le mur d'un pignon, dans la langage ordinaire, comprend non-seulement la partie sup\u00e9rieure et triangulaire mais aussi la partie inf\u00e9rieure.\nDans l'acte de 1832, quand on dit que le pignon sera mitoyen entre les parties, on entendait d\u00e9clarer tout ce mur du c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord-ouest comme \u00e9tant mitoyen.\nQuelle est l'effet de cette d\u00e9claration? C'est que ce mur est devenu la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des deux parties. Pothier, \u00e9d. Bugnet, vol. 4, no. 129, page 313.\nCe n'est plus la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 exclusive de Hart et de ses ayants-cause, mais il est la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 commune de Hart, de Woolsworth et de leurs ayants cause.\nC'est d'ailleurs une stipulation bien rationnelle quand on songe que Woolsworth acqu\u00e9rait par sa vente le droit de b\u00e2tir \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9 et d'accoter contre et sur le mur, alors les parties ont voulu \u00e9viter tout doute en stipulant que ce mur serait mitoyen, quoiqu'il f\u00fbt assis sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du vendeur seul.\nS'il n'y avait pas eu cette stipulation de mitoyennet\u00e9, je crois que la demanderesse aurait pu forcer les d\u00e9fendeurs \u00e0 reconstruire le mur \u00e0 leurs frais et d\u00e9pens. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le cr\u00e9ancier d'une servitude a droit de faire tous les ouvrages n\u00e9cessaires poux en user et la conserver et ces ouvrages sont \u00e0 ses frais, \u00e0 moins que le titre constitutif de la servitude ne dise le contraire (arts. 553 and 554 C.C.).\nJe consid\u00e8re que la servitude stipul\u00e9e dans les termes suivants :\u2014\nErastus Woolsworth aura droit \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9 de b\u00e2tir, accoter contre et sur le mur en pierre et en briques du pignon nord-ouest du magasin et maison du dit sieur vendant\nconstitute non-seulement une servitude d'appui, mais une servitude de support.\nFournel, dans son trait\u00e9 du Voisinage, Vol. 2, page 444, dit que le droit de support est une obligation impos\u00e9e au propri\u00e9taire voisin d'entretenir perp\u00e9tuellement en bon \u00e9tat un mur.\nDans le contrat que nous avons \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter, les mots \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9 qui s'y trouvent sembleraient, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, cr\u00e9er la servitude de support dont parle Fournel. Mais ces expressions rapproch\u00e9es de la d\u00e9claration des parties que la mur sera mitoyen impliquent seulement qu'on a voulu incorporer les principes ordinaires de la mitoyennet\u00e9.\nCes principes se trouvent expos\u00e9s dans les articles 510 et suivants du Code Civil. L'\u00e9paisseur du mur doit \u00eatre de 18 pouces (art. 520 C.C.). Celui qui existait sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 lors du contrat de 1832 et lors de l'incendie de 1908 \u00e9tait en pierre et en brique et on ne nous en a pas prouv\u00e9 l'\u00e9paisseur. Mais il \u00e9tait assez fort pour soutenir une construction aussi \u00e9lev\u00e9e chez le voisin que celle qui existait alors. Quant \u00e0 l'\u00e9paisseur, la demanderesse pourrait, en vertu de la loi, exiger 18 pouces, mais elle se contenterait de 16. Le mur \u00e9rig\u00e9 par les d\u00e9fendeurs depuis l'incendie n'a que onze pouces et a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait en bois et en brique et est certainement trop faible pour que la demanderesse puisse y appuyer sa b\u00e2tisse. Ce mur devrait \u00eatre d\u00e9moli, du moins pour la partie o\u00f9 se trouvait l'ancien mur.\nMaintenant qui devrait supporter les frais de cette d\u00e9molition? C'est, suivant moi, les d\u00e9fendeurs.\nEn vertu de l'article 203 de la Coutume de Paris, qui est encore en force (art.2613 C.C.), les d\u00e9fendeurs ne devaient pas r\u00e9\u00e9difier ce mur sans appeler la demanderesse qui avait int\u00e9r\u00eat dans cette reconstruction. Et alors s'ils sont expos\u00e9s \u00e0 encourir les frais de d\u00e9molition, ce n'est d\u00fb qu'\u00e0 leur n\u00e9gligence.\nDesgodets, Loi des B\u00e2timents, page 173, \u00e9dition de 1777, dit:\u2014\nSi celui qui a fait b\u00e2tir le premier avait fait une cloison ou pan de bois de charpenterie au lieu d'un mur joignant sans moyen \u00e0 l'h\u00e9ritage de son voisin, si le voisin voulait b\u00e2tir contre, il pourrait obliger le premier \u00e0 d\u00e9molir son pan de bois et \u00e0 contribuer pour la part dont il serait tenu \u00e0 reconstruire un mur mitoyen \u00e0 frais communs, depuis le fond jusqu'\u00e0 la hauteur de son h\u00e9berge: et au cas que la fondation f\u00fbt suffisante pour porter l'\u00e9l\u00e9vation du nouveau mur, celui qui voudrait adosser contre serait tenu d'en faire le remboursement \u00e0 l'autre de moiti\u00e9 de sa valeur.\nDans une cause de Sicotte v. Martin[5], il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par l'honorable juge Archibald, et ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la Cour de Revision[6] compos\u00e9e des honorables juges Sir Melbourne Tait, Sir Henri Taschereau et Loranger, que si un propri\u00e9taire construit un mur insuffisant il peut \u00eatre condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 le d\u00e9molir \u00e0 ses frais.\nCette d\u00e9cision est conforme au principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l'article 203 de la Coutume de Paris, que j'ai mentionn\u00e9 plus haut.\nLes intim\u00e9s ayant reconstruit le mur sur lequel la demanderesse appuyait sa b\u00e2tisse, la servitude d'appui ou de support stipul\u00e9e en faveur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de cette derni\u00e8re par l'acte de 4832 se continue (art. 522 C.C.). Demolombe, vol. 12, page 505, no. 973, dit:\u2014\nPareillement le mur, la maison ou le b\u00e2timent quelconque auquel \u00e9taient attach\u00e9s des servitudes actives ou passives, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9moli ou d\u00e9truit, est relev\u00e9. Les servitudes actives et passives se continuent \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du nouveau mur ou de la nouvelle maison.\nIl \u00e9tait du devoir des d\u00e9fendeurs, en reconstruisant leur mur, de le faire de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que la servitude d'appui stipul\u00e9e dans Pacte de 1832 ne f\u00fbt pas affect\u00e9e et p\u00fbt s'exercer. N'ayant pas accompli cette obligation, les d\u00e9fendeurs doivent en subir les cons\u00e9quences. Pardessus, vol. 2, no. 295.\nLa cause de Delorme v. Cusson[7], invoqu\u00e9e par la cour d'appel n'est qu'un arr\u00eat d'esp\u00e8ce qui ne saurait s'appliquer dans une cause o\u00f9 les faits sont differ\u00e9nts. Il s'agissait dans cette cause de Delorme v. Cusson7, d'une erreur commune dans laquelle les parties \u00e9taient tomb\u00e9es pouf d\u00e9terminer leur ligne de s\u00e9paration: et on a ' appliqu\u00e9 les r\u00e8gles ordinaires qui r\u00e9gissent la mati\u00e8re de l'erreur. Il n'est pas question d'erreur dans la pr\u00e9sente cause; mais les d\u00e9fendeurs, contrairement aux exigences de la loi, ont reb\u00e2ti leur mur sans en avertir ceux qui \u00e9taient propri\u00e9taires dans le temps du terrain voisin.\nSuivant moi, on devrait reconna\u00eetre par le jugement \u00e0 intervenir.\n1\u00b0 que le mur qui \u00e9tait mentionn\u00e9 dans l'acte de 1832 \u00e9tait un mur mitoyen pour les nos. 694 and 695 du cadastre de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res;\n2\u00b0 que ce mur ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 en partie d\u00e9truit par l'incendie de 1908, sa reconstruction \u00e9tait \u00e0 la charge des propri\u00e9taires des dits lots (art. 512 C.C.) ;\n3\u00b0 que le mur qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 construit par les d\u00e9fendeurs devrait \u00eatre d\u00e9moli par les d\u00e9fendeurs pour la partie o\u00f9 se trouvait l'ancien mur et qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9faut par les d\u00e9fendeurs de faire cette d\u00e9molition dans les quinze jours qui suivront la signification du jugement la demanderesse est autoris\u00e9e de la faire aux frais et d\u00e9pens des d\u00e9fendeurs;\n4\u00b0 que le mur soit reconstruit en brique aux frais et d\u00e9pens des parties en cette cause avec une \u00e9paisseur de 16 pouces pour les deux premiers \u00e9tages et de 12 pouces pour le troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tage.\nL'appel deyrait donc \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens de cette cour et des cours inf\u00e9rieures.\nMignault J. (dissenting).\u2014Il se soul\u00e8ve dans cette cause une int\u00e9ressante question de droit d'appui ou de mitoyennet\u00e9, et l'appelante, qui r\u00e9clame ce droit, invoque un titre qui remonte \u00e0 pr\u00e8s d'un si\u00e8cle. Pour l'explication des faits de la cause il vaut mieux commencer par ce titre.\nIl s'agit de la vente d'un emplacement dans la ville de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res par Moses Hart \u00e0 Erastus Woolsworth, pass\u00e9 devant J. N. Badeaux et confr\u00e8re, notaires, le 21 f\u00e9vrier, 1832. L'acte d\u00e9crit assez vaguement la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 vendue comme suit:\nUne part du lot de terre situ\u00e9 en cette dite ville, faisant le coin nordouest des rues du Platon et Notre-Dame et par derri\u00e8re, par une ligne qui sera tir\u00e9e paralellement \u00e0 la dite rue Notre-Dame dans et par le milieu de la porte de cour actuellement existante sur le rue du Platon et ce depuis icelle jusqu'\u00e0 la ligne de division entre le terrain sus vendu et le terrain de Pierre Deveau, tenant d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 au nord-est \u00e0 la dite rue du Platon, et d'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 au sud-ouest au dit Pierre Deveau, avec une maison dessus \u00e9rig\u00e9e.\nEt l'acte contient en outre les clauses qui suivent:\u2014\nIl est convenu et arr\u00eat\u00e9 entre les parties que Erastus Woolsworth aura droit \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9 de b\u00e2tir, accoter contre et sur le mur en pierre et en briques du pignon nord-ouest du magasin et maison du dit sieur vendant et \u00e9rig\u00e9e sur l'autre partie du dit lot de terre, lequel pignon sera mitoyen entre les parties.\nEt il est de plus convenu et arr\u00eat\u00e9 entre les parties qu'elles laisseront \u00e0 toujours un passage de huit pieds de largeur et de neuf pieds de hauteur entre la maison du dit sieur vendant et celle d\u00e9j\u00e0 construite ou \u00e0 construire du dit sieur acqu\u00e9reur pour aller et communiquer dans leurs cours respectives, lequel passage sera mitoyen entre les parties, leurs hoirs et ayants cause \u00e0 l'avenir.\nAutant qu'on peut le juger par les \u00e9nonciations de cet acte de vente, il y avait une maison sur le terrain vendu, mais il est impossible de dire si cette maison, telle qu'elle existait alors, appuyait sur le mur de la maison du vendeur. Et en supposant m\u00eame qu'elle s'y appuyait, l'acheteur n'a acquis d'autre servitude d'appui que celle que lui conf\u00e8re l'acte de vente. Quant au terrain lui-m\u00eame que. Hart a vendu \u00e0 Woolsworth, il s'\u00e9tendait, d'apr\u00e8s les indications de l'acte\u2014mais ces indications manquent de pr\u00e9cision\u2014depuis la rue Notre-Dame jusqu'\u00e0\nune ligne qui sera tir\u00e9e paralellement \u00e0 la dite rue Notre-Dame dans et par le milieu de la porte de cour actuellement existante sur la rue du Platon et ce depuis icelle rue jusqu'\u00e0 la ligne de division entre le terrain sus vendu et le terrain de Pierre Deveau.\nEn rapprochant cette description de celle du passage mitoyen, le terrain vendu par Hart para\u00eet s'\u00e9tendre depuis une ligne tir\u00e9e par le milieu du passage mitoyen jusqu'\u00e0 la rue Notre-Dame. C'est du reste ce qui ressort de la d\u00e9claration de l'appelante, o\u00f9 elle dit que James Dickson, un de ses auteurs, contribua pour moiti\u00e9 au passage mitoyen.\nL'acte de vente par Hart \u00e0 Woolsworth cr\u00e9ait deux droits de servitude: 1\u00b0 le droit d'appui sur la maison de Hart; et 2\u00b0 le passage mitoyen. Cependant la s\u00e9rie d'actes que produit l'appelante fait voir que le droit d'appui ou de mitoyennet\u00e9 r\u00e9clam\u00e9 par cette derni\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 dans une vente du 8 octobre 1833 par Woolsworth \u00e0 James Dickson, mais que les titres subs\u00e9quents n'y font aucune allusion. Il appert, par la preuve, qu'avant 1908 la Banque d'Hochelaga avait une b\u00e2tisse \u00e0 trois \u00e9tages sur le terrain vendu par Hart \u00e0 Woolsworth et sur un autre terrain en arri\u00e8re, et que les intim\u00e9s, successeurs de Hart, avaient une maison de deux \u00e9tages avec pignon, sur lequel pignon, de l'aveu des intim\u00e9s, la b\u00e2tisse de la banque s'appuyait. En 1908 arriva le grand incendie de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, qui d\u00e9truisit les deux b\u00e2tisses; et la municipalit\u00e9 en profita pour exproprier une lisi\u00e8re sur la rue du Platon et la rue Notre-Dame d'une largeur de dix-sept pieds, ne laissant que quatorze pieds environ du site de l'ancien mur de la maison qui, avant l'incendie, appartenait aux intim\u00e9s. Depuis l'incendie, ces derniers ont construit sur leur propri\u00e9t\u00e9, celle qui appartenait \u00e0 Hart, une maison en bois, briques et cr\u00e9pi dont le mur du c\u00f4t\u00e9 des appelants ne peut, \u00e0 raison de sa construction en bois et briques, servir comme un mur mitoyen. Le terrain de l'appelante, celui que Hart vendit \u00e0 Woolsworth, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 b\u00e2ti depuis l'incendie; cependant, d'apr\u00e8s des indications assez vagues qu'on trouve dans la preuve, l'appelante aurait essay\u00e9 de poser des piliers en beton dans le passage mitoyen pour appuyer une construction qu'elle se proposait d'\u00e9riger, mais sur une poursuite intent\u00e9e contre elle par les intim\u00e9s il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure qu'elle n'en avait pas le droit. Ce jugement toutefois n'est pas invoqu\u00e9 comme chose jug\u00e9e et l'honorable juge de premi\u00e8re instance a refus\u00e9 de le laisser produire \u00e0 moins que ce ne f\u00fbt comme autorit\u00e9. Il se trouve au dossier, mais les parties n'ont pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de l'imprimer avec les autres documents de la cause.\nL'appelante par son action demande qu'il soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle a un droit perp\u00e9tuel de b\u00e2tir et accoter le mur d'un magasin qu'elle entend \u00e9riger sur son terrain contre et sur l\u00e9 pignon nord-ouest de l'\u00e9difice des intim\u00e9s \u00e0 partir d'une hauteur de neuf pieds jusqu'\u00e0 la sommit\u00e9 du toit de cet \u00e9difice; qu'il soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ce pignon est mitoyen entre les parties; que, dans le d\u00e9lai qui sera fix\u00e9, les intim\u00e9s soient condamn\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u00e9molir \u00e0 leurs frais le mur nord-ouest de leur \u00e9difice et \u00e0 le remplacer \u00e0 leurs frais jusqu'\u00e0 la hauteur de neuf pieds par un autre d'une force et \u00e9paisseur suffisantes pour recevoir le mur de pignon de l'appelante, et qu'\u00e0 partir de neuf pieds jusqu'\u00e0 la sommit\u00e9 du toit de l'\u00e9difice des intim\u00e9s, le mur soit remplac\u00e9 \u00e0 frais communs par un mur d'une force et \u00e9paisseur suffisantes pour assurer \u00e0 l'appelante l'exercice de sa servitude de pignon; enfin qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9faut par les intim\u00e9s d'ex\u00e9cuter le jugement \u00e0 \u00eatre rendu contre eux, l'appelante soit autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 le faire aux risques, frais et p\u00e9ril des intim\u00e9s.\nCette action a \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e par les intim\u00e9s, qu ont r\u00e9ussi dans les deux cours, et l'appelante nous demande d'infirmer les jugements rendus contre elle\nEn premi\u00e8re instance, l'honorable juge Drouin s'est bas\u00e9 sur le fait que les actes subs\u00e9quents \u00e0 la vente par Woolsworth \u00e0 Dickson (8 octobre 1833) ne mentionnent nullement les droits de servitude et mitoyennet\u00e9 r\u00e9clam\u00e9s par l'appelante et qu'aucune inscription de ces droits n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9e sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des intim\u00e9s. Il a exprim\u00e9 l'opinion qu'il s'agit ici d'une servitude constitu\u00e9e par destination du p\u00e8re de famille, laquelle servitude n'est pas d\u00e9sign\u00e9e \u00e0 l'acte comme l'exige l'article 551 du code civil. Le savant juge n'a trouv\u00e9 dans la preuve rien qui indique d'une mani\u00e8re certaine que l'\u00e9difice qui existait avant l'incendie sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelante appuyait sur celui \u00e9rig\u00e9 alors sur le terrain des intim\u00e9s.\nLe cour d'appel (Lavergne, Cross, Carroll et Pelletier, JJ.)[8], a \u00e9galement vu dans la servitude dont il s'agit une servitude cr\u00e9\u00e9e par destination du p\u00e8re de famille, mais elle \u00e9tait d'opinion que les termes de l'acte sont trop vagues pour la constituer. Se basant cependant sur l'aveu des intim\u00e9s dans leur plaidoyer qu'avant l'incendie l'\u00e9difice des auteurs de l'appelante appuyait sur l'\u00e9difice des intim\u00e9s, conform\u00e9ment au droit de servitude dont il est question en cette cause, elle arriva \u00e0 la conclusion que les parties avaient suppl\u00e9\u00e9 \u00e4 ce qui manquait dans l'acte constitutif pour cr\u00e9er la; servitude par destination du p\u00e8re de famille. Toutefois la cour d'appel, sous l'autorit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision de cette cour dans la cause de Delorme v. Cusson[9], a renvoy\u00e9 l'action de l'appelante pour le motif que celle-ci avait laiss\u00e9 les intim\u00e9s reconstruire leur maison apr\u00e8s l'incendie, sans pr\u00e9tendre qu'elle avait le droit de s'y appuyer, et que maintenant elle ne devrait pas \u00eatre \u00e9cout\u00e9e \u00e0 en demander la d\u00e9molition.\nLe juge Cross n'a pas partag\u00e9 cette opinion. Il \u00e9tait d'avis de permettre \u00e0 l'appelante de d\u00e9molir et reconstruire, \u00e0 ses frais, la partie du mur des intim\u00e9s qui se trouve sur le site de l'ancien mur.\nMalgr\u00e9 l'opinion contraire de la cour sup\u00e9rieure et de la cour d'appel, je ne trouve rien dans l'esp\u00e8ce qui ressemble \u00e0 la servitude par destination du p\u00e8re de famille. Cette destination consiste en la disposition ou arrangement que fait le propri\u00e9taire de deux fonds ou m\u00eame d'un seul fonds, au moyen de quoi l'un de ces fonds ou une partie d'un fonds est destin\u00e9 au service de l'autre. A certaines conditions \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es par l'article 551 C.C., cette destination vaut titre. Ici rien ne fait voir qu'il existait; lors de la vente de 1832, la disposition requise pour la destination du p\u00e8re de famille. Du reste, il y a un titre expr\u00e8s cr\u00e9ant une servitude conventionnelle, et il serait bien oisif de se demander si, en l'absence d'un tel titre, on aurait pu pr\u00e9tendre qu'il y avait destination du p\u00e8re de famille, dont le seul but est de suppl\u00e9er au titre qu'exige la loi.\nTout ce qu'il y a ici donc, c'est la cr\u00e9ation d'une servitude ordinaire d'appui et de passage. Le passage mitoyen n'est pas en question dans cette cause et il ne s'agit que du droit d'appui, cr\u00e9\u00e9 conventionnellement, et qu'on doit soigneusement distinguer de la servitude l\u00e9gale de mitoyennet\u00e9. Cette derni\u00e8re esp\u00e8ce de servitude existe sans convention et en vertu de la loi seule, et elle suppose n\u00e9cessairement que les deux terrains sont contigus et que le mur a \u00e9t\u00e9 construit sur la ligne de s\u00e9paration entre ces terrains. Si, comme les titres l'indiquent, les terrains des parties sont s\u00e9par\u00e9s par le passage mitoyen dont elles paraissent avoir fourni chacune la moiti\u00e9, il n'existe aucun droit de mitoyennet\u00e9, en vertu de la loi, sur un mur qui se trouverait construit enti\u00e8rement sur le terrain des intim\u00e9s, mais en bordure du passage mitoyen qui s\u00e9pare les deux immeubles.\nCependant le droit d'appui sur la maison de Hart a pu tr\u00e8s bien \u00eatre accord\u00e9 conventionnellement par ce dernier, avec le droit de b\u00e2tir au-dessus du passage mitoyen, et telle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 mon avis la convention des parties. Ce droit d'appui est une v\u00e9ritable servitude conventionnelle. Il faut toutefois avoir \u00e9gard aux termes par lesquels cette servitude conventionnelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e. L'acte d\u00e9clare que\nErastus Woolsworth aura droit \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9 de b\u00e2tir, accoter contre et sur le mur en pierre et en briques du pignon nord-ouest du magasin et maison du dit sieur vendant et \u00e9rig\u00e9e sur l'autre partie du dit lot de terre, lequel pignon sera mitoyen entre les parties.\nWoolsworth a acquis le droit \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9 de b\u00e2tir et accoter sur le mur du pignon du magasin et maison de Hart, et c'est ce pignon qu'on d\u00e9clare mitoyen entre les parties. Or le mot pignon est d\u00e9fini comme la partie sup\u00e9rieure d'un mur qui se termine en pointe et dont ie sommet porte le bout du faitage d'un comble \u00e0 deux \u00e9gouts. (Nouveau Larousse, vo. Pignon.)\nOn objecte cependant que, d'apr\u00e8s le sens populaire du mot. \"pignon\" dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, ce mot s'entend de tout le mur lat\u00e9ral d'un \u00e9difice, et non pas seulement de la partie sup\u00e9rieure de ce mur. En supposant qu'il en serait ainsi, et la preuve est silencieuse \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, je ne puis arriver \u00e0 la conclusion que les parties aient envisag\u00e9, comme le mur de pignon qui \u00e9tait sujet \u00e0 la servitude et \u00e9tait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 mitoyen, autre chose que la portion sup\u00e9rieure du mur lat\u00e9ral de Hart \u00e0 partir de neuf pieds du sol. Toute la d\u00e9claration de l'appelante le d\u00e9montre. Elle veut que les intim\u00e9s reconstruisent \u00e0 leurs frais la partie de ce mur depuis les fondations jusqu'\u00e0 la hauteur de neuf pieds du sol, et qu'\u00e0 partir de cette hauteur le mur de pignon soit construit \u00e0 frais communs, alors que si tout le mur lat\u00e9ral \u00e9tait mitoyen toute cette reconstruction serait \u00e0 frais communs. Je cite les paragraphes 47 et 48 de sa d\u00e9claration:\n47. Qu'elle (l'appelante) est encore en droit d'exiger d'eux qu'ils remplacent \u00e0 leurs frais et jusqu'\u00e0 la hauteur de neuf pieds Je dit mur par un autre de force et d'\u00e9paisseur suffisante pour recevoir le mur de pignon.\n48. Qu'\u00e0 partir de neuf pieds jusqu'\u00e0 la sommit\u00e9 de leur \u00e9difice, les d\u00e9fendeurs construisent \u00e0 frais communs avec la demanderesse un mur de pignon qui assure \u00e0 Ja dite demanderesse l'exercice de sa dite servitude de pignon telle que d\u00e9crite au paragraphe 5 de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9claration.\n(Ce paragraphe 5 rapporte les termes m\u00eames de l'acte de vente entre Hart et Woolsworth.)\nDonc ce que l'appelante entend par \"mur de pignon\", objet de la servitude et d\u00e9clar\u00e9 mitoyen par l'acte de vente de Hart \u00e0 Woolsworth, c'est la portion sup\u00e9rieure du mur lat\u00e9ral \u00e0 partir d'une hauteur de neuf pieds du sol et non pas tout ce mur lat\u00e9ral. Il ne peut, il me semble, rester l'ombre d'un doute quant \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation plut\u00f4t restrictive qu'extensive que l'appelante donne au mot \"pignon\" quand on aura lu ce qu'elle dit elle-m\u00eame dans son factum que je cite textuellement:\u2014\nThe contract of 1832 declared that Woolsworth's mitoyennet\u00e9 in the respondents' northwest wall only began at the height of 9 feet because it was set out in the convention entered into between the parties that there should always exist between their buildings a mitoyen passage 8 feet in width and 9 feet in height. The mitoyennet\u00e9 only beginning at a height of 9 feet it follows that up to that height the wall is not mitoyen and should, as in the case of all non-mitoyen walls, be built at the sole expense of the party to whom it belongs.\nJe dois donc refuser pour ma part d'\u00e9carter le sens que les lexicographes et l'appelante elle-m\u00eame donnent au mot \"pignon\" pour un sens soi-disant populaire et ordinaire, et j'entends par le pignon, qui \u00e9tait sujet au droit d'appui et mitoyen entre les parties, la portion sup\u00e9rieure du mur lat\u00e9ral de Hart \u00e0 partir d'une hauteur de neuf pieds du sol. En d\u00e9cider autrement serait enti\u00e8rement refaire la demande de l'appelante.\nIl est par cons\u00e9quent bien clair que le droit conventionnel de mitoyennet\u00e9 l\u00e9gale dont il s'agit se restreint au mur de pignon de Hart commen\u00e7ant \u00e0 une hauteur de neuf pieds du sol. Nous sommes donc loin des conditions de la mitoyennet\u00e9 qui implique la co-pro-pri\u00e9t\u00e9 du mur depuis les fondations jusqu'\u00e0 l'h\u00e9berge (art. 510 C.C.), (c'est-\u00e0-dire jusqu'\u00e0 la ligne de la hauteur de l'\u00e9difice le moins \u00e9lev\u00e9, lorsque les deux \u00e9difices sont de hauteur in\u00e9gale), et aussi la copropri\u00e9t\u00e9 du sol sur lequel le mur est assis. Ici il y a copropri\u00e9t\u00e9 et mitoyennet\u00e9 du pignon seulement, et non du mur entier ou de ses assises, et cela \u00e0 partir d'une hauteur de neuf pieds du sol seulement.\nCel\u00e0 \u00e9tant, j'arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que le droit accord\u00e9 \u00e0 Woolsworth, bien que ce droit soit qualifi\u00e9 de perp\u00e9tuel, \u00e9tait le droit de s'appuyer sur le pignon d'une maison d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme actuellement existante lors de la passation de l\u2019acte de vente, et non pas, comme on aurait pu le dire, le droit de s'appuyer sur tout mur ou \u00e9difice qui pourrait \u00eatre construit sur le terrain de Hart, et le pignon seul \u00e0 partir de neuf pieds du sol \u00e9tait mitoyen entre les parties. Ce droit de servitude, qui avait pour objet ce pignon, ne pouvait s'exercer que tant que le pignon subsistait lui-m\u00eame. Si ce pignon, objet de ce droit de servitude, venait \u00e0 p\u00e9rir par cas fortuit, le droit de servitude cessait (art. 559 C.C.), car tout droit, perp\u00e9tuel ou non, cesse lorsque son objet n'existe plus (art. 1200 C.C.).\nJe ne perds pas de vue la disposition de l'article 522 C.C., mais cet article laisse encore \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les parties dans l'esp\u00e8ce ont r\u00e9ellement voulu cr\u00e9er un droit de servitude qui devait subsister plus longtemps que l'objet sur lequel ce droit devait s'exercer, et je ne crois pas qu'elles aient eu cette intention.\nOr, le mur de pignon et toute la maison de Hart, ainsi que la b\u00e2tisse qui s'y appuyait, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truits dans l'incendie de 1908, ce qui \u00e9videmment est un cas fortuit. Le droit accord\u00e9 \u00e0 Woolsworth se trouvant d\u00e8s lors sans, objet a cess\u00e9 de pouvoir s'exercer, et les ayants cause de Hart n'\u00e9taient pas oblig\u00e9s de reconstruire leur maison, car, en mati\u00e8re de servitude, l'obligation du fonds servant est passive, ce qu'on exprimait autrefois par la maxime : servitutum non ea natura est ut quis aliquid faciat sed ut patiatur et non faciat.\nIl est vrai que les intim\u00e9s ont b\u00e2ti une maison dont le mur lat\u00e9ral se trouve en partie seulement sur l'emplacement de l'ancien mur, mais on ne peut dire avec l'article 560 C.C. que\nles choses sont r\u00e9tablies de mani\u00e8re qu'on puisse en user,\ncar l'appelante all\u00e8gue que le mur de la nouvelle maison ne peut servir de mur mitoyen. Et pour cette m\u00eame raison elle veut forcer les intim\u00e9s \u00e0 reconstruire \u00e0 leurs frais le mur de leur maison jusqu'\u00e0 la hauteur de neuf pieds du sol, de mani\u00e8re qu'il puisse supporter le poids de la construction que l'appelante veut \u00e9riger. Si, apr\u00e8s l'incendie, l'appelante ne pouvait forcer les intim\u00e9s \u00e0 reconstruire leur mur, je cro\u00ees qu'elle ne peut les obliger \u00e0 d\u00e9molir et \u00e0 refaire le mur qu'ils ont b\u00e2ti, pour la raison que ce mur ne suffirait pas comme mur d'appui pour la construction de l'appelante.\nL'appelante donc se trouve dans cette situation que le droit de mitoyennet\u00e9 qu'elle invoque ne peut plus s'exercer, et elle n'est pas dans les conditions de la mitoyennet\u00e9 l\u00e9gale, car son terrain n'est pas contigu au site de l'ancien mur. Son action, avec les conclusions qu'elle renferme, manque absolument, \u00e0 mon avis, de base juridique.\nPour ces motifs\u2014et sans d\u00e9cider si le d\u00e9faut de mention dans les actes subs\u00e9quents du droit d'appui en question et le d\u00e9faut d'enregistrement de la servitude ont rendu cette servitude inopposable aux intim\u00e9es\u2014 je suis d'avis de renvoyer l'appel de l'appelante avec d\u00e9pens.\nJe n'exprime aucune opinion quant au motif sur lequel la cour d'appel se base en s'appuyant sur la d\u00e9cision de cette cour dans la cause de Delorme v. Cusson[10]. Cette d\u00e9cision ne me para\u00eet qu'un arr\u00eat d'esp\u00e8ce que l'on aurait tort de vouloir \u00e9riger en arr\u00eat de principe.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Fortunat Lord.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Duplessis & Langlois.\n[1] Q.R. 28 K.B. 14.\n[2] 28 Can.

Sask, [1915] c. 14, ss. 23 and 25\u2014Licence to do business in province\u2014Dominion companies.\nSecs. 23 and 25 of the Saskatchewan \"Companies Act\" requiring all companies, as a condition for doing business in the province, to be registered and take out an annual licence are intra vires of the legislature and apply to, and may be enforced against, a company incorporated by the Parliament of Canada to do business throughout the Dominion. John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton ([1915] A.C. 330; 18 D.L.R. 353), distinguished.\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan, Harmer v. A. Macdonald Co. (10 Sask. L.R. 231, 33 D.L.R. 363), affirmed. APPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan[1], affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff. The effect of this judgment was to affirm the convictions against the appellant companies in the other two cases.\nThe Great West Saddlery Company and the John Deere Plow Company were convicted by a police magistrate of Regina of violating the provisions of secs. 23, 24 and 25 of the \"Companies Act\" of Saskatchewan and on a case stated to the Supreme Court the convictions were affirmed. In the Harmer Case an action was brought to restrain the company from carrying on business without being registered or licensed under these provisions.\nSecs. 23, 24 and 25 of the Act read as follows:\u2014\n\"23. Any company, whether incorporated under the provisions of this Act or otherwise, having gain for its object or part of its object and carrying on business in Saskatchewan, shall be registered under this Act.\n(2) Any unregistered company carrying on business, and any company, firm, broker or other person carrying on business as a representative, or on behalf of such unregistered company, shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a penalty not exceeding $50 for every day on which such business is carried on in contravention of this section, and proof of compliance with the provisions of this section shall be at all times upon the accused.\n(3) The taking of orders by travellers for goods, wares or merchandise to be subsequently imported into Saskatchewan to fill such orders, or the buying or selling of such goods, wares or merchandise by correspondence, if the company has no resident agent or representative and no warehouse, office or place of business in Saskatchewan, shall not be deemed to be carrying on business within the meaning of this Act.\n24. Any company may become registered in Saskatchewan for any lawful purpose on compliance with the provisions of this Act and on payment to the Registrar of the fees prescribed in the regulations:\nProvided that the Registrar may in the case of all companies (other than those incorporated by or under the authority of an Act of the Parliament of Canada) or proposed companies refer the application to the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council who may refuse registration at his discretion, and in the case of refusal such company or proposed company shall not be registered. 25. Every company may, upon complying with the provisions of this Act and the regulations, receive a license from the Registrar to carry on its business and exercise its powers in Saskatchewan.\n(2) Such license shall expire on the thirty-first day of December in the year for which it is issued, but shall be renewable annually upon payment of the prescribed fees.\n(3) A company receiving a license from the Registrar may, subject to the provisions of its charter, Act or other instrument creating it, carry on its business to the same extent as if it had been incorporated under this Act.\n(4) There shall be paid to His Majesty, for the public use of Saskatchewan, for every license under this Act, such fees as may be prescribed by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council.\n(5) Every company which carries on business in Saskatchewan without a license, and every president, vice-president, director and secretary or secretary-treasurer of such company, shall be respectively guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding $25 for every day the default continues.\nThe decision of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan as to whether or not these provisions were intra vires was asked by the stated case and appeal and given in favour of their validity.\nWenegast, for the appellant, submitted that the provisions could not be distinguished from those in the \"Companies Act\" of British Columbia held in John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[2], to be ultra vires.\nChrysler K.C. for the respondent the Government of Saskatchewan. The legislature has eliminated from the \"Companies Act\" the provisions held ultra vires in John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton2.\nThe present legislation is authorised by sec. 92 of the \"British North America Act, 1867\"; Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[3]; Brewers and Malsters Assoc. v. Attorney-General of Ontario[4]; and does not infringe the powers given the Dominion Parliament by sec. 91; In re Insurance Act, 1910[5]; In re Companies[6]; Lionel Davis for the respondent Harmer referred to Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[7]; Colonial Building and Investment Assoc. v. Attorney-General of Quebec[8]; and Attorney-General of Manitoba v. Manitoba License Holders Assoc.[9].\nC. C. Robinson for the Dominion of Canada. The Wharton Case[10] laid down general principles as to the rights and powers of federal companies; In re Companies[11]; and the legislation in question does not accord therewith.\nA provincial company can enter another province only by comity but a federal company does so of right. See Bonanza Creek Gold Mining Co. v. The King[12]; and its right cannot be interfered with by provincial legislation. In re Insurance Act, 1910[13].\nNesbitt K.C. and Barton for the Ontario Government also contended that the legislation is intra vires.\nWenegast, for the appellant.\nChrysler K.C. for the respondent.\nLionel Davis for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014These three actions which were brought to test the constitutional validity of certain sections of the \"Companies Act\" of Saskatchewan, R.S.S. 1915, ch. 14, requiring all companies, provincial and foreign, to register in the province and to take out an annual licence and pay an annual fee before carrying on business therein and providing that every company carrying on business in Saskatchewan without such licence should be guilty of an offence and be liable on summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding $50 for every day the default continued, came before us in one consolidated appeal and were argued together. The trial judge in the court of first instance upheld the validity of the impeached sections, and the Court of Appeal in that province, consisting of five judges, unanimously confirmed the judgment of the trial judge.\nThe sections in question, the validity of which is impeached, were enacted by the legislature of that province after the decision of the Judicial Committee in the case of John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[14], and were, no doubt, enacted in an honest attempt to comply with the principles which in that case it was declared should control provincial legislation with respect to companies chartered by the Dominion of Canada. The objectionable features of the previously existing legislation of the Saskatchewan Legislature, somewhat similar to those sections of the British Columbia Legislature which in the Wharton Case14 had been held ultra vires, were eliminated and the present provisions introduced in lieu of them.\nWhether the legislature has been successful or not in avoiding the constitutional perils of enactments which may be said to some extent to control and regulate the business activities in the province of Dominion companies is the question now before us. It depends altogether upon the construction given to the reasons for judgment of the Judicial Committee in the Wharton Case14, before referred to. I have read and re-read this judgment several times and studied it most carefully. As a result, I cannot conclude that the legislature in this instance has exceeded its powers in enacting legislation requiring all companies, local and foreign, including Dominion, to register and pay an annual fee Nor do I think the section imposing a penalty upon a Dominion company for every day it carries on business in the province without having paid the annual fee is ultra vires or other than a reasonable sanction to the requirement of the payment of the annual tax or fee imposed.\nI reach this conclusion not without grave doubt whether the section requiring the company to take out a licence to carry on business in a province is not objectionable and ultra vires. In the result, however, I have concluded that the Saskatchewan \"Companies Act\" as amended and now before us, while in form to some extent objectionable as seeming to require a provincial licence to enable a Dominion company to carry on its business in the province may nevertheless be so construed as to be held to be merely a taxing Act, levying an annual tax or fee, alike on local companies as on extra-provincial companies, including Dominion ones. Its form may be, and I think is, objectionable and unfortunate, but its essence and substance merely require the payment of an annual fee or tax with a provision that the company shall not carry on its business in the province until the annual fee is paid subject to a penalty for every day it so transgresses.\nThe requirement of payment of such a tax is not objectionable and is expressly referred to in the Wharton Case[15], by the Judicial Committee as permissible legislation by the province while the penalty for non-payment of the fee may be looked upon as a non-objectionable sanction for the recovery of the tax.\nI do not think the requirement of a licence to enable the company to carry on its business is intra vires, but I would in this case treat it as negligible and inapplicable to Dominion companies, and if the tax was paid more in the nature of a receipt for its payment than as a licence to carry on business, I do not think the company, after payment of the tax, would be liable to the penalty prescribed if it declined to accept the licence and continued to carry on its business. The legislature has no power to require the acceptance of a licence from it to enable a Dominion company to carry on its business in the province. It might require registration, it might impose an annual tax, it might possibly enact the penalty clause as a sanction for the recovery of the tax, but it could not compel the company to accept a licence from it to enable it to carry on its business. The company derived its power to do that throughout the Dominion from the Dominion which gave it its charter and while the legislature could not prohibit or control the exercise of these powers it nevertheless could, in my judgment, exact the payment of an annual tax from the Dominion company in common with other foreign companies and local companies which itself created and chartered and could probably enforce the payment of such tax by the imposition of a penalty. I reach this latter conclusion, as I have said, with difficulty and doubt. It is to be regretted that the legislation should take the form it did, but looking at its essence and construing it as I do, I will not hold it to be ultra vires.\nOf course, the legislation requiring a licence and prescribing a penalty or penalties for not taking one out before carrying on business may take an objectionable form. In the case before us I think, on my construction of the statute, it, while objectionable in form, is not so in essence. The license required, the fee payable and the penalty prescribed apply equally to local and foreign companies, which include Dominion, and it cannot be successfully argued that the fees are excessive or that they are other than such fees as may reasonably be imposed as direct taxation for the purpose of revenue within the province. Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[16].\nNor can it be said that such fees and the penalties imposed on the company for carrying on its business without their payment are really calculated to affect the status or powers of a Dominion company. The penalties prescribed are only a means of recovering the annual fees. Once those fees are paid these penalties could not be exacted.\nI may add that I have not reached my conclusion as to the licence without doubt and hesitation in view of the reasons for the decision in the Wharton Case[17], and as these appeals avowedly seek to obtain a judicial construction of the judgment of the Privy Council in that case it would have been better from every standpoint, in my opinion, if they had been taken direct to the fountain head which could best explain the exact meaning and effect of the principles it laid down, and so avoid the delays and costs of totally unnecessary appeals to this court.\nI would, in view of the reasons given above, dismiss these appeals with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014These appeals were by consent reargued together, and they ought to be decided upon the same single neat point of law whether or not a local legislature can tax an incorporated business company deriving its incorporation from the Dominion Parliament.\nAll the other issues attempted in argument to be dragged into the case seem entirely irrelevant. If the tax is paid the other issues become of no consequence for the purposes of the disposition of the litigation respectively involved in each case. The issuing of any more interrogatories on merely abstract points of law by the Dominion Government to this court for purposes of information or of testing the limits of the powers of local legislatures in regard to some supposed assertion or possible assertion of power, seems for the present to have reached the bounds of its toleration, yet that does not seem to have exhausted the resources of ingenuity on the part of others for we are invited to answer in some of these cases questions needless to answer if the power of taxation in question exists.\nThe Legislature of Saskatchewan, having due and proper regard to the fate which rightly befell some extremely unjustifiable British Columbia legislation in the case of John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[18], decided to conform, so far as it could, to the decision in that case; repealed its old statutes bearing upon the like questions (of which some are not involved herein) and enacted a new \"Companies Act\" wherein it incorporated a provision for registration and licensing of all corporate business companies and subjected all, whether of local organization under the Act, or of Dominion or of foreign origin, to an initiative and annual license fee of the same graduated scale fixing the amount to be paid in proportion to capital. It clearly did this by way of taxation which the appellants seek to escape.\nI know of no reason why they should not be subjected thereto or why the place of origin should be a ground for freeing them from the common burden all should bear in support of the government of the province\u2014where they choose to carry on business\u2014and seek the protection it gives.\nNor do I see any imperative reason for confining the exercise of the taxing power to some statute earmarked as a taxing Act.\nThe questions of choice of subjects for taxation and equality of burden to be borne thereby, and best modes of enforcing payment thereof, have never yet been scientifically settled in a way satisfactory to those who have paid the greatest attention to such questions.\nWhat we have primarily to deal with is the single issue of whether the annual tax for the non-payment of which one of these companies has been penalized, falls within what is referred to in the \"British North America Act\" as \"direct taxation.\"\nIt seems to fall well within the decisions in the cases of Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[19], and the Brewers & Malsters Association v. Attorney-General of Ontario[20], as being direct taxation.\nIndeed no question was raised in argument founded upon any doubt as to this tax being direct taxation.\nIn the graduated scale as a basis for its application I cannot distinguish it from the former and in the licensing fee as a mode of its imposition it seems to fall within the latter case.\nI cannot, where the power seems so clear, entertain, as a valid argument, in answer to the judgment in the two first named cases enforcing the penalties, the objection that there are provisions in the Act claimed to be ultra vires.\nThese collateral contentions seem wholly irrelevant to the single issue before us, so far at least as concern the respective judgments for penalties.\nTheir introduction seems but an attempt to becloud the real issue which is a very narrow one.\nAs to the Harmer Case, though not differentiated in the argument from the other two, it occurred to me that possibly the introduction of some of these alleged objections was not so far fetched.\nIn that we have to consider the basis upon which a shareholder is proceeding against his company for relief.\nI am, however, of the opinion that there is quite enough in the plaintiff shareholder's complaint, when confined to the question of improperly incurring penalties by refusing to pay the tax and all implied therein, to maintain the action and the resultant judgment, without considering the other excuses for not doing so or contentions set up by either party.\nIt seems to me the same observations are applicable to the appeal in the Manitoba case.\nI observe, however, that there is a slight difference between the language used in the final clause of the case stated in the Harmer Case, and that used in the final clause of the case submitted to the Manitoba courts. I shall revert to this in closing what I have to say.\nI agree entirely with the reasons assigned by the late learned Chief Justice of Manitoba, and substantially with all advanced by Mr. Justice Cameron in support of the judgment of the Court of Appea from Manitoba in the Davidson Case.\nIn deference to the argument presented herein, I desire to point out that, in my opinion, a corporation, by whomsoever or whatsoever power created, has no greater right in any province than a private individual enjoying full rights of citizenship and not personally disqualified in any way, going there to do business and in many respects has less, unless expressly given same by virtue of some legislative authority endowed with power to do so as, for example, in the cases of banks or railway companies. If created by the Dominion authority its capacity must fall within what an exercise of the so-called residuary powers of the Dominion may create, unless in the cases specifically provided for either expressly or impliedly in the enumerated powers of the \"British North America Act\" conferred on the Dominion.\nThe Great West Saddlery Company in question in no way falls within any of the latter. There is, therefore, no reason for relying upon any such implication as may arise in favour of the corporation created to execute the purposes of any of the said enumerated powers.\nIt was suggested in argument that the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the Wharton Case[21], had said the Dominion \"Companies Act\" rested upon item No. 2 of the said enumerated powers. I do not so read it. And after the numerous futile attempts theretofore made, before said court, to make that item relative to \"Trade and Commerce\" subservient to the enlargement of the powers of the Dominion in relation to conferring extraordinary powers upon ordinary trading companies, I submit respectfully, that any such expression if to be read as suggested, must be treated as obiter dicta.\nIt was in no way necessary for the decision of the single neat point decided in the Wharton Case21.\nMoreover, we have, since that case, the expression, of opinion by it in the insurance case, Attorney-General for Canada v. Attorney-General of Alberta[22], which seems to deny the power to rest any licence thereon to carry on any \"particular trade.\"\nThe pith of the said expression of opinion is contained in the following extract:\u2014 There was a good deal in the \"Ontario Liquor License Act,\" and the powers of regulation which it entrusted to local authorities in the province, which seems to cover part of the field of legislation recognized as belonging to the Dominion in Russell v. The Queen[23]. But in Hodge v. The Queen[24], the Judicial Committee had no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that the local licensing system which the Ontario statute sought to set up was within provincial powers. It was only the converse of this proposition to hold, as was done subsequently by this Board, though without giving reasons, that the Dominion licensing statute, known as the \"McCarthy Act,\" which sought to establish a local licensing system for the liquor traffic throughout Canada, was beyond the powers conferred on the Dominion Parliament by s. 91. Their Lordships think that as the result of these decisions it must now be taken that the authority to legislate for the regulation of trade and commerce does not extend to the regulation by a licensing system of a particular trade in which Canadians would otherwise be free to engage in the provinces.\nThis express declaration of the court above relevant to the non-existence of the power claimed for the Dominion so far as rested upon the enumerated item of \"Trade and Commerce\" seems to be conclusive against the contention of appellant, for it is only by virtue of something alleged to rest upon said item the mysterious right is asserted.\nIf the Dominion cannot assert the power claimed for it by way of an express licence, much less can it do so by mere incorporation giving specified rights to certain parties to trade in a corporate capacity.\nThe legal entity must submit to the same laws properly enacted by and within the powers of a provincial legislature as the private individual.\nThe power to impose a tax and enforce its collection by means of prohibition to trade until it has been paid and its payment evidenced by a licence has been asserted and upheld especially in relation to the manufacture and sale of liquor in so very many ways that one is surprised to hear the argument now put forward that the doing so is to be treated as an improper assertion of power and a denial of anything more than it means.\nThough the testing of the power has been more in evidence before the courts in relation to the liquor traffic than any other, the successful assertion of the power has been asserted in manifold ways by provincial legislation ever since Confederation.\nMuch of that has been asserted through the powers given the municipalities, which again rests upon item No. 9 of sec. 92 of the \"British North America Act,\" as to the licensing power as a means of raising revenue.\nThe taxation of transient traders by municipalities \u2014a very old form of tax\u2014and sometimes of the travelling circus would be an illusory thing if the collection was not enforced by prohibition of carrying on the business of him so liable.\nI only present these casual illustrations as a test of the possible need of the power to prohibit the carrying on of business until the tax may have been paid, in order to render it effective, of which no reasonable person, speaking of its possible exercise in relation to such cases, would be likely to deny. A judicial creation of a mere theoretical power to tax without any potentiality of its enforcement is apparently the high aim of the appellants.\nBut so long as the decision in Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons[25], and all involved therein stands as good law the power of the provincial legislatures over contracts will remain what it was always intended to be.\nThere would not seem to be in principle any difference in the quality of the power invoked whether exercised in relation to such transients or others presenting greater promise of permanency.\nYet the transient trader or the circus man might easily become incorporated and often is in fact. Are we to say incorporation by virtue of the Dominion legislation inherently carries with it a greater sanctity than any other?\nWe do know from the record herein that the \"John Deere Plow Company, Limited,\" one of the appellants herein, became so incorporated on the application of four gentlemen of Moline, in the State of Illinois, one of the United States of America, and a dealer in Winnipeg.\nWhy should such a legal entity be entitled to claim, merely because so created by virtue of Dominion legislation, professing only so to create, and not pretending thereby to confer greater rights to trade anywhere in Canada, than any mere private individual citizen of Canada possesses, that it has such superior rights?\nThe questions submitted are not necessary for the determination of the single issue which the pleading presents in either the Harmer Case from Saskatchewan or the Davidson Case from Manitoba.\nEach plaintiff is entitled to succeed by reason of the company attacked defying the law of the province in question and thereby becoming liable to penalties and possibly more serious consequences.\nI am strongly impressed with a suspicion begotten of circumstances coming under my observation in these proceedings and the needless frame of the questions submitted that these actions are collusive and used as a means of interrogating this court in a way it should not submit to at the mere whim of any private individuals desiring to know how far their companies can go.\nLong ago, in the Province of Ontario, provision was made by legislation for the settlement of contentions between that province and the Dominion, or it and other provinces. And likewise provision was made for the court having jurisdiction at the suit of either the Attorney-General for Canada or the Attorney-General for Ontario to entertain an action for a declaration as to the validity of any statute or any provision therein, and the \"Constitutional Questions Act\" of Ontario had existed from an earlier period.\nThe existence of such legislation, as well as similar legislation by the Dominion, seems to indicate, to put it mildly, a doubt as to the propriety of private individuals attempting what is attempted by some part of what is before us herein.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs to each of the respondents in the case wherein he is concerned.\nAnglin J \u2014The impeached provisions of the \"Companies Act\" of Saskatchewan (R.S.S. 1915 ch. 14) are, in my opinion, clearly distinguishable from those of the British Columbia statute held to be ultra vires in John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[26]. The important differences are so fully and so satisfactorily pointed out and discussed in the judgments of Elwood and Newlands JJ. in the Saskatchewan courts, and in the opinions prepared by my brothers Brodeur and Mignault, which I have had the advantage of perusing, that I cannot do better than adopt the reasons given by them for concurring in the dismissal of these appeals.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The three appellant companies are incorporated under the authority of the \"Companies Act\" of Canada (R.S.C. ch. 79) and are empowered to carry on their business throughout the Dominion of Canada. By the provisions of secs. 23 and 25 of the Saskatchewan \"Companies Act\" any company carrying on business in the province must register and take out a licence. As the appellant companies have not registered and have not taken out the prescribed licence, they have been prosecuted. They claim that those provisions of the provincial statute are ultra vires and they rely on the decision of the Privy Council in the case of John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[27], to sustain their contention.\nThe John Deere Plow Case27 had reference to the operation of the \"Companies Act\" of British Columbia, which empowered the provincial authorities to refuse to a federal company the right to carry on business on the ground that there was another company of the same name upon the local register. The evidence shewed that the John Deere Plow Company had applied for a licence and its application had been rejected. Such legislation and action affected the status of the company itself, though it had been incorporated by the Dominion authorities, and the Privy Council decided (1), that the legislation was ultra vires of a provincial legislature, as far as the federal companies were concerned.\nWhen the John Deere Plow decision was rendered, the Saskatchewan legislation contained provisions similar to those of British Columbia, and the Saskatchewan Legislature, at its next session, repealed the objectionable provisions and the companies legislation is now contained in the ch. 14 of the statutes of 1915. The provisions as to registration and licensing, which were applicable formerly to foreign and Dominion companies, are now of general application to all companies, whether they are incorporated by the province itself or by the Dominion or other provincial authorities or foreign states.\nThe statute simply provides that all companies, whether local or not, would be equally taxed by means of licence, and the statute also provides that they should all be registered.\nThe failure of those companies to take a licence or to register renders them liable to a penalty.\nThere is nothing in the statute which prevents them from carrying out their corporate powers to make contracts and to sue under those contracts, but they are simply required to observe the general registration provisions and take a licence for purposes of taxation.\nThe object of the registration provision is to keep the public informed as to the status of those companies. They are bound to hand over to the registrar a return shewing the amount of the share capital, the quantity subscribed and paid up, the names of the directors and some other useful information which the public may need to do business with those companies (section 34). It is of the utmost importance for a person who contracts with a corporation to know the legal status of the latter and to see whether the contract contemplated is within the powers granted to the company by its Act of incorporation or its letters patent.\nThe fees which the company have to pay for their registration look to me as being very reasonable and could hardly cover the expenses which the establishment of the registrar's office would entail.\nThe unauthorised and fictitious companies will then be prevented from deceiving the public, since any one may obtain from the registrar the information as to any bon\u00e2 fide company and may ascertain the powers and standing of such company in the same manner as if the company had obtained its charter under provincial authority.\nPerhaps that knowledge could be procured in applying to the Dominion authorities; but who is going to inform the person desirous of procuring that information that the company is a federal one? It might be a foreign or provincial company. Besides, the distances in our country are so great that each province should have in its capital the necessary data as to the existence, the status and the capacity of any company.\nThat provision concerning registration is a law of general application enacted under the powers conferred by section 92, and there is nothing in it which may deprive a federal company of its status and powers.\nThe obligation for a federal company to take out a licence from and pay a tax to the provincial authorities is also a law of general application; it and the companies incorporated locally have to pay for it just as well as the companies incorporated outside the province\nIn the case of Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[28], that question has been decided. It was there held that though the banks are incorporated by the Dominion Parliament, they may be bound to contribute to the public objects of the provinces where they carry on business.\nThat same principle was affirmed by the Privy Council in the Brewers & Malsters Case[29], where the Ontario \"Liquor License Act,\" which provided that no person should sell any liquors for consumption in the province without having first obtained a licence was held to be valid.\nThe judgment of the inferior courts in the present cases, which decided that secs. 23 and 25 of the Saskatchewan \"Companies Act\" were valid and intra vires, are well founded.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nMignault J.\u2014These three appeals were argued together and the question is as to the validity of secs. 23 and 25 of the \"Companies Act\" of Saskatchewan, ch. 14 of the statutes of 1915.\nThat Act was passed after the decision of the Privy Council in the case of John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[30], and the intention was, no doubt, to conform to the rules therein stated. Whether the legislature has done so is the question which has now to be decided.\nIn my opinion in the case of the Great West Saddlery Company, Limited v. Davidson[31] I have stated the test, derived from the decision of the Privy Council in the John Deere Plow Company Case, according to which the validity of such legislation must be determined. This test is whether a Dominion company is compelled to obtain a licence and to be registered in a province as a condition of exercising its powers.\nThe material sections of the Saskatchewan statute, which essentially differs from the Manitoba \"Companies Act\" referred to in the other case, are secs. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 and 30, which are in the following terms.\u2014\n23. Any company, whether incorporated under the provisions of this Act or otherwise, having gain for its object or part of its object, and carrying on business in Saskatchewan, shall be registered under this Act.\n(2) Any unregistered company carrying on business and any company, firm, broker or other person carrying on business as a representative or on behalf of such unregistered company, shall be liable, on summary conviction, to a penalty not exceeding $50 for every day on which such business is carried on in contravention of this section, and proof of compliance with the provisions of this section shall be at all times upon the accused.\n(3) The taking of orders by travellers for goods, wares or merchandise to be subsequently imported into Saskatchewan to fill such orders or the buying or selling of such goods, wares or merchandise by correspondence, if the company has no resident agent or representative and no warehouse, office or place of business in Saskatchewan, shall not be deemed to be carrying on business within the meaning of this Act.\n24. Any company may become registered in Saskatchewan for any lawful purpose on compliance with the provisions of this Act and on payment to the registrar of the fees prescribed in the regulations;\nProvided that the registrar may in the case of all companies (other than those incorporated by or under the authority of an Act of the Parliament of Canada) or proposed companies refer the application to the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council who may refuse registration at his discretion, and in the case of refusal such company or proposed company shall not be registered.\n25. Every company may, upon complying with the provisions of this Act and the regulations, receive a license from the registrar to carry on its business and exercise its powers in Saskatchewan.\n(2) Such license shall expire on the thirty-first day of December in the year for which it is issued, but shall be renewable annually upon payment of the prescribed fees.\n(3) A company receiving a license from the registrar may, subject to the provisions of its charter, Act or other instrument creating it, carry on its business to the same extent as if it had been incorporated under this Act.\n(4) There shall be paid to His Majesty, for the public use of Saskatchewan for every license under this Act, such fees as may be prescribed by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council.\n(5) Every company which carries on business in Saskatchewan without a license, and every president, vice-president, director and secretary or secretary-treasurer of such company, shall be respectively guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a penalty not exceeding $25.00 for every day the default continues.\n26. Every incorporated company shall, before registration, file with the registrar a certified copy of its charter and by-laws and a statutory declaration of the president, vice-president, secretary, or manager, that it is still in existence, and legally authorized to transact business under its charter.\n27. The Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council may prescribe and from time to time alter, such regulations as he may deem expedient for the registration of all companies, and may fix the fees and other payments to be made in connection with the administration of this Act, and such regulations shall have the same force and effect as if incorporated in and forming part of this Act.\n(2) All regulations in connection with this Act shall be published in the Saskatchewan Gazette.\n28. Every company not exclusively engaged in the business of banking, insurance, express, railways, telephones, telegraph, trust, loan, land, building, contracting, agencies, farming, ranching, employment, recreation, and such other business as may from time to time be determined by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, shall not later than the first day of January in every year pay an annual fee prescribed by the regulations of the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council.\n30. Should the registrar not receive any fee prescribed by the regulations made by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council under this Act by the date such fee is due, he shall send to the company in default a registered letter notifying it of its liability and at the expiration of a period of one month, should such fee remain unpaid, he shall, without further notice, cause the name of the company to be struck off the register and publish the fact in the Saskatchewan Gazette;\nProvided that the liability of every director or officer or member of the company shall continue and may be enforced as if the name of the company had not been struck off the register.\nIt is to be noted that these sections apply to all companies whether incorporated under the Saskatchewan statute or otherwise, and that the registrar does not appear to have the right to refuse registration to companies incorporated under the authority of an Act of the Parliament of Canada. There are no provisions, such as secs. 118 and 122 of the Manitoba \"Companies Act,\" prohibiting a Dominion company from carrying on business in the province until it has obtained a licence, and denying it access to the courts to enforce contracts made by it while unlicensed\nThe real point, to my mind, is not whether the appellant companies were required to register and to obtain a licence but whether they were compelled to obtain registration and a licence as a condition of exercising their powers in the Province of Saskatchewan.\nThey were, no doubt, required to register and to secure a licence, and in default of registration they were subject to a penalty not exceeding $50 for every day on which they carried on business in contravention to section 23, and in the case of their failure to take a licence they were, under section 25, subject to a penalty for carrying on business in Saskatchewan without a licence not exceeding $25 for every day the default continued.\nThe form of expression in section 25 is not exactly the same as in section 23, but the effect of both sections is that if these companies carry on business in Saskatchewan without having registered or without having obtained a licence, they incur a separate penalty for each day they so carry on business.\nDo these provisions amount to compelling these companies to register and obtain a licence as a condition of exercising their powers in Saskatchewan? As I have said, there is nothing here, as in the Manitoba Act, prohibiting an unlicensed Dominion company from carrying on business or depriving it of the power to sue on contracts made by it in pursuance of its business. But inasmuch as carrying on business without registration and without a licence is made an offence punishable by a fine, it is argued that this business is thereby made illegal so that no right to sue on a contract made under these circumstances would exist by law.\nIt is to be noted that in the John Deere Plow Co. Case[32], the British Columbia \"Companies Act\" under consideration contained a similar provision (section 167) to secs. 23 and 25 of the Saskatchewan statute, and the Judicial Committee, at page 337, after mentioning, among other provisions of the British Columbia statute, sec. 167, said:\u2014\nWhat their Lordships have to decide is whether it was competent to the province to legislate so as to interfere with the carrying on of the business in the province of a Dominion company under the circumstances stated.\nAnd after discussing secs. 91 and 92 of the \"British North America Act\" they add:\u2014 It follows from these premises that these provisions of the \"Companies Act\" of British Columbia which are relied on in the present case as compelling the appellant company to obtain a provincial licence of the kind about which the controversy has arisen, or to be registered in the province as a condition of exercising its powers or of suing in the courts, are inoperative for these purposes.\nTheir Lordships did not attempt to define a priori the full extent to which Dominion companies may be restrained in the exercise of their powers by provincial legislation, although they stated that a Dominion company could not refuse to obey the statutes of a province as to mortmain, or escape the payment of taxes, although these may assume the forms of requiring, as a method of raising a revenue, a licence to trade which affects a Dominion company in common with other companies. Somewhat tentatively they added that it might have been competent to the legislature to pass laws applying to companies without distinction, and requiring those that were not incorporated in the province to register for certain limited purposes, such as the furnishing of information.\nThe Saskatchewan statute applies to all companies whether incorporated in the province or otherwise. The registration required by section 23 does not per se, as I read the statute, furnish any information, but it is enacted by section 34 that, not later than the 1st March in each year after its registration, the company shall furnish certain particulars to the registrar. It is obvious, however, that the statute was drafted with the purpose of bringing it well within the rules laid down in the John Deere Plow Co. Case[33].\nI now come back to the question which I stated above, whether sections 23 and 25 compel the appellant companies to register and obtain a licence as a condition of exercising their powers. My difficulty to answer this question in the affirmative is that, under the holding in the John Deere Plow Case[34], the province can for the purpose of raising a revenue, require a licence to trade which affects a Dominion company in common with other companies. If so, it can impose a penalty for failure to take out the licence (\"British North America Act,\" sec. 92, sub-s. 15). Can this penalty be imposed for each day during which the company carries on business without taking out a licence? Inasmuch as the province can, for revenue purposes, require the taking out of a licence to trade, as decided in the John Deere Plow Case34, it follows that it can impose a penalty for trading without such licence, and therefore for each day during which the unlicensed company carries on trade. This does not give to sections 23 and 25 of the Saskatchewan statute the effect of compelling the appellant companies to register and to obtain a licence as a condition of exercising their powers. These companies, with all other companies, are compelled to take out a licence to trade and to pay therefor the fees prescribed by the Lieutenant-Gover-nor-in-Council, and their liability to pay the penalty is not due to the fact that they are exercising their powers under their charters but that they are carrying on business without taking out a licence to trade.\nThe appellants complain that the basis of the registration fee is the nominal or authorized capital of the company without regard to the amount paid thereon or the amount employed in the province. This may be objectionable, but I cannot see how it can affect the question of jurisdiction.\nI would, therefore, think that sections 23 and 25 of the Saskatchewan \"Companies Act\" are not ultra vires, and that the appeals of the appellant companies should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Mackenzie, Brown, Thorn, McMorran, MacDonald, Bastedo & Jackson.\nSolicitors for the respondent Harmer: Cross, Jonah, Hugg & Forbes.\nSolicitor for the respondent The King: H.

The litigation arose out of an agreement of the 13th March, 1917, between the appellant and Curtis's & Harvey (of Canada), Limited, whereby the latter, for the consideration therein stated, promised to pay the appellant the sum of $250,000,00, payable as follows:\u2014$25,000.00 in ten days, $75,000.00 before the end of May, 1917, and $150,000.00 before the 15th July, 1917, with option to the company, in the event of its obtaining any new contract involving deliveries after the completion of existing contracts, that it might pay the last instalment of $150,000.00 in three amounts of $50,000.00 on the last days of July, August and September, 1917, with interest at 6%.\nBy clause 7 of the agreement, it was provided that Until full payment of the sum of $250,000.00, the company would not deal with, dispose of or charge its assets, save in the ordinary course of its business operations, under a penalty of $50,000.00 payable to the appellant.\nThe company paid the two first instalments, and the condition provided for having happened, it made option to pay the balance of $150,000 in three instalments, and it paid the first of these instalments, $50,000.00, which became due on the 31st July, 1917. On the 18th August, 1917, practically the whole of the company's plant and materials at Dragon were destroyed by fire and explosions which prevented the continuance of the company's manufacturing operations, and it was decided that it was inadvisable to rebuild the plant.\nThe company had then an unfinished contract with the United States Government, entered into in July, 1917, for the manufacture of 10,800,000 pounds of refined trinitro-toluol, which contract was cancelled after the fire, and the United States Government made a new contract with Canadian Explosives Limited out of which a substantial percentage of profit was to be paid, and was paid, to the company.\nA winding-up order was made against the company on the 5th October, 1917, on the petition of the secretary of the company in his capacity as shareholder, but at the request of the company which acquiesced in the winding-up order.\nThe appellant filed his claim with the liquidator for the balance of $100,000 then due to him, and also claimed the penalty of $50,000.00 on the ground that the company had violated clause 7 of the agreement. This latter claim was contested by the liquidator whose contestation was maintained by the Superior Court and by the Court of King's Bench.\nIt is stated in the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Martin, in the latter court, that the liquidator has since paid the appellant $75,000.00 and that there remains only due $25,000.00 on the $250,000.00 payable under the agreement.\nWith regard to the penalty of $50,000.00, both courts have held that the appellant cannot claim it under clause 7 of the agreement, the Superior Court because the company had not dealt with its assets in the manner provided against, and the Court of King's Bench mainly because by the happening of the fire of the 18th August, 1917, the condition of clause 7 no longer applied and the company was entitled to deal with its remaining assets in the manner in which it had done in the interest of the appellant and its other creditors.\nUnder these circumstances the appellant has applied to me for leave to appeal to this court from the judgment of the courts below. This appeal cannot be taken; under section 106 of the \"Winding-Up Act\" (R.S.C. ch. 144), unless the amount involved exceeds $2,000.00, and unless leave be obtained from a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada.\nHere the amount involved is sufficient to give jurisdiction to this court. The sufficiency of the amount is not however conclusive of the right of the appellant to appeal to this court. He must obtain leave, and the discretion to grant or refuse this leave must be exercised judicially, that is to say, for sufficient reason in the judgment of the judge to whom the application for leave to appeal is made.\nThe question as to the sufficiency of the reasons for granting leave to appeal is not now a new one, and certain rules have been laid down which I feel I should follow.\nThus in Lake Erie and Detroit River Ry. Co. v. Marsh[1], where special leave to appeal was applied for under sec. 48, sub-section e, of the \"Supreme Court Act\"\u2014and I conceive that the same rule should be followed in cases arising under section 106 of the \"Winding-Up Act\"\u2014Mr. Justice Nesbitt stated that:\nWhere the case involves matter of public interest, or some important question of law, or the application of Imperial or domestic statutes, or a conflict of Provincial or Dominion authority, or questions of law applicable to the whole Dominion, leave may well be granted.\nWhile the learned judge disclaimed the intention of laying down any rule which would not be subject to future qualification, I think his statement of the reasons why the discretion to grant leave should be exercised furnishes a convenient test for the guidance of the court or of its judges in a matter like this. And I would also think that where the only importance of a case is on account of the amount at issue, and where, however important the matter may be for the parties to the litigation, the only question to be determined is the construction and effect of a private contract, leave to appeal to this court from the unanimous judgment of two courts should not be granted.\nMoreover, In re The Ontario Sugar Company (McKinnon's Case)[2], Mr. Justice Anglin refused leave to appeal, under section 106 of the \"Winding-Up Act,\" on the ground that the proposed appeal raised no question of public importance, and that the affirmance or reversal by this court of the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appear would not settle any important question of law or dispose of any matter of public interest.\nThis is emphatically the case here. The proposed appeal would deal exclusively with the question whether there has been a breach on the part of the company of the obligation it assumed under clause 7 of its agreement with the appellant, entitling the latter to claim the penalty of $50,000.00, and the affirmance or reversal of the judgment of the Quebec Court of King's Bench would not settle any important question of law or dispose of any matter of public interest.\nI can therefore see no reason why I should exercise the discretion given me by section 106 of the ''Winding-Up Act\" and grant leave to appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench. The motion of the appellant is dismissed with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\n[1] 35 Can. S.C.R. 197.\n[2] 44 Can. S.C.R.659.\n"}

Christie (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1919: October 14, 15; 1919: October 20.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA.\nJudgment\u2014Setting aside\u2014Common error of parties.\nIn a former action between the appellant and the respondents, the trial judge pronounced an oral judgment finding in favour of the appellant upon certain contested items and in favour of the respondents upon certain other contested items and fixed the rate per foot upon which the sum for which judgment was to be finally given in favour of the appellant was to be calculated; and a reference to the registrar was directed to work out this judgment and express the result in figures. The solicitors then agreed to substitute a report by architects for this reference. It had been expressly stated that it was the respondent's intention to appeal from the judgment. The order, drawn up by agreement and initialled by the solicitors for both parties, apparently deprived the respondents of that right. Subsequently, the respondents appealed but the appeal was dismissed on the ground that it was a judgment by consent. The respondents then took a direct action to set aside the judgment.\nHeld, that there had been common error in the expression of the intentions of the parties and the judgment was properly set aside. Wilding v.Sanderson, [1897] 2 Ch. 534, followed.\nPer Davies C.J. and Duff, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\u2014The appellant, having succeeded in his contention that the judgment was drawn in a form which made it unappealable, cannot now be allowed to say, as against the respondents, that this was not in law the construction of the order.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1919] 3 W.W.R. 740), affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Morrison, J.,[2], and maintaining the respondents', plaintiffs', action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. and Sir Charles Tupper K.C. for the appellant.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. for the respondent was not called upon.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Duff.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The judgment in the original action by appellant against respondents, on the main issue therein, clearly was pronounced by the learned trial judge against the will of the respondents.\nAnd their avowed intention to appeal therefrom appears in the answer by their solicitors, to the suggestion of appellant's solicitors, that they should mutually try to avoid the expense of a reference to determine the amount of the allowances to be made the respondents, within the terms of the opinion judgment given by the learned trial judge. That renders it difficult for me to understand how appellant could in good faith take the objection made to hearing an appeal from the formal judgment issued as the result of the adjustments reached to avert a reference.\nThe appellant's solicitors expressly recognized in their reply to said answer the right and intention to appeal.\nThe adjustment of the matters to be the subject of a reference was all that either party contemplated giving assent to. The initialling of the consents was evidently only intended to shew an adjustment had been made of the said matters and need for a reference.\nAs I read the memo thus initialled it was all done on the \"basis of the judgment\" pronounced by the learned trial judge. And as I understand the facts appellant's counsel unfairly refused to let the Court of Appeal get seized of these facts when the motion for appeal was heard, and thus have the ambiguous document illuminated by what the letters clearly shew the parties intended.\nHence there was a failure of that court to recognize the right of appeal and I imagine a failure of justice.\nAs the learned trial judge herein well expressed his view of the situation thus created:\u2014\nIt would be a reproach upon our juridical system if it were impossible to put the parties to this action in a position whereby the judgment of the trial judge could be worked out ultimately according to its true intent and meaning.\nI, therefore, entirely agree with the judgment appealed from.\nIt may be that if called upon to consider the judgment in appeal against said judgment I should not agree with the result arrived at.\nThe mere question of practice or procedure relative to the proper method of rectifying what seems to be a grave wrong, is one that according to the settled jurisprudence of this court we must not interfere with unless a result has been reached that violates natural justice.\nThe bringing of an action instead of proceeding by way of motion may have resulted in greater expense to be borne by appellant.\nOf this the appellant has no right to complain for its course of conduct in refusing to accede to the request for a stay of proceedings, when the appeal was being heard, in order to enable the respondents to move and rectify the form of judgment which raised the doubt and difficulty, is the cause of resorting to a more costly mode of procedure.\nI think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014There is no dispute as to the agreement between Mr. McMullen and Mr. Bull respecting the judgment which was to be entered in the action. The trial judge at the conclusion of the trial had pronounced an oral judgment in which he found in favour of the bank upon certain contested items and in favour of Skene and Christie upon certain other contested items for which credit was claimed in the defence and fixed the rate per foot upon which the sum for which judgment was to be finally given in favour of the bank was to be calculated; and a reference to the registrar was directed to work out this judgment and express the result in figures. After some correspondence the solicitors agreed that the two architects who had been examined as witnesses for the respective parties before the trial judge should be requested to make the necessary measurements and calculations and to report to the solicitors, it being understood that, if they reached an agreement, the result of the investigation in figures should be adopted and that they should be incorporated in the judgment as if they had been arrived at by the learned trial judge himself. It was not only understood but expressly stated that it was Mr. McMullen's intention to appeal from the adjudication of the learned trial judge, that is to say, from the principle of the judgment. The findings, of course, in so far as they rested upon the report of the architects or upon the calculations of the solicitors themselves were the necessary result of the adjudications of the trial judge and must stand or fall with these adjudications.\nI cannot accept the contention that on these points there was not a concluded agreement. The correspondence read together with a document which finally became the judgment but which was not a judgment until it had been approved of by the trial judge affords a complete demonstration not only of the general terms but of the particulars of the agreement between the solicitors. Moreover, there is no dispute upon it. Mr. Bull's evidence is explicit and the effect of the documents and the oral evidence is that both Mr. McMullen and Mr. Bull believed that both of them were giving their assent to certain findings which, taken with the adjudications of the trial judge, should together constitute a judgment; a judgment which, save as regards these agreed findings, was the judgment of the trial judge based upon his own decision. The truth is that as regards these consent findings the solicitors intended that they should be in precisely the same position as findings upon admissions made in the course of the trial.\nThe trial judge, in giving judgment, I repeat, was acting in the ordinary course of jurisdiction, not at all extra muros; indeed there was nothing irregular in what was done and a judgment beyond all question could have been drawn in a form which would have excluded any possible suggestion that the judgment itself was a consent judgment or that on any ground the adjudications of the trial judge were not to be open to the appeal to which everybody intended that they should be subject.\nI express no opinion upon the point whether or not the form of the judgment presented is strictly an obstacle in the way of an appeal. The counsel for the bank took the objection that the judgment was drawn in a form which made it unappealable. I am not sure that I quite understand the precise nature of the objection but I gather from the evidence of Mr. McMullen that the view taken by the majority of the Court of Appeal on the occasion was that one paragraph in the judgment shewed that the adjudication was an adjudication by consent, not an adjudication resting upon judicial decision; and that consequently the parties were, as no doubt they would be if such were the case, precluded from impeaching the adjudication by way of appeal. I repeat, that I express no opinion as to this view, but counsel for the bank having contended for this construction and having succeeded in his contention and having got the appeal dismissed as a result of his successful contention, the bank cannot now be allowed to say as against the respondents, that this was not in law the construction of the order. I refer to a well known passage in a judgment of Bowen L.J. in Gandy v. Gandy[3] :\u2014\nI am not certain that this is not res judicata within the view which has been taken of res judicata, when the same questions arise again between the same parties litigating similar subject matter. But whether it is res judicata or not, it seems to me that there would be monstrous injustice if the husband, having suggested one construction of the deed in the old suit and succeeded on that footing, were allowed to turn around and win the new suit upon a diametrically opposite construction of the same deed. It would be playing fast and loose with justice if the court allowed that.\nAdmittedly this construction of the judgment is one which defeats the intentions of the solicitors whose agreement the judgment was intended to give effect to. There is, as Chitty L.J. said[4], common error in the expression of the intentions of the parties and therefore the instrument must be rectified or set aside. I think Wilding v. Sanderson[5], governs this case.\nIt is, I think, nothing to the purpose to say that this is strictly not a judgment by consent. The paragraph in the judgment which gave rise to the difficulty was a paragraph which was intended to express the agreement of the parties and indeed, the judgment may, for the purposes of this appeal, be read as two judgments; (Belcher v. McDonald[6]; the judgment formally expressing what was orally pronounced by the trial judge and the judgment by consent expressing the result of the findings and the calculations which the parties had agreed to. It was in attempting to express the result of these findings and calculations, in other words, in attempting to give effect to that part of the judgment which rested on consent, that the solicitors unfortunately used language which was afterwards thought to give a character to the whole judgment which nobody ever intended it should bear.\nNor should effect be given to the suggestion that the proper course for the present respondent was to apply for an amendment of the judgment by the trial judge. For myself, I entertain no doubt that the trial judge would have been quite within the ambit of his competency in making the amendment because the trial judge never intended to approve a judgment which nobody ever intended that he should approve, a judgment which should make him say that his adjudications rested upon the consent of the parties and not upon his own decision except in respect of the calculations mentioned. While that is so, it is quite clear that counsel for the bank took this position before the Court of Appeal and succeeded in maintaining it\u2014that the trial judge was functus officio; and on that ground induced the Court of Appeal to reject the application made by appellant's counsel for an adjournment. It is not now open to the appellant bank in view of this course of conduct to argue that the present action is unnecessary.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.:\u2014As between the parties to this action I think it must be taken to be res judicata that the judgment in the former action was non-appealable. If so, on the merits this case is clearly governed by Wilding v. Sanderson[7]. On matters of procedure, such as the appellant complains of, it is the usual practice of this court not to disturb the judgments of the provincial courts.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBRODEUR J.:\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Duff.\nMIGNAULT J.:\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Duff.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Tupper & Bull.\nSolicitor for the respondents: J.

Rep. 360), affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1], affirming the judgment for the plaintiff at the trial.\nThe defendant, to secure a debt due by one Holmes to the plaintiff, wrote his name across the back of a promissory note made by Holmes in favour of the plaintiff who afterwards wrote his name under that of defendant. The note was protested and an action brought against defendant as an indorser. The courts below held him liable.\nFinlay Macdonald K.C. for the appellant. The plaintiff is not a holder in due course as the same is defined by section 56 of the \"Bills of Exchange Act.\" Steele v. McKinlay[2]; Jenkins & Sons v. Coomber[3]; Shaw v. Holland[4]; Robertson v. Davis[5].\nIn Robinson v. Mann[6], the respondent's liability on the note was not the issue. Neil R. McArthur for the respondent relied on Robinson v. Mann[7] and also cited McDonough v. Cook[8]; Davis v.Bly[9].\nFinlay Macdonald K.C. for the appellant.\nNeil R. McArthur for the respondent\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of opinion that the unanimous decision of this Court in the case of Robinson v. Mann7, that under section 56 of the \"Bills of Exchange Act,\" 1890, a person who indorses a promissory note not indorsed by the payee may be liable as an indorsee to the latter, is conclusive in this appeal.\nI myself was a party to that judgment. It has remained now for many years unquestioned and been accepted throughout Canada as law. I see no reason for raising any doubt now upon its correctness.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014It seems to me that the question raised in the appeal herein is decisively concluded by the decision in Robinson v. Mann7, and therefore that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014This appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nI concur in the unanimous judgment of the court below that it is governed by the decision of this court in Robinson v. Mann7.\nAnglin J.\u2014The appellant, intending to become a surety for the maker to the payee, wrote his name across the back of a promissory note. On precisely similar facts this court in Robinson v. Mann7, held the defendant liable as an indorser by virtue of section 56 of the \"Bills of Exchange Act\" of 1890\u2014 now section 131 of R.S.C. 1906, ch. 119, made applicable to promissory notes by section 186. That decision has been uniformly accepted as the law of Canada in the provincial courts and by text writers of repute. The respondent makes the following references:\u2014\nSlater v. Laboree[10]; McDonough v. Cook[11]; Knechtel Furniture Co. v. Ideal House Furnishers[12]; Johnson v. McRae[13], Falconbridge on Banking (2nd ed.) 701; Maclaren on Bills and Notes (2nd ed.) 334.\nI had occasion shortly after becoming a member of this court to examine with some care how far the doctrine conveniently designated stare decisis should be held to govern it. Stuart v. Bank of Montreal[14], at p. 536. I have had ho reason to change the views there expressed. Holding them, this case is for me concluded against the appellant by Robinson v. Mann. I may add that personally I agree with the interpretation there placed on section 56 of the \"Bills of Exchange Act\" of 1890.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This case is concluded by the decision of this court in Robinson v. Mann[15].\nBy section 131 of the \"Bills of Exchange Act,\" it is provided that when a person signs a bill otherwise than as a drawer or acceptor, he thereby incurs the liabilities of an indorser to a holder in due course and is subject to all the provisions of the Act respecting indorsers.\nThis section contains an important addition to the corresponding section of the Imperial Act and it would not be advisable then to follow the British decisions. In the case of Ayr American Plough Co. v. Wallace[16], decided in 1892 on a promissory note made before the above addition, Sir Henry Strong stated that if the case were under the new law the defendant would have been held liable. This dictum was followed in the Province of Quebec where the doctrine had always existed. (Pothier, Trait\u00e9 du change, no. 132, art. 2311 C.C.) and also in some other provinces.\n1892 Balcolm v. Phinney[17].\n1894 Watson v. Harvey[18].\n1895 Fraserv. McLeod[19].\n1897 Pegg v. Howlett[20].\nThe question, as I said before, was finally settled by this court in 1901 in the case of Robinson v. Mann[21], where it was held that the Molsons Bank were holders in due course of a note made payable to their order and which the defendant had indorsed above them and that his indorsement was a form of liability which the \"Bills of Exchange Act\" had adopted.\nI do not see any reason why this decision which has been followed should be changed.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014The point to be decided in this case is a very simple one.\nThe appellant signed his name across the back of a promissory note whereby one Holmes promised to pay to the respondent $500.00 twelve months after date with interest at 8% per annum as well after as before maturity. He claims to have thus signed the note as security for Holmes. He now contends that he is not liable as an indorser of the note.\nSection 131 of the \"Bills of Exchange Act\" (R.S.C., ch. 119), which applies to both bills of exchange and promissory notes, states that\nNo person is liable as drawer, indorser or acceptor of a bill who has not signed it as such; provided that when a person signs a bill otherwise than as a drawer or acceptor he thereby incurs the liability of an indorser to a holder in due course and is subject to all the provisions of this Act respecting indorsers.\nIn Robinson v. Mann[22], a similar case, it was said by this court, under the authority of section 56 of the \"Bills of Exchange Act,\" 1890, now section 131, that a person who indorses a promissory note not indorsed by the payee may be liable as an indorser to the latter.\nThe fact that the payee, Scott, when he placed the note in the hands of the Royal Bank for collection, also indorsed the note, and he did so under the signature of the appellant, does not take the case out of the operation of section 131, and I cannot follow the argument of the appellant when he says that the respondent was not a holder in due course, for he clearly was one as the word is defined by section 56. Robinson v. Mann22, is conclusive authority that the payee can hold as an indorser a person who signs the bill or note otherwise than as a drawer or acceptor.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Finlay Macdonald.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Neil R.

The trial judge found that the fall was due to the slippery condition of the sidewalk and that the municipality had neglected to keep it in repair. His judgment for the plaintiff was affirmed by an equal division of opinion in the full court.\nFinlay Macdonald K.C. for the appellant. The municipality is not liable for non-feasance. Municipality of Pictou v. Geldert[2]; and see City of Vancouver v. McPhalen[3]. As to the duty of the city in regard to the sidewalk see Palmer v. City of Toronto[4]. See also German v. City of Ottawa[5].\nRogers K.C. and J. McG. Stewart for the respondent. Municipality of Pictou v. Geldert[6], was decided on the ground that no express duty to repair was imposed on the muncipality by the legislature.\nThis case is governed by City of Vancouver v. McPhalen[7].\nFinlay Macdonald K.C. for the appellant.\nRogers K.C. and J. McG. Stewart for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014Accepting as I do the findings of fact of the trial judge, confirmed as they are by the full court in Nova Scotia, and giving proper weight to the frank admissions of the learned counsel for the city appellant on the argument at bar, I find myself, after giving the facts and admissions much consideration, unable to hold the city not to be liable for the injuries sustained by the plaintiff.\nThe city's statutory duty to keep the street in repair on which the accident to the plaintiff happened was certainly not discharged by the simple giving of a notice to the \"frontager\" to remove the frozen slush and ice. That notice given in pursuance of its by-law was one of the means adopted by the city of having its statutory duty with respect to the streets discharged. Whether neglect on the part of the frontager after such notice to remove the dangerous snow and frozen slush would render him liable to an injured party is quite another question not now before us. But it is clear that the giving of such a notice would not in itself be a discharge of the city's statutory obligation and duty.\nThe injuries sustained by the plaintiff from the dangerous condition of the sidewalk were, therefore, in my opinion, attributable to the defendant's negligence in not causing the frozen slush to be sanded or otherwise made reasonably safe for pedestrian traffic.\nIn Ontario the legislature has deemed it necessary for the due protection of cities and municipalities to provide that for injuries which may be sustained by pedestrians and others by reason of ice and snow on their sidewalks they shall only be liable for \"gross negligence.\" But there is no such provision in the legislation of Nova Scotia.\nThat provision or limitation upon the city's liability may account for some of the decisions in cases which at first sight may seem at variance with the conclusion I have reached as to the city's liability in this case.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nIdington' J.\u2014The liability of the appellant rests upon section 249 of the Act incorporating it as a city, which reads as follows:\u2014\nThe City Council shall keep in repair all such streets as prior to the passing of this Act have been dedicated to and accepted by the Town of Sydney by resolution of its council, and all streets laid out under any law of the Province and no other.\nThere might be a doubt arise, from the peculiar wording of the limitations therein, as to whether or not this street in question fell within the definition of the streets in regard to which the duty to keep in repair was imposed; but for the clear admission in the statement of defence relative to paragraphs one, two, and three of the statement of claim.\nThe said third paragraph alleged that\nThe streets of the City of Sydney are vested in the defendant, City of Sydney, and the said City is required to keep them in repair. The facts found by the learned trial judge amply justify the conclusion he reached.\nIt is now well settled jurisprudence relative to the measure of responsibility imposed upon municipalities by legislation providing for their repair of highways that on such facts as he finds the municipality is liable.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur in the view that section 249 of the Sydney \"Corporation Act\" gives a right of action to persons who suffer harm in consequence of default in performance of the duty thereby imposed on the municipality to repair certain streets. I think the contention fails that George Street is not one of those streets in respect of which this duty arises. Accepting the construction suggested by Mr. Justice Mellish and urged upon us by counsel for the municipality that the sections confer upon the city council the power of determining by resolution what streets shall be kept in repair and that the statutory duty exists only in relation to such streets\u2014I think there was sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case that responsibility for repairing George Street had been accepted by the municipality. City of Victoria v. Patterson[8].\nIt has repeatedly been decided that natural accumulations of show and ice on a highway may amount to disrepair within the meaning of statutes requiring municipalities to keep highways in repair; and counsel for the appellant did not deny that these decisions may legitimately be appealed to as a guide for the construction and application of the statute now before us. There can, I think, be little doubt that the accumulation of ice and snow which occasioned the respondent's injury constituted a serious danger to pedestrians, though proceeding with ordinary care, a condition which amounts to disrepair within the contemplation of the statute.\nIt is desirable, I think, to add a word of comment upon an argument based upon the supposed necessity of notice to the municipality of the dangerous condition of the street as one of the conditions of liability. The statutory duty is to keep in repair. That does not, of course, involve absolute responsibility for disrepair. Such provisions, it has been many times held, do not create liability for the consequences of a state of things which has not arisen through the failure of the municipal authority to observe reasonable precautions to prevent it. Jamieson v. Edmonton [9], Hammond v. Vestry of St. Pancras[10]; Bateman v. Poplar District Board of Works[11].\nBut where the disrepair complained of consists in a condition such as that in question here in a frequented street a condition, not to put it moderately, outside the purview of reasonable anticipation in a Nova Scotia winter, then the municipality can only escape responsibility by shewing that the measures taken came up to the standard of reasonableness and this may include a proper system of inspection.\nI concur in the opinion of the majority of the court below that the municipality failed to discharge its duty.\nAnglin J.:\u2014I would dismiss this appeal. I agree with Chisholm, Russell and Ritchie JJ. that the City of Sydney is civilly liable to a person injured through non-repair of streets in respect of which the city charter (s. 249) imposes the obligation to repair where such non-repair is due to inattention to the duty so imposed sufficient to constitute negligence. I accept Mr. Justice Russell's view that\nthe law imposing upon the city the duty of keeping the streets from falling into disrepair in consequence of snow and ice must be reasonably interpreted and applied.\nWith him also\nI am unable to say that it has not been so applied by the learned trial judge in this case.\nThe facts in evidence establish a condition amounting to disrepair likely to be productive of danger known to the city authorities at all events on the day before the plaintiff met with his accident. It was the duty of the city officials to see to it that that state of affairs was remedied and they had abundant opportunity to do so. The finding of negligence is supported by the evidence. It follows that there was a breach of statutory duty resulting in an injury to the plaintiff which entailed civil liability on the part of the city.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The only question in this case is whether the appellant municipal corporation has been negligent.\nThe snow had been permitted to accumulate on the sidewalk at the place where the respondent fell, and the slush which the mild weather had formed was converted into ice as a result of the night frost. The sidewalk became dangerous for pedestrians. The City of Sydney is bound by the law to keep in repair all its streets. That would involve the duty to take reasonable precautions against the streets becoming dangerous by reason of the ice and snow. I would distinguish this case from Pictou v. Geldert[12], and Sydney v. Bourke[13], because no duty to repair was imposed by the statute then under consideration.\nIt is not contended at bar that the duty to repair would not cover the removal of the ice and snow on the sidewalk, or the sanding of the sidewalk. As a question of fact, the sidewalk had been sanded some time before; and by a by-law of the city the snow should be removed by the riparian owners.\nThe question is whether the municipality has discharged its duty in a reasonable manner. That becomes then a question of fact and the concurrent findings of the courts below in that respect should not be disturbed.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014On the findings of fact of the learned trial judge that the accident was caused by the slippery condition of the sidewalk; that the appellant was aware of the condition of the sidewalk and allowed the snow to remain there for some time, when, to the knowledge of the city officials, a lowering of the temperature was very likely to take place and the slush to be frozen over night; that the street in question was one of the principal streets of the city, travelled over by thousands of people by day, or at all events on Sunday; that its condition on the day of the accident could have been prevented, the city having the means to clear the sidewalk and having failed to employ these means; and on the admission of the learned counsel for the appellant that to leave ice on the sidewalk for an unreasonable time would be a lack of repair, an admission which I think he rightfully made\u2014I am of the opinion that the judgment of the learned trial judge should not be disturbed.\nThe statute obliged the city council to repair the streets and it failed to fulfil this obligation and under the circumstances it is liable for the accident.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Finlay Macdonald.\nSolicitor for the respondent: A.

Rees (Plaintiffs) Respondents\n1919: May 8, 9; 1919: October 14.\nPresent:\u2014Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA.\nTrade unions\u2014Inducing dismissal of non-unionists by threatening strike\u2014Right to damages\u2014Liability of individual members\u2014Practice and procedure\u2014Unincorporated body\u2014Representative action. The respondents, being miners and members of the Local Union appellant, were employed by the Rose-Deer Mining Company. The manager of the company, becoming dissatisfied with the actions of the Union, closed the mine down with the object, successful for a time, of destroying the weight of the Union; but he opened it again, and the respondents returned to work, agreeing to the condition not to pay any Union dues. The respondent Williams then received an anonymous letter calling him a \"scab.\" The manager of the company having taken the ultimate decision to live at peace with the Union for the security of his own interests, a new Local Union was organized, but both respondents refused twice the invitation to become members until the matter of the letter was \"cleared up.\" Later on, the manager of the mining company advised the respondents that they would be discharged unless they settled with the Union as he had received notification that the Union would declare a strike if they continued to work. This notification was given by the appellants Young and Stefanucci. The respondents then applied for membership in the Union, but were refused, though the Union withdrew the objection formally taken' to them as co-workmen in the mine. The respondents, having been subsequently discharged took an action against the individual appellants on the ground of conspiracy to injure them by inducing their dismissal and against the Local Union for unlawful intimidation by the threat of a general strike. The Local Union was not incorporated, nor registered under the \"Trades Union Act\"; and an application was made at the close of the trial to amend the statement of claim by making the individual appellants defendants in their representative capacity, but this was not granted.\nHeld that, upon the evidence, the respondent's action should be dismissed, except as to the appellants Young and Stefanucci; Idington and Mignault JJ. dissenting; Duff J. would have dismissed the action in toto. Per Duff J.\u2014The conduct of the appellant Young cannot be construed as intimidation or coercion by \"threat\" and did not expose him to an action in damages in the absence of the characteristic elements of a criminal conspiracy to injure. Quinn v. Leatham (1901) A.C. 495, discussed.\nPer Duff J.\u2014The object of \"The Industrial Disputes Act\" is to interpose investigation and negotiation with a view to conciliation between the institution of a dispute and the culmination of it in a strike or lockout; but there is nothing illegal (notwithstanding the legislation) in an employer or his workmen deciding to pay no attention to outside advice or decision but to insist upon their or his terms and to enforce them by all legal means and nothing illegal in making this known to the other party to the dispute.\nPer Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\u2014In the absence of legal evidence that they were present at the meetings where the acts complained of were authorized or that they had otherwise sanctioned them, mere membership in the Local Union would not render the individual appellants personally answerable in damages for the results of these acts.\nPer Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\u2014The dismissal of the respondents was the direct and intended outcome of the action of the Local Union's committee, such action amounting to a coercive threat and being therefore an unlawful means taken to interfere with the respondents' engagement, the liability of the Local Union appellant if suable is established, and the delivery of the message of the committee by the appellants Young and Stefanucci to the manager of the mining company, having regard to all the circumstances, makes them personally liable towards the respondents.\nPer Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\u2014The issue of want of legal entity was sufficiently raised by the explicit denial of the allegation that the Local Union was a body corporate.\nPer Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\u2014No action lies against an unincorporated and unregistered body in an action of tort such as the present one.\nPer Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\u2014The rule of practice by which, when numerous persons have a common interest in the subject matter of an action, one or more of such persons may be sued on behalf of all persons interested, which rule was invoked in support of the application for an order for representation, cannot properly be applied in an action of tort such as the present one without evidence that the individual appellants could fairly be said to be proper representatives. Idington J. contra.\nPer Idington and Mignault JJ. dissenting\u2014The Local Union having throughout the litigation acted as if rightly sued, it is too late now to urge the objection of want of legal entity; and per Mignault J., the judgment of the trial judge should not be interfered with on a matter of procedure. APPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming, the court being equally divided, the judgment of the trial judge, Simmons J.[2], and maintaining the respondents', plaintiffs', action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nA. M. Sinclair K.C. and H. Ostlund for the appellants.\nE. V. Robertson for the respondents.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal is taken jointly by all the defendants, condemned by the formal judgment of the learned trial judge, and maintained on appeal therefrom, by an equal division in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court for Alberta.\nThe respondents' statement of claim presents several causes of action and prays for relief in more ways than one.\nThe first of these causes of action as stated, and in respect of which relief was sought, seemed to raise the question of a legal right of each of the respective respondents to become a member of the said Union but nothing has been determined in regard thereto, or raised by this appeal, save indirectly.\nThe second cause of action is framed as if against half a dozen members of the said Union for conspiracy with each other and other persons to wrongfully, unlawfully and maliciously injure the plaintiffs, now respondents, by depriving them and each of them of their employment and to induce the dismissal of each from the employment of the Rose-Deer Mining Company, Limited, a mining company in Alberta.\nIt is further charged that pursuant to such conspiracy and combination they, by intimidation of the company and threatening to go on strike and tie up the mine, succeeded without lawful reason or excuse in having respondents dismissed and deprived of employment.\nThere is ample evidence to support these claims against some, at least, of these parties. Hence they should not succeed herein.\nSeeing that the money has been paid into court to meet the judgment for damages without regard to any distinction between or amongst these several appellant parties and hence if the judgment appealed against stands against a single one of the defendants the judgment will be satisfied, it seems to me the rest of the appeal becomes somewhat academic.\nIn deference to the views of others whereby elaborate argument was heard, notwithstanding the admission of the payment thus made, I have examined the various questions presented.\nIn view of the following several considerations: that the misleading use by the appellant of a seal which presumably would be supposed to indicate a corporate capacity in the Union, and of the fact that no steps were taken to remove such impression, save by a formal denial in the pleadings; that the proceedings for discovery, and examinations for discovery, and indeed the whole trial were each allowed to proceed as if the Union was at least registered and thereby liable to be sued as a corporation, and that the parties defendant all joined in one defence, and no motion at any time to set aside such clearly erroneous proceedings if, as now contended, the Union was not a legal entity, I think the learned trial judge should at once, when asked by counsel for the plaintiffs (now respondents), have allowed the amendment of the pleadings to make them conformable to the case presented by the evidence adduced without objection. Then he should, if the defendants (now appellants) so desired, have given them an opportunity to answer the case so made. I presume as no objection made to amendment, or claim to adduce further evidence, appellants must have concluded nothing further in way of evidence for defence thereto was available.\nNotwithstanding the case of Walker v. Sur[3], relied upon by appellant, I think the action of a representative character will still lie against an unincorporated union, for wrongs such as complained of. That case is easily distinguishable from the numerous other authorities relied upon by the respondents herein.\nI agree with the view of Lord Macnaghten in the Taff Vale Ry. Co. v. Amalgamated Soc. Ry. Servants[4], at page 438, where he says:\u2014\nI have no doubt whatever that a trade union, whether registered or unregistered, may be sued in a representative action if the persons selected as defendants be persons who, from their position, may be taken fairly to represent the body,\nand also with what Lord Lindley says in the same case on the same Subject.\nAnd I may add that the obvious reason for the qualification of the representative persons chosen is to avoid the possibility of the Union being bound by a collusive action, or by one not properly defended by all the force it might officially choose to bring in its own defence if made a party.\nThe Union itself having taken part in the defence and being beyond doubt the party actively defending, cannot now be heard to set up such a mere technical objection occasioned by a slip in the pleading. Surely at this time of day when we, sometimes at least, try to get at and grasp the realities instead of the mere formalities, such an objection comes too late.\nThe party that says it is not a legal entity has had the courage to proceed as if it were, whilst saying it was not.\nIt strikingly illustrates in doing so the course pursued in the circumstances, out of which this action arises, by its refusing on the one hand to admit the respondents as members, though well qualified to become such, and in no way disqualified except by reasons founded on the evidence of highly probable motives on the part of those possessed of obvious hate and malice, being permitted to direct such a course of conduct, and on the other at one and the same time, offering to let them work whilst creating an atmosphere that rendered the doing so an impossibility. I hope our law, begotten of freedom and justice, has not grown so feeble as to tolerate such injustice.\nIt is clear to my mind on the facts presented that such inconsistencies of conduct are attributable only to that malice in law by which the accused representatives of the Union are claimed to have been actuated.\nBeing moved thereby they cannot claim they were simply defending their honest legal rights in what they did.\nAnd if the majority of the members of a union permit even a few of the master spirits to so illegally and improperly dominate the action of their union then in law the union must suffer the consequences.\nAdded to this the intimidation of a strike which was threatened, regardless of the law as enacted in \"The Industrial Disputes Act,\" sec. 56, was evidently illegal. The sooner that the mere offence of threatening to disregard such a law or any other is understood, the better for all concerned.\nI think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The view of the facts which I accept is that which is very fully and lucidly explained in the judgment of Stuart J.[5].\nThree or four events are of capital importance. The lockout by Tupper in Jan., 1917, with the object, successful for a time, of destroying the weight of the Union; the ultimate decision of Tupper to live at peace with the Union for the security of his own interests and the consequent re-establishment of relations between them; the invitation given twice to the plaintiffs to become members of the Union and their refusal to do so; the application (the first) by the plaintiffs on Dec. 21st, and the answer of Jan. 6th, refusing to accept them as members but withdrawing the objection formally taken to them as co-workmen in the mine.\nIn order to prevent misconception, I ought to state, without passing any opinion upon the extent of the jurisdiction conferred by Rule 20 of the Alberta Rules (I need hardly say that I should hesitate before differing from the united opinion of Lord Macnaghten, Lord Lindley and Lord Dunedin) that this is not in my judgment, a proper case for amendment; and moreover, that in disposing of the appeal we are bound to give effect to the contention that the union is not a suable entity. I should also state explicitly that I concur with the conclusion of Mr. Justice Stuart that there is no evidence against Stefannuci, Gerew, Marcelli, Lorenzo and Kamuckle. The case as presented in the Supreme Court was a case of conspiracy, it was tried as a case of conspiracy and as such it must succeed or fail.\nLooking at the course of events broadly and especially noting those just mentioned, the evidence of actionable conspiracy seems to be too slight to support an affirmative finding.\nFor the principle to be applied it is my habit in these cases to resort to the charge of the trial judge in Quinn v. Leathem (Fitzgibbon L.J.)[6]:\u2014\nI told the jury that they had to consider whether the intent and actions of the defendants went beyond the limits which would not be actionable, namely, securing or advancing their own interests or those of their trade by reasonable means, including lawful combination, or whether their acts, as proved, were intended and calculated to injure the plaintiff in his trade through a combination and with a common purpose to prevent the free action of his customers and servants in dealing with him, and with the effect of actually injuring him, as distinguished from the acts legitimately done to secure or advance their own interests.\n* * * * *\nTo constitute such a wrongful act for the purpose of this case, I told the jury that they must be satisfied that there had been a conspiracy, a common intention and a combination on the part of the defendants to injure the plaintiff in his business, and that acts must be proved to have been done by which the defendants in furtherance of that intention which had inflicted actual money loss upon the plaintiff in his trade.\nThis statement of the law received the approval of the Lords of Appeal.\nSubject to special legislation contained in the \"Industrial Disputes Act,\" as to which I shall have something to say presently, the union men were quite entitled to refuse as a body to work with non-union men and to advise their employer of their policy. Tupper appears to have been quite aware of the attitude of the union men and quite willing to take any course necessary to meet their views.\nThe whole weight of the case lies in the difficulties which are said to have been made regarding the reception of the plaintiffs as members of the Union. But the plaintiffs appear to have made no application until the end of December, the result being that the objection to them as miners was withdrawn.\nThe plaintiffs appear to have been reluctant to regularize themselves and I can see no ground for a finding that an earlier application would not have had the same effect as that of Dec. 21st.\nI am quite unable to concur in a finding of intimidation or coercion. As already mentioned, Tupper had decided upon his course long before the incidents in question arose and I am convinced that Tupper's only concern was to know with certainty the attitude of the men. His course in consequence of that knowledge cannot fairly be attributed to anything which could properly be described as the imposition of their will upon his but should be ascribed to his deliberate choice of the policy of accepting the Union terms for the sake of peace and in his own interests.\nThe situation being quite well understood on both sides, I do not perceive the aptness of the description \"threat\" as applied to the communications made to Tupper.\nThe truth seems to be that the impulse behind those communications came from the men as a body and that the emissaries who interviewed Tupper were really the agents of the men and that in these communications they were faithfully imparting to Tupper (as he desired them to do) the facts as regards the terms on which the men could be induced to work. No authority so far as I am aware warrants the suggestion that such conduct exposes either the members of the Union as such, or the Union officials as such, to an action in the absence of the characteristic ele- ments of the class of cases to which Quinn v. Leathem[7], belongs, cases of criminal conspiracy to injure. Lord Lindley goes further perhaps than any other legal authority of his eminence has gone in countenancing the doctrine that threats when they result in coercion\u2014threats, that is to say, of \"serious annoyance and damage\" as distinguished from threats to do something itself punishable by law (as threats of bodily harm\u2014are in themselves prim\u00e2 facie \"wrongs inflicted upon the persons coerced;\" but it is evident from his judgement7, at pages 507 and 508, that Lord Lindley would not have considered what occurred here to be within the category of \"coercion by threats.\"\nAs to the special legislation (\"The Industrial Disputes Act\") the object of the statute is to interpose investigation and negotiation with a view to conciliation between the institution of a dispute and the culmination of it in a strike or lockout. But there is nothing illegal (notwithstanding the legislation) in an employer or his workmen deciding to pay no attention to outside advice or decision but to insist upon their or his terms and to enforce them by all legal means and nothing illegal in making this known to the other party to the dispute.\nI am not satisfied that what was said necessarily meant that the men intended to act illegally. If the point had been taken at an earlier stage the facts would no doubt have been more closely investigated.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The history of the events out of which this litigation arose and the material facts are fully stated in the judgments of the learned trial judge [8], and of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[9]. The plaintiffs hold a judgment against all the defendants for $100 for general damages and for $435.62 for loss of wages.\nLocal Union No. 1562, U.M.W., an unincorporated and unregistered Trades Union, was sued as a corporation and the six other defendants as individuals and not in any representative capacity. There appears to be some uncertainity whether the trial judge intended that judgment should be entered against the Local Union. It would seem to have been his opinion that the assets of that body could be reached \"only by suing the individual members\"\u2014presumably all of them or certain members properly selected as representatives of all treated as a class. But an amendment asked for by the plaintiffs at the close of the trial whereby the six individual defendants should be constituted representatives of all the members of the Local Union and authorized to defend as such, while not refused, does not appear to have been allowed and the formal judgment was entered against the Union as well as against the individual defendants personally. The appeal taken from that judgment to the Appellate Division stands dismissed by the order of that court, which consisted of four members. Two of them (Stuart and Hyndman JJ.) would have allowed the appeal, holding that no actionable wrong had been established. The learned Chief Justice of Alberta was of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs. Mr. Justice Beck,\nin view of the difference of opinion amongst the members of the Court,\nconcurs in the disposition of the appeal made by the Chief Justice: but, if giving effect to his own view, he would have required the plaintiffs to elect to\ntake judgment (1) against the individual defendants in their individual capacity, or (2) against the individual defendants as representing the Union, or (3) against the Union by name.\nThe grounds of appeal to this court are:\u2014\n(1) That no actionable wrong has been proved against any of the defendants; and (2) that the Local Union, as an unincorporated and unregistered Trades Union, cannot be sued.\nTo deal with the appeal satisfactorily it is necessary to appreciate the cause or causes of action as formulated in the statement of claim. Against the Local Union there are two distinct grounds of complaint: (1) that the plaintiffs were twice wrongfully refused membership in it contrary to the terms of its constitution and bylaws; and (2) that by wrongfully and maliciously objecting to their being employed by the Rose-Deer Mining Company, Limited, and intimidating that company by threatening a general strike the Local Union induced it to dismiss the plaintiffs from its employment. Against the six individual defendants the cause of action set up is wrongfully and unlawfully and maliciously conspiring and combining to deprive the plaintiffs of employment and to induce their dismissal by the Rose-Deer Company and in pursuance thereof intimidating that company by threats etc., resulting in the plaintiffs' discharge etc.\nIt will be convenient to deal first with the case of the individual defendants. The learned trial judge, as I read his judgment, makes no finding of conspiracy or combination. In this he may possibly have been well advised.\nMr. Justice Stuart says:\u2014\nWith respect to the matter of conspiracy or combination, there does not, in fact, appear to be any evidence at all against the defendants Stefanucci, Gerew, Marcelli, Lorenzo and Kamuckle that they took part in any way whatever in the matter. Whether they were present when any concerted arrangement or combination was made or not, or had anything to do with it in a meeting or otherwise, is not suggested anywhere in the evidence. I cannot assent to the contention that every member of the Union is individually liable for whatever the other members may have done quite apart from him, and with no evidence at all of his connection or participation therein, unless, of course, the Union were (what it is not) in itself an unlawful association with unlawful objects, in which case it might be otherwise.\nExcept probably as to the defendant Stefanucci, who accompanied the defendant Young and one Rose (not made a party) on a mission to communicate the attitude of the Local Union to Tupper, the manager of the Rose-Deer Company, this statement of the effect of the evidence appears to be accurate. Redpath's evidence on discovery, as an officer of the Local Union, that Gerew and Kamuckle attended a meeting at which the plaintiffs' applications for membership were rejected is not admissible against them in their individual capacity. There appears to be no evidence that Marcelli attended any meeting and nothing except the silence of the statement of defence to shew that Lorenzo was even a member of the Local Union.\nAs to Stefanucci and Young, apart from any question of conspiracy and combination, as delegates of the Local Union they personally conveyed the message of that body to Tupper. If the delivery of that message, haying regard to all the circumstances, amounted to a coercive threat designed to bring about the dismissal of the plaintiffs and had that result, there is in my opinion no room to doubt the individual liability of these two defendants. That they acted as agents for the Union, or, to speak more accurately, of its members, of course affords them no answer in this action for tort.\nNor do I think they should be heard to set up that the only case alleged against them is one of conspiracy. As to them there is probably sufficient evidence to sustain a judgment on that ground also. But, at the trial, they made common cause with the Local Union, and the substantial defence of both was a justification of all that had been done by the Union and on its behalf. Moreover, they are charged with having actually intimidated the plaintiffs' employer by threats and thus procured their discharge. The allegation that this was done in pursuance of a conspiracy, if not proven, may be treated as surplusage. I would incline to hold them liable on both grounds\u2014but, at all events, on that of participation in the actual commission of the wrong done the plaintiffs.\nThe learned trial judge rests his judgment against the other four individual defendants solely on their responsibility as members of the Union for the authorized acts of its duly constituted agents. What he says as to the liability of these defendants is contained in the following passage from his judgment:\u2014\nThe officers of the Local Union were the agents for the individual members and the principal is bound by the authorized acts of the agent acting within the scope of his authority.\nThe individual members of the association or Local Union were each liable for what was done by their agents.\nThe defendants do not deny membership in the Local Union during the period when the boycott took place. Two of them, Young and Stefanucci, took an active part as officers of the Union.\nWith great respect, in the absence of some evidence, admissible against them, that they were at least present at the meetings when the acts complained of were authorized or approved of, or that they otherwise sanctioned them, I think a case has not been made against these defendants. Mere membership in the Union would not, in my opinion, render them personally and individually answerable in damages for the results of those acts. There is no evidence of any participation by them in the commission of the actual wrong done the plaintiffs.\nThe evidence, however, convinces me that, acting through authorized agents, the Local Union as a body brought about the dismissal of the plaintiffs by threatening a general strike should they be retained in the company's employment and I think it is a fair inference from the proven facts, that while subsequently professing willingness to allow them to be re-employed by the company, the Local Union in fact made their reemployment impracticable and that it fully intended to bring about that result. I am, with great respect, unable to appreciate how the complacency of the manager of the Rose-Deer Company, induced by various considerations which Mr. Justice Stuart emphasizes, affects the matter. It merely served to render easier the accomplishment of the Local Union's design. Nor do I perceive the force of the distinction which that learned judge draws between the responsibility of the Union as a body for the threat of a strike and that of its members as employees of the Rose-Deer Company. The threat was made by the Union through its delegates on behalf of all its members who were the company's employees. It was the act of the Union (so far as such a body can be said to act) done by its instructions and for its purposes.\nI think it is also a fair inference from all the circumstances in evidence that a desire to prevent the plaintiffs continuing in the employment of the Rose-Deer Company and to punish them for remaining non-union men after the re-establishment of Local Union 1562, in 1916, and their refusal to join it when it was first suggested to them to do so actuated its conduct in seeking their dismissal rather than any genuine wish to promote the interests of trades-union- ism generally or its own immediate welfare. Otherwise I find it very difficult to understand the Local Union's refusal to accept the plaintiffs as members even when urged to do so by the officers of the Union of District No. 18, to which it is in some degree subordinate.\nOn this view of the evidence the liability of the Local Union, if it be susceptible of being held responsible and be suable as a body, or the liability of all its members who participated in or sanctioned the steps taken to secure the dismissal of the plaintiffs, if the application made by the plaintiffs' counsel at the trial to amend by making the individual defendants defendants also in a representative capacity on behalf of its members should be granted, is, in my opinion, established. Injury to the plaintiffs has been proved. That injury was the direct and intended outcome of action of the Local Union's committee taken by its direction for that purpose. That action amounted to a coercive threat and was therefore an unlawful means taken to interfere with the plaintiffs' employment, the use of which, damage having ensued, constituted in itself an actionable wrong. The authorities bearing on this aspect of the case at bar have been so fully and carefully reviewed in the able judgment recently delivered by McCardie J. in Pratt v. British Medical Association[10], that further reference to them seems unnecessary. See especially pages 256-7, 260, 265-8, and 277-8.\nPerhaps it may not be amiss, however, to mention as very closely in point Lord Justice Romer's judgment in Giblan v. National Amalgamated Labourers' Union[11], and Lord Lindley's speech in Quinn v. Leathem[12]. The Local Union's vindictive motive excludes any possible defence of \"justification\" or \"just cause\" in the present case, if, indeed, where unlawful means have been resorted to that defence would be open however innocent or even laudable the purpose may have been. This aspect of the case is fully discussed by McCardie J. in the Pratt Case[13], at pages 265 et seq. See too the South Wales Miners' Federation v. Glamorgan Coal Co.[14].\nI have reached the foregoing conclusions of fact without taking into consideration, except as against himself, the discovery evidence given by Albert Young, which, I agree with Mr. Justice Stuart, would be inadmissible against the Local Union, even if it had been properly sued either as a corporation or quasi-corporation or is estopped by its conduct from denying that it was so sued, or as against the other defendants either individually or in any representative capacity. Young was examined for discovery solely as an individual defendant and not in any sense as an officer selected to make discovery on behalf of the Union or its members. His evidence so given is not within the provisions of Alberta Supreme Court Rule 250. If the Local Union, though not a corporation, had been rightly made a defendant the evidence of Redpath would be a admissible as against it, and, having regard to the provision of Rule 3 of the Alberta Supreme Court that\nas to all matters not provided for in these rules the practice, as far as may be, shall be regulated by analogy thereto,\nI incline to think it would also be admissible against the individual defendants if sued as representatives of all the members of the Union.\nThere remain for consideration the questions whether the Local Union was properly made a defendant in the first instance or is estopped from denying that it was so; and, if both these questions should be answered in the negative, whether the plaintiffs' application to amend should be granted.\nI have no doubt that the Local Union, as an unincorporated and unregistered body, was not properly made a defendant and that service on it must have been set aside had application been made for that relief. Metallic Roofing Co. v. Local Union No. 30[15].\nWhile I should have thought it better, had the defence in addition to the bare denial of incorporation contained a plea that the Local Union is not registered, is not a partnership, and, as an entity not known to the law, cannot be sued by its adopted name (R.93), I incline to think this issue was sufficiently raised by the explicit traverse of the allegation that the Local Union is a body corporate. But, if not, the objection to suing the Local Union being its non-existence as an entity known to the law, I confess my inability to understand how any conduct of those representing that body, such as that here relied on, can create an estoppel which would justify the granting of a judgment against it. A judgment should not wittingly be entered against a non-entity.\nIn Krug Furniture Co. v. Berlin Union of Woodworkers[16], relied upon by the Chief Justice of Alberta and Mr. Justice Beck, the defendant Union, sued as a corporation, appeared, apparently as such, unconditionally and its statement of defence did not contain the plea nul tiel corporation as required by the Rules of Court. Its incorporation was accordingly presumed. The explicit denial of incorporation in the present instance precludes any such presumption. In my opinion the judgment against the Local Union in its adopted name cannot be maintained. The question of representation presents more difficulty. The selection for that purpose of the six individual defendants before the court was not happy. Four of them are admittedly persons of no importance in the Local Union and cannot fairly or properly be said to represent it. The remaining two were Young and Stefanucci. Young was an ex-secretary and both he and Stefanucci had \"represented\" the Union in discussions with the Rose-Deer management on several occasions and also had had interviews with the plaintiffs on its behalf. These are the only grounds on which it can be claimed that they would be proper representative defendants. Neither of them appears to have been an officer of the Union at the time the action was begun. Whatever funds or other property the Local Union may possess, there is nothing to shew in whose name or names such funds or other property stand; and if, as is probable, these are held by trustees, the trustees are not before the court; nor is it sought to add them as defendants. Yet the avowed purpose of suing the Local Union is to reach its funds. If the case were otherwise one in which an order might be made for representation of the members of the Local Union by properly selected defendants, I strongly incline to the view that in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion the six individual defendants now before the Court, whom it is asked to approve for that purpose and to authorize to defend the action on behalf of the membership, should be held not to be proper representatives. (See observations of Lord Macnaghten in the Taff Vale Case[17]), and that on that ground, strengthened as it is by the fact that it was sought only at the close of the trial, the suggested amendment should be refused. Moreover, notwithstanding what was said obiter in Duke of Bedford v. Ellis[18], (a case of representative plaintiffs), in Taff Vale Rly. Co. v. Amalgamated Society of Rly. Servants[19], (where a Union was successfully-sued in its registered name) and in Cotter v. Osborne[20], and Cumberland Coal & R. W. Co. v. McDougal[21], to which I refer in order to make it clear that they have not been overlooked, I am with respect, of the opinion that in two recent cases, Walker v. Sur[22], and Mercantile Marine Service Association v. Toms[23], the English Court of Appeal has made it clear that the rule of practice invoked in support of the application for an order for representation cannot properly be applied in such an action as this. Rule 20 of the Alberta Rules is an adoption, substantially in ipsis-simis verbis, of English Order XVI., r. 9. All the objections to the applicability of that rule indicated by the Lords Justices in the Walker Case(5)22, exist here, notably those mentioned by Kennedy L.J. on page 937. As is pointed out by Swinfen Eady L.J. in the Toms Case(6)23, many members of Local Union 1562 might have defences not open to the proposed representative defendants, and there are many other reasons against applying the rule in cases of tort such as this. Lord Parker of Waddington, whose authority in regard to the scope and purview of an equity rule such as O. XVI., r. 9, is of the highest, in his speech in London Association for Protection of Trade v. Greenlands Limited[24], points out some of the serious difficulties which must be encountered in seeking to apply it to such a case as this. Fully as I realize the desirability of finding some method whereby bodies such as Local Union 1562 may be made answerable in the courts for wrongs similar to that done to the plaintiffs, the two authorities to which I have referred seem to me to afford sound reasons for the conclusion that that desirable end cannot be attained by an application of Rule 20. Nor does the other rule invoked, No. 31(2), corresponding to English Order XVI., r. 32 (b), appear to advance the plaintiffs' case. Any attempt to apply it here is open to the same objections which preclude an application of Rule 20. The caution with which Rule 31(2) should be applied is shewn by the course taken by Buckley J. in Morgan's Brewery Co. v. Crosskill[25]. Moreover, not a little may be said in favour of restricting the meaning of the word \"class\" in that rule by reason of its collocation with \"heirs or next of kin.\" I cannot think it was ever intended to provide by it for such a case as that at bar.\nIn view of the fact that Rule 20 is a reproduction of English Order XVI., r. 9, I am unable to accept the ingenious suggestion of Mr. Justice Beck that because law and equity have always been concurrently administered by the same court in the Province of Alberta, Rule 20 may be extended to a case held not to fall within its prototype in England. I should add that I have not overlooked Lord Atkinson's comprehensive observation in London Association, etc. v. Greenlands, Limited[26], Neither the Walker Case[27], nor the Toms Case[28], however, appears to have been cited at their Lordships' bar.\nIn the result I am of the opinion that the action fails and must be dismissed except as against the defendants Young and Stefanucci, as to whom the appeal should be dismissed. BRODEUR J.\u2014I concur with my brother Anglin. The appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed, except as to the defendants Young and Stefanucci. There should be no costs here or in the Court of Appeal.\nMIGNAULT J. (dissenting).\u2014After carefully reading the evidence and considering the authorities, I can see no sufficient reason for disturbing the judgment of the learned trial judge as to which the learned judges of the Appellate Division were equally divided. The defence of the defendants that the acts done by them with reference to the plaintiffs were\ndone solely with intent to further the legitimate objects of the organization known as the United Mine Workers of America and not with the intent to injure the plaintiffs or either of them,\nis not, in my opinion, made out. On the contrary, the defendants twice refused to admit the plaintiffs into their Union, and then notified the mine operator that they declined to work with them, so that the mine operator, who was told that he could choose between operating his mine with the two plaintiffs alone or with the members of the Union without the plaintiffs, considered it good business to choose the latter alternative and to refuse to employ the plaintiffs. It is unnecessary, under the circumstances of this case, to decide whether the conduct of the defendants would have been actionable had they allowed the plaintiffs to join their Union and refused to work with them if they did not join. But here the door was closed on the plaintiffs when they claimed admission to the Union and under the circumstances the refusal of the defendants to work with them\u2014and no sufficient reason is shewn for refusing to admit them in the Union or to work with them\u2014was in my opinion a wrongful act and a deliberate and successful attempt to obtain their dismissal from the mine. I feel some doubt whether the Local Union No. 1562, not being an incorporated body or a registered labour union, could be sued as has been done in this case. But throughout this litigation the local Union has acted as if it had been validly sued, has joined with the other defendants in contesting the action by one and the same plea and has also united with the other defendants in appealing by one appeal from the judgments of the trial court and the Appellate Division, I consider therefore that it should not now be heard to urge the objection that it could not be sued. Further, this is a matter of procedure on which I would not interfere with the judgment of the trial court.\nAppeal allowed in part.\n[1] 14 Alta.

Dunphy (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1919: October 15; 1919: October 20.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA.\nNegligence\u2014Contributory\u2014Collision\u2014Automobile and street car\u2014Jury's findings\u2014Sufficiency.\nThe action is for damages for injuries suffered in a collision between an automobile driven by the respondent, and appellant's street car. At the trial one witness for the respondent, who was in the automobile, testified to having warned the respondent before the accident; and the respondent was not called to explain his failure to act upon this warning. The jury, after having found the appellant guilty of negligence, specified such negligence in the following terms: \"Insufficient precaution on account of approaching crossing and conditions existing on morning in question.\"\nHeld, that the jury's findings, if read with and construed in the light of the issues presented by the pleadings, the evidence and the charge of the trial judge, were justified both as to appellant's negligence and as to absence of respondent's contributory negligence and were not too vague to support a judgment for respondent.\nPer Duff J.\u2014The practice in jury cases in British Columbia is that the jurors are not bound to believe the evidence of any witness; and they are not bound to believe the whole of the evidence of any witness; they may believe that part of a witness' evidence which makes for the party who calls him, and disbelieve that part of his evidence which makes against the party who calls him, unless there is an express or tacit admission that the whole of his account is to be taken as accurate. Dublin, Wicklow, and Wexford Ry. Co. v. Slattery (3 App. Cas. 1155), followed.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ((1919), 48 D.L.R. 38, [1919] 3 W.W.R. 201), affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] affirming the judgment of the trial court with a jury and maintaining the respondent's, plaintiff's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head\u2014note and in the judgments now reported.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. for the appellant.\nMayers for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I confess that at the close of the argument on this appeal I felt inclined to allow it on the grounds submitted by Mr. Tilley, first, that the evidence of Cross, one of the witnesses for the respondent and who was in the respondent's motor car at the time the collision with the street railway happened, shewed clearly that he, Cross, had seen the electric car approaching and had warned the respondent Dunphy who was driving the motor car about thirty or forty feet away from the track: \"Look out, look out the car.\" (No evidence was given challenging or qualifying Cross's evidence as to his having given the warning or to the effect that it had not been heard by Dunphy), and secondly, that the jury had failed to find in answer to the question put to them as to what the negligence of the defendant company consisted of\u2014 anything definite or certain\u2014and that their finding was altogether too vague and uncertain to uphold the verdict entered against the defendant.\nHowever, after reading the evidence over and the judge's charge to the jury, which was very clear, and considering that in appreciating the weight to be given to Cross's evidence the jury had the advantage of having had a \"view\" of the locality where the collision occurred and of seeing and deciding as to the extent the alleged growing trees between the motor and the car would have prevented Clarke seeing from the motor the approaching electric car, I am, but with some doubt, of the opinion that we would not be justified in allowing the appeal and either dismissing the action or granting a new trial.\nRead in connection with the judge's charge to them, the jury's findings as to the defendant's negligence may be held to be definite enough and the evidence of Cross with respect to the warning shouted by him when he says he saw the electric car approaching would be much better understood and appreciated by the jurymen who had a view of the locality than it can possibly be by the judges of this court on the printed evidence and the conflicting contentions of counsel upon that evidence.\nNot being convinced, therefore, that the judgment appealed from is clearly wrong, I will not dissent from the judgment dismissing the appeal.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I find the answers of the jury quite intelligible when read in light of the evidence and the learned trial judge's charge to the jury.\nThe question of contributory negligence was one for the jury and their answer leaves no reason to rest the appeal thereon.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014Mr. Tilley bases his appeal upon two grounds: First, he argues that the admissions made by a witness called on behalf of the plaintiff, and indeed admissions brought out by the plaintiff's counsel in examination-in-chief, conclusively establish the defence of contributory negligence.\nThe passages relied upon are as follows:\u2014\nQ. When did you realize that the street car on the interurban was upon you, or was there? When did you first realize that it was coming? A. Well, I glanced up to the track, when we were about, I suppose, 30 or 40 feet away from the B.C. Electric tracks. I am not saying this definitely, but approximately, I glanced up to the track towards the east, and I saw the street car coming, and I shouted then to Mr. Dunphy: \"Look out, look out, the car.\"\nQ. And you saw the car coming? A. And I saw the car coming, yes.\nQ. It would have been then about how far away? A. About three car lengths I should think. I could see the top of the car and not the bottom of it. It was the trolley pole I saw first.\nQ. Well, how long after you shouted was it that you were struck by the other car? A. Well, it was so quick I could not say. It was not more than a second or a couple of seconds.\nQ. From the time you shouted to Dunphy until the time you were struck? A. Yes.\nThe evidence as it stands affords no doubt very powerful support to the contention of the defendants that the plaintiff, if his attention had been reasonably alert to the situation as he was coming up to the railway track, must have had sufficient notice of the approach of the car in time to avoid a collision, and coupled with the observations of Mr. Taylor on the following page and with the fact that the plaintiff was not called to explain the failure to act upon Cross's attempt to warn him, it must, I think, be held to have established for all the purposes of the trial, the fact that Cross did shout to the plaintiff as he says he did. The discussion of the law to be found in the books on the effect of a statement made by a witness damaging to the party who calls him, is not entirely satisfactory. The Common Law Procedure Act of 1854, sec. 22, which is the parent of the corresponding statute in British Columbia, provides that a party may\nin case the witness produced by him shall, in the opinion of the judge prove adverse, contradict him by other evidence,\nseeming, as Mr. Justice Stephens (Digest Note XLVII.) points out, to imply that the right to contradict his own witness in such circumstances rests upon the condition that the trial judge shall consider and hold the witness to be adverse. This, however, Mr. Justice Stephens remarks \"is not and never was law\": Greenough v. Eccles[2]. And the generally accepted rule appears to be that it is always open to a party to adduce evidence inconsistent with statements made by one of his witnesses, which, of course, is a very different thing from discrediting him by general evidence as to character.\nThere is a passage, however, in the judgment of Lord Sumner then Hamilton J. in Sumner v. Brown[3], which seems to enunciate a somewhat stricter rule:\u2014\nUpon the question of the plaintiff Leivesley's evidence, Mr. Keogh had called him with his eyes open and with full knowledge of what he was likely to say, and that it was not competent for the defendants to contradict him on the vital point of contract or no contract. It was not as if unexpected evidence had been given or there had been some contradiction in details. When two equally credible witnesses called by the same side flatly contradicted each other, it was not competent for the persons calling them to pick and choose between them. They could not discredit one and accredit the other. That, in his opinion, although no decision might have been reported, had been the practice for some time.\nHamilton J. was, of course, speaking not only as a judge who had the responsibility of giving directions as to the law to be applied but as the tribunal of fact as well, and it may be doubted whether he meant to lay down a rule absolutely controlling the discretion of a jury.\nThe practice at all events in British Columbia in jury cases has followed the rule enunciated by Lord Blackburn in Dublin, Wicklow, and Wexford Ry. Co. v. Slattery[4], as follows:\u2014\nThe jurors are not bound to believe the evidence of any witness; and they are not bound to believe the whole of the evidence of any witness. They may believe that part of a witness' evidence which makes for the party who calls him, and disbelieve that part of his evidence which makes against the party who calls him, unless there is an express or tacit admission that the whole of his account is to be taken as accurate;\nand the view expressed by Sir James F. Stephens.\nCross's evidence, however, as to locality and point of time\u2014where and when the incident which he relates occurred\u2014is vague and of course naturally so; what he says about the position of the motor car with reference to the track at the time he shouted is couched in language quite consistent with the conclusion that, although he was quite certain that the motor car was quite close to the track and that the collision followed very quickly, he had nevertheless no very precise notion of the exact position of the car.\nI think effect must be given to Mr. Mayers' contention that the evidence of the plaintiff and Hammond describing the occurrences accompanying the accident and the succession of events as the motor car approached the track, was evidence which it is impossible to say it was the duty of a jury to disregard and from that point of view I am unable to assent to the conclusion that the defence of contributory negligence was established with such certainty as to necessitate setting aside the verdict.\nThe onus of proving contributory negligence in the first instance lies on the defendant and it would be the duty of the jury to find the issue in favour of the plaintiff unless satisfied that the defence had been affirmatively proved.\nMr. Tilley's second contention was that the findings were insufficient to support the judgment. I concur with the opinion of the learned trial judge, Macdonald J. that the verdict presents no difficulty. It is quite true that the jury did not respond to an invitation by the learned trial judge to particularize the charges of negligence which they found to be proved. But as the learned trial judge observed in pronouncing judgment upon the motion for judgment, when the answer to the second question is read with the charge, it becomes perfectly intelligible.\nI may add that the answers to these questions read together are equivalent to an affirmation that the plaintiff's injuries were due to the negligence of the defendant company and that the plaintiff is entitled to recover as damages the amount mentioned. Read together the answers constitute a perfectly good finding for the plaintiff for that sum. There can be no practical difficulty in giving effect to this as a general verdict because the instructions in the charge were quite sufficient to enable the jury intelligently to return a general verdict.\nHad the answers been objected to as insufficient at the time they were given, the trial judge, no doubt, could have presented to the jury the alternative of specifying their findings of negligence more particularly, or returning a general verdict in the usual form. No such exception having been taken, it is not, I think, open to the defendants to take exception to the form\u2014albeit an unusual form\u2014in which the jury have expressed their findings.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The defendant appeals on two grounds from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia dismissing its appeal from the judgment for the plaintiff entered by Macdonald J. on the findings of the jury. It contends that the evidence of the witness Cross called by the plaintiff established con- tributory negligence on his part and that upon it the judge should have withdrawn the case from the jury. Accepting Cross's statement that he shouted a warning to the plaintiff, it is not clear that he did so in time to enable the plaintiff to avoid the collision; nor is it quite certain that the plaintiff heard the warning. Passages in the plaintiff's evidence as well as in that of Hammond rather indicate that he did not. The question of contributory negligence was in my opinion by no means concluded against the plaintiff by Cross's testimony and was therefore properly submitted to the jury and their verdict negativing it cannot be impeached.\nThe second point made by Mr. Tilley is that the jury, having found the defendant guilty of negligence which caused the accident, failed, in answer to the second question\u2014\"If so, in what did such negligence consist?\"\u2014to specify the negligence. They said\u2014 \"Insufficient precaution on account of approaching crossing and conditions on morning in question.\" As Mr. Mayers very properly pointed out the words \"in approaching crossing\" make it clear that it was negligence on the part of the motorman which the jury had in mind. Only two faults on his part were charged\u2014failure to sound the air-whistle and excessive speed\u2014both of them matters of more than usual importance in view of the \"conditions on the morning in question,\" by which the jury, no doubt, meant the failure of the automatic warning signals at the crossing known to the motorman. The learned trial judge in his charge distinctly warned the jury that they must confine themselves to the negligence charged and should not import matter \"in the nature of a suggestion * * * that some other precaution could have been taken.\" We may not assume that the jury ignored this direction and unless we do so it would seem reasonably certain that the motorman's failure to sound his air-whistle and to moderate the speed of his car was the \"insufficient precaution\" which, in the jury's opinion, constituted the \" negligence which was the cause of the accident.\" Meticulous criticisms of a jury's findings are not admissible and they must always be read with and construed in the light of the issues presented by the pleadings, the evidence and the charge of the trial judge. While it might have been more satisfactory had the second finding been more specific, if dealt with in the manner I have indicated it seems to be sufficiently certain what the jury meant by it.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014This is a street railway accident, and a jury trial found the appellant company guilty of negligence. There is some evidence given by the plaintiff's own witness which would shew that the victim had been guilty of contributory negligence. But the evidence of that witness is somewhat conflicting and the jury were properly charged as to its consideration. It was for the jury to determine in those circumstances whether there was contributory negligence or not; and their finding in that regard is not such that we would consider it as perverse.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014Mr. Tilley attacked the judgment of the Court of Appeal and the judgment thereby affirmed of Mr. Justice Macdonald giving effect to the verdict of the jury on two grounds:\n1. That the judgment should have been in favour of the defendant, appellant, for the reason that the evidence at the trial disclosed the fact that Dunphy drove into the street car after a warning received from Cross that it was coming and without looking to see where it was.\n2. That after finding that the accident was caused by the negligence of the appellant, the jury entirely failed to state in what such negligence consisted.\nFirst ground. This ground is based on the evidence of Cross who was riding in the motor car with Dunphy and the latter's brother-in-law, Hammond. Cross swore that when they were about thirty or forty feet away from the track\u2014but he adds that he was not saying this definitely but approximately\u2014he saw the street car coming and then shouted to Dunphy: \"Look out, look out, the car.\" Further on Cross states that after shouting it was not more than a second or two before they were struck by the car.\nAlthough Dunphy and Hammond were not asked whether they had heard this shout, they both swear that the first thing they knew was that the car struck them. The latter was running, on approaching the crossing, at a speed of 18 to 20 miles an hour, and at the best from Cross's own story it is impossible to say whether his warning was given in time to be of any avail.\nUnder these circumstances, after the learned trial judge had fairly left to the jury the question of the warning received from Cross, the latter found that the accident was the result of the appellant's negligence, the majority stating that Dunphy was not guilty of contributory negligence. I cannot say that this finding is clearly wrong, and, on this first ground, I would not disturb the verdict.\nSecond ground. This objection is at first sight more serious. The jury, after answering that the appellant was guilty of negligence which caused the accident, were asked in what such negligence consisted. They replied: \"Insufficient precaution on account of approaching crossing and conditions existing on morning in question.\"\nThis answer seems very vague, but taken in connection with the judge's charge, I think it sufficiently assigns the lack of sufficient precautions which in the jury's opinion caused the accident. The learned trial judge fairly placed the matter before the jury and explained the conditions which, according to the evidence, prevailed on that morning at the crossing. He said:\u2014\nThen you have to consider whether the rate of speed which would not have been too great ordinarily, was upon the morning in question too high a rate of speed, and whether this rate of speed is one subject to the surroundings. You have had pictured to you, and probably you have vizualized yourselves the condition of affairs that morning. There seems to be no question that the British Columbia Electric had, as an extra precaution for the safety of those using that highway, installed not only bells that would ring automatically on the approach of a street car, but also a light which would give evidence of the approach of a street car. On this particular morning, to the knowledge, however, of the motorman, those safeguards were not in operation; so that it left a condition of affairs which it may well be argued, and you may conclude, that required a precaution on the part of the motorman different from that he would have required to pursue, say, the day before.\nThen, again, you have the question of the bushes growing up in that locality, and obstructing, more or less, the view of the approaching street car. I instruct you, as far as the question of crossing is concerned, there is no law resting on the railway company to clear its right of way. That is a matter that pertains, and has to do with another branch of the duties placed upon a railway company operating in the country; but it is a fact that you can take into consideration when you determine whether or not, at that point, the motorman, upon the occasion in question, having in view that situation, was acting with due regard to those entitled to use the highway.\nWhen, therefore, the jury found that the appellant had not taken sufficient precautions on account of the approaching crossing and the conditions existing on the morning in question, I think that their answer clearly means that in view of the fact that, to the knowledge of the motorman, the bell and the light at the crossing were not in working order that morning and that the bushes obstructed the view, the motorman had not taken sufficient precautions for the protection of persons entitled to use the highway. I would therefore conclude that Mr. Tilley's attack on this answer is not a reason for setting aside the verdict.\nMy opinion consequently is that the appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McPhillips & Smith.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Taylor, Mayers, Stockton & Smith.\n[1] (1919) 48 D.L.R. 38; [1919] 3 W.W.R. 201.\n[2] 5 C.B.N.S. 786.\n[3]25 Times L.R. 745.\n[4] 3 App. Cas. 1155, at page. 1201.\n"}

Collister And Others (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1919: October 17; 1919; October 21.\nPresent: Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA.\nMines and mining\u2014Certificate of improvements\u2014Application for\u2014Affidavit\u2014Cessation of work\u2014\"Mineral Act,\" R.S.B.C. 1911, c. 157, ss. 49, 52, 56, 57.\nThe respondents, owners of mining claims under the \"Mineral Act,\" complied with all the requirements of section 57 except the filing of the affidavit required by sub-section (g), which they were deterred from doing by the statement of the mining recorder that an adverse action had been begun and notice thereof had been filed with him, and this being so, the respondents were not in a position to swear that they were \"in undisputed possession\" of the claim. The respondents waited for such adverse claimants to proceed with their action and allowed two or three years to elapse without doing further work or making further payment on the claim. Section 49 provides that \"if such work (annual work) shall not be done, * * * the claim shall be deemed vacant and abandoned, any rule or law of equity to the contrary notwith standing.\"\nHeld, that, under the circumstances of this case, the respondents were relieved from the necessity of doing further work on the claims pending the issue of the certificate of improvements and that they were not subject to section 49.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ((1919), 47 D.L.R. 509; [1919] 3 W.W.R. 229), affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Gregory J. and maintaining the respondent's, plaintiff's, action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nMayers for the appellant.\nBass for the respondent.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014Not without some doubts but largely because of such, I am unable to assent to the allowance of this appeal.\nIt seems to me that, on the evidence adduced, the curative sections of the Act relevant to the several questions raised, as to all but one question, which I am about to refer to, meet and answer them effectively.\nThe one question about which I have doubts is whether the learned trial judge was right in holding that because the respondents failed to meet the formal requirements of the \"Mineral Act,\" they forfeited all their rights, and their claims are to be ipso facto deemed vacant and abandoned.\nI agree so far with the learned trial judge that the language of section 49 is so plain and expressive that it requires a very exceptional case (such as this I fancy is) to render it possible to hold otherwise than he does.\nIt seems to me that having regard to a consideration of the purview of the statute, whilst it may be possible rightly to hold as the judgment of the learned trial judge does, that when there has in fact arisen default in a literal compliance with the requirements of the Act, no matter how induced, forfeiture must ensue. Yet the Act should not be so construed, when the omission to comply with its terms has been brought about, (through no fault of the claimant, who has had done everything to entitle him to a grant, save in the mere formal requirements of application therefor, being compiled with, and the acts necessary therefor have been prevented), by the wrongdoing of some malicious person rendering it impossible to make the necessary affidavit in its entirety.\nWhen we find, as herein, that the mere issue of a writ setting up an adverse claim, but never served though made to appear of record in the office of the Mining Recorder, is virtually held to suffice to frustrate an honest claim, I think we must pause and consider, as the Court of Appeal has done, whether the purpose and scope of the Act imperatively requires a declaration of forfeiture instead of any other alternative.\nIndeed, the learned trial judge suggests other alternative courses were open to the respondents, but either of those suggested involved a possible, and probable, loss of time that would work a forfeiture if the section is to be taken in the sense declared or an expenditure never contemplated as part of the policy of the legislature before the claimants' right to a grant was recognized.\nI cannot think the legislature ever in fact desired to produce such grossly unjust and absurd results and they should be averted if a more reasonable construction is open to us.\nI am inclined rather to adopt one or other of the alternative views presented in the opinion judgments delivered in appeal and now called in question, and hence must refuse to allow this appeal.\nIndeed my doubts, to put the matter no higher, preclude my assenting thereto.\nI think there is, for the respective reasons assigned by Mr. Justice Martin, nothing in the other objections taken in support of the appeal herein. In some of such objections which are taken I do not agree with appellants' view of the facts.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\n[Page278]\nDUFF J.\u2014The question of substance presented for determination on this appeal is by no means free from difficulty; but after a full examination of the considerations presented by the appellant I think the better view is that expressed in the judgment of the Chief Justice in the court below. With his reasons I concur.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of the majority of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal as to the construction and effect of section 52 of the \"Mineral Act\" and as to the sufficiency of what was done by the plaintiffs as a compliance with its requirements. But, without further consideration, I am not prepared to accede to Mr. Justice Martin's view as to the scope and effect of section 56, which, if correct, would seem to render section 52 quite superfluous. The presence in the Act of the latter section indicates that the existence of the conditions which render section 56 operative does not per se suspend the obligations imposed by section 48. On the other questions in issue between the parties I accept Mr. Justice Martin's conclusions.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The plaintiffs, respondents, were the recorded owners of the claim in question; and if they have not filed with the Mining Recorder an affidavit shewing the performance of the conditions required by the \"Mineral Act,\" it is due to the fact that an adverse action had been instituted against them by the appellants and that they had to swear in that affidavit that their possession was not disputed.\nThe appellants, however, did not proceed with their action before the courts; but they located mineral claims upon the same land of which the respondents were the recorded owners.\nThe present action has been instituted by the respondents to restrain the defendants, appellants, from interfering with their rights.\nI entirely agree with the view expressed by the learned Chief Justice of the Court below.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The only serious question in this case is whether, in view of section 49 of the \"British Columbia Mineral Act\" (R.S.B.C. 1911, ch. 157), the mineral claims of the respondents must be deemed to have been vacant and abandoned. The learned trial judge considered this section as being conclusive against the respondents and expressed his regret at having to dismiss their action, the more so as in his opinion, and in this opinion Mr. Justice Martin of the Court of Appeal fully concurred, the appellants had simply \"jumped\" the respondents' claims. In the Court of Appeal, however, the objection based on section 49 did not prevail with the majority of the court and the learned trial judge's judgment was reversed.\nThe whole question is as to the effect of the \"Mineral Act.\" And if section 49 does not stand in the way of the respondents, the appeal must be dismissed.\nAfter consideration, I have come to the firm conclusion that section 49 does not deprive the respondents of their claims, for I cannot doubt that they had applied, which they could do verbally, to the Mining Recorder for a certificate of improvements. They were fully entitled to this certificate, having done and recorded work or made payments to the amount of $500.00 on each claim. And when they applied for the certificate of improvements, the Mining Recorder informed them that an adverse claim had been filed and that the filing of that adverse claim stopped all proceedings in the matter of obtaining a certificate of improvements. The respondents had complied with all the requirements of section 57, with the single exception of the affidavit required by sub-section (g) of that section. But inasmuch as that form of affidavit obliged the affiant to swear that he was in undisputed possession of the claim, it was impossible for the respondents to make this statement on account of the filing of the adverse claim and the Mining Recorder told them that they could not make the affidavit.\nUnder these circumstances my opinion is that in view of the making of the application for a certificate of improvements, and while this application was pending, section 52 exempted the respondents from the obligation of doing any more work or paying any more money in connection with their claims. The result is that section 49 does not apply and the respondents' claims are not to be deemed vacant and abandoned.\nHad I any doubt as to this result I would not, in the words of Chief Justice Macdonald, give the appellants, whose conduct places them in a somewhat unenviable position, the benefit of this doubt, but I really can feel no doubt after reading the judgment of the learned Chief Justice and the very complete and convincing opinion of Mr. Justice Martin.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Courtney & Elliott.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Bass & Bullock-Webster.\n[1] (1919), 47 D.L.R. 509; [1919] 3 W.W.R. 229.\n"}

Act,\u201d 1867, empowering the legislature of any province to make laws in relation to \u201cthe incorporation of companies with provincial objects\u201d does not preclude a legislature from creating a company with capacity to accept extra-provincial powers and rights. Bonanza Creek Gold Mining Co. v. The King, [1916] 1 A.C. 566, 26 D.L.R. 273, followed.\nSuch capacity need not be expressly conferred. It is sufficient if the intention of the legislature to confer it can be gathered from the instruments creating the company.\nA Saskatchewan Company may, on obtaining a license under the \u201cExtra-provincial Corporations Act,\u201d (R.S.O. [1914] ch. 179), carry on business in Ontario. It may enforce in the Ontario Courts the performance of a contract entered into with a resident of that province and the action may be maintained though the license was not granted until after it was instituted.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (45 Ont. L.R. 176), reversing that on the trial (43 Ont. L.R. 451), affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment on the trial[2] in favour of the defendant.\nThe questions raised on the appeal were whether or not the respondent company, incorporated under the \u201cCompanies Act\u201d of Saskatchewan for the purpose of buying and selling land, could enforce in the Ontario Courts, an agreement for sale of its land in Saskatchewan to a purchaser in Ontario; and whether or not license to resort to the courts of the latter Province had been validly granted by the authorities there.\nThe trial judge held that the company could not carry on its business outside of Saskatchewan and dismissed the action. His judgment was reversed by the Appellate Division.\nHellmuth K.C. and Kingstone for the appellant. The reasoning of Lord Haldane in the Bonanza Creek Gold Mining Co. v. The King[3], is that a provincial company must have express authority before it can operate beyond the limits of its Province. And see Florence Mining Co. v. Cobalt Lake Mining Co[4].\nTilley K.C. and Payne for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This appeal must, in my opinion, be decided in accordance with the law as laid down by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the Bonanza Case3, as to the powers and capacities of companies incorporated by provincial legislatures.\nI think the head-note of the case correctly defines what their Lordships in that case determined. It is as follows:\u2014\nSection 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d 1867, confines the actual powers and rights which a provincial government can bestow upon a company, either by legislation or through the Executive, to powers and rights exercisable within the province, but does not preclude a province either from keeping alive the then existing power of the Executive to incorporate by charter so as to confer a general capacity analogous to that of a natural person, or to legislate so as to create, by or by virtue of a statute, a corporation with this general capacity. The power of incorporation by charter transferred to the Lieutenant Governor of the Province of Ontario by section 65 of the above mentioned Act has not been abrogated or interfered with by the \u201cOntario Companies Act\u201d R.S.O. 1897, ch. 191.\nThe doctrine of Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co. v. Riche[5], does not apply to a company which derives its existence from the act of the Sovereign and not merely from the regulating statute.\nLord Haldane in delivering the reasoned and considered judgment of their Lordships overrules the judgment of the majority of this court, of which I was one, when the Bonanza Case[6], was before us, as to the meaning of sub-section 11 of section 92 of our Constitutional Act empowering legislatures exclusively to make laws in relation to the\nincorporation of companies with provincial objects.\nOur judgment placed a territorial limitation upon the powers which the provincial legislatures were authorized to confer upon the companies created or incorporated by them, and this limitation was, Lord Haldane says, at page 577, so complete\nthat by or under provincial legislation no company could be incorporated with an existence in law that extended beyond the boundarise of the province.\nWhether His Lordship stated with accuracy the real meaning and effect of the decision of this court I do not stop to discuss. We are concerned alone with the proper construction of the judgment of the Judicial Committee for whom His Lordship was speaking, as to the meaning of this 11th sub-section.\nI think, as I have said, the head-note of the Bonanza judgment correctly epitomizes the gist of that judgment, namely, that while the \u201cpowers and rights\u201d which a provincial legislature can bestow are confined to those exercisable within the province, that does not preclude such legislature from legislating so as to create by statute a corporation with the general capacity to acquire in another province of the Dominion power to operate in that province with respect to the carrying out of its corporate powers granted by the province incorporating the company.\nThe question in this case, in my opinion, under the construction I put upon the Privy Council judgment in the Bonanza Case[7] was confined to two points, first, whether the company had the capacity given to it by the legislature to obtain power ab extra to carry on in another province its authorized business of buying and selling real estate in Saskatchewan, and secondly, whether it had obtained such power from the Province of Ontario, assuming that its contract in question was made there.\nI am, as I have said, of the opinion that its corporate powers \u201cto carry on real estate loan and general brokerage business\u201d in the Province of Saskatchewan, under the Bonanza Case7, decision of the Judicial Committee, conferred on it the capacity to obtain such power from Ontario under what is known as the law of comity.\nOf course, such a statutory corporation as the respondent could not obtain ab extra power to carry on any business not strictly within its corporate powers, but within these powers it had such capacity. My construction of the powers conferred upon the company \u201cof real estate loan and general brokerage business\u201d is that they referred to real estate in the Province of Saskatchewan alone, and not to real estate elsewhere. The lands in question in this case were, of course, situate in the Province of Saskatchewan.\nThe question is then raised whether it did obtain such powers ab extra or not.\nOn that point I cannot think there can be any doubt. The law of Ontario has, as is pointed out by the trial judge, Masten J., always recognized, subject to certain specified restrictions which do not enter into this case, the right of foreign corporations to carry on their authorized business and make contracts within their authorized powers outside of the country in which they are incorporated, so that the contract sued on in this case even if made in Ontario, being admittedly within the express corporate powers of the company to buy and sell real estate in Saskatchewan, was not ultra vires and was capable of being enforced in the Ontario courts.\nThe appellant relied upon the \u201cExtra-Provincial Corporations Act,\u201d R.S.O. ch. 179. The plaintiff admitted it did not have the license required by section 7 of that Act until after it had commenced this action, but it did then obtain the license and the statute expressly provides that the granting of the license put the company\u2019s right of resort to the Ontario Courts in the same position as if it had been granted before the action was instituted.\nIn the result I am of the opinion that whether the contract sued on was made in Saskatchewan as found by the Appellate Division, or in Ontario as contended by the appellant, the right of the plaintiff to maintain an action upon it in Ontario was clear.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant is and has been throughout the period of time involved in the negotiations and bargaining in question herein, and this litigation founded thereon, a resident of Ontario.\nThe respondent is a company incorporated (23rd March, 1912) under and by virtue of the \u201cSaskatchewan Companies Act\u201d \u201cto carry on real estate, loan and general brokerage business.\u201d In the course of carrying on said business the respondent had its head office in Weyburn in Saskatchewan and acquired some lands in the said province. The appellant by an agreement of sale dated the 15th October, 1912, made between the respondent and himself, agreed to purchase from the former certain blocks of said land and to pay the price named, for balance of which this action is brought.\nThe defences set up at the trial failed, except as to one which raised the question that the said contract was ultra vires the respondent company and hence null and void.\nThe learned trial judge maintained this contention and dismissed, for that reason alone, respondent\u2019s action.\nThe first Appellate Division of Ontario reversed this and directed judgment to be entered for respondent for the sum claimed.\nThe agreement in question was drawn up in duplicate at Weyburn in Saskatchewan and forwarded to the appellant in Ontario, who executed both copies and returned them to the respondent, who, then in Weyburn, executed same there. That does not seem to me to constitute anything ultra vires the corporate powers or capacity of the respondent.\nThe said \u201cCompanies Act\u201d of Saskatchewan appears in the Consolidation of 1909, which is enacted by a statute of the legislature, assented to January 26th, 1911, and professes to be an enactment of His Majesty by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan.\nThe first chapter of said Revised Statutes is called \u201cThe Interpretation Act\u201d and by the second clause thereof provides that the following words may be inserted in the preamble of Acts and shall indicate the authority by virtue of which they are passed, that is to say:\u2014\nHis Majesty by and with the consent of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan enacts as follows:\u2014\nFrom this Act I infer as well as from the words in the preamble to the Act respecting the Revised Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1909, which adopts these enacting words\nHis Majesty by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan,\nthat the enactments in the consolidation are to be treated as if they were made in that form.\nThe fifth clause of the \u201cCompanies Act\u201d declares as follows:\u2014\nAny three or more persons associated for any lawful purpose to which the authority of the Legislature extends * * * may by subscribing their names to the memorandum of association and otherwise complying with the requirements of this Act in respect of registration, form an incorporated company with or without limited liability.\nI am unable to understand how a company incorporated, without any limitations upon the powers or capacity of the legal entity thereby created, under and by virtue of an enactment professing to be enacted by His Majesty by and with the advice of the legislature, and expressly intending that the full power of incorporation which a provincial legislature has to incorporate for certain specific objects is being exercised, can be said to have been acting ultra vires of the power thereby conferred, when confining its action within the obvious purposes of its creation; and that no matter where acting unless in violation of the law of the country or province where so acting or other local limitations upon the usual observance of the comity of a foreign state in relation to the recognition of corporations created beyond its jurisdiction. I most respectfully submit that what was said in the Bonanza Creek Case[8], having been intended to be applicable only to an enactment using entirely different language and mode of thought for expressing the purpose of the legislature, and also to a different state of facts from those presented herein, cannot be helpful herein or further than in an expressly identical sort of case.\nI am quite sure that whenever it is in such an enactment the obvious intention of the legislature when indicated as above to exercise to the fullest extent the powers given it by the \u201cBritish North America Act,\u201d the incorporating power it thereby confers upon those obtaining incorporation thereunder all the power and capacity that can be given by virtue of such powers as conferred by section 92, Item No. 11 of said Act.\n\u201cThe Legislature,\u201d which must be taken to mean all that section 92 of the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d implied by the use of that very term which Parliament used when it expressly endowed each province with the incorporating power in question, has in the plainest and most comprehensive language quoted above, expressed such a purpose, and I am not prepared to minimize the slightest degree the full effect thereof.\nWhat Parliament in that regard conferred upon each province in question in the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d has been conferred, by a process needless to trace here in detail, upon the Province of Saskatchewan.\nWhat, in my opinion, that implied in Item II of the \u201cBritish North American Act,\u201d I have heretofore expressed in several cases. I am the more inclined to adhere thereto when I recall that I had reached the same result in the Bonanza Case[9] as did the court above, and I now hear it argued as it was, relying upon the reasons assigned by the said court in that case, by counsel for appellant herein, that the corporate body created in Saskatchewan as this was has no power to sue in another province.\nThough that proposition was ably and logically presented as a corollary of some of the reasons I cannot assent thereto.\nNor do I think the negotiations which took place in Ontario leading up to the execution of the above mentioned instrument under seal in which they would, so far as in any way affecting the relations between the parties, be merged therein, can affect the answer to be given the question raised in one way or another.\nAs to the right to sue in Ontario I assume that a corporation created by the like authority which created respondent may, as any one else may, be debarred from using the courts of a province in violation of a valid statutory prohibition; but anything of that kind which may have existed was removed by the licence issued respondent.\nThere is nothing in the Ontario legislation which affects, or pretends to affect, in any way the legality of the contract.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I shall assume for the purposes of this judgment that the respondent company was carrying on business within the meaning of the Ontario statute, in Ontario, when the contract was made and that the contract, which is the subject of the action, was effected in the course of carrying on that business. On that assumption, the principal question is whether the respondent company possesses capacity recognized by the laws of Ontario to become a party to that contract. The question whether it enjoys such capacity is primarily, of course, a question to be determined by the Ontario law Ontario law on this subject, in so far as it has not been altered by statute, is the common law of England. The common law of England recognizes the legal personality of juristic persons, speaking generally, for the purposes for which they have been endowed with capacity to be the subjects of rights and duties by the authority to which they owe their existence. The concrete point for decision is therefore, under the assumption above mentioned, did the respondent company under the law of Saskatchewan receive capacity to procure recognition in Ontario as a corporation and to acquire the right to enter into the contract it seeks to enforce?\nIt is argued that from the fact that the legislative authority of a Canadian province in relation to the incorporation of companies is an authority limited in respect of territory and subject matter, one of these two results follows: either (it is said) 1st., A corporation (to which the doctrine of ultra vires applies) owing its existence to legislation passed under the authority of No. 11 of section 92 is inherently wanting in capacity in consequence of the limitations laid down in the \u201cBritish North America Act\u201d to acquire recognition abroad for the purpose of pursuing the objects for which it is incorporated, or 2nd., it receives such capacity only when that is given in express words by the instruments defining its constitution.\nTo deal with these propositions in the order in which I have stated them, the legislative authority of a province is, of course, territorially limited\u2014the power conferred by section 92 in relation to the subjects enumerated being a power to make laws for the province; but when a question arises in another jurisdiction touching the recognition of a right acquired under the law of a Canadian province or alleged to have been so acquired, the rules applicable for deciding the question do not in any presently relevant respect differ from those applicable where rights are alleged to arise under a system of law owing its sanctions to a sovereign authority unlimited as regards subject matter and unlimited by any constitutional instrument as regards territory. The very point was discussed by Mr. Justice Willes in his most illuminating judgment at pages 18, 19 and 20[10], delivered on behalf of the Exchequer Chamber in Phillips v. Eyre, and he there says:\u2014\nWe are satisfied * * * * that a confirmed act of the local legislature lawfully constituted, whether in a settled or conquered colony, as to matters within its competence and the limits of its jurisdiction has the operation and force of sovereign legislation, though subject to be controlled by the Imperial parliament.\nAlmost identical language is used (with reference to the particular case of the Canadian Provinces) by Lord Watson in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in The Maritime Bank v. Receiver General of New Brunswick[11], and by Lord Haldane in giving judgment on behalf of their Lordships in In re The Initiative and Referendum Act[12], at page 5. Lord Haldane\u2019s exact words are:\u2014\nSubject to this (the qualification has no bearing on the present discussion) each province was to retain its independence and autonomy, and to be directly under the Crown as its head. Within these limits of area and subject\u2019s, its local Legislature, so long as the Imperial Parliament did not repeal its own Act conferring this status, was to be supreme, and had such powers as the Imperial Parliament possessed in the plenitude of its own freedom before it handed them over to the Dominion and the provinces, in accordance with the scheme of distribution which it enacted in 1867.\nThere seems to be no reason for suggesting that the recognition of corporateness or juristic personality, which is only the capacity to be the subject of rights, should stand on a lower plane than, e.g. rights arising from a judgment (see Dicey, page 469 note and page 23); and speaking generally the law of England recognizes such capacity subject to the restrictions (if any) imposed by the authority from which the capacity is derived. Where corporate capacity is derived from a legislature, having limited authority as regards the creation of corporations, the limits set to the legislative authority must, of course, be considered in determining the scope of such capacity and as I have already said the contention now advanced is that No. 11 of section 92 does confine the authority of a provincial legislature in relation to that subject to the creation of companies having capacity only to carry on business within the limits of the province.\nThe judgment of the Judicial Committee in the Bonanza Company\u2019s Case[13], seems to be decisive of the point in the opposite sense.\nTheir Lordships there enunciate at page 578, an interpretation of No. 11 of section 92 in these words:\u2014\nFor the words of section 92 are, in their Lordships\u2019 opinion, wide enough to enable the Legislature of the province to keep the power alive, if there existed in the Executive at the time of confederation a power to incorporate companies with provincial objects, but with an ambit of vitality wider than that of the geographical limits of the province. Such provincial objects would be of course the only objects in respect of which the province could confer actual rights. Rights outside the province would have to be derived from authorities outside the province.\nAnd at page 583:\u2014\nThe whole matter may be put thus: The limitations of the legislative powers of a province expressed in section 92, and in particular the limitation of the power of legislation to such as relates to the incorporation of companies with provincial objects, confine the character of the actual powers and rights which the provincial government can bestow, either by legislation or through the Executive, to powers and rights exercisable within the province. But actual powers and rights are one thing and capacity to accept extra-provincial powers and rights is quite another.\nAnd again at page 584:\u2014\nAssuming, however, that provincial legislation has purported to authorize a memorandum of association permitting operations outside the province if power for the purpose is obtained ab extra, and that such a memorandum has been registered, the only question is whether the legislation was competent to a province under section 92. If the words of this section are to receive the interpretation placed on them by the majority of the Supreme Court the question will be answered in the negative. But their Lordships are of opinion that this interpretation was too narrow. The words \u201clegislation in relation to the incorporation of companies with provincial objects\u201d do not preclude the province from keeping alive the power of the Executive to incorporate by charter in a fashion which confers a general capacity analogous to that of a natural person. Nor do they appear to preclude the province from legislating so as to create, by or by virtue of statute, a corporation with this general capacity. What the words really do is to preclude the grant to such a corporation, whether by legislation or by executive act according with the distribution of legislative authority, of powers and rights in respect of objects outside the province, while leaving untouched the ability of the corporation, if otherwise adequately called into existence, to accept such powers and rights if granted ab extra. It is, in their Lordships\u2019 opinion, in this narrower sense alone that the restriction to provincial objects is to be interpreted.\nThe language of No. 11 of section 92\u2014\nincorporation of companies for provincial objects.\nhad of course never been supposed by anybody to import any limitation by which companies created under it would be disabled from acquiring status and recognition abroad for the purpose of pursuing the objects for which they were legitimately incorporated. It was never supposed, for example, that a mutual fire insurance company authorized by provincial legislation to carry on business in a single county would, because of this restriction of its business operations, be disabled from enforcing the payment of a premium note in the courts of another jurisdiction against a defaulting member who had left the province.\nThe view which had been taken was that \u201cprovincial objects\u201d had no immediate reference to legal powers and capacities but that the word \u201cobjects\u201d denoted the undertaking of the company in the commercial or economic sense; and that these words \u201cfor provincial objects\u201d expressed a condition requiring that the business or the undertaking of a provincial company must be so restricted as to fall within the description \u201cprovincial\u201d and that in applying this condition, the word \u201cprovincial\u201d must be interpreted in a territorial sense. It followed\u2014on the assumption that No. 11 was to be construed and applied in the spirit of the doctrine of ultra vires\u2014that, such a company being a corporation only for such restricted objects, Ashbury Carriage Co. v. Riche[14], at page 669, per Lord Cairns, and at pages 693 and 694, per Lord Selborne, its capacity to enjoy status and rights outside the province must exist only in respect of such status and such rights as might be necessary to enable it to pursue these objects; although it was by no means involved in this that particular transactions outside the province could not be within the capacity of such a company, as incidental to or consequential upon the pursuit of objects, in substance provincial in a territorial sense.\nThis view of No. 11 of section 92, which was the view adopted by the majority of this court, was rejected by the Judicial Committee in the Bonanza Company\u2019s Case[15], as the extracts already quoted sufficiently shew, and it must be accepted as settled law that the words \u201cfor provincial objects\u201d in No. 11 do not import any restriction upon the \u201cobjects\u201d of a provincial company in the sense above mentioned; and moreover\u2014and on this point the effect of the passages cited seems to be unmistakable\u2014that the words \u201cwith provincial objects\u201d are merely declaratory of the necessary limits upon the operation of provincial legislation on the subject mentioned which in the absence of them would have been the consequence of the legal principle that corporate status and capacity, in like manner as rights, arising under provincial law, cannot, in jurisdictions beyond the boundaries of the province be legally operative ex proprio vigore but only by virtue of recognition, express or implied, accorded by some other political authority or system of law.\nIt is true that in the Bonanza Company\u2019s Case[16], it was held that the company whose capacity was there in question was not a company to which the doctrine of ultra vires applied. But the language of the passages cited is perfectly general and the principle laid down thereby is broad enough to embrace the case of a company to which the doctrine is applicable. Indeed once the point is reached that the scope of the undertaking (in the sense already mentioned) of a company incorporated under the authority of No. 11 of section 92, is not necessarily limited territorially by virtue of any limitation of legislative authority supposed to reside in the phrase \u201cwith provincial objects,\u201d it manifestly results that, as regards statutory corporations affected by the doctrine of ultra vires, the scope of corporate capacity must be determined by reference to the language 1st, of the statute, and then, if the statute be a general one, of the instrument defining the powers of the particular company under consideration. Nor does there appear to be any good reason why in interpreting a provincial statute providing machinery for the incorporation of companies generally, or a special statute incorporating a company and defining its constitution, or a memorandum of association taking effect under the authority of a general statute, general words defining the constitution of a particular company and prescribing the scope of its activities, or general words defining corporate capacity, should be read as subject to some stringent canon of construction supposed to have its logical and legal foundation in the fact that the statute is a provincial statute, or that the instrument derives its legal effect from the authority of a provincial statute.\nWith great respect for the learned trial judge, who seems to have taken the opposite view, I know of no legal principle\u2014and here we come to the second branch of the argument I am considering\u2014and no consideration of convenience, derived from business practice, requiring the court to read the language of such a statute or instrument defining the scope of the company\u2019s activities as prim\u00e2 facie confining those activities within the province, or to read the language defining the capacity and powers of the, company as prim\u00e2 facie denuding the company of capacity to acquire rights and status abroad; or as prima facie limiting the application of the rule that whatever may fairly be regarded as incidental to or consequential upon things authorized, ought not, unless a contrary intention appear, to be held by judicial construction to be ultra vires. Attorney General v. Great Eastern Ry. Co.[17]\nComing to the concrete case before us I cannot agree with the view that there is anything in the Saskatchewan Statute to support the inference that companies incorporated under it are to be limited in their business activities to the territory of the province; and I cannot agree that the unqualified language of the memorandum of the respondent company can be read as subject to some qualification arising from the fact that the company is incorporated in Saskatchewan and has its head office there. Further, had the memorandum, in otherwise unqualified words, authorized dealings in Saskatchewan lands only, I should not have deduced from the two circumstances mentioned alone, a presumption confining within the province the operations of the company either in making contracts of purchase or in making contracts of sale, or indeed in establishing agencies for sale. I do not think there is any solid basis for such a presumption.\nIn this view the Ontario statute (R.S.O. 1914, ch. 179, secs. 7 and 16) admittedly presents no difficulty.\nThe provisions of section 16 shew plainly enough that the policy of this licensing enactment is primarily in its object and effect a revenue enactment; and sub-section 2 of the last mentioned section explicitly provides that a license granted during the progress of an action is sufficient to support the right of action.\nAs regards the \u201cSaskatchewan Act\u201d of 1917 (ch. 34, sec. 42) I should only like to say that I pass no opinion upon the question whether the law of Ontario in recognizing a foreign corporation as a juristic person, takes account (for the purpose of determining the capacity of such a corporation) of the enactments of a retroactive statute conclusively binding upon the courts of the jurisdiction where the corporation had its origin and has its principal place of residence. The point is an important one and can more conveniently be considered when a case arises in which it is necessary to pass upon it.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The defendant appeals from the judgment of a divisional court of the Supreme Court of Ontario[18], reversing the decision of Masten J who dismissed the action[19], and directing specific performance of a contract for the purchase of land in Saskatchewan, and payment of the purchase price with interest amounting in all to $6030.35. The facts are fully stated by Mr. Justice Masten.\nThe execution of the agreement for purchase was not contested. The plaintiff company was incorporated under the \u201cSaskatchewan Companies Act,\u201d 1909, sec. 72, pt. 1, by a memorandum of association duly subscribed and registered, in which its objects are declared to be\nto carry on real estate, loan and general brokerage business.\nThe following questions were in issue in the action:\n(1) Was the contract procured by misrepresentations which made it voidable by the defendant?\n(2) Was the contract made in Saskatchewan, or was it made in Ontario, or in the course of carrying on business by the plaintiff company in Ontario?\n(3) If made in Ontario, or in the course of carrying on business there, was it invalid?\n(a) because the Legislature of Saskatchewan lacked power to endow a body corporate created by it or under its authority with the subjective capacity to avail itself outside the province of powers, rights or privileges, similar to those enjoyed by it in Saskatch- ewan, of which any other province or foreign state should by comity permit the exercise within its territory;\n(b) because, if the Saskatchewan Legislature possessed that power, it was not exercised in favour of the plaintiff company; or\n(c) because at the time of the execution of the contract the plaintiff company did not hold a license under the \u201cOntario Extra-Provincial Corporations Act\u201d R.S.O. ch. 179?\n(4) Did the want of such license at the date of instituting the action render it unmaintainable although a license was procured before the trial?\n(1) The learned trial judge was of the opinion that the defence based on misrepresentation wholly failed. His view was affirmed by the Appellate Division and that defence has not been made a ground of appeal to this court.\n(2) After stating the facts at some length, the learned trial judge expressed his views on this aspect of the case in these words\u2014\nThe agreement sued on is dated October 15th, 1912. The only agreement made between these parties was the agreement which was negotiated on that date at Jordan, Ontario, between Gayman, Bowman and Griffin, agents of the company, of the one part and the defendant of the other part. The company subsequently treated what took place on October 15th, not as an offer but as an existing agreement which the company then ratified as of the 15th of October and confirmed and evidenced by executing under its corporate seal a formal written agreement bearing date October 15th.\n* * * * * *\nIn the present case it seems to me that the question is whether the sale in question is essentially bottomed on acts of the plaintiff company done outside the territorial limits of Saskatchewan.\nWhen the plaintiff company appointed Gayman, a resident of Ontario, to be its permanent representative and agent in St. Catharines, and when he, along with the President and Secretary of the company, approached the defendant at his residence in Ontario, sold him the lands in question, made the agreement of which Exhibit 1 afterwards became the written record and at the same time received from him, as part of the purchase price, the promissory note payable in Ontario, and when Gayman at St. Catharines afterwards received from the defendants payments on account of the price and renewals of the note, the plaintiff company was, I think, carrying on in Ontario essential parts of the transaction in question and was assuming to exercise powers and acquire rights outside of Saskatchewan.\nIn so far as the question is one of fact I so find on the evidence.\nThe view taken in the Appellate Division was that notwithstanding the negotiations conducted and the resultant verbal agreement made in Ontario, accompanied by part payment of the purchase money by the giving of a promissory note, and the execution there at a later date by the defendant of the formal instrument now sued upon, because of its execution by the plaintiff company subsequently in Saskatchewan, whereby it became a concluded agreement, it must be regarded as a contract made in Saskatchewan. Hodgins J.A. expressed this opinion perhaps more pointedly than the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, with whom the other members of the court concurred.\nI am with great respect not quite prepared to accept without some qualifications the reasoning on which this conclusion has been based. It is the purchaser who is sued. Whatever answer the Statute of Frauds might have afforded him had he not signed the formal instrument, upon his signature being affixed to it a memorandum sufficient to meet the requirements of that Act existed and the verbal contract made at Jordan, Ontario, if otherwise valid, would have been enforceable against him. But, apart from that view of the matter the execution of the agreement in Saskatchewan by the company was merely the carrying to completion of the oral bargain made and already in part performed in Ontario. Yet, assuming that all that had transpired there was void, because ultra vires of the company, and that while matters remained in that position the defendant would have had an unanswerable defence, what had been so done was not illegal and as such incapable of being made the basis of an agreement binding on the parties. There was nothing to preclude the company by a valid contract made in Saskatchewan from selling its land to a non-resident of the province\u2014nothing to prevent it accepting in Saskatchewan an offer from such a non-resident though obtained in and transmitted from another province, even if the company\u2019s power and capacity were as restricted as the defendant contends. If all that had been done up to the time he executed the formal agreement was ineffectual because ultra vires of the company, the defendant, if aware that he was dealing with a provincial corporation, might be presumed to have been cognizant of the constitutional limitations upon its powers and of the legal consequences which lack of capacity on its part would entail. But, even without the aid of that presumption I would incline to accede to the view that the document signed by him and forwarded with his knowledge for execution by the company, if everything which preceded it were void, might be regarded as an offer to purchase then made by him to the company which was subsequently accepted by the latter in Saskatchewan and thereby became a valid contract binding upon it. Apart, therefore, from some considerations arising out of the phraseology of the \u201cExtra-Provincial Corporations Act\u201d of Ontario presently to be noticed I would be disposed to agree in the conclusion of the learned Chief Justice of Ontario that, assuming the restrictions upon the corporate capacity of the plaintiff company asserted by the defendant, the contract eventually executed by it should not be regarded as open to the objection to its validity on which he relies. 3 (a) But if that view of the case should be wrong and in order to guard against being taken to hold the opinion expressed by Masten J., in which Hodgins J.A. expressly concurs, that it is beyond the legislative jurisdiction of a provincial legislature to incorporate a company with capacity to carry on in another province or state, by virtue of its sanction express or tacit, business within the objects of its incorporation and not otherwise open to exception, I desire to state that on this aspect of the case I adhere to the opinion which I expressed in the Companies\u2019 Reference[20], and in the Bonanza Case[21], and I find that opinion upheld by the judgment of the Judicial Committee on the appeal in the latter case[22]. I venture to quote the following passages from what I said in the Companies\u2019 Case:\u2014\nIf the operations or activities of any foreign corporation should depend for their validity upon the powers conferred upon it by the law of the incorporating state, it would in my opinion be difficult to sustain them, inasmuch as the law of no country can have effect as law beyond the territory of the Sovereign by whom it was imposed. But the exercise of its powers by a corporation extra-territorially depends not upon the legislative power of its country of origin, but upon the express or tacit sanction of the state or province in which such powers are exercised and the absence of any prohibition on the part of the legislature which created it against its taking advantage of international comity. All that a company, incorporated without territorial restriction upon the exercise of its powers, carries abroad is its entity or corporate existence in the state of its origin coupled with a quasi-negative or passive capacity to accept the authorization of foreign states to enter into transactions and to exercise powers within their dominions similar to those which it is permitted to enter into and to exercise within its state of origin. Even its entity as a corporation is available to it in a foreign state only by virtue of the recognition of it by that state. It has no right whatever in a foreign state except such as that state confers.\n* * * * * *\nThe provincial company is a domestic company and exercises its powers as of right only within the territory of the province which creates it. Elsewhere in Canada, as abroad, it is a foreign company and it depends for the exercise of its charter powers upon the sanction accorded by the comity of the province in which it seeks to operate, which, although perhaps not the same thing as international comity, is closely akin to it.\nIn delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in the Bonanza Case[23] Lord Haldane said:\u2014\nThe whole matter may be put thus: The limitations of the legislative powers of a province expressed in section 92, and in particular the limitation of the power of legislation to such as relates to the incorporation of companies with provincial objects, confine the character of the actual powers and rights which the provincial government can bestow, either by legislation or through the executive, to powers and rights exercisable within the province. But actual powers and rights are one thing and capacity to accept extra\u2011provincial powers and rights is quite another.\n* * * * * *\nWhere, under legislation resembling that of the \u201cBritish Companies Act\u201d by a Province of Canada in the exercise of powers which section 92 confers, a provincial company has been incorporated by means of a memorandum of association analogous to that prescribed by the \u201cBritish Companies Act,\u201d the principle laid down by the House of Lords in Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co. v. Riche[24], of course, applies. The capacity of such a company may be limited to capacity within the province, either because the memorandum of association has not allowed the company to exist for the purpose of carrying on any business outside the provincial boundaries, or because the statute under which incorporation took place did not authorize, and therefore excluded, incorporation for such a purpose.\nNote the contrast between the form of the clause dealing with the memorandum and that of the clause dealing with the statute. The antithesis is so significant that it is impossible that it was not intentional.\nAssuming, however, that provincial legislation has purported to authorize a memorandum of association permitting operations outside the province if power for the purpose is obtained ab extra, and that such a memorandum has been registered, the only question is whether the legislation was competent to the province under section 92. If the words of this section are to receive the interpretation placed on them by the majority in the Supreme Court the question will be answered in the negative. But their Lordships are of opinion that this interpretation was too narrow. The words \u201clegislation in relation to the incorporation of companies with provincial objects\u201d do not preclude the province from keeping alive the power of the Executive to incorporate by charter in a fashion which confers a general capacity analogous to that of a natural person. Nor do they appear to preclude the province from legislating so as to create, by or by virtue of statute, a corporation with this general capacity. What the words really do is to preclude the grant to such a corporation, whether by legislation or by executive act according with the distribution of legislative authority, of powers and rights in respect of objects outside the province, while leaving untouched the ability of the corporation if otherwise adequately called into existence, to accept such powers and rights, if granted ab extra. It is, in their Lordships\u2019 opinion, in this narrower sense alone that the restriction to provincial objects is to be interpreted.\nOn this branch of the case, therefore, I find myself unable to agree with the views expressed by Masten J. and Hodgins J.A. Meredith C.J.O. expressly reserved his opinion on the scope of provincial legislative jurisdiction in regard to the incorporation of companies.\n(b) This question presents more difficulty. It was because he thought that whatever power the province possessed to confer the extra-territorial capacity under consideration had not been exercised in favour of the plaintiff company that Meredith C.J.O., with the concurrence of three of his colleagues, was of the opinion that\nthe appellant company by its incorporation acquired no capacity to carry on its business beyond the limits of Saskatchewan.\nThe purview and scope of the power and capacity of the plaintiff company depend entirely upon the combined effect of the statute under which it was incorporated and the terms of its memorandum of association. Not having been incorporated by letters-patent, as was the Bonanza Creek Mining Company, it cannot, in order to supplement the powers and capacity derived from its purely statutory incorporation, invoke the prerogative power (if it be vested in the Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan) to the exercise of which their Lordships of the Judicial Committee saw fit to impute the possession by the Bonanza Creek Mining Company of the powers and capacity, similar to those of a natural person, appertaining to a common law corporation. Since the plaintiff company depends for its existence entirely upon the statute subject to the question of constitutional limitation upon the provincial legislative jurisdiction already dealt with, the problem presented on this branch of the case is to ascertain whether upon the fair intendment of the statute and the memorandum of association it should be deemed to have had conferred upon it the capacity to take advantage of the comity of other provinces and states to enable it to exercise its powers within their jurisdiction. It cannot derive that capacity from any other source. As pointed out by Lord Haldane in the Bonanza Case[25], at page 578\u2014\nThe question is merely one of the interpretation of the words used.\nThe. principle of Ashbury Carriage Co. v. Riche[26], applies. That principle, as stated by his Lordship,\namounts to no more than that the words employed to which a corporation owes its legal existence must have their natural meaning whatever that may be.\nHis Lordship adds:\u2014\nThe doctrine means simply that it is wrong in answering the question of what powers the corporation possesses when incorporated exclusively by statute to start by assuming that the legislature meant to create a company with a capacity resembling that of a natural person such as a corporation created by charter would have at common law and then to ask whether there are words in the statute which take away the incidents of such a corporation.\nIn the passage already quoted referring to a provincial company incorporated by means of a memorandum of association under legislation resembling that of the \u201cBritish Companies Act\u201d his Lordship applying the principle laid down in the Riche Case2, said:\u2014 The capacity of such a company may be limited to capacity within the province either because the memorandum of association has not allowed the company to exist for the purpose of carrying on any business outside the province or because the statute under which incorporation took place did not authorize and therefore excluded incorporation for such a purpose.\nWhile at first blush this language might seem to import that the subjective capacity now in question must be conferred in explicit terms, his Lordship nowhere says so, and I cannot think he meant that in a statute providing for the incorporation of companies general terms may never be given a broad construction of which they are susceptible in order to carry out what should, having regard to all the circumstances and the context of the Act, be considered as having been the intent of the legislature in passing it, but must always be read in the most restricted sense however unreasonable, inconvenient or even mischievous the result. The doctrine of reasonable intendment; Boon v. Howard[27]; The Duke of Buccleuch[28], at page 96; Countess of Rothes v. Kirkcaldy Waterworks Commissioners[29], at page 702; Llewellyn v. Vale of Glamorgan Rly Co.[30], at page 478; Reid v. Reid[31], at page 407; in my opinion applies to such a statute just as it does to others.\nIn the \u201cSaskatchewan Companies Act\u201d I find at least two provisions which afford, I think, sufficient indication that the legislature meant that companies incorporated under it\nfor any lawful purpose to which the authority of the Legislature extends (section 5)\nwithout any restrictive provision, express or implied, in the memorandum of association should possess, to use Lord Haldane\u2019s terms, all the \u201cactual powers and rights\u201d which it could bestow and also the fullest \u201ccapacity\u201d which it could confer\nto accept extra-provincial powers and rights.\nBy section 17 the \u201cSaskatchewan Companies Act\u201d of 1909 provides that every body incorporated under that Act shall be\ncapable of exercising all the functions of an incorporated company\nand by section 4 it is enacted that\nNo company association or partnership consisting of more than twenty persons shall hereafter be formed for the purpose of carrying on any business to which the authority of the Legislature extends that has for its object the acquisition of gain by the company association or partnership or by the individual members thereof unless it is registered as a company under this Act or is formed in pursuance of some other Act of the Legislature.\nThe creation in Saskatchewan by charter of a common law corporation having more than twenty shareholders is probably precluded by this latter section. There appears to be no other general Act of the Saskatchewan Legislature providing for the incorporation of companies, and no provision for the registration of domestic companies created otherwise than under statutory authority. It would seem therefore that, unless by a special Act, a corporation with more than twenty shareholders having the capacity to avail itself of international comity cannot be brought into existence in that province if it may not be done under the \u201cCompanies Act.\u201d Compare secs. 18 and 4 of the \u201cCompanies Act,\u201d 1862, ch 89 (Imp.) and secs. 16(2) and 1(2) of the \u201cCompanies (Con.) Act\u201d of 1908, ch. 69 (Imp.); and compare also secs. 95 and 97 of the \u201cSaskatchewan Companies Act\u201d of 1909 with sec. 37 of the \u201cCompanies Act\u201d of 1867, ch. 131 (Imp.) and sec. 76 of the \u201cCompanies (Con) Act\u201d of 1908. (Imp.)\nI think it is abundantly clear that the legislature of Saskatchewan intended to confer upon companies to be incorporated under the \u201cCompanies Act\u201d of 1909, whose memoranda of association contain no restrictions thereon, the fullest powers, rights and capacity for the attainment of their objects which its legislative jurisdiction empowered it to bestow and which may be requisite or useful to enable it to exercise \u201call the functions of an incorporated body\u201d for that purpose. It must not be understood, however, that my reference to the provisions of sections 4 and 17 implies that had they been omitted the general terms in which the \u201cSaskatchewan Companies Act\u201d provides for incorporation would not have sufficed to vest in corporations formed under it the capacity we are considering.\nThere is nothing in the memorandum of association of the plaintiff company which\u2014to quote Lord Haldane again\nhas not allowed the company to exist for the purpose of carrying on any business outside the provincial boundaries.\nIts declared objects do not import activities confined to any limited area.\nWe are not now dealing with a question which affects only provincial corporations. The same problem is presented in the case of every company which has been incorporated by memorandum of association under the \u201cEnglish Companies Acts\u201d in general terms for objects not of such a nature as to imply an intention that the exercise of its powers should be restricted to the United Kingdom and without any such restriction being expressed, but also without any explicit provision that it may carry on its business abroad or may avail itself of the comity of foreign nations or of the self-governing overseas Dominions of the Empire. I am satisfied that thousands upon thousands of contracts have been made by and on behalf of such corporations outside the United Kingdom in the course of carrying out the objects of their incorporation and that it would surprise and shock its directors and legal advisers if the power of an English company so constituted to make such contracts were called in question and they were told that under the doctrine of Ashbury Carriage Co. v. Riche[32], its activities must be strictly confined to the United Kingdom. Yet that would seem to be the effect of the Bonanza judgment as interpreted by the learned trial judge and the learned judges of the Appellate Division.\nThe \u201cEnglish Companies Acts\u201d of 1862 and 1908 nowhere provide expressly that corporations formed under them shall possess, or may acquire, the capacity to accept powers and rights abroad. Section 55 of the Act of 1862 (section 78 of the \u201cCompanies (Consolidated) Act\u201d of 1908) providing for foreign attorneys, and the recital and sections 2, 3 and 6 of the \u201cCompanies Seals Act\u201d of 1864, (chapter 19) (section 79 of the \u201cCompanies (Con.) Act\u201d of 1908), providing for foreign seals, appear to assume that such a capacity might be acquired under the Act of 1862. It is not without significance that it was thought necessary explicitly to restrict the possession of the powers conferred by the Act of 1864 to companies expressly authorized to exercise them by their articles of association. The English sections referred to have no counterpart in the \u201cSaskatchewan Companies Act,\u201d 1909.\nWhile it may be said that the presence of these provisions in the English statute, at all events since 1864, made the intention to enable the companies incorporated under it to acquire the capacity under consideration clearer than it is in the case of the Saskatchewan statute, the difference is merely one of degree. In neither case is there explicit language conferring the capacity. In both its existence depends on the doctrine of reasonable intendment. Does the language of the statute fairly interpreted sufficiently indicate that the legislature meant to provide for the enjoyment of this capacity by the companies to be formed under its authority?\nNo doubt the plaintiff company, as a statutory corporation, would not have the powers and capacity of a natural person unless conferred upon it by the statute. That is the doctrine of Ashbury Co. v. Riche[33]. But it has nowhere been determined, so far as I am aware\u2014and certainly not in the Bonanza Case[34] that in the absence of express language purporting to confer upon it capacity to avail itself of the comity of nations a corporation, formed under a statute, which by reasonable intendment should be taken as having been designed to vest in the bodies corporate created, without restriction, under its authority all the powers and rights and the fullest capacity which the legislature had jurisdiction to bestow, and having objects which imply no territorial restriction and powers set forth in the most general terms, is by English law unable to avail itself of the comity of other nations or dominions and is therefore obliged to confine its activities within the territorial limits of the jurisdiction of the legislature to which it owes its existence.\nI am for these reasons of the opinion that the power which the Legislature of Saskatchewan possessed to endow corporations created by it with capacity to exist and to carry on outside the limits of the Province of Saskatchewan business within the objects of its incorporation sanctioned by the country where it is transacted has been exercised in favour of the plaintiff company.\nI entirely agree with the learned judges of the provincial courts that the plaintiff can derive no assistance from the Saskatchewan declaratory statute of 1917. If the contract in question had been ultra vires of the plaintiff company when entered into such ex post facto legislation could not render it enforceable in courts not subject to the jurisdiction of the legislature of Saskatchewan.\nOntario, as Mr. Justice Masten points out, has always recognized\nthe right of foreign incorporated companies to carry on business and make contracts outside of the country in which they are incorporated, if consistent with the purposes of the corporation and not prohibited by its charter and not inconsistent with the local laws of the country in which the business was carried on, subject always to the restrictions and burdens imposed by the laws enforced therein.\nCanadian Pacific Rly. Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co.[35], at page 155.\nHowe Machine Co. v. Walker[36], cited by the learned judge is a comparatively early instance of the affirmation of that right, and, as he adds,\nso far as I am aware it has ever since been maintained without question.\nIt follows that, unless prohibited or rendered void by Ontario legislation, the contract sued upon, even if made in Ontario, being admittedly for the attainment of one of the provincial objects of the plaintiff company, was not ultra vires and is enforceable in the Ontario Courts.\n(c) The only legislation of Ontario on which the appellant relies is the \u201cExtra-Provincial Corporations Act\u201d (R.S.O. ch. 179). The plaintiff company admittedly did not hold the license required by section 7 of that statute when the contract in question was made, nor indeed until after this action was begun. Was the contract therefore void and unenforceable in the Ontario Courts? It was undoubtedly negotiated in Ontario and was executed there by the defendent, whose liability upon it it was sought to enforce, and was not an isolated transaction. It was, in my opinion, clearly a contract, within the purview of section 16 (1) of the \u201cExtra-Provincial Corporations Act,\u201d\nmade * * in part within Ontario and in the course of or in connection with business carried on contrary to the provisions of said section 7\nof that statute, i.e., by or on behalf of an Extra-provincial corporation not then licensed (see section 7, sub-section 2). The Ontario statute however, does not declare such a contract void. On the contrary, it merely deprives the offending extra-provincial corporation of the right\nof maintaining any action or other proceeding in any court in respect of any such contract so long as it remains unlicensed\nand upon the granting of a license puts its right of resort to the Ontario courts in the same position\nas if such license had been granted * * * before the institution\nof the action or proceeding.\nIt is the prosecution of \u201csuch action or other proceeding\u201d; i.e.\nan action or other proceeding * * in respect of any contract made wholly or in part within Ontario in the course of or in connection with bsuiness carried on contrary to the provisions of said section 7\nthat section 16(2) expressly authorizes. That provision is utterly repugnant to the idea that the statute was intended to render such contracts void. The \u201cExtra-Provincial Corporations Act\u201d of Ontario does not affect the validity of the contract.\n(4) The statute in explicit terms provides by sub-section 2 of section 16 that upon the granting of the license a pending action upon a contract made contrary to the provisions of section 7\nmay be prosecuted as if such license had been granted * * before the institution thereof.\nI am, for the foregoing reasons, of the opinion that the contract sued upon was not ultra vires of the plaintiff company and is enforceable in the courts of Ontario and that the judgment for its specific performance should be upheld.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014A company duly incorporated in a province becomes an artificial person authorized by its charter and with the capacity of carrying on its business in all the parts of the world where by the comity of nations such business is not repugnant or prejudicial to the policy or to the interests of the local authority.\nSupposing that in this case the respondent company had been selling in Ontario lands situate in Saskatchewan (a fact which is denied by the respondent) it was certainly within the limits of its authority and there was nothing in the Ontario laws which would prevent a company incorporated by another province from doing business so long as it would pay for the licences imposed upon it.\nThe facts disclosed in the evidence do not shew that the contract in question was made in violation of the powers conferred by its charter and by the comity of nations on the respondent company.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Ingersoll & Kingstone.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Payne & Bissett.\n[1] 45 Ont.

[1914] c. 178, s. 82.\nA company formed to buy land for re-sale purchased a block on which W. held an option. W. made a profit of over $11,000 which he shared equally with F. and D. promoters and directors of the company who did not disclose the fact to the other members for several months.\nHeld, that F. and D. had received a secret profit to which the company was entitled.\nThe company passed a resolution purporting to refuse to allow its name to be used and C., a shareholder and former partner of F., brought action, on behalf of himself and all other shareholders except the defendants, to recover this secret profit for the company.\nHeld, that the capacity of a single shareholder, against the will of the majority, to assert the right of the company to this money is doubtful; Towers v. African Tug Co., ([1904] 1 Ch. 558) referred to; he must succeed on his own merits alone; and, Davies C.J. and Duff J. dissenting, as it was shewn that he was aware of the payment to F. and D. at an early date, and elected to treat F\u2019s portion as an asset of the partnership between them by demanding his share of it he was disqualified from bringing the action in respect to these secret profits.\nD., who was a land agent, sold the property purchased from W. at an advantageous price and was paid the usual broker\u2019s commission. At a meeting of the shareholders a resolution was passed sanctioning this payment. C. claimed the return of this money also.\nHeld, that as D. did not receive the money in his capacity of director, sec. 92 of the Ontario \u201cCompanies Act\u201d did not apply and a by-law authorizing the payment was not necessary. Held, also, that there was noting to prevent D. from serving the company as an employee and receiving proper remuneration therefor. In re Matthew Guy Carriage and Automobile Co. (26 Ont. L.R. 377; 4 D.L.R. 764), approved.\nPer Davies C.J. and Duff J. The payment of the commission could only be legal if sanctioned by the shareholders. At the meeting when the resolution professing to sanction all the payments attacked was passed the capital of the company had been impaired by payment of a dividend without the funds sufficient therefor. The resolution, therefore, had no effect and the impugned transactions had no sanction. As to C\u2019s right to bring the action it was not pleaded nor raised in the Courts below and cannot be questioned on this appeal.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (42 Ont.

THE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Duff.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This suit is ostensibly concerned with the rights of a shareholder in a company to keep erring promoters and directors in the path of duty, but in truth is the outcome of an unsavoury squabble between two late partners in a law firm which had been solicitors for the company and could not, on a dissolution of their firm, settle their partnership accounts without adjusting the affairs of the company.\nThe appellant Fullerton, an elderly practitioner of law in Toronto, took, in January, 1912, as junior partner, one Crawford, a young man who professed to have some knowledge of company law, on the understanding that he was to bear the burden of the office work.\nWe are not very fully informed as to the exact details of their arrangements, but we are told that they were to divide the results of the office on the basis of five to Fullerton and three to Crawford \u201cbut each to have the liberty of having business in which\u201d he might \u201chave a personal interest done in the office without charge.\u201d\nFullerton had a proposition made to him, by a client and personal friend named Wallace, to buy from one Bicknell a hundred and fifty-nine acres in the township of York at $725 an acre. An optional agreement was obtained by Wallace therefor, which was drawn in the said law office. To secure that, the selling agent, and one Doran, and Wallace, each contributed in nearly equal parts to. a deposit of $2,500 which Wallace as buyer was required to pay.\nHaving in view the ultimate purpose of forming a joint stock company to carry out the speculation, a syndicate agreement was drawn up in the office of Fullerton & Crawford whereby Fullerton was to buy from Wallace at $800 an acre the land which he had thus secured at $725 an acre.\nThis agreement purports to be made in duplicate, on the 4th March, 1913, between Wallace the vendor of the first part, and Fullerton as trustee thereinafter called the purchaser of the second part, and the subscribers whose names are signed, of the third part; and to provide that a syndicate is thereby formed with a capital of $75,000 divided into $100 shares to carry out said purchase by Fullerton. Doran was to be the manager of the syndicate; Fullerton to be treasurer; and it was declared to be the intention to organize a joint stock company in which each syndicate shareholder was to become a shareholder in proportion to the number of shares held by him in the syndicate.\nThe trustee Fullerton was then to convey the land to said company. The details were to be decided at any meeting of the syndicate.\nCrawford subscribed said syndicate agreement for $5,000. An agreement of sale was entered into on same day for the sale by Wallace to Fullerton at the price of $800 an acre.\nInasmuch as Fullerton is described in both documents as a trustee I see no importance to be attached to this latter, save its being referred to in the syndicate agreement as definitely fixing the terms of purchase.\nIt was contended by Crawford in this suit, and by his personal representative in this appeal, that he was entitled, a year and seven months later, to bring an action against Fullerton and Doran to recover for the company which was duly formed as projected in said agreement, about six weeks later, the respective sums of $3,877.20, each which Wallace had paid each out of the profits he had thus made of $75 an acre. The learned trial judge and the Appellate Division upheld such contention.\nI assume for argument\u2019s sake that the company if suing might have recovered said profits.\nIndeed, very early in the argument it was intimated by this court to the counsel for the representative of Crawford, that as to the said amount so received by Fullerton they might so assume also, and direct their attention to the claim made by the respondents, that Crawford had become disqualified and disentitled to bring such an action especially in face of the almost unanimous opposition of his fellow shareholders.\nI have sought in vain for any decision in favour of a shareholder coming into court with so many impediments in his way, by reason of honest opposition on the part of his fellow shareholders to any assertion of such right as he claimed and with the evident disqualification attaching to him by reason of his knowledge of and acquiescence in the conduct of those accused until he had failed in an attempt to profit thereby and to extort by virtue thereof a share of such part as Fullerton had got.\nThe learned trial judge rejected another item of his claim which was to recover for the company moneys paid out by reason of the said payments impairing capital.\nThat claim was rejected, not because unfounded in law if made by the company or a proper party, but solely by reason of the plaintiff\u2019s disqualifications resulting from his sharing in such illegal payments.\nThe same principle as thus acted upon and as applied in the case of Towers v. African Tug Co.[9], ought on the evidence of the plaintiff to be applied to the rest of the claims in question. Shortly after the events I have already related in regard to the origin of the claim for recovery of secret profits above referred to, the company became incorporated on the application by petition of Fullerton, Doran, Crawford and others who were named as provisional directors.\nThe papers connected with this application were all prepared by Crawford and he made the usual affidavit verifying the petition.\nThe papers already referred to, and those others to found this proceeding upon had been all kept in the office vault of Fullerton & Crawford and along therewith the agreement between Wallace and Bicknell which Crawford admitted seeing and handling.\nThe interest of Crawford evidenced by his subscribing one-fifteenth part of the whole proposed capital in the syndicate, coupled with opportunity and duty alike to know should have led any intelligent man to learn by the time incorporation was completed the fact that there was a profit going to Wallace.\nWe are not left to rest on these circumstances alone for Crawford in his evidence spoke of the relations between Wallace and Fullerton, as follows:\u2014\nQ.\u2014After the 4th of March\u2014prior to that have you any recollection of any conversation with either Doran or Fullerton? A.\u2014Yes, some time prior to that, I think it was before the 4th of March, Mr. Fullerton told me that he was taking this deal in Wallace\u2019s name because he did not want himself to go on any covenant.\nQ.\u2014Then he was taking this deal in Wallace\u2019s name as he did not want to go on any covenants\u2014is that the first statement that you recollect as having been made by any person about this matter? A.\u2014So far as I know it is, although I know that I had a number of office conversations with him.\nQ.\u2014Probably prior to that time. Then do you want us to understand that Mr. Fullerton was putting Wallace forward as a stool pigeon in this matter and you knew that from the first? A.\u2014Why, of course.\nQ.\u2014Just go the limit if you will? A.\u2014Of course, he was putting Wallace forward.\nQ.\u2014Pardon? A.\u2014He was taking the deal in Wallace\u2019s name so there was no liability on his part. Q.\u2014So from the first\u2014? A.\u2014If he was not successful in raising a syndicate\u2014\nQ.\u2014So you want us to understand the first conversation you had with anybody about this matter you recall is one in which Mr. Fullerton represented to you that he was taking this, which was his, Fullerton\u2019s deal, in Wallace\u2019s name, so as to avoid his, Fullerton\u2019s, personal liability? A.\u2014I would not say that was the first conversation, but that was one of the conversations.\u201d\nAnd again\nQ.\u2014Yes? A.\u2014And was considering getting up this syndicate.\nQ.\u2014Will you please give me something definite, is it the first conversation you recollect or not? A.\u2014So far as I know it is.\nAnd to his taking an interest:\u2014\nQ.\u2014I understand you were very little interested in it at that time\u2014where did it take place? A.\u2014Somewhere in the office.\nQ.\u2014In your office or his? A.\u2014I cannot say as to that. He used to walk into my office and talk to me about it and in his office and in Doran\u2019s office, and he would talk about it, it was the talk of the whole office.\nQ.\u2014Mr. Fullerton was not hiding anything under a blanket or keeping anything from you? A.\u2014I do not believe he was.\nQ.\u2014The matter was discussed pro and con? A.\u2014I thought so.\nQ.\u2014You were in Mr. Doran\u2019s office and took it up with him? A.\u2014I think so.\nQ.\u2014You went in to Mr. Doran\u2019s office, any conversations about it? A.\u2014Yes, we used to talk about it.\n* * *\nQ.\u2014Well, you ought to remember it\u2014when did you first make up your mind to take an interest in this proposition? A.\u2014It would be about the 10th of March.\nQ.\u2014And you subscribed for how much? A.\u2014$2,500.\nQ.\u2014$2,500\u2014was that your original subscription? A.\u2014The original subscription was $5,000 which included $2,500 of Mr. Eatons.\n* * *\nQ.\u2014Now, tell me, Mr. Crawford, had you any other investments of a similar character to this, at that time? A.\u2014No.\nQ.\u2014Had you any other money in any other real estate transactions at or about that time? A.\u2014No.\nQ.\u2014Can you suggest any other investment you made in 1913? A.\u2014No.\nQ.\u2014Had you any other investments that were of a similar amount, or to any extent in 1912? A.\u2014No.\nQ.\u2014Had you any in 1914? A.\u2014No.\nQ.\u2014Then so far as this was concerned, this was practically your ewe lamb in the way of investment? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Your ewe lamb, and the one, therefore, in which you were particularly interested? A.\u2014-Yes. And again as to Doran\u2019s contribution:\u2014\nQ.\u2014When did you have the first interview with Mr. Doran about the matter? A.\u2014Oh, I cannot say.\nQ.\u2014Can you recall any interview with Mr. Doran prior to the 10th of March, when you agreed to go in? A.\u2014I can recollect several conversations with Mr. Doran.\nQ.\u2014Can you cast your mind back, and having regard to this, your first and most important and practically your only investment at that period of time, can you cast your mind back to any conversation with Mr. Doran, and fix that conversation in your mind with Mr. Doran, and say what took place? A.\u2014Not previous to the signing up of the deal.\nQ.\u2014Not previous\u2014what do you mean by signing up of the deal? A.\u2014The agreement of the 4th of March.\nQ.\u2014What? A.\u2014The agreement of the 4th of March.\nQ.\u2014But previous to the 4th of March, and after the 4th of March, if you recollect any conversation with Mr. Doran, what was the first you remember? A.\u2014I remember Mr. Doran telling me that he had put up the $2,500.\nQ.\u2014The whole $2,500? A.\u2014The whole $2,500.\nQ.\u2014Do you remember the time that Doran told you that? A.\u2014No, it was some time shortly afterwards, and he was bragging, he bragged to me of having put one over on Boehm.\nQ.\u2014What? A.\u2014He was\u2014\nQ.\u2014Don\u2019t characterize it bragging\u2014you know, give us the conversation? A.\u2014He told me in other words that he had got ahead of Mr. Boehm.\nQ.\u2014Yes? A.\u2014He succeeded in getting Mr. Boehm to put up a third of the deposit.\nQ.\u2014He had succeeded in getting Mr. Boehm? A.\u2014To put up a third of the deposit.\nQ.\u2014In addition to them\u2014was that at the same time he was discussing about having to put up the $2,500? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014So that you understood at that time, that in the $2,500 that was put up, Boehm had contributed one-third of the deposit? A.\u2014Yes. from what he told me.\nAnd again as to Wallace:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Now, Mr. Wallace was not in this real estate business for his health, so far as you could see, was he? A.\u2014No, I do not suppose he was.\nQ.\u2014You thought it reasonable that Mr. Wallace went into these ventures with a view to make a profit? A.\u2014Apparently so, if he disclosed them.\nQ.\u2014I am not asking whether he disclosed them or not, so far as Mr. Wallace was concerned, he transferred by an agreement to Mr. Fullerton, certain rights and interests in that property at $800 an acre\u2014you knew that, you knew that? A.\u2014I knew he had an agreement with Mr. Fullerton. Doran, who had taken an office about the 1st July, 1913, to carry on real estate business in same building and, as I understand the evidence, adjacent to those rooms occupied by the firm of Fullerton & Crawford, would seem thus to have had the opportunity of daily intercourse with Crawford as well as Fullerton in regard to the joint venture in which he put $5,000 for himself and a friend.\nI cannot accept the statement he (Crawford) seems to have made that he did not know that there was a profit of $75 an acre to somebody, for it is inconsistent with what he admits in relation thereto and the exercise of ordinary common sense applied to the business he was so deeply interested in for himself and others.\nHis pretension was that he only became aware of the amount Fullerton got by looking at the papers in the vault in January or February, 1914, after his partnership with Fullerton had ceased, as it did in said January.\nWhy, or how, he should have, as it were accidentally, discovered it then and not before on the many opportunities equally good for doing so, I am unable to understand.\nI prefer to think he obviously had either forgotten or had not felt the same keen interest as this suit indicates in sharing in the profits made by Fullerton.\nIndeed, he puts it rather as a realization of the fact in the following evidence:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Then you told us yesterday that you had made some discovery about this alleged property, I think you said, in February, 1914? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Just tell us what the discovery was that you then made? A.\u2014The discovery was that Mr. Wallace had made this profit of eleven thousand and some hundreds of dollars.\nQ.\u2014Yes? A.\u2014That was the first time that I realized that Wallace had made that money.\nQ.\u2014Tell me the date on which you discovered it? A.\u2014I cannot tell you that, but the day\u2014 Q.\u2014Well, about the day? A.\u2014It would be some time about the latter end of February.\nThe learned trial judge expressly finds as a fact, notwithstanding Crawford\u2019s denial, that he knew a profit was being made by Wallace.\nBut for his omission to find also that he knew, or must be held to have known, that Fullerton and Doran were interested therein, I should not have set forth the foregoing evidence so fully as I have done.\nCrawford at the trial would have the court believe that, though the facts were plain and palpable to anyone possessed of the documents as he was, he had failed to realize the actual situation in which Fullerton had placed himself by what said documents demonstrated. I do not think this improved his claim to found such a suit as this.\nAnd still less so when we find him immediately attempting to make merchandise of his realization of the fact by the attempt to frighten Fullerton into giving him a share of what he claimed herein to be an illicit profit, as evidenced by the following letter:\u2014\n401 Crown Office Building,\nToronto, March 13th, 1914.\nJames S. Fullerton, Esq. K.C.,\nToronto, Ont.\nRe Accounts.\nDear Sir:\u2014\nI contend that you received moneys from Mr. Edwin Wallace in connection with the purchase of Bathurst Centre, and must now ask you to account to me for the same under our partnership.\nI think my share nearly amounts to $1,500.00.\nYours truly,\n(Signed) J.P. Crawford.\nThis letter admittedly refers to the said secret profits got by Fullerton. I cannot think that a suitor who proposed, as this one in this letter did, to share in that complained of, is entitled, within the doctrine laid down in many cases but latest in the Towers Case[10] cited above, to bring in support of such a claim such an action as this when he failed to intimidate and extort a division of the spoils.\nHis share therein as a shareholder in the company as the result of success herein in that regard might be $300, but he was willing to take $1500 if the item was brought into the accounts of Fullerton & Crawford.\nThe suppression of secret profits is most desirable but I submit it will never be accomplished by upholding the claim of one who thus attempted first to make use of such a club to promote his own ends, and then only months afterwards when he failed to so intimidate, resorts to an action ostensibly in the interest of the company.\nTo recognize such a suitor as well entitled first to attempt such a levy and then entitled, despite his failure therein, would be productive of evils far surpassing those springing from a single successful reaping of secret profits, especially when the latter has been maintained as rightful by nearly all those concerned but himself.\nOn that ground the appellant Fullerton is entitled, in my opinion, to succeed as to this item of the claim made.\nI am, moreover, very far from holding the opinion that a single shareholder can insist, against an over-whelming majority of fellow shareholders who have no interest adverse to the claim for recovery in such a case, save the honest purpose of allowing him who has received such compensation to retain it, though so ill advised as to have kept his doing so secret instead of manfully proclaiming the fact.\nIn such a case the question of ultra vires or fraud in the sense used in the decision bearing upon such an issue may not arise and the matter be within the competence of a disinterested majority of the shareholders to deal with.\nWhat is clear from the latest decisions such as Alexander v. Automatic Telephone Company[11], is that shareholders in maintaining an advantage for themselves not shared by others, cannot be permitted to accomplish the wrong merely on the pretence that it falls within the internal management of the company.\nThis decision followed the judgment in the case of Menier v. Hooper\u2019s Telegraph Works[12], wherein, as also in Gray v. Lewis[13] at page 1051, Sir W.M. James L.J. expressed comprehensively what I may be permitted to think is still the law governing such cases as this when the question raised may not present some act merely ultra vires the company and the test have to be applied whether or not a fraudulent use is being made of its powers by the majority of the shareholders or directors as the case may be.\nIn the case at bar the plaintiff fails, I think, to bring himself within the principles there laid down not only as to the first item but also the other remaining items of his claim when we consider, as I think we must, the action of the shareholders at the September meeting which was called at his instance.\nThe other items I refer to are Doran\u2019s share of the profits made by Wallace and Doran\u2019s commission on the resale. As to the former, all I have said and set forth, relative to the claim against Fullerton, applies.\nIt may be observed that though there was no demand made upon Doran for a share, yet the obvious purpose of the litigation was the same improper one in its origin, and suit was taken after long knowledge and acquiescence.\nAs to Doran\u2019s commission on the resale I think there was beyond a doubt present to Crawford\u2019s mind the knowledge that it was Doran\u2019s effort that produced the resale, that he knew Doran would be expecting a commission and was the only man entitled to commission and whose claim could alone be that referred to in the circular letter of the 22nd of April, 1914, to him and all other shareholders, announcing the sale and referring to the year\u2019s operations and the paying of commissions on sale, could refer to nothing else than Doran\u2019s commission.\nYet in face thereof he not only refrained from objecting thereto but actually participated in the distribution of the moneys as therein suggested, and I hold must be held to have assented thereto.\nInasmuch as he drew the misleading by-law of the company which provided as follows:\u2014\n6. Except in so far as the remuneration of the directors shall be fixed by this by-law the directors themselves shall have power to fix their remuneration either as directors or as officers of the company, and also the salaries or remuneration to be paid to all salaried officers of the company, and to vary the same when it may be expedient to do so.\nupon which no doubt the directors may well have imagined they had a right to act in fixing the commission, I do not think he was entitled to complain of the result.\nUnder all the foregoing circumstances I am of the opinion that he had no right to complain of this commission and was not entitled to override the action of the shareholders by the bringing of this action though other shareholders may have had such right by virtue of the statute. I think the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014The liability of the appellants in respect of three sums at the suit of the respondent in a representation on behalf of the shareholders is to be determined on this appeal: The sum of $3,867.36 for which the appellant Fullerton has been adjudged responsible and the like sum for which the Doran estate has been adjudged responsible and the sum of $8,121.22 for which all the appellants have been adjudged responsible.\nThe question raised, whether Crawford, the original plaintiff, was entitled to maintain the action, whether, that is to say, he had not lost any right he might otherwise have had by acquiescence or estoppel, would naturally come first in order of consideration but the discussion of it may conveniently be postponed until after the discussion of the substantive question of responsibility.\nThe learned trial judge, Masten J. gave judgment against the appellants and the Doran estate respectively for the sums first above mentioned and against all the appellants in respect of the sum of $8,121.22. This judgment was sustained by the Appellate Division and that court was unanimous as regards all points except in respect of the liability of the defendants Murray, Gibson and Brian, in relation to which there was some difference of opinion.\nThe first two sums were paid to Fullerton and Doran respectively by Wallace out of the purchase money, which, on the same day, had been paid to Wallace by Fullerton on behalf of the syndicate, and constituted in each case one-third of Wallace\u2019s profit by the sale, which amounted in all to $11,601.75. It seems to be unnecessary in regard to this transaction to say more than that Fullerton and Doran were both in the position of promoters of and consequently of trustees for the syndicate, and in that character incapable of retaining any profit derived in this way from the transaction. These moneys, therefore, which they received from Wallace remained the property of the syndicate and later of the company in their hands. In passing it may be noted that these moneys were, of course, part of the proceeds of the original subscriptions, that is to say, of the original capital of the syndicate.\nThe substantive defence of the appellants in respect of these sums rests upon certain resolutions, which were passed on the 4th November, 1914, by the shareholders of the company, professing to take effect as a release of the company\u2019s claim to them. I concur with the view of the learned trial judge that, in the situation in which the company found itself on the date mentioned, it was not competent to the shareholders to transfer without consideration a title to these moneys to Fullerton and Doran.\nThe company made a sale of its lands in the spring of 1914 and, at the end of May, the directors, after paying a commission of $8,000 odd to Doran, proceeded to distribute $36,000 odd in dividends; and the resolutions of the 4th November already alluded to professed to ratify this payment to Doran and to secure a title to Doran in respect of this sum as well as to deal with the sums distributed by Wallace already referred to.\nIn May, 1914, the profits arising from the company\u2019s transactions (treating Doran\u2019s claim for commission as a liability of the company) had reached $25,000 odd on the assumption, and this is rather important, that a third mortgage of $50,000 odd given by the purchasers of the land sold in the spring of 1914 was worth its face value, and on the further assumption that in respect of the two mortgages, one assumed and the other given by Wallace, the company was under no contingent responsibility. Thus the directors in paying the dividend mentioned as well as the Doran claim had disposed of at least $11,000 in excess of the moneys available for distribution among the shareholders.\nOn the 4th November, therefore, the capital of the company had actually been diminished by a considerable sum and the principle of Newman\u2019s Case[14], forbade any further distribution of its assets among the shareholders until the statutory proceedings had been taken. In re Newman & Co.14; Paton\u2019s Case[15], at page 406; Hutton v. West Cork[16]; Flitcroft\u2019s Case[17], at pages 534-5.\nNow the sums in the hands of Fullerton and Doran which had been paid to them by Wallace were assets of the company, just as the moneys standing to the credit of the company in the bank were; and the attempt on the 4th November, to hand this property over to Fullerton and Doran was just as illegal, and inoperative in point of legal effect, as would have been a resolution authorizing the directors to transfer any asset, e.g., the mortgage above mentioned into the name of any one of them and to sell and dispose of it for the benefit of the directors.\nAs to the Doran commission. I am disposed to agree with the view of section 92 of the Ontario \u201cCompanies Act\u201d advanced on behalf of the appellants; I am inclined to concur in the view that this section does not contemplate special payments of the character here in question which are not made by way of remuner- ation for services of a director as director, but a special allowance made on some other ground.\nOur attention has not been called to any other provision of the Ontario \u201cCompanies Act,\u201d and I assume that if there had been such a provision our attention would have been called to it, that in any way weakens the force of the rule by which directors, trustees of their powers for the shareholders, are incapacitated from retaining as against the company any profit arising from a contract made between themselves and the body of directors of which they are members, unless the company knows and assents. Imperial Mercantile Credit Association v. Coleman[18], at page 566; James v. Eve[19], at page 348; Gluckstein v. Barnes[20]; Boston Deep Sea Fishing Co. v. Ansell[21]. The application of the principle does not appear to be affected by the provisions of by-law 6 of the company\u2019s general by-laws. The power given thereby to the directors is a power to fix their own remuneration as directors or as officers of the company; and, no doubt, it would have been competent to the directors acting thereunder to attach a salary to the office of director or to the office of vice-president, or to the office of general manager, but it is impossible to suggest that what is alleged to have been done here in order to support the payment to Doran, is or bears any kind of resemblance to any of these things. What is alleged is a contract between the company and Doran through the instrumentality of the board of directors of which he was a member, allowing him a specific fee for a specific service\u2014a service given in the ordinary course of prosecuting his calling as land agent. That would be a transaction which could not be brought within the authority given by this by-law. Doran, it may be noted, on the 4th November was still vice-president, director, general manager. The fee which had been illegally paid to him was the property of the company in his hands. It is quite true it required only the assent of the company to give him a title and the resolution of the 4th November is relied upon as furnishing adequate evidence of that assent.\nThe first objection which is taken to the proceedings on the 4th November is based on the fact already mentioned, namely, that in paying the dividend of the 29th May the company had more than disposed of all its available distributable assets, and that objection seems to be fatal.\nIt is quite true that if the company had possessed itself of the moneys in Fullerton and Doran\u2019s hands, amounting to $15,000 odd, then, assuming always that the third mortgage on the lands disposed of should be counted at its face value, it would appear that there would be a small surplus, $4,000 odd; but on the closest calculation the retention of neither the Wallace donations nor the Doran fee could be sanctioned without obliterating this surplus and there is, I think, no escape from the conclusion that these proceedings of the 4th November, which were virtually simultaneous, must on this account be held to be without legal effect.\nThere is another grave objection, moreover, to these proceedings which I should have preferred not to mention and which I should have passed over in silence had it not been that it has material weight in considering the important question of the right of the plaintiff to maintain the proceedings.\nIt is unfortunately too clear that knowledge of the participation in the Wallace profit was industriously withheld by Fullerton and Doran from the shareholders \u2014until in the autumn of 1914 the curiosity excited by Crawford\u2019s activities, left them no other choice than disclosure. At the trial Fullerton still maintained the attitude that these payments were bonuses and any suggestion of impropriety in the non-disclosure of them was treated rather contemptuously as a quibble. I am referring, of course, to Fullerton\u2019s own attitude, not to that of his counsel. In view of this state of mind, one is not surprised to discover in a letter written on the 11th September to Mr. Ruckle, for the information of persons from whom proxies were to be obtained, the statement that Wallace came to him, Fullerton, as any other client would have come, and told him that he had an option on this property at $800, that no other price was ever mentioned and that \u201cthe deal was put through\u201d at that price; and again in a letter of the 6th of July, addressed to the shareholders generally, this statement: \u201cEdwin Wallace\u2019s option was at the price of $725 per acre and he offered it to the syndicate at $800 per acre, whereby Mr. Wallace made a profit of the balance.\u201d Mr. Fullerton\u2019s attitude is perhaps best brought out in some parts of his own evidence:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Then you say that you first knew that you were going to get something on what date? A.\u2014Oh, my recollection now is that it was on the 14th day of March.\nQ.\u2014On the 14th day of March? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014That you first knew that you were going to get something? A.\u2014Yes\u2014or rather I did not know that I was going to get something until I got it, but on the 14th day of March Wallace spoke to me about it.\nQ.\u2014Wallace spoke to you about it and then you did not know what amount you were going to get then? A.\u2014I did not.\nQ.\u2014And when did you find out what amount you were going to get? A.\u2014When I got the cheque.\nQ.\u2014When was that? A.\u2014I cannot say whether it was the afternoon of the 14th or the morning of the 15th. I can only state that I deposited it on the 15th or that it was deposited for me on the 15th. In my examination I was speaking from the deposit, and I thought it was on the 15th I got it, but further recollection the 14th or 15th\u2014 Q.\u2014The 14th or 15th\u2014now up to that date you did not know yourself you were going to get anything? A\u2014I did not.\nQ.\u2014And any knowledge Mr. Crawford could have acquired up to that date could not have conveyed that information to him? A.\u2014No.\nQ.\u2014Is that right? A.\u2014That is right.\nQ.\u2014He could not have found it out if he had known all about Wallace\u2019s profit? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014He could not have told you were getting anything and he could not have told Doran was getting anything? A.\u2014I cannot tell you.\nQ.\u2014You cannot tell that then when you did get something, Mr. Fullerton, why did you not disclose it to your friends and associates? A.\u2014I am not much in the habit of disclosing to my friends and associates what my deals are or what was done.\nQ.\u2014I mean your associates in this particular deal\u2014why did you not disclose it? A.\u2014I did not disclose it but I have no particular reason except that I am rather reticent about my business and I did not intend to disclose it at that time.\nQ.\u2014Now, Mr. Fullerton, on the 18th Sept. when all the checks were spread out before you and when apparently Mr. Crawford had all this time information for the $11,000 cheque was there, now why\u2014come to the time when he knew about the $11,000 odd cheque\u2014it was there before you? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014And Mr. Crawford said \u201cMr. Fullerton and Mr. Doran are you getting any share of that?\u201d A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014And you heard Mr. Wallace say that he would not say how he had distributed it, that that was his own business, do you remember that? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Why did you not then say you got a part of it? A.\u2014Because I was calling a meeting of the company I intended calling a meeting of the company and intended to make disclosure there in regard to the whole matter and I knew that Mr. Crawford was seeking information at that time for the purpose of his suit, and I did not intend to give it until I called my own meeting.\nQ.\u2014You did not intend to give it? A.\u2014Until I called my own meeting. That was absolutely the reason why. Mr. Crawford had written me a letter in which he had demanded $1,500 on the belief and sole belief that he was considering whether to bring an action against me in the partnership or on the other, and I did not propose to assist him at that meeting if I could avoid it.\nFullerton and Doran, as directors and officials of the company, were under a duty to the company and to the shareholders as a body to see that the fullest information was laid before the shareholders regarding the transactions under review at the meeting of the 4th November Cook v. Deeks[22]. It is regrettable that no effort was made to perform this duty; that these gentlemen considered themselves entitled to act within the spirit of the communications and the evidence just set out; and that the members represented by proxy at the meeting of November 4th seem to have remained in ignorance of the facts to the very end. In these circumstances I think the resolution of the 4th November cannot be treated as satisfactory evidence that a majority of the shareholders with knowledge of the facts approved these transactions of which Fullerton and Doran were the beneficiaries: Cook v. Deeks[23]; Pacific Coast Coal Mines v. Arbuthnot[24].\nAs to Crawford\u2019s right to maintain these proceedings. The status of a single shareholder to attack an ultra vires proceeding is, as a rule, unquestionable, in the absence of evidence disclosing conduct making it unjust that he should be permitted to go forward with his attack.\nAs regards the Doran commission: It is not, I think, seriously argued that Crawford did anything to preclude him from impeaching that payment.\nAs regards the sum given by Wallace to Doran I have heard no suggestion requiring discussion pointing to any conduct of Crawford\u2019s precluding him from taking steps to impeach that.\nAs to the sum received by Fullerton from Wallace. It is now said, 1st, that Crawford knew of the distribution of the Wallace profit from the beginning, and 2nd, that in March, 1914, he wrote a letter to Fullerton calling upon him to account for the sum received from Wallace as part of the partnership proceeds and that this last mentioned act constituted such a participation in the conduct of Fullerton as to make it inequitable and contrary to justice to permit Crawford now to complain of it.\nIt is necessary to keep clearly in view two things, 1st, that the moneys in question, as I have already said, in Fullerton\u2019s hands constituted an asset of the company; 2nd, that the general rule is that a single shareholder is entitled to impeach an ultra vires or illegal act of a company without using the name of the company subject to the qualification that the right of a single shareholder to proceed where the majority refuse to allow the name of the company to be used, in such case rests upon the proposition that justice requires the sanction of the proceeding. Russell v. Wakefield Waterworks Co.[25], at page 480.\nIt follows of course that if in a particular case it would be unjust to permit a single shareholder to take a proceeding, the right is denied him and virtually the point to be determined at this stage is this: In view of the circumstances mentioned would it be unjust to permit Crawford to maintain the action? Consider the conduct of Fullerton as disclosed by the communications and the evidence above referred to; he was a promoter, not technically merely but actively engaged in soliciting subscriptions and support from all quarters. He deliberately and with set policy withheld the fact that he was making a substantial profit out of the promotion. This fact he withheld until at the very last he was virtually forced to disclose it. He says that as late as September, 1914, Crawford was searching for information to enable him to take proceedings and that he was resisiting his attempts to get it.\nCrawford, as the learned trial judge found, understood that Wallace was making a profit at a comparatively early stage, but the evidence of Fullerton read with that of Crawford is convincing upon the point that as regards Fullerton and Doran, Crawford had nothing more than a suspicion down to the middle of 1914, and Crawford\u2019s explanation of the letter, namely, that it was written with the object of getting information is virtually accepted by Fullerton himself.\nCrawford\u2019s delay in actively pressing his inquiries may perhaps be accounted for by the fact that it was only after the dissolution of the partnership with Fullerton that he decided to press his claim; but in truth it is hardly disputable that until months after the dissolution Crawford was not in possession of information which would have justified him in charging Fullerton and Doran with participating in Wallace\u2019s profit. This is evident from Crawford\u2019s own course and is virtually asserted by Fullerton himself. And when one considers the course of conduct deliberately pursued by Fullerton and Doran, the persistent determination to conceal the facts touching their relations with Wallace and the actual destination of the profit derived by Wallace from the sale to the syndicate, it seems an extreme view that by writing the letter of March, a letter which was never acted upon, which affected nobody\u2019s conduct, nobody\u2019s rights or interests, Crawford was doing something making it unjust that he should institute legal proceedings to compel these fiduciaries to account to the shareholders for the property of the shareholders in their hands.\nIt should be noted perhaps at this point that the trial judge in declining to accept Crawford\u2019s testimony to the effect that he did not know the price at which Wallace bought, acquits him of any intention to misstate the facts.\nThe question for disposition here has little analogy to that which arose in Towers v. African Tug Co.[26], where an action was brought by a shareholder against directors seeking to hold them responsible for moneys distributed among the shareholders which were not available for distribution. The shareholder who was plaintiff in that action had received his share of these moneys knowing the facts and brought the action with the proceeds of the distribution in his pocket; in other words, he had made himself a party to\u2014he had participated in\u2014the very act he was complaining of Crawford, on the other hand, received nothing and moreover did nothing which could have precluded him from saying to Fullerton, if in response to his letter Fullerton had offered to divide his profit with him\u2014the money is not yours to divide.\nIn Towers\u2019 Case26, each one of the Lords Justices dwells upon the fact that when the action was brought and when it was tried Towers still had in his pocket his share of the proceeds of the ultra vires act of which he was complaining. Vaughan-Williams L.J. at page 565; Stirling L.J. at page 569; Cozens-Hardy L.J. at page 572. Moreover, the transaction in Towers\u2019 Case26, was not impugned as a transaction in which directors or trustees had tried to benefit themselves at the expense of their co-adventurers; it was a case in which there had been an equal distribution among shareholders, by the consent of every one of them, of a small part of the company\u2019s capital not legally distributable; and the Lords Justices (see especially Lord Justice Sterling at page 570) emphasize the fact that no one had ascribed fraud or dishonesty to anybody concerned in the distribution.\nThere is another and fatal objection to the contention of the appellants on this point and that is that it is not raised in the pleadings as originally framed, nor by any amendment, nor is there anything in the course of the proceedings at the trial to justify the inference that the pleadings were treated as amended in such a way as to make this defence available. The cross-examination by counsel for the defendants was, after repeated objections, allowed to proceed in deference to the contention that Crawford\u2019s conduct, with regard to all these matters, was material on the question of credit and the cross-examination of Fullerton proceeded on much the same lines. The point now contended for, namely, that the letter of March plus the delay was an act precluding Crawford from taking these proceedings, is not noted in the judgment of the trial judge who, it is to be observed, deals with the issue raised by the allegation in the defence\u2014the narrow issue raised by paragraph 10 of Fullerton\u2019s defence and paragraph 4 of Doran\u2019s defence\u2014that Crawford knew that Wallace had made a profit. The trial judge deals with this issue and finds that Crawford became aware of this profit having been made. He also deals specifically with the defence set up in answer to another claim, a claim in relation to the moneys distributed as profits, the defence that, having received his share, he was precluded, under the authority of Towers\u2019 Case[27], from disputing the regularity of the distribution. He deals with this and gives effect to the defence, but there is not a word in his judgment from the beginning to the end countenancing the idea that any such defence as that I am now considering was put before him. There are, moreover, discussions reported in the appeal book which seem to shew affirmatively that this defence, if it was in view, was never in any way put forward at the trial. I refer specifically to two examples only of this At page 171 the following occurs:\u2014\nQ.\u2014If Mr. Doran pledges his positive oath against your uncertain memory of other matters that that conversation did take place, will you undertake to contradict him? A.\u2014I certainly will. I asked particularly about that commission at the meeting in September. I did not know then about the commission.\nMr. McMaster: Surely my Lord, the right to commission does not turn on his knowledge or lack of knowledge. Surely this is wasting a lot of time\u2014his knowing has nothing to do with Doran\u2019s right to take commission.\nMr. Dewart: It is a matter of his right to take commission of 5%. It may have an important bearing on the evidence we will offer, my Lord.\nIf the defence I am now discussing was to be relied upon it is quite impossible to suppose that this colloquy could have taken place in these words.\nAgain at pages 340 and 341 there is the following:\u2014\nHis Lordship: I might say to counsel frankly, my own idea is that all that long discussion and great conflict of testimony in regard to what was done, and what was not done, and various things of notice to Mr. Crawford, makes no difference. I think that the subject\u2014I am not giving judgment, understand, at all, by any means, and I am entirely prepared to hear what everybody has to say, and I may be entirely wrong, but my present view is these moneys were promotion moneys and these people were originally in the position of having received promotion moneys and were promoters and that it all becomes a question, the whole question comes down to the effect of what we have been recently discussing. Now, as to the subject of ratification, that is on that original part, that is my view\u2014I do not want at all to interfere with your elaborating just as fully as you choose for the benefit of any court of appeal, on the different view.\nMr. Rowell: Of course, as the whole matter has been raised in issue, we want to get all the facts in this connection with the transaction.\nHis Lordship: I am not interfering in any way.\nMr. Rowell: That is my only reason for mentioning now, until we get in the contents of this note book, and have Mrs. Dack called, I cannot ask Mr. Fullerton in reference to a point I want to ask him.\nMr. McMaster: What I mean, is the great conflict there was whether Mr. Crawford knew that Mr. Wallace was getting something\u2014now how can it effect this case against the other two directors whether he did know that or did not know it? Just simply I want to get through with the case as early as possible, that is all.\nMr. Dewart: The evidence directs itself solely to a different branch than that. If the defence of knowledge of the Fullerton and Doran participation and condonation of that was to be raised in this court (the defence not having been pleaded) it should have been specifically brought forward at this point.\nIt is not the practice of this court to allow an appellant to reinforce his hand with cards he has hitherto been concealing in some part of his habiliments.\nThe defence, as one would expect, is not referred to in any of the judgments of any of the learned judges of the Appellate Division.\nIt should be added that the status of the respondents to maintain the proceedings rests upon two grounds, 1st, the illegality of the proceedings of the 4th November 2nd, a recognized exception to the rule that the company is the only proper plaintiff in an action to recover company property is that where misconduct on the part of the company and one or more of its officers is to be investigated the arm of the law is not stayed by the rule. Cockburn v. Newbridge Sanitary Steam Laundry Co.[28], at page 258; Cook v. Deeks[29].\nFor these reasons the appeal should, in my judgment, be dismissed with costs\nANGLIN J.\u2014As the syndicate acquired the Bicknell property merely to hold it pending the incorporation of the projected company and its members became shareholders in that company in proportion to their respective interests in the syndicate, I do not distinguish between rights of the company and rights of the syndicate.\nAt the outset I should state that I entertain no doubt that upon the receipt by the defendants, Fullerton and Doran, of their shares in the Wallace profit liability to account for them to the company immediately arose. Archer\u2019s Case[30].\nBut it is not so clear that this is one of the exceptional cases, referred to in Towers v. African Tug Co.,[31] in which a single shareholder, suing on behalf of himself and of shareholders other than the defendants, may, against the will of the majority, assert a right of the company to recover its property and compel its enforcement (Lindley on Companies, 6 ed., 779, 781; Buckley on Companies, (1909) 612-14), or that the plaintiff in this action had not disqualified himself from maintaining it. On this branch of the case I find it necessary to pass definitely only upon the latter question.\nThe learned trial judge expressly found, contrary to the testimony of the plaintiff Crawford, that he was fully apprised of the profit made by Wallace on the sale to Fullerton as trustee for the syndicate, adding, however, that neither he nor any of the subscribers of the syndicate were aware of the division of that profit with Fullerton and Doran. A study of the evidence, all of which I have found it necessary to read with care, has satisfied me that little reliance can be placed on the plaintiff\u2019s testimony. His cross-examination is most unsatisfactory. His witness, Eaton, seems to be even less reliable; and there is practically no other corroboration of the plaintiff\u2019s story on controverted points. The evidence of Fullerton and Doran, while not entirely satisfactory, is, in my opinion, much more reliable than that of Crawford.\nWhile Crawford may not have known of the actual payments by Wallace to Fullerton and Doran at the time they were made, with great respect I think the evidence leaves no room for any real doubt that he knew at a comparatively early date that the defendant Fullerton had shared in Wallace\u2019s profit and I cannot believe that he remained long in ignorance of the actual division made of it. His reiterated statement that Fullerton had told him from the first that he (Fullerton) was the real purchaser from Bicknell and that he had taken the agreement to purchase in Wallace\u2019s name merely to escape liability on covenants, coupled with his letter of the 13th of March, 1914, in my opinion puts Crawford\u2019s knowledge as to Fullerton\u2019s share beyond question His admitted knowledge that Doran had furnished one-third of the deposit of $2,500 made by Wallace with Bicknell to secure the property, another one-third of it having been obtained from one Boehm (Bicknell\u2019s agent for sale), and his familiarity with all the details of the purchase by Wallace, of his sale to Fullerton as trustee, of the formation of the syndicate and of the incorporation and organization of the defendant company, which I think the evidence establishes, warrant the inference that he also knew of Doran\u2019s receipt of one-third of the Wallace profit. With that knowledge he determined to treat the $3,877.20 received by Fullerton as money properly obtained by him for which he should account as partnership assets of the firm of Fullerton and Crawford. By his letter of the 13th of March, 1914, he distinctly demanded from Fullerton an accounting \u201cunder our partnership\u201d of the \u201cmoneys received (by him) from Mr. Edwin Wallace in connection with the purchase of Bathurst Centre\u201d\u2014the property in question. That, in my opinion, amounted to such acquiescence in the receipt by Wallace of the profit on the sale to the syndicate and its distribution between himself, Fullerton and Doran, that the plaintiff is disqualified from complaining of it individually; and he cannot get any greater right of complaint because his action is in form an action by himself and all the other shareholders of the company. In fact, he must succeed by his own merits and not by the merits of the other shareholders.\nTowers v. African Tug Co.[32], at page 572, per Cozens-Hardy L.J.\nOn this ground the action, in my opinion, fails as to the two sums of $3,877.20 each claimed respectively from Fullerton and Doran.\nMoreover, the receipt by Fullerton and Doran from Wallace of part of the latter\u2019s profit\u2014their sharing that profit with him on the understanding which the learned trial judge found had existed from the inception of the project\u2014was neither something which it was ultra vires of the company to sanction, nor something in se illegal and therefore not susceptible of ratification by the shareholders. It was not within the \u201cSecret Commissions Act\u201d (8 & 9 Edw. VII. (D) ch. 33, sec. 3), because not accepted or obtained corruptly. Had the Wallace profit, and the interest of Fullerton and Doran in it, been fully disclosed to the shareholders from the first its payment and distribution could not have been successfully challenged. It was the concealment and secrecy of the payments to Fullerton and Doran that made them fraudulent against the company and entitled it to recover them back. Shipway v. Broadwood[33], at page 373, per Chitty L.J. Viewed as a fraud on it carried out by a breach of duty on the part of the defendants Fullerton and Doran, who occupied a fiduciary position in regard to it, the company had the option to elect to ratify what had been done or to demand an accounting from Fullerton and Doran.\nThere is not a little to indicate that a majority of the shareholders not in anywise implicated or interested in the payments to Wallace, Fullerton and Doran have been prepared to ratify those payments and are opposed to the plaintiff\u2019s attempt to compel Fullerton and Doran to account to the company for their shares. The shareholders\u2019 meeting of the 4th of November, 1914, appears to have been fairly called. From the plaintiff himself and in the directors\u2019 notice calling the meeting they had received full information of the transactions of which he complains and of which their sanction and approval were sought. The defendants, Fullerton and Doran, made the mistake, however, of allowing proxies procured for an earlier meeting, held in September to be used in the voting of the 4th of November. When those proxies were given it is not at all clear that the shareholders had been fully apprised of the payments to Doran and Fullerton now in question. Although Crawford had notified them in a circular letter of the 4th of July that there had been \u201ca secret profit of $11,601.75 made by some of the promoters of the syndicate,\u201d it was only in his circular letter to them of October 23rd that he distinctly charged Fullerton and Doran with having in this way obtained $3,867.20, each, and Doran with having been paid $8,121 as a commission. With that knowledge, however, the shareholders who had given proxies in a most general form to Fullerton, Doran and Ruckle apparently allowed them to stand unrevoked and available for use at the November meeting called expressly to ratify and confirm these payments. While, under these circumstances, there is not a little to be said for the view that they intended to have their votes recorded in support of the proposition made by the directors in the notice calling the meeting of the 4th of November, on the whole, apart from any question to which the impairment of capital then existing gives rise, I think it would not be safe to treat what occurred there as a sufficiently certain expression of the views of shareholders whose votes were cast under the September proxies. Pacific Coast Coal Mines Co. v. Arbuthnot[34].\nBut for this difficulty in regard to the votes cast by proxies, in the absence of any ground to question the good faith of the action of the majority in sanctioning and approving what had been done, the right of a minority shareholder to maintain this action to compel repayment to the company\u2014to recover its property\u2014to enforce its rights\u2014would be at least questionable. The corporation is prim\u00e2 facie the only proper plaintiff in such an action. Had the use made of the proxies at the November meeting been beyond suspicion, this would not appear to be one of the exceptional cases in which a dissentient shareholder should be permitted to exercise the company\u2019s right against the will of the majority\u2014cases which, to quote Sir George Jessel\u2019s observation in Russell v. Wakefield Water Works[35], cited by Stirling L.J. in the Towers Case[36],\nturn very much on the necessity of the case; and that is the necessity for the court doing justice.\nI rest my judgment for the defendants on this branch of the case, however, on the plaintiff\u2019s disqualification to maintain the action.\nThe $8,121.22 paid to the defendant Doran as a commission on the very advantageous sale of the company\u2019s property to Robins, Limited, undoubtedly effected by him, stands on a different footing. While there was some delay after the plaintiff had knowledge of the actual payment to Doran in bringing this action and he accepted a dividend which he knew had been recommended and passed on the basis that it represented a balance divisible amongst shareholders after payment of the outstanding unsecured liabilities of the company, including a commission on the sale to Robins, Limited, there is not in regard to this item the evidence of unequivocal acquiescence which the plaintiffs letter of the 13th of March, 1914, affords as to the distribution of the Wallace profit. I therefore prefer not to rest my judgment in regard to it on personal disqualification of the plaintiff by acquiescence.\nThe reasonableness of the amount paid, if Doran was entitled to a commission, is not questioned and I find nothing to justify the suggestion that either his employment or the payment to him was in any sense secret or surreptitious. On the contrary, the fair inference from the evidence is that all who were interested in the company including the plaintiff, knew that upon the lapse of the Sorley option the sale of the property was placed in the hands of Doran, whose business was real estate brokerage. The suggestion now made that he negotiated the sale as the general manager of the company acting without remuneration, is one which I cannot accept. His expenditure out of his own pocket in endeavouring to effect the sale is utterly inconsistent with any such view of the footing on which he was proceeding.\nThe objections made to the payment of this commission are that since Doran was a director of the company any payment to him must, under section 92 of the Ontario \u201cCompanies Act,\u201d be authorized by a by-law confirmed by a general meeting of the shareholders; that it was not proved that he was employed to make the sale; and that the payment to him was made out of capital.\nThe commission was not paid to Doran as a director of the company, but as an agent employed by it to sell its property. I think such a payment does not fall within section 92 of the Ontario \u201cCompanies Act.\u201d I agree with the view expressed by Middleton J. in Re Matthew Guy Carriage and Automobile Co.[37], at page 379, that this section does not extend to a payment to a director at the ordinary market price for a service rendered by him in his capacity of a mere employee of the company. After reviewing the authorities in Canada Bonded Attorney and Legal Directory Co. v. Leonard-Parmiter Co.[38], Mr. Justice Riddell, dealing with section 92, says, at page 144:\u2014\nThere is no reason, however, why one who happens to be a director should not serve the company in another capacity, as servant, clerk, bookkeeper, mechanic, etc., and receive reasonable remuneration therefor. It is of course the duty of every director, a duty which he owes to his company and to the other shareholders, to see to it that he does not receive too great a remuneration for such service as he does render.\nIf the services are such that only a director can perform them, e.g., attending board meetings or acting in other regards as a director, he can recover compensation, payment for such services, only by complying with the statute; but, if he is employed in a subordinate capacity and at a reasonable figure, there is no necessity for a by-law confirmed at a general meeting.\nFerguson J.A. concurred in this judgment; Rose J. while differing on some of the facts, concurred in Mr. Justice Riddell\u2019s statement of the law; and Lennox J. concurred with Rose J. I think a by-law was not necessary to authorize the defendant Doran to act as agent of the company for the sale of its lands. Nor was a by-law confirmed by a general meeting required to authorize his being paid for services rendered in that subordinate capacity. They were not services rendered in the government of the company. Mackenzie v. Maple Mountain Co.[39], at page 621, per Meredith J.A. Mr. Justice Rose summarizes the evidence on this branch of the case\u2014very fairly, if I may be permitted to say so\u2014as follows:\u2014\nMr. Doran swore, and Mr. Fullerton\u2019s evidence seems to support his statement, that it was understood amongst the directors that he should not be given a regular salary for acting as vice-president and general manager, but should have the opportunity of finding a purchaser for the land and, if he succeeded, should be paid the usual land agent\u2019s commission, and should accept that as his \u201crecompense\u201d for performing the duties of his office.\nAt a meeting of shareholders, he was instructed, informally, to endeavour to find a purchaser. He did make a sale, and he managed to induce the purchasers to add to the price first offered by them, which price some, at least, of the shareholders and directors were in favour of accepting, a sum practically equivalent to the amount of the commission; and apparently, all the members who knew about the matter were content. It was paid and the question is whether there was legal authority for paying it.\nAt the meeting which was held on May 29th, 1914, and which seems to have been a directors\u2019 meeting, although the minutes called it a meeting of the company, the secretary\u2011treasurer is reported to have put in a statement of liabilities shewing the solicitor\u2019s charges in connection with the sale, a commission to Doran of $8,121.22, small sums for fees of the several directors, and a small salary to the secretary-treasurer. The statement ended with the following memorandum:\nThe amount at present in the bank is $45,014.48. The disbursements as above are $8,829.22, which will enable us to pay a dividend of 57% and leave the balance in the bank of $161.76 to the credit of the company.\nResolutions were passed that the directors be paid $10.00 per meeting for meetings attended by them; that the secretary be allowed the sum mentioned in the statement as owing to him; and that a dividend of 57% be declared and be paid to the shareholders forthwith. On the same day cheques were issued for the commission and for the dividend.\nThere was no resolution referring to the commission or to the solicitor\u2019s charges.\nWhile there is no doubt a lack of proof of a by-law or resolution formally authorizing Doran to act as the company\u2019s selling agent, the impression left on my mind by the whole of the evidence bearing on this issue is that he was authorized at the shareholders\u2019 meeting of the 27th of March, 1914, at which Crawford admits he was present, to sell the company\u2019s property as a real estate broker on commission, and that acting on that authorization he proceeded in good faith to procure and did procure a purchaser for the lands at an advantageous price. While the absence of a minute of this action of the shareholders affords ground for adverse comment, it by no means conclusively establishes that Doran was not in fact so authorized. Bartlett v. Bartlett Mines Co.[40]; In re Fireproof Doors Co.[41] I accept Doran\u2019s uncontradicted statement, partly corroborated by Fullerton\u2019s testimony, that he was. The company had the benefit of what he did and was, in my opinion, liable to him for a commission. Doran\u2019s employment as selling agent being established, the amount of the commission paid him is readily defensible on a quantum meruit basis.\nI incline to think that it was only because they deemed it unnecessary to do so that the directors did not at their meeting of the 29th of May, 1914, pass a formal resolution for the payment to Doran of his commission of $8,121.22. Payment of the item for solicitor\u2019s charges shewn in the secretary-treasurer\u2019s statement submitted to the meeting was likewise not covered by any specific resolution. That statement admittedly shewed this commission as an outstanding liability of the company and it was on the footing of its being paid that it proceeded to indicate that there would be enough money left in the bank to warrant a distribution of 57% of the amount of the company\u2019s capital as a dividend amongst the shareholders\u2014leaving $161.76 still in bank to the credit of the company. It was on that statement, as the minutes shew, that the directors resolved to pay the 57% dividend. I have no doubt (as Masten J., Meredith C.J.C.P. and Lennox J. appear to have thought) that it was intended at this meeting to recognize the Doran commission claim as a liability of the company and to authorize its payment. Otherwise the dividend there directed to be paid would have been not 57% but 69%. The purpose was to act on the memorandum submitted by the secretary-treasurer and to leave in bank the comparatively insignificant sum of $161.76 to meet current petty expenses\u2014not $8,300. The $8,121.22 was paid to Doran on the same day (May 29th, 1914) by the company\u2019s cheque, signed by J.A. Murray, president and Jas. S. Fullerton, secretary-treasurer and it is reasonable to assume that this payment preceded the payment of the 57% dividend. If so, the capital was intact when and after it was made and, however irregularly made, it was not ultra vires of the company.\nWhat I have said as to the proceedings at the shareholders\u2019 meeting of the 4th of November applies to this branch of the case. While upon the whole evidence I have little doubt that the majority of the shareholders approved of the payment of a 5% commission to Doran and would have ratified and confirmed the action of the directors in making it, the uncertainity as to the use at the November meeting of the September proxies having been quite legitimate prevents the resolutions passed at it from being given whatever effect they might otherwise have had. But without the aid of this attempted ratification, the payment of the commission to Doran may be upheld as the liquidation of an honest debt by the company which it was within the authority of its officers to make.\nNo one suggests any fraud or dishonesty on the part either of Doran or of the directors. All that was done; if done regularly, would not have afforded a scintilla of ground for complaint. Mistakes may have been made and foolish courses adopted; but fraudulent intent has not been established.\nI would, for these reasons, allow this appeal with costs here and in the Appellate Division and would dismiss the action with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014This appeal should be allowed and I concur with my brother Idington.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants Fullerton and the Doran Estate: Hugh J.

When the latter was seventy-five or one hundred feet away the motorman, without a signal from the conductor, started to cross. When half way over the power was increased, the car went forward with a jerk and two ladies at the rear end were either thrown or jumped off and falling on the diamond were killed by the train. In an action against the Electric Ry. Co. and the Canadian Northern Ry. Co. by the husband of one of the victims:\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal (29 Man. R. 91), that the motorman was guilty of negligence in crossing under these conditions and the Electric Company was liable.\nHeld also, reversing said judgment, Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that the Canadian Northern Ry. Co. was likewise liable; that on approaching the crossing it was the duty of the employees to exercise great caution; that it was shewn that the train was travelling slowly and could have been stopped in time if the train hands had acted promptly; that failing to stop when the situation of danger arose was negligence, and the fact that the manner in which the accident happened could not reasonably have been anticipated was of no importance and the further fact that but for the negligence of the Electric Ry. Co. the deceased would not have been killed no excuse.\nHeld per Duff J.\u2014The respondent company was obliged to take precautions to obviate the risk of harming passengers in the electric car and the wrongful neglect of that duty having directly caused the harm the question of remoteness of damages cannot arise. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], affirming the judgment at the trial against the Electric Company and in favour of the Canadian Northern Co.\nThe facts are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nThe respondent could have stopped its train in time to avoid the accident which must, therefore, be ascribed to its negligence. See City of Calgary v. Harnovis[2], British Columbia Electric Ry. Co. v. Loach[3].\nO. H. Clarke K.C. for the respondent cited \"The Bywell Castle\"[4], at pages 223 and 227; \"The Tasmania\"[5], at page 226; Weir v. Colmore-Williams[6].\nTilley K.C. for the appellant.\nO. H. Clarke K.C. for the respondent.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014This is a remarkable appeal. The appellant, and the Canadian Northern Railway Company, which I shall for brevity's sake hereinafter designate respectively the \"Electric Railway\" and \"Steam Railway,\" were sued for damages arising from the death of the wife of the respondent administrator, alleged herein to have been caused by the negligence of both or one of the said railway companies at a point where their respective tracks cross each other in Winnipeg.\nThe declarations of the plaintiff therein alleged sufficient to constitute grounds of action which might render both or only one of said companies liable. And the defendants each by its pleading not only denied the allegations made in the declaration as against itself but also alleged contributory negligence on the part of the deceased.\nThe plaintiff in reply denied each of these allegations of contributory negligence and joined issue.\nThe defendants each agreed with plaintiff before the trial that he was entitled to a verdict for $6,000 and $300 costs and reduced this to writing. The respective counsel for plaintiff and defendants at the opening of the trial announced the fact of settlement and the disposition of the case made thereby, and that there was nothing to be tried except this subsidiary question of whether or not either defendant was solely to blame or they were both liable.\nNo amendment of pleadings was made and nothing definitely settled in that regard.\nInasmuch as each of the companies in its pleading had carefully abstained from alleging anything against the other, how can we hold this an appealable case?\nIf the case had proceeded in the usual way of the plaintiff proving, or attempting to prove, his case then there might have arisen incidentally thereto ample grounds for adducing evidence, which would have disposed of such an incidental issue, but how there can be said to have been a trial of that sort of case made, I am unable to see.\nTo make matters worse the settlement agreement, which one of counsel said would be filed, is neither printed in the case presented to us, nor to be found in the record.\nThe novelty and difficulty of such a situation seems to have occurred to the learned trial judge, and respective counsel for each of the companies. The following seems to cover all that there is in the final result of the discussion:\u2014\nMr. Clark: It would be better for us to have this understanding that neither party be bound by the pleadings in this case, because practically a new issue has arisen now.\nHis Lordship: I do not see why you should not leave the pleadings as they stand, subject to any amendments you may suggest, because I cannot try the case without any pleadings.\nMr. Clark: Then we will go on, it being understood that neither party will hold the other down to the pleadings.\nMr. Guy: I would very much prefer that the Canadian Northern Railway Company put in their evidence first. When the question of the settlement was discussed, there was a question as to which one would put in his evidence first.\nMr. Clark: I was not present then.\nMr. Guy: And the question was left open.\nHis Lordship: Is it material? You are both defendants.\nMr. Guy: We were not in a position to have an examination for discovery, and in order for me to proceed, it may be necessary for me to prove my case by calling employees of the Canadian Northern Railway Company, and I do not want to do that and be bound by their evidence.\nHis Lordship: They are in the same position.\nMr. Guy: Yes, but I don't think their case is affected in the same way as our case is.\nHis Lordship: I think you had better proceed with the evidence and do the best you can. It is a very unusual kind of a case, and we are dealing with it in an unusual manner.\nSo far as I can find there was no amendment of any kind to the record of pleadings.\nThe formal judgment gave the plaintiff a recovery of $6,300 against the Winnipeg Electric Company, and then dismissed the action as against the Canadian Northern Railway Company, and awarded the latter as against the former its costs of this action.\nI regret the actual situation I have thus outlined was not presented to us or present to my mind intent on hearing what counsel had to say.\nI am so much impressed with the nature of such a trial of an issue not raised by the pleadings being one by a court chosen by the parties as persona designata and hence non-appealable, that if I could come to the conclusion that both courts below upon what was tried have erred in mere concurrent finding of the facts, I should have desired to hear argument on the question before so determining.\nI have considered all that was argued as to the facts and relevant law.\nI am, after reading not only all that we are referred to, but also much more of the evidence, unable to see wherein the courts below can properly and judicially be now held to have erred.\nAs quite natural in such an extraordinary and shocking exhibition of foolhardy conduct on the part of the man in charge of the car that ventured to cross under the circumstances presented, the witnesses were liable from mere excitement, and haste due thereto, to give inaccurate and unreliable estimates of distances.\nOne can pick out, if he discards all else, quite enough in the evidence to constitute grounds for holding the steam railway company not only liable but also solely liable.\nAny such conclusion would seem to disregard the impressions of fact which a great many people, no doubt better placed than we are to appreciate the local situation and hence be probably seized of the right view of the facts, would receive.\nIt appears on the case before us that several duly constituted authorities had acted in a way quite contrary to what one would \"expect if the \"Steam Railway\" Company was alone to blame.\nAnd then we have in accord with the action of these other authorities a view taken by the learned trial judge of the facts presented to him at the trial for which there is ample ground and that maintained by a court of appeal consisting of three judges, all from local knowledge of the situation having an advantage over us, unanimously concurring in the finding.\nI cannot, without anything conclusive and uncontradicted to guide me, save in one particular which I am about to refer to, reverse such a finding, which ought not to be controlled any more than the verdict of a jury, by us here unless we can find undisputed facts and circumstances which beyond reasonable doubt would demonstrate error on the part of those making such concurrent findings.\nThe fact that appellant's argument is made only to turn upon its view of a very narrow margin of time and space, ascertained from guesses of fact, makes one pause.\nI have been unable to find from which side of the electric car the deceased jumped or was thrown, and yet that fact alone, if I apply experience and common sense, would make a possible difference in what we are asked to deal with of ten or twelve feet.\nNobody at the trial, I venture to think, deemed that the issue could reasonably be decided upon a calculation or finding of such a narrow nature as it is to be herein unless upon our holding that every car in the \"Steam Railway\" train must, by law, be linked up by the air brakes and the use thereof applied with the utmost celerity on pain of those applying them being possibly held liable to conviction of a charge of manslaughter in such events as presented herein.\nAs to the engineer acting upon the signal given him by his brakesman, I accept his story and as between two statements prefer his to that of the brakesman who was placed in a distressing situation, which probably accounts for the evident doubts, inaccuracies and inconsistencies that exist in his evidence.\nThe only conflict pressed herein was whether or not the engineer acted on the first emergency signal given, or the second a few seconds later. The engineer swears he was looking and acted promptly. He knows probably better than a brakesman what time is necessarily lost in the operation.\nThe section 264, sub-section 3 of the \"Railway Act\" then in force, reads as follows:\u2014\n3. There shall also be such a number of cars in every train equipped with power or train brakes that the engineer on the locomotive drawing such train can control its speed, or bring the train to a stop in the quickest and best manner possible, without requiring brakesmen to use the common hand brake for that purpose.\nThen follows sub-section 4 which renders it imperative to have, in the case of passenger trains, a continuous system of brakes applied to the whole train capable of being applied by engineer or brakesman instantly.\nIt seems the connection in the case in question was only between the engine and tender which those in charge had deemed sufficient for the service which was to be performed.\nThe witnesses explain why, in the shunting operations, on which they had been engaged, it was deemed impracticable to have brakes on each car to be shunted connected with the tender.\nThere is a discretion evidently permissible under the Act in that regard. And the weight of the evidence clearly is that so far as concerned the train in question running at the slow rate it was, the said method adopted herein of bringing into effect the air brake was usually sufficient.\nThe test of highest possible efficiency and results known to be got therefrom, as testified to by an expert, does not seem to me a fair one or such as the statute imperatively requires in such circumstances as in question.\nEach case must be determined upon the circumstances in question as to how far beyond the connection of the air brake with the tender its connection is to be extended and to be made with the other cars, and may be reasonably necessary.\nThe courts below have held that the connection adopted was in this case sufficient for the required efficient service being performed with such a train. I am unable to say they erred.\nIt is to be observed that though citing the decision in the case of Muma v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[7], the Court of Appeal does not rest upon that but upon the result of applying the facts in question herein.\nI may point out that the decision in the Muma Case (1), proceeded upon the \"Railway Act\" when in this regard different from that now in question. The Act has been so amended as to make the law in question much clearer.\nThe rigid enforcement of the statute, or any other statute designed to protect life and property, I hold to be imperative. But reason must be applied and when it comes to a minute calculation of how many, or few, feet and seconds are involved in the application of the law we must decide reasonably.\nFifteen seconds was the guess of one man as to the time involved and so many as fifteen feet in falling short of safety in performance is the guess of appellant's argument, and all dependent on the guesses of naturally excited people, unless as to one man who claims he was so cool and collected that he sat still and could by the eye measure, when looking from a moving car crossing at right angles the path of the moving train, its exact distance from his car.\nThe primary gross negligence of the appellant as the causa causans of that which is complained of, and in the circumstances was the natural consequence, is unrelieved by the interposition of independent responsible human action, and is all too obvious to be swept aside by any such guesses if the appellant is not to be allowed to escape having justice meted out to it.\nThe same proof of reasoning would lead to absolving both companies on the ground they each set up of contributory negligence, for, as I may repeat, why could not the unfortunate ladies have picked themselves up in four or five of these fifteen seconds of time which they had?\nFor aught we know their necks were broken and they dead already as the result of appellant's car jerking them off.\nAnd if we had to decide this case as against the \"Steam Railway'' we would have to ascertain exactly the measure of damages each company was responsible for.\nThere is no room for joint liability.\nTheir acts were distinctly separate and each responsible for the consequences of its own conduct and dependent in part upon the application of distinctly different principles.\nI need not elaborate this and illustrate how the law has stood at least ever since the case of Davies v. Mann[8], was so long ago decided.\nThe court below does not go further than to find upon the peculiar circumstances in this case that there was no negligence of respondent which led to the accident.\nOn that view of facts I am not able to reverse.\nThis case was one for the application of sound sense and not fine spun theories of what might have been, and I am sure the former was applied and guided the courts below.\nHence I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014This litigation arises out of a most regrettable accident in which the deceased wife of the plaintiff Andrew Jackson Bartlett, was run over by a train of the respondent company and killed. Mrs. Bartlett was a passenger on a car of the Winnipeg Electric Company on Portage Avenue, which crosses the Canadian Northern track. She and two other passengers were thrown from the car on to the railway track in front of a freight train the front truck of which passed over Mrs. Bartlett's body. The surviving husband sued both companies charging both with negligence. The claim was settled but the litigation proceeded for the purpose of determining whether both or only one, and if so which, of the companies was properly chargeable with the negligence that was the real cause of the accident. On the facts the negligence of the Electric Railway Company was not seriously open to dispute. Mr. Justice Galt who tried the action and the Court of Appeal from Manitoba unanimously acquitted the railway company of negligence.\nNegligence or no negligence is of course a question of fact and the two courts have pronounced in favour of the railway company upon that issue. The judgment is therefore one which ought not to be disturbed unless the appellant has clearly established error in some specific matter and error of such importance as to vitiate the conclusion of the courts below. Careful judgments were delivered by Galt J. and by the Chief Justice of Manitoba in Court of Appeal. I have examined these judgments closely and, with very great respect, I am unable to escape the conclusion that they cannot be sustained.\nPortage Avenue is a much used thoroughfare traversed as already mentioned by an electric car line. As the Canadian Northern train which was made up of a number of cars preceding and a number of cars following a locomotive approached this street, it was the duty of those in charge of the train to exercise great caution and particularly to be on the alert for the perception of any dangerous situation which might arise as the train reached the street car track. There is a rule of the railway company governing this crossing requiring trains to stop at least one hundred feet before reaching the Winnipeg Electric Company's tracks and requiring them not to proceed until a proper signal is received from the signalman or from one of the train crew \"located in a proper position\" on the crossing.\nIt is not very material for the purposes of this appeal whether this instruction does or does not strictly apply to a train of this character\u2014which, it is alleged, was engaged in a shunting operation. The instruction is valuable evidence of the view taken by competent persons responsible for the working of trains approaching this crossing as to the kind of precaution necessary to obviate the risks incidental to the running of a train over it.\nThe grounds of Mr. Justice Galt's judgment are indicated in the following passages quoted textually from his reasons:\u2014 When it was about 75 or 100 feet from the crossing, the motorman of the electric car, without having received any signal from the conductor, started his car to get across before the train arrived. As I have said, the situation was perfectly apparent, and some of the people in the car, seeing the freight car coming towards them, got alarmed and moved towards the door at the rear end of the car. Amongst these people were two ladies; one of them was Grace Jane Bartlett, wife of the plaintiff.\nBy the time the electric car reached the diamond crossing the freight train was perhaps within 30 or 40 feet of the car. The evidence (to which I will allude more particularly hereafter) shewed that at this juncture the brakesman, who was stationed on the front freight car, shouted to the motorman to get across. Whether the motorman heard him or not does not appear, but there is evidence that the car, which was ahead in motion, started forward with a jerk and the two ladies either stepped off hurriedly, or were thrown off the rear steps of the car and fell on the diamond crossing. The brakeman on the freight train had already given a violent signal to the engine-driver to stop, but the freight train was not completely stopped before the front truck of the freight car had run over the two ladies and inflicted such injuries upon them that they both died.\n*****\nThen again it was argued that the steam railway was negligent, that the engineer did not apply his emergency brake to the engine soon enough. It is quite possible, and the evidence seems to indicate that the engineer missed the first violent signal given by the brakesman, but the engineer had no reason to expect such a signal and had every reason to suppose that the way was clear.\nAs I read the \"Railway Act\" and the rules and regulations applicable to these defendant companies, I should certainly say that at the time in question the steam railway had the right-of-way across Portage Avenue. Even if it had been otherwise, the action of the motorman of the electric car in approaching the crossing and then stopping operated as an invitation to the engineer of the freight train to continue on his course. The whole trouble was caused by the frantic haste of the motorman to get across the diamond before the freight train.\nThe opinion of the learned judge that the train was about 75 or 100 feet from the crossing is affirmed by the Court of Appeal and is fully supported by the evidence. It does not appear to be necessary for the purpose of deciding the appeal to discuss or to consider any of the earlier incidents. When the motorman was seen by the brakesman to be starting his car across the track, a situation full of grave risk arose if the train were not stopped. The brakesman must have realized this if his story is to be accepted because he had already given a signal to stop the train, and he says that in doing so\u2014although he had the rule in mind\u2014 he was also influenced by the fact that he had noticed a car approaching the crossing. Upon seeing the motorman start his car he immediately gave the more vigorous signal used to indicate to the locomotive engineer that an emergency had arisen requiring the instant stopping of the train. It matters little whether one accept the evidence of the brakesman or not, for if he acted as he says he did, he appears to have done his duty, if he did not he was incurring a grave and quite unnecessary risk in not taking instant steps to stop the train upon perceiving that the motorman was about to cross the track. So also as regards the locomotive engineer (if the signal was given) it is of no consequence whether he observed the signal or did not observe it, it was his duty to be on the alert for signals and instantly to obey a signal to stop.\nWith great respect, I think these considerations are not met by the reasoning of the learned trial judge or by that of the Court of Appeal.\nThe learned judges of the Court of Appeal appear to have considered that a dangerous situation requiring special precautions arose for the first time when, in consequence of the violent jerk forward of the Electric Company's car, Mrs. Bartlett was thrown to the ground. That, with respect, appears to be a misconception of the position. The approach by a train of this character towards a much used street having on it a street car line in operation, was in itself a situation involving risk and this, as I have already said, is recognized in the instruction mentioned above. It was a situation requiring in itself exceptional precautions as the instruction shews. Add to that the fact that a street car was on the line approaching the point of intersection and you have a not inconsiderable increase of risk; a situation imperatively demanding that the precaution prescribed by the instruction, namely, of coming to a stop, should not be omitted; and, as I have already said, a situation full of grave possibilities arose and became apparent when the street car was seen to move forward across the track.\nMr. Clark in his concise and able factum faces the difficulty thus:\u2014\nThe appellant's contention amounts to this, that when Cammell saw the street car start to move it should have occurred to him that some of the passengers might fall on the track in front of the train, and his duty to avoid the consequences of the appellant's neglect began then and not when the last dangerous situation actually arose. Admitting that it was the natural thing for passengers in such a critical situation to rush to the front or rear of the car, no one would presume that when jumping they would select the diamond\u2014the only dangerous spot there was upon which to alight. But even assuming that the brakesman should have foreseen what actually took place, the appellants are not entitled to complain if Cammell, who was thrown into a state of excitement by their negligence, did not act in the most reasonable manner.\nThis extract from the respondent's factum puts very forcibly the point upon which the respondent company must rely in view of the findings of fact already referred to. These contentions are first open to the observation\u2014although in the present state of the litigation the controversy has become one between the appellant company and the respondent company\u2014that the decision of that controversy must be dictated by the answer given to the question whether the plaintiff had or had not a cause of action against the respondent company. And it is perhaps needless to say that in passing upon that issue the conduct of the Electric Company's servants is not to be imputed to Mrs. Bartlett as her conduct; and further the situation if it was critical and embarrassing was brought about, at least in part, by the failure to bring the train to a stop conformably to the practice. The substance of the contention is that the persons responsible for the train might reasonably in the exercise of their judgment assume, and act upon the assumption, that the car would clear the railway track before the train reached the point of intersection; and that in the circumstances there was no ground for apprehending that the passengers would leave or be thrown from the car and remain helpless on the track as the train approached them. The first observation to suggest itself is an important one. The onward motion of the train was not the result of the judgment of the brakesman that it was safe to proceed; on the contrary he, as we have seen, took the opposite view. The second is virtually a repetition of what already has been said, namely, that once the electric car started forward the risk of the situation imperatively demanded that the train should be stopped. The fact that in the event the car did clear the track without injury is little to the purpose; failure of the mechanism might have brought it to a standstill before the track was passed. The duty of the respondent company was to take suitable measures to obviate the danger incurred by the passengers of the car of injury from the respondent company's train arising out of the situation, and the fact that the particular manner in which the injury did occur was one not naturally to be anticipated is really of no importance. See Hill v. New River Co.[9]; Clark v. Chambers[10].\nThe obligation to take care, default in respect of which constituted the negligence charged, was an obligation due to the passengers in the car, and that being so, the respondent company is responsible for harm suffered by them in consequence of its default to the extent to which the damages are not, in the language of the law, too remote.\nAre the damages too remote? Was the running down of Mrs. Bartlett in the circumstances a consequence for which in law the respondent company was responsible? The rule as regards remoteness of damage was recently discussed by the President of the Probate and Divorce Division in H. M. S. London[11], and, with respect, I concur in the view there expressed that where the harm in question is the direct and immediate consequence of the negligent act then it is within the ambit of liability. Here the injury complained of was the direct and immediate consequence of the failure to stop the train.\nMoreover, it is sufficient in this case to say that the railway company being under an obligation to take precautions to obviate the risk of harming the passengers in the electric car through the instrumentality of its train moving across the car track and the wrongful neglect of this duty having resulted directly in the very harm it was the duty of the company to avoid, remoteness of damage is out of the question. Clark v. Chambers[12].\nWhere there is a duty to take precautions to obviate a given risk the wrongdoer who fails in this duty cannot avoid responsibility for the very consequences it was his duty to provide against by suggesting that the damages are too remote, because the particular manner in which those consequences came to pass was unusual and not reasonably foreseeable.\nOne aspect of the case was the subject of a good deal of discussion and I refer to it only to make it quite clear that I neither dissent from nor concur in the views expressed by the courts below with regard to it. The point to which I refer is that which arises upon the contention of the Electric Company's counsel that section 264 of the \"Railway Act\" is applicable and that the railway company should be held responsible for failure to observe the requirements of those sections with reference to braking appliances. I express no opinion upon the question whether this section applies to a train such as this.\nAnglin J.\u2014The liability of one or other or both the defendants to the plaintiff being admitted, the purpose of continuing this, litigation is to determine where the responsibility rests, the defendants having agreed amongst themselves for contribution (on some basis with which we are not concerned) should both be held liable. The learned trial judge's view was that the appellant is solely answerable and his judgment was unanimously affirmed on appeal. The evidence so conclusively establishes that its negligence was a cause of the death of the plaintiff's wife that so far as it seeks to be wholly discharged its appeal is quite hopeless. Assuming that due care by its co-defendant would have enabled it to avoid running down the plaintiff's unfortunate wife, notwithstanding the peril in which she had been placed by the appellant's negligence, that fact could afford the latter no answer to the plaintiff's claim. City of Toronto v. Lambert[13]; Algoma Steel Corporation v. Dub\u00e9[14].\nUpon the other question\u2014that of the joint liability of the respondent\u2014there is much more to be said.\nThe learned trial judge could\nfind no particular in respect of which the steam railway company were guilty of any negligence conducing to the accident, and the Court of Appeal took the same view. I gather from his judgment that the learned trial judge was of the opinion that there was no evidence on which a jury could have found actionable negligence on the part of the employees of the steam railway company and in effect so directed himself; and from the reasons for judgment of the Court of Appeal, delivered by the learned Chief Justice of Manitoba, I infer that in his opinion because, the electric tramcar having crossed in safety, the immediate peril to the deceased caused by her jumping or being thrown from that tramcar and falling on the diamond crossing in front of the approaching train was a situation which the steam railway employees could not reasonably have been expected to anticipate and because when it actually arose it was possibly too late to stop the train and prevent the accident, or, at all events, the train crew had little, if any, opportunity to think and act, liability on the part of the steam railway company could not be found. With profound respect, although the idea is not very clearly expressed, these views would seem to imply that the liability of the doer of a negligent act is restricted to consequences which he should have anticipated would flow from it as natural results.\nWhere there is no direct evidence of negligence the question what a reasonable man might foresee is of importance in considering the question whether there is evidence for the jury of negligence or not * * * ; but when it has once been determined that there is evidence of negligence, the person guilty of it is equally liable for its consequences, whether he could have foreseen them or not.\nSmith v. London and South Western Ry. Co.[15], at page 21, per Channel B.\nWhat the defendants might reasonably anticipate is, as my brother Channel has said, only material with reference to the question whether the defendants were negligent or not, and cannot alter their liability if they were guilty of negligence. Ibid, per Blackburn J. Mr. Beven in his work on Negligence (Can. ed., p. 85), introduces a discussion of this and other cases bearing on this aspect of the law of neg\u00fcgence by stating\na distinction of importance for understanding this branch of the law; between acts from which injurious consequences in the result flow to others, but which are not negligent in law, because these consequences would not antecedently have been anticipated to flow as natural results; and acts which carry liability because their probable outcome is injurious acts, though, in fact, the consequences which flow are not those anticipated.\nThe doer of a negligent act, says the learned author, is responsible for the consequences flowing from it in fact, even though antecedently, to a reasonable man, the consequences that do flow seem neither natural nor probable.\nSee too Shearman and Redfield on Negligence (6 ed.), secs. 26a, 29a, and 30.\nThe Canadian Northern train was moving very slowly\u2014between one and two miles an hour. The evidence establishes that, equipped as it was, it could easily have been stopped in 40 feet. The engineer deposed that he believed he had in fact stopped it within 15 feet on receiving the first signal to do so. The evidence also establishes that when the electric tramcar started to move towards the crossing, thus creating a situation of danger, which in my opinion made it the duty of those in charge of the advancing steam railway train to stop it, or at least to get it under such control that it could be instantly stopped if the reckless conduct of the motor-man in driving the electric tramcar on to the diamond crossing should give rise to a situation making that necessary\u2014a duty which they owed to all the people on the tramcar\u2014the train was at least 75 feet from the diamond crossing. The brakesman on the front car so tells us. He saw the tramcar start. Had he at once signalled the engineer to stop or even to prepare to stop before reaching the crossing and had the latter promptly obeyed the signal, no harm would have ensued. Still later, when the electric tramcar was approximately two-thirds across the diamond and had almost stopped, as the brakesman informed us, the danger being thus greatly increased and the duty to stop all the more pressing, the train was still 50 feet from the crossing, and prompt action by the brakesman and engineer would have brought it to a stand at least 10 feet before it reached the crossing. That the appellant's train may have had the right of way over the electric tramcar affords no excuse for not fulfilling this duty. It would not justify the respondent running down the appellant's car if it could avoid doing so by reasonable care\u2014still less killing the plaintiff's wife. Whatever the brakesman may have done to signal the engineer, the evidence indicates that no attempt to stop or even lessen the speed of the train or to get it under better control was made by the engineer until it was almost upon the crossing, since when it was actually stopped the foremost part of the front car was in fact 16 feet beyond the crossing. There was in my opinion abundant evidence on which a jury might have found negligence imputable to the steam railway company either on the part of the brakesman or on that of the engineer.\nHad the electric tramcar been run into on the crossing, as would have happened if the motorman had failed for any reason to get it clear, the liability of the steam railway company for damages sustained in the collision at all events by passengers on the tramcar would seem to me to be incontrovertible. It was only by suddenly \"speeding up\" in response to the shouted warning of the brakesman, given when his train was only 30 feet from the crossing, that the motorman succeeded in taking his car out of danger, possibly as a result precipitating the plaintiff's wife and two other persons on the crossing in front of the still advancing train then only 15 feet away. The actual danger which the brakesman should have anticipated, and apparently did in fact, anticipate, viz., collision with the tramcar, was thus obviated. But the negligence of the Canadian Northern employees, which was a cause of that peril having continued until the car escaped from the danger zone, did not thereupon cease to operate. It had a further and, under the circumstances, a natural consequence, in the sense explained in Shearman & Redfield's work (sections 29a and 30), in the running over of the plaintiff's wife, and the steam railway company, in my opinion, cannot escape liability merely because that particular consequence or the immediate situation in which it occurred cannot be said to have been something which was or should have been within the contemplation of the train crew when they negligently failed, while the tramcar was in a position of peril, either to stop their train or to have it under such control that it could at any moment have been stopped before reaching the crossing.\nConsiderations such as arise between a plaintiff and a defendant in cases of contributory negligence are quite foreign to the question now before us\u2014 that of the liability of a defendant to a plaintiff against whom no contributory negligence is suggested.\nIn my opinion not only was there evidence of negligence on the part of the respondent\u2014proper for submission to a jury\u2014but on the uncontroverted facts a finding of such negligence should be made.\nThe negligence of both defendants conduced to the death of the plaintiff's wife. Had that of either been absent the lamentable tragedy would not have occurred.\nIt is our duty to give the judgment which the court appealed from should have given. Exercising the power conferred on the Court of Appeal by sec. 9 of R.S.M. [1913], ch. 43, I would set aside the judgment of the learned trial judge and direct the entry of judgment declaring both defendants liable to the plaintiff for the sum agreed on as damages with costs. There should be no costs as between the defendants of the proceedings in the Court of King's Bench, but the appellant is entitled to be paid its costs here and in the Court of Appeal by the respondent.\nBrodeur J. (dissenting)\u2014The question in this case is whether the Canadian Northern Company has been at fault in the accident which caused the death of Mrs. Bartlett. The evidence may lead to the conclusion that there was negligence on the part of the employees of the railway company in not stopping the train after the engineer in charge of the locomotive had received the proper signals. But the evidence is not very positive and is in some respects conflicting. In view of the unanimous findings of the courts below in that respect I would not feel disposed to interfere.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014The whole question here is not whether the plaintiff, Bartlett, was entitled to recover damages for the death of his wife, for both the appellant and the respondent admitted that he was, but whether the plaintiff had a valid cause of action against the respondent as well as against the appellant.\nIn other words, would the plaintiff on the evidence be entitled to recover damages for the death of his wife against both defendants or against one only of them? The learned trial judge came to the conclusion that judgment should be entered in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant, the Winnipeg Electric Railway Company, and that the action should be dismissed against the defendant, the Canadian Northern Railway Company, with costs to be paid by Winnipeg Electric Railway Company to its co-defendant, the Canadian Northern Railway Company.\nThe conduct of the trial to a certain extent obscured this simple issue, for, as the learned trial judge observed:\u2014\nThe whole course of the trial consisted of evidence and arguments adduced by each of the co-defendants to shew that the other should be held liable.\nAnd so before this court the argument was directed to shew that one company rather than the other should bear the burden of the admitted liability towards the plaintiff, with the result that the one emphasized the negligence of the other, especially the respondent the negligence of the appellant, while the latter, which could not deny that its motorman had been grossly in fault, endeavoured to shew that, but for the negligence of the respondent, this fault would not have caused the accident.\nI propose to look at the case solely on the basis of the real question which was in issue, that is to say, on the evidence, would a jury, or a judge sitting without a jury, have been justified in finding against both defendants negligence entitling the plaintiff to recover against both of them, or would a verdict or a judgment be justified only against the appellant, so that the respondent would have been entitled to have the plaintiff's action dismissed, as it was, in so far as it was concerned?\nAnd on this basis and in answer to the question so submitted by the agreement of the parties, I have come to the firm conclusion, with deference, that the plaintiff was entitled to recover damages against both defendants as being jointly liable for the accident.\nThe plaintiff's wife was a passenger on an electric car of the appellant which had to cross the line of the respondent on the level on Portage Avenue, Winnipeg. At that time a freight train of the respondent was approaching the crossing very slowly, its speed being about two miles per hour. It consisted of four box cars in front, then an engine and some twelve empty cars. A brakesman, named Kenneth Cammell, was on the front car. The electric car, as the rules required, stopped within a few feet of the railway track, and the conductor got off and went ahead to see if the track was clear, and it was the duty of the motorman to wait until the conductor gave the signal to go ahead, which signal he never gave. What happened then is best described in the language of the learned trial judge:\u2014\nWhen the freight train was within perhaps 75 feet of the crossing the motorman of the electric car suddenly decided to get across in front of the freight train and started forwards. When the electric car was partly on the diamond the brakesman on the freight car saw imminent danger of collision, and as the car seemed to be stopping, shouted to the motorman to \"go ahead.\" The motorman thereupon apparently applied extra power, the car went ahead with a jerk, and three passengers, including the deceased, were either thrown off the rear platform of the car or else in desperation jumped from it and alighted on the diamond where the deceased was run over.\nDuring all the time the brakesman had the electric car in full view, and when it suddenly started to go ahead, the train should have been stopped. The time card of the respondent required the train to stop 100 feet from the crossing, and Cammell says that he gave at that distance the usual stop signal but it was not obeyed. He was, he adds, about 50 feet from the diamond, or crossing of the railway and electric car tracks, when the motorman ran his car ahead so that it came right on the diamond, where it seemed to stop and the brakesman gave several violent stop signals which the engine driver either did not see or failed to obey, and the brakesman shouted to the car to go ahead which it did with a kind of jerk and cleared the diamond, but at its sudden jerk forward, the plaintiff's wife who with two other passengers had run to the rear platform of the car, was either thrown off or jumped off and fell on to the diamond where she was run over.\nThere can be no doubt as to the gross negligence, not to use a much stronger term, of the motorman when he started forward with a moving train coming towards him so close to the crossing. But this does not mean that the railway company was itself free from negligence so that the plaintiff would not have a right of action against it also. The learned trial judge stated that he could find no particular in respect to which the steam railway company was guilty of any negligence conducive to the accident. With deference, I think it was negligence not to have stopped the train, which could have been done, when the electric car first started forward in an attempt to clear the track. If the railway train was then \"within perhaps 75 feet\" of the crossing, as found by the learned trial judge, or even about 50 feet away, as testified by Cammell, the train, which he says was just crawling, could have been stopped short of the crossing had the stop signals been obeyed.\nIn view of these circumstances I cannot think for an instant that if the plaintiff had sued the respondent alone he would not have been entitled to a verdict or judgment, and surely the respondent could not have escaped liability by emphasizing\u2014as it does here\u2014 the gross negligence of the Winnipeg Electric Railway Company.\nThe learned Chief Justice of Manitoba made use of an argument which at first impressed me when it was urged at the hearing by counsel for the respondent. He said:\u2014\nThe accident was a natural sequence of the negligent conduct of the motorman: See Prescott v. Connell,[16]. The brakesman on the front of the train had urgently signalled the engine driver to stop and had repeated his signals. There was not sufficient time to do anything further after the deceased fell on the track. The train was stopped as soon as possible. The trainmen were suddenly faced with a new situation of danger, which gave them little, if any, time to think and act. Even if they could have done anything more than was done to avoid the accident, the court ought not to require of them, in the new situation that was created, perfect nerve and presence of mind enabling them to do the best thing possible.\nAnd it was urged that the respondent could not have foreseen that passengers in the electric car would jump out or be thrown out of the car.\nWith great deference and upon full consideration I am of the opinion that this argument cannot prevail. Before \"a new situation of danger was created,\" there was a situation of danger created by the attempt of the electric car to cross before the train reached the crossing, and as the learned Chief Justice observed, the brakesman had urgently signalled the engine driver to stop and had repeated his signals.\nThere was then time for the train crew, and especially the engine driver, if he was heeding the signals, to think and to act. Wooden, the engine driver, was examined before the Public Utilities Commissioner, and stated that he could have stopped his engine within 15 feet, and he did not contradict this statement when he was cross-examined at the trial. And as to the argument that it could not have been foreseen that passengers would jump out of the car in the dangerous situation created by the joint negligence of the two companies, the learned Chief Justice rightly observes that the passengers did what might have been expected in such a case and rushed to the door and tried to leave the car.\nOn the whole I am of the opinion, with deference, that the judgment which absolved the respondent of any negligence conducive to the accident cannot stand, and that it should be declared that the plaintiff is entitled to recover against both defendants as being jointly liable for the accident.\nThe appeal should therefore be allowed with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and the two defendants condemned to pay the plaintiff the amount agreed upon. There should be no costs of the trial as between the defendants.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Moran, Anderson & Guy.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Clark & Jackson.\n[1] 29 Man.

Third Party.\n1919: November 5; 1919: November 10.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA.\nNavigation\u2014Obstruction\u2014Removal of wreck\u2014Owner\u2014Liability for cost \u2014Statutory requirements\u2014\"Navigable Waters Protection Act\" [1906] c. 115, ss. 17 and 18.\nBy sec. 16 of the \"Navigable Waters Protection Act,\" if navigation is obstructed by a wreck the Minister of Marine may cause same to be destroyed; by sec. 17 he may convey it to a convenient place and sell it at public auction, paying the surplus of proceeds over expenses to the owner who shall be liable for any deficiency. A wreck obstructing navigation was sold by the owner on condition that it be removed. This was not done and the Minister advertised for public tenders, the material after removal to belong to the tenderer. In an action against the original owner for the cost:\nHeld, per Davies C.J. Brodeur and Mignault JJ. that the owner was liable; that he had received the benefit of the value of the material in the reduced amount of the tender; and that the Minister had exercised a wise discretion.\nPer Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ. that as the Minister did not observe the statutory requirement of conveying away the vessel and selling it by public auction the Crown could not recover notwithstanding that the course pursued may have been equally beneficial to the owner.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court (18 Ex. C.R. 401; 46 D.L.R. 275), affirmed, the court being equally divided.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], in favour of the Crown.\nThe necessary facts and the question raised for decision are stated in the above head-note. J. McG. Stewart for the appellant.\nR. V. Sinclair K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of the opinion that the judgment of the Exchequer Court was right and that this appeal should be dismissed and such judgment confirmed.\nAs there is an equal division of opinion in this court, in accordance with our usual practice there will be no costs of the appeal.\nThe action was brought by the Crown under the \"Navigable Waters Protection Act\" to recover expenses incurred by the Crown in removing a wreck from Barrington Passage, Nova Scotia, on the ground that the passage was a public harbour of Canada and that the wreck constituted an obstruction to navigation.\nThe facts necessary for the decision of the appeal are clearly and concisely stated in the written reasons of Mr. Justice Brodeur with which I concur.\nI base my judgment upon the fact that the evidence shews such a full and substantial compliance with section 17 of the \"Navigable Waters Protection Act\" (R.S.C. ch. 115) as entitles the Crown to maintain this action under section 18 of that Act.\nNo injustice whatever was, in my opinion, sustained by the appellant.\nIf a reservation of property rights in the debris of the vessel after being blown up had been made, the amount of the tender would have been necessarily increased by such a problematical value as the tenderer might put upon such debris and the owner obliged to pay the increased amount.\nThe circumstances of the case were such as called for the exercise by the Minister of a wise and prudent discretion and I think in accepting the tender with the provision that the property in the debris of the wreck in question when blown up should belong to the tenderer, the Minister exercised, under the circumstances, such discretion and one in the interests of the owner Anderson.\nIdington J.\u2014This is an appeal in an action brought by the respondent in the Exchequer Court to recover the expenses of removing a wreck, under and by virtue of the \"Navigable Waters Protection Act,\" ch. 115 R.S.C. 1906. At common law there could be no such relief. The rights and remedies in question are entirely the creature of the said statute which has given a new remedy.\nSection 16 provides that:\u2014\nThe Minister may * * * if, in his opinion:\n(a) the navigation of any such navigable water is obstructed, impeded or rendered more difficult or dangerous by reason of the wreck * * * cause such wreck, vessel or part thereof or other thing, if the same continues for more than twenty-four hours, to be removed or destroyed in such manner and by such means as he thinks fit, and may use gunpowder and other explosive substance for that purpose if he deems it advisable.\nSection 17 is as follows:\n17. The Minister may cause such vessel, or its cargo, or anything causing or forming part of any such obstruction or obstacle, to be conveyed to such place as he thinks proper, and to be there sold by auction or otherwise as he deems most advisable; and may apply the proceeds of such sale to make good the expenses incurred by him in placing and maintaining any signal or light to indicate the position of such obstruction or obstacle, or in the removal, destruction or sale of such vessel, cargo or thing.\n2. He shall pay over any surplus of such proceeds or portion thereof to the owner of the vessel, cargo or thing sold, or to such other persons as shall be entitled to the same respectively.\nThe Minister did not direct anything to be conveyed to any place, or to be sold by auction. What happened was that he advertised for tenders for the execution of the work and in the advertisement expressly provided as follows:\u2014\nthe materials in the obstruction, when the removal is satisfactorily completed, but not before, to become the property of the contractor.\nThe contract for removal was let to the firm which made the lowest tender based on specifications thus providing for the disposition of the property. Upon the execution of the work the contractors took the property as their own and afterwards, it is said, sold a part for some $129, and had still some more left. It is quite evident, I think, that there was not sufficient value in the wreck or the material of which it was composed to leave any balance in favour of the appellant. And inasmuch as he had sold to one Nickerson his rights in the wreck for $5 on the terms of removal, there would not be any grevious wrong done to the appellant by what transpired. That, however, is not the question.\nEven if we could find that there was a very trifling sum realized out of the property after its removal, I do not see how that would affect the question involved.\nThat question is reduced solely to the one question of whether or not in this new remedy given the Crown to recover from the unfortunate owners of a wreck the cost of removing it, the steps laid down in the statute giving the remedy, as a condition precedent thereto, have been observed. I have come to the conclusion that they have not been observed.\nSo clear a departure from the terms of the Act should not, I submit, be maintained, no matter how well intentioned the modification made by the Minister or his deputy in carrying into effect the provisions of the Act may have been.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs. Duff J.\u2014The decision of this appeal turns upon the construction to be given to sections 13, 14, 16, 17 and 18 and particularly section 18 of the \"Navigable Waters Protection Act,\" ch. 115, R.S.C. 1906. By the combined operations of sections 13 to 16 inclusive the Minister is authorized in certain circumstances where the navigation of navigable waters is obstructed, impeded or rendered more difficult or dangerous by reason of the wreck, sinking or grounding or any part thereof to\ncause such wreck, vessel or part thereof or other thing, if the same continues for more than 24 hours, to be removed or destroyed in such manner and by such means as he thinks fit, and may use gunpowder or other explosive substance for that purpose, if he deems it advisable.\nBy section 17\nthe Minister may cause such vessel, or its cargo, or anything causing or forming part of any such obstruction or obstacle, to be conveyed to such place as he thinks proper, and to be there sold by auction or otherwise as he deems most advisable; and may apply the proceeds of such sale to make good the expensed incurred by him in placing and maintaining any signal or light to indicate the position of such obstruction or obstacle, or in the removal, destruction or sale of such vessel, cargo or thing.\nSection 18 provides that where the Minister\nhas caused to be removed or destroyed any wreck, vessel or part thereof, or any other thing by reason whereof the navigation of any such navigable waters was or was likely to become obstructed, impeded or rendered more difficult or dangerous * * * and the cost of removing or destroying such vessel or part thereof, wreck or other thing has been defrayed out of the public moneys of Canada; and the net proceeds of the sale under this part of such vessel or its cargo, or the thing which caused or formed part of such obstruction are not sufficient to make good the cost so defrayed out of the public moneys of Canada, the amount by which such net proceeds falls short of the costs so defrayed as aforesaid, or of the whole anount of such cost, if there is nothing which can be sold as aforesaid, shall be recoverable with costs, (a) from the owner of such vessel or other thing, or from the managing owner or from the master or person in charge thereof at the time such obstruction or obstacle was occasioned * * *\nThe dispute arises in this way: The schooner \"Empress\" was burned to the water's edge in Barrington Passage, a public harbour, and was abandoned to the underwriters as a total loss. By them it was sold at auction for $5.00 to one Nickerson who, after several ineffectual efforts, abandoned the attempt to remove the wreck. The Minister advertised by tender for the execution of the work of removal and in the contract which was let for $750.00, it was stipulated that\nthe materials in the obstruction when the removal was satisfactorily completed, but not before,\nwere to \"become the property of the contractor.\"\nBy the contractor the wreck was blown up and the pieces were removed to the adjacent shore and eight iron knees weighing over a ton, and about 150 lbs. of copper were taken by the contractors to Yarmouth and sold by them for their own benefit.\nIn this action the Crown sought to charge the appellant under section 18 with the whole cost of removing the wreck and Mr. Justice Cassels, the judge of the Exchequer Court, has held that the appellant is liable. The appellant contends that the conditions of liability under section 18 have not come into existence.\nAt common law the owner of a vessel becoming an obstruction to navigation in the absence of negligence or wilful default of the owner or persons in control of her, is not responsible for the consequences of the obstruction, or chargeable with the cost of removing it, and the \"Navigable Waters Protection Act\" imposes a new liability upon the owners of ships, which comes into existence in certain defined conditions; a liability which it would be difficult in many cases to describe as just or fair or reasonable.\nOn well-known principles the party who asserts in a particular case that the conditions of a new statutory liability have come into existence, must establish that proposition strictly and in ascertaining whether that is so or not, the inquiry is: Do the facts established clearly fall within the statutory description of those conditions?\nNow when section 18 is read in connection with section 17, it becomes apparent that \"sale under this part\" in section 18 refers to the sale authorized by section 17, and section 18 provides, if not in explicit terms, at least by plain implication, that if there is anything which can be sold, it is only the difference between the net proceeds of the sale of it and the amount of the costs which can be recovered.\nIt is quite clear that there was something of appreciable value which could be sold; the parts of the vessel, that is to say, which were taken away by the contractors and sold for their own account. And the appellant is entitled to succeed unless the condition of the statute is satisfied that there was a sale of these parts within the meaning of the statute.\nOn behalf of the Crown it is contended that the provision of the contract transferring the ownership of the materials to the contractor upon the completion of the work of removal, constituted a sale within the meaning of the Act. The consideration for this term of the contract would be found, it is argued, in an appropriate allowance made in the stipulated compensation which would be reduced in consequence of the supposed value of the stipulation in the eyes of the tenderers. The cost of removal being thus diminished and the burden upon the owner correspondingly lightened, the owner, it is argued, would in this way get the equivalent in value of the materials just as if they had been sold as the statute contemplates. The answer to this contention is, and I think it is a complete answer, that the statute provides for no such thing. Neither in form nor in substance does this stipulation in this contract fulfil the statutory condition. The statute provides for a sale at auction and section 18 makes it quite plain that what is contemplated is a sale in the ordinary sense, that is to say a sale for an ascertained price which, if less than the cost, can be deducted therefrom in order to determine the amount of the liability under that section.\nMoreover, it would be rash to assume that the procedure under consideration would in all cases operate as favourably to the owner as that prescribed by the statute. Under this procedure the competitive bidders are limited to persons who are prepared to tender for the execution of the work of removal. Under the statutory procedure the bidders would include all persons naturally desirous of buying the articles for sale.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J\u2014I was at first inclined to think that there had been substantial compliance with section 17 of the \"Navigable Waters Protection Act\" (R.S.C. ch. 115) sufficient to entitle the Crown to maintain this action under section 18. But further consideration has led me to the conclusion that this view cannot be sustained\u2014somewhat reluctantly because I incline to think the course adopted may have been quite as beneficial to the appellant as a strict compliance with section 17 would have been.\nTenders were called for by an advertisement for the removal or destruction, under section 16, of the wreck of the defendant's vessel on the footing that the property in it after removal or destruction should belong to the contractor. It may be surmised that in this case something approximating their saleable value after the ship was blown up had already been allowed to the Crown by the contractor in reduction of the amount of his tender for the destruction of the vessel and that the defendant, therefore, received the benefit of such saleable value. But if that be the fact, and if proof of it would entitle the Crown to maintain this action, such proof is entirely lacking; and in many other cases\u2014perhaps the great majority\u2014 little or nothing would be allowed by a tenderer for the value of possible salvage from a submerged wreck to be removed or destroyed by him. On the other hand, after removal to the shore or to some other accessible place portions of the same vessel or cargo might have a very substantial value and be readily saleable.\nWe are required to place a construction on sections 17 and 18. The latter section confers on the Crown a right which it did not theretofore enjoy. Arrow Shipping Co. v. Tyne Improvement Commissioners[2], at pp. 527-8. It subjects the owner of a vessel which founders in a place where it constitutes an obstruction to navigation, who may be entirely free from blame, to what may be a very serious burden. It is only fair to him that any conditions which Parliament has attached to the imposition of that burden should be fulfilled. Section 17 imposes such a condition. If after the removal or destruction of a vessel by or at the instance of the Crown under section 16 there should be anything left \"which can be sold,\" it must then be \"sold by auction or otherwise\" under section 17 before the Minister may invoke the remedy created by section 18 of maintaining an action for the balance of the expenses incurred by the Crown after crediting the proceeds of a sale under section 17. Disposing of what may prove to be of saleable value after removal or destruction by inviting tenders for the removal or destruction oil the basis that it shall belong to the contractor may be a convenient, possibly the most convenient, method of dealing with such a situation as was presented in the case at bar. It may under some circumstances even be more advantageous to the owner than the course prescribed by section 17. But it is not that course; nor can it be said that it has been shewn in the present case to have been its substantial equivalent, if that would suffice.\nI am for these reasons, with great respect, of the opinion that the appeal must be allowed and the action dismissed.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This is a case where we are called upon to construe certain provisions of the \"Navigable Waters Protection Act,\" ch. 115, R.S.C., concerning the sale, the removal or destruction of the wrecks in navigable waters.\nThe appellant, Anderson, was the owner of a schooner called Empress; and on the 10th November, 1915, while lying at anchor in Barrington Passage, the vessel was burnt to the water's edge and became an obstruction to navigation.\nThe owner was notified by the Department of Marine and Fisheries that it was his duty, under the provisions of the Act, to remove the schooner and, on the 18th November, Anderson caused the vessel to be sold at public auction to the highest bidder, and he stipulated that the purchaser should assume all responsibility for its removal. A person offered and paid five dollars ($5) for the vessel, stripped her of everything of value and abandoned the remains after having unsuccessfully tried to remove the vessel.\nThe Department then advertised for tenders for the removal of the wreck; and, in view of what had happened, stated in the notice calling for tenders that the materials of the vessel, when the removal has been satisfactorily completed, should become the property of the contractor. The successful tenderer, as requested by the notice calling for tenders, stated that he intended to blow the hull into pieces and agreed to do the work for seven hundred and fifty dollars ($750.00). The present action has been instituted by the King to recover the sum of $750 and cost of advertisements, and some other incidental expenses.\nThe point raised by the appellant is that the sale of the vessel is a condition precedent to the right to recover the expenses of removal and that the Minister did not properly exercise his discretion as to whether the wreck is an obstruction to navigation and as to the manner of its removal.\nBy the provisions of section 16 of the Act the Minister\nmay cause any wreck to be removed or destroyed in such manner and by such means as he thinks fit and may use gunpowder and other explosive substance for that purpose if he deems it advisable.\nIn the present case, the Minister called for tenders and in the notice the tenderers were asked to state how they would do the work. Different modes were suggested by the different tenderers; and the Minister having decided to accept a tender which provided that the vessel would be destroyed shews that the discretion has been properly exercised by the Minister and that in his view the hull should be destroyed. It is rather evident in this case that the vessel could not easily be removed in view of the condition in which she had been left after the fire, and in view of the efforts made by the first purchaser. Besides, the Minister was not bound to remove her. It was absolutely within his discretion to remove or to destroy her.\nThe Minister could then have purely and simply asked for tenders for her destruction. But in this case, in order that the owner could get from the vessel as much benefit as possible, he provided that the successful tenderer should become the owner of the wreck and should consider in his tender the value of such wreck. As I said, it was not necessary for the Minister to provide for that. He could have simply called for tenders for the destruction of the ship without providing at all for setting any value upon the hull. That condition was put in for the benefit of the owner; and he should certainly not now be entitled to complain and say the Minister had no right to do that.\nI consider that the Minister substantially complied with the provisions of the law; and if he failed in something, it was in conveying to the owner certain benefits which otherwise the latter could not get.\nFor these reasons I consider that the action which was maintained by the court below was well founded and the appeal from its judgment should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014The only question that merits serious discussion here is whether the appellant is right in his construction of sections 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 of the \"Navigable Waters Protection Act\" (R.S.C. 1906, ch. 115), as amended, so that the wreck not having been sold by auction by the Crown for the recovery of the cost of its destruction, the respondent cannot recover from the appellant the amount necessarily paid for the removal of the wreck. Otherwise it is obvious that the claim of the Crown is one which the appellant should pay.\nThe schooner Empress, while anchored at Barring-ton Passage, a public harbour, was burnt to the water's edge, and was abandoned to the underwriters as a total loss and by them, on their account and on account of the owner, sold by auction for $5.00 to one Nickerson, the purchaser obliging himself to remove the wreck. Nickerson swears that he twice tried to remove the remains of the schooner to the shore and failed and so abandoned it where it was, after taking away what could be stripped off. The Minister, after notifying the owner to remove the wreck and this not being done, advertised for tenders to remove it, the materials to belong to the tenderer, and received several tenders, the lowest being $750, and the highest $2,700. The lowest tender was accepted, the wreck blown up with dynamite, and some of the materials were sold by the contractor. The Crown sued the appellant and the latter served a third party notice on Nickerson, but the issue was tried between the Crown and Anderson, and it was agreed that if the plaintiff succeeded against Anderson, the trial between Anderson and Nickerson would come on at a subsequent date.\nAs I have said, the claim of the Crown is one which Anderson should pay unless, adopting his construction of the \"Navigable Waters Protection Act,\" it be held that the sale of the wreck under section 17 is a condition precedent to the right of the Crown to claim from the owner the cost of removal.\nThat this question of construction is not free from difficulty is shewn by the division of opinion among the members of this court. Section 17 deals with the sale of the obstruction or wreck. In form it is permissive and says that the Minister may cause such vessel, or its cargo, or anything causing or forming part of any such obstruction or obstacle, to be conveyed to such place as he thinks proper, and to be there sold by auction or otherwise as he deems most advisable. The evidence here is that the wreck could not be removed from the place where it formed an obstruction, while certain materials, such as the chains, anchors, etc., could be and were taken away by Nickerson to whom the whole wreck had been sold, on account of the owner and underwriters, with obligation to remove the wreck, before the appellant received the letter from the Government ordering him to remove it. That the appellant bid $3.00 and did not judge it wise to go higher than $5.00, the amount of Nickerson's bid, shews that he considered the game was not worth the candle on account of the obligation incumbent on the purchaser to remove the wreck.\nIt is true that the contractor was allowed to dispose of the remains of the wreck after blowing it up: But if all these remains had to be brought by him to shore and then sold so as to defray in part the cost of removal, the contractor would no doubt have charged more, so that the appellant gets the benefit of the value of anything remaining after the wreck was blown up.\nComing back now to sections 17 and 18, a not unreasonable construction of section 17 would be that where the wreck or obstruction, or a material part thereof, cannot be conveyed to the shore and sold, there is no obligation (and I think that the word \"obligation\" is too strong for a provision such as section 17 which is as I have said permissive in form) to sell it by auction, and if in such a case there is no direction in the statute to sell the wreck, the sale cannot be a condition precedent to the right of the Crown to recover the cost of removal.\nMoreover, if the Minister had caused the wreck to be sold where it stood, owing to the impossibility of removing it, there is no reason to suppose that a larger sum would have been realized than that paid by Nickerson for, obviously, if the Minister sold the wreck, a necessary condition would have been that the purchaser should remove it.\nBut the appellant contends that after the wreck was blown up the remains should have been sold and credited to him. I have already answered that in that event the contractor would no doubt have charged more for removal.\nI may add that section 18 contemplates the case where there is nothing that can be sold and in that event nothing is to be credited to the owner in deduction of the cost of removal. Here of course there were some iron knees and copper, but the sale of this stuff would not have benefitted Anderson, as I have observed, if the contractor, deprived of these materials, had charged more for removal, and the whole of it is to my mind so insignificant that the maxin de minimis non curat lex may be usefully applied.\nOn the whole, I consider that the appellant has suffered no prejudice, and to allow his technical objection to prevail would deprive the Crown of the right to ever recover what is due by him.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. A. Henry.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F. C. Blanchard.\nSolicitor for third party: C. J. Burchell.\n[1] 18 Ex. C.R. 401; 46 D.L.R. 275.\n[2] [1894] A.C. 508.\n"}

V. c. 33\u2014 Seizure of liquor\u2014Intercolonial Railway\u2014Carrier\u2014Statute\u2014Application to Crown.\nSec. 36 of the \"Nova Scotia Temperance Act\" authorizes the seizure of liquor in transit or course of delivery upon the premises of any carrier etc.\nHeld, that neither expressly nor by necessary implication did this enactment apply to liquor in custody of the Crown in right of the Dominion as a carrier.\nHeld, also, Duff J. expressing no opinion, that if it did purport so to apply it would be ultra vires.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1], reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nLiquor shipped from Montreal and consigned to the plaintiff company at Sydney was seized there by an inspector, under the provisions of sec. 36 of the \"Nova Scotia Temperance Act, 1911\" on the premises of the Dominion Government Railway by which it had been carried from Montreal. The company issued a writ of replevin on the trial of which it was held that the transaction was bon\u00e2 fide and came within the saving clause, sec. 4, of the Act of 1910. His judgment for the plaintiff was reversed by the full court and the action dismissed.\nJ. M. G. Stewart for the appellant referred to Kelly & Glassey v. Scriven[2]; Ex parte McGrath[3].\nFinlay Macdonald K.C. for the respondents. The liquor was imported for re-sale and the transaction was not bon\u00e2 fide within the meaning of sec. 4 of the Act of 1910. See In re Nova Scotia Temperance Act, 1910[4].\nThis is a proceeding in rem, and the judgment of the court below is final. McNeil v. McGillivray[5]; Sleeth v. Hurlbert[6], at pages 630-1.\nJ. M. G. Stewart for the appellant.\nFinlay Macdonald K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The sole question raised and argued on this appeal was whether a seizure of certain liquor by an inspector under the Provincial Temperance Act of Nova Scotia in the freight sheds of the Intercolonial Railway where it had been carried by the railway and was awaiting delivery to the consignee, was a legal seizure or not. In other words, whether or not the Crown in right of the Dominion was a \"carrier\" within the meaning of the Provincial Temperance Act. I am of the opinion that the Crown in right of the Dominion was not such a carrier, that the Act in question did not pretend to extend its provisions to the Crown in right of the Dominion and that the legislature of the province had no power to so extend it even if it had tried to do so. I concur with Anglin J. in the reasons stated by him in allowing the appeal and restoring the judgment of the trial judge, and would refer to the case of The Queen v. McLeod[7], where it was held the Crown was not liable as a common carrier for the safety and security of passengers using its railway.\nIdington J.\u2014Counsel for the appellant wisely abstained from pressing many points taken in the courts below and confined this appeal to the single neat point of whether or not by virtue of the Nova Scotia Act which, neither by express words nor by any legal implication in those used, pretended to so extend them as to include the Crown and its possessions when giving the powers of entry and seizure it conferred on inspectors named pursuant to the provisions of said Act, can be held to have given them such powers as asserted by invading in the way in question the premises of the Crown, commonly known as the \"Intercolonial Railway\" and taking therefrom the cases of liquor in question.\nI am of opinion his point is well taken. We have repeatedly held that most beneficent legislation of local legislatures could not give a remedy for grevious wrongs suffered on, or in and by, operations carried on upon said railway, and other like public works vested in the Crown. The like holding has been adhered to in analogous cases.\nThere is a double difficulty in respondent's way herein, because the Act in question fails to use express language extending it to include the Crown property, and he is invoking it to assert a power to enter that property vested in the Crown on behalf of the Dominion.\nThe counsel for respondent urged that the point taken here was not taken below, but clearly he is in error for the amended pleadings distinctly raise the issue presented here by appellant. It may well be, as so often happens in every court in too many cases, that the one issue upon which the case should turn, gets so befogged by raising irrelevant issues of law or fact, or both, that its import is apt to be overlooked; and possibly this is another of the same to be added to the long list of those which have preceded it.\nI think this property now in question never got, except by an illegal act, where respondents had a legal right to deal with it, or by the appellant's own act when he might, if he had taken it there, presumably be held to have rendered it liable to such seizure as made.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored.\nDuff J.\u2014This appeal raises a question under section 59 of the \"Nova Scotia Temperance Act,\" being ch. 8 of the Nova Scotia statutes of 1918. By sub-section 1 of that section:\nWhere any inspector, constable or other peace officer finds liquor in transit or in course of delivery upon the premises of any carrier or at any wharf, warehouse or other place, and reasonably believes that such liquor is to be sold or kept for sale in contravention of this Act, he may forthwith seize and remove the same.\nThe section goes on to provide for proceedings before a magistrate for the purpose of hearing and determining the claim of the owner that the liquor is not intended to be sold or kept for sale in violation of the Act and authorizes the destruction of the liquor in the event of the disallowance of this claim by the magistrate or in the event of no person appearing to make such a claim.\nCertain liquor in the freight sheds of the Intercolonial Railway and there awaiting delivery to a consignee after carriage on the railway was seized by an inspector professing to act under the authority of this enactment. Proceedings having been instituted before a magistrate under the Act, the consignee demanded delivery of the liquor, the property in which in the meantime had passed to him by payment of the vendor's draft attached to the bill of lading; the assignee's demand was refused and the liquor was destroyed.\nThe proceedings including the destruction of the liquor were taken professedly under the authority of sub-section 1 of section 59 and it is not suggested that the acts, of which the appellant complains as wrongful acts, could be justified under any other provision of the Act and the defence must fail unless the seizure was authorized under sub-section 1. It is contended on behalf of the appellant 1st, that this sub-section does not authorize the seizing and removing of such property from premises which are occupied by the Crown in connection with and for the purpose of the working of a Government railway, and 2nd, that if the scope of the sub-section is broad enough to give such authority it must be restricted in such a way as to exclude from its operation the premises of the Intercolonial Railway as being a railway owned and worked by the Government of Canada on the ground that if such were the effect of the enactment it would be ultra vires of the provincial legislature. I think the appeal should be allowed on the first mentioned ground and I desire to say as regards the second ground that questions touching the authority of a provincial legislature purporting to exercise the jurisdiction it possesses concerning civil rights or local and private matters within the province or the administration of justice to pass legislation incidentally giving rights of entry upon property connected with a Dominion railway or Dominion Crown property for purposes not otherwise affecting any interest of the Crown in the right of the Dominion or in conflict with any Dominion enactment may have to be considered by reference to the Dominion authority respecting the public property of the Dominion or by reference to the Dominion authority in relation to Railways or Trade and Commerce. But such questions can more satisfactorily be considered (presenting as they frequently do difficult and important points) after full argument upon them, and on this second ground we virtually have had no argument. I therefore pass no opinion upon it as I find it unnecessary to do so.\nIt is quite clear, I think, that section 59 does authorize the taking of goods out of the possession of a carrier in derogation of any possessory lien or other right of possession the carrier may have in relation to them. It is therefore, if applicable to the Crown as carrier, an enactment in derogation of the rights of the Crown and upon settled principles for which it is unnecessary to cite authority it must not be given this application unless (there being no express words requiring it), the Crown is reached by necessary implication. The words of the section are general and there is nothing in it to indicate any intention on the part of the legislature that the authority conferred is to be exercisable in relation to goods in possession of officials of the Government in their capacity as such.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nAnglin J.\u2014The \"Nova Scotia Temperance Act\" (ch. 33 of the statutes of 1911) by section 36 authorized the seizure by an inspector of liquor in transit or in course of delivery upon the premises of any carrier or at any wharf, warehouse or other place, if reasonably believed by him to be intended or kept for sale. Liquor of the defendant, consigned to him from Montreal, was seized by an inspector under the Temperance Act in the freight sheds of the Intercolonial Railway at Halifax after property therein had passed to the defendant by the payment of the vendor's draft attached to the bill of lading.\nQuestions agitated in the provincial courts arising under section 4 of the Temperance Act were not pressed by counsel for the appellant, who rested his appeal solely on the ground that goods in the custody of the Crown (Dom.) as a carrier and awaiting delivery are not within the provisions of section 36, invoking the familiar rule of construction that\nThe Crown is not reached (by the statute) except by express words or by necessary implication,\nand also contending that it would be ultra vires of a provincial legislature to authorize such interference with the undertaking of a Dominion railway and that a construction involving such authorization should not be placed on the statute unless inevitable. I am inclined to think both points well taken. The Crown in right of the Dominion, although a carrier, was not within the purview of the Nova Scotia statute and the impeached seizure on its premises was unlawful.\nAuthorities on the first branch of the argument are collected in Maxwell on Statutes (5 ed.), at page 220, and Craies Hardcastle (2 ed.), at pages 376 and 386-92. On the second branch reference may be made to Gauthier v. The King[8].\nThe original caption of the liquor having been illegal the defendant cannot, in my opinion, successfully fully set up in answer to the plaintiff's action for replevin that since he might have proceeded rightfully to take it as soon as the plaintiff had removed it from the railway premises, the case may be treated as if he had seized the goods after they had in fact been removed from the railway premises, whether rightfully or wrongly, and the detention of them were thus legal. The inspector in seizing was a mere trespasser ab initio. All the acts he did were trespasses. He was in the same position as a mere stranger without any legal authority whatever. The plaintiff is entitled to say:\nLet me be put in the position in which I stood before your illegal act.\nAttack v. Bramwell[9].\nI agree with the view expressed by the majority of the learned judges of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, in Ex parte McGrath[10].\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the court en banc and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco reversing the judgment of Mr. Justice Chisholm.\nIn the courts below the question which was mainly discussed was whether or not the sale of liquor was a bon\u00e2 fide one within the meaning of section 4 of the \"Nova Scotia Temperance Act.\"\nThe trial judge held that the transaction was a bon\u00e2 fide one and that therefore the statute did not apply.\nUpon appeal this decision was reversed and the court held that the transaction ended in Sydney, when the draft was paid at the bank, and that section 4 of the \"Nova Scotia Temperance Act\" did not apply. Before this court, the above question was not pressed and the only point which was raised by the appellant for our consideration was whether under the provisions of the \"Nova Scotia Temperance Act\" authorizing the seizure of liquor in the hands of a common carrier, that seizure can be legally made when the liquor is in the hands of the Crown as owner of the Canadian Government Railways.\nIt is an elementary principle of law that no legislation can affect the Crown without formal reference to it in the statute. Moveable property in the possession of the Crown cannot be seized or removed without its consent, or without some law being passed to that effect; and the Crown is not bound by statute, unless expressly, or by necessary implication. There is no power or authority in this Dominion capable of binding the Sovereign, save only the Sovereign himself in Parliament, and then only by express mention or clear implication. Gorton Local Board v. Prison Commissioners[11].\nThe \"Nova Scotia Temperance Act\" could very well authorize the seizure of liquor in the hands of an ordinary common carrier; but if the carrier is the Crown itself, I do not think the statute could apply.\nIn the present case, the officers charged with the carrying out of the \"Nova Scotia Temperance Act\" thought it advisable to go and seize in the hands of the Crown the liquor in question. That seizure was illegal and the action instituted by the appellant to claim the goods is well founded.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs of this court and of the courts below and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nMignault J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: A.

On arriving at Halifax he found that the ship was to go to Newfoundland and from there to Italy. He was offered $400 a month for the new voyage and agreed to go for $450 or, at all events, more than was paid to the chief engineer. Without further notice the owner engaged a new master and chief engineer paying the latter $400 a month. J. left the ship and, the owner refusing to pay the account he rendered, brought an action claiming damages for wrongful dismissal.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Local Judge (19 Ex. C.R. 165; 49 D.L.R. 123), that he was entitled to recover; that not having been hired for a definite term he was entitled to reasonable notice before being dismissed; and that the assessment of his damages at three months' wages, the arrears due when he was suspended, and expenses of his trip to Norway after dismissal should not be disturbed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Local Judge of the Nova Scotia Admiralty District[1], in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe facts of the case are stated in the above head-note.\nRogers K.C. for the appellant.\nKenney for the respondent. The Chief Justice.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIdington J.\u2014Having regard to the peculiar terms of the hiring, whereby the respondent was always to get a higher wage than the engineer, with which Anderson was conversant, I do not think he was treating respondent fairly in supplanting him by another captain without first telling him he had an engineer duly qualified and willing to go at $400 a month and offering something in excess of that wage.\nAnd none the less is that so, when regard is had to the terms of the telegram to him (Anderson) from appellant's Halifax agents, on which its counsel laid so much stress in argument here, for that clearly indicates respondent was not in accord with the possibly excessive and imperative demands of the rest of the crew whereby the engineer would get $475 a month yet respondent was offering to take $450, but by no means clearly putting it as an ultimatum.\nI am clearly of opinion that there was a dismissal and no refusal on the part of respondent to go.\nIn view of the express concession of the appellant's counsel that the Norwegian law was intended to govern, I see no alternative which entitles us to consider English law as the binding basis of the contract or anything therein relative to the consequences of a breach thereof.\nThe intention of the parties contracting is in that regard the rule of law however variable and difficult of application may be the general respective presumptions which any given set of circumstances may give rise to.\nThe appellant and respondent being agreed in that regard herein, we are relieved from any of the difficulties that sometimes exist in such cases. The only other question involved is the measure of damages and they must be measured by the terms of the contract made in light of and rendered definite by a reading of the relevant law.\nI cannot help having a suspicion that the respondent may have had, and possibly even availed himself of, the opportunity of minimizing his damages by accepting another engagement, but as no such contention is in fact set up I cannot assume that a return to Norway, though for past twenty odd years resident in New York, apparently was not the alternative he chose to abide by when this litigation had ended, if not before.\nPrima facie at least the extreme limit of the statutory provision is what, as he claims, he is entitled to when as here no alternative basis is presented by the evidence.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I think there is evidence to support the finding that the contract made in New York between Anderson, the representative of the owners, and the respondent as master, was subject to the condition that he should not be bound to serve in any voyage taking him across the Atlantic. The contract appears to have been indefinite as to the duration of hiring. The rule of English law, which in such circumstances would govern the rights of the parties, is that the contract cannot be terminated without reasonable notice. Creen v. Wright[2]. Whether this rule of English law be applied to the present case or the rule of the Norwegian law as explained in the evidence, the judgment of the trial judge seems to be a satisfactory disposition of it. As to the jurisdiction of the Court of Exchequer, a Court of Admiralty in such cases has jurisdiction to award damages; The Great Eastern[3]; and any difficulty which might otherwise have arisen from the decision in The Courtney[4], seems to be met by sec. 10 of the \"Admiralty Courts Act\" of 1861, 24 Vict. ch. 10.\nAnglin J.\u2014The learned trial judge, as I read his judgment, found that the plaintiff was employed by the owner of the defendant ship not by the month, as the latter contends, but for a voyage from New York to Halifax and thence to the West Indies. Since the evidence of the plaintiff, corroborated to some extent by that of Martin Marsden, supports this finding we should not disturb it merely because the defendant testifies to the contrary. Another not unreasonable inference from the evidence and all the circumstances might be that the plaintiff was engaged for an indefinite term as master of the \"Fort Morgan\" to take her wherever ordered subject to the limitation that she would not be sent overseas nor into the war zone.\nThe contract of employment was made in New York. The evidence also warrants a finding that it was one of its terms that the plaintiff's wages as master of the \"Fort Morgan\" should be higher than those of any other officer on the ship.\nThe vessel proceeded to Halifax under the plaintiff's charge and while it lay in that port the owner notified the master that the ship had been chartered to go to Newfoundland and thence to Italy instead of to the West Indies. While the master was willing to assent to this change of route and destination, he and the owner were unable to come to terms as to his wages for the new voyage. The owner recognized his right to a substantial increase owing to the fact that the vessel would proceed to the war zone, and offered him $400 a month. The captain's demand was for $450 but not less than should be paid to the chief engineer. The owner engaged new officers in New York agreeing to pay the new chief engineer $400. When the new master and his officers arrived at Halifax the plaintiff, who had never been offered more than $400 a month by the owner, left the ship. The learned trial judge found that he was discharged without notice and\nunder the English law * * * would be entitled to compensation for such damages (sic).\nThe facts in evidence I think warrant this conclusion.\nThere was some discussion at bar as to the law by which the nature of the contract, the question of its breach and the relief to which the plaintiff might be entitled should be determined and as to the jurisdiction of an English Admiralty Court to enforce in rem rights based on foreign law in excess of those conferred by the general maritime law. Counsel were agreed that the Norwegian law applied and evidence of it was given by the Norwegian Consul at New York. No evidence of any other foreign law was adduced. The law of the state of New York, should it be applicable, must therefore be deemed to be the same as the law administered by English courts.\nIn the view I take of the case it is unnecessary to decide to what law the rights of the parties were subject. If they were governed by the Norwegian law the plaintiff's damages appear to have been assessed in accordance with its provisions as proved by the witness Ravn. If they Should be determined by English law the amount allowed does not appear to have been excessive\u2014at all events, not sufficiently so to justify interference. The total judgment was for $1,888.85. The plaintiff's wages when dismissed were $343.75 per month, and there was then due to him for wages earned and unpaid $727.60. His damages for wrongful dismissal were therefore assessed at $1,121.25, or $120 more than three months' wages. I am not prepared to hold that this amount was so excessive for loss of the voyage to the West Indies that the assessment of the local Admiralty Court should be set aside.\nThere is no evidence that the plaintiff actually obtained, or could by reasonable effort have secured, other employment which he would have been bound to accept in order to minimize his damages.\nI would for these reasons dismiss this appeal with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This appeal does not, to my mind, present any serious difficulty.\nThe engagement of the respondent as master of the \"Fort Morgan\" was for a trip from New York to Halifax and the West Indies. The \"Fort Morgan\" is a Norwegian ship and the respondent is also a Norwegian. The contract should be governed by Norwegian law because prim\u00e2 facie the law of the flag governs, unless the parties have provided otherwise in the language of the contract. It was said in The Johann Friederich[5], that\nin cases of mariners' wages whoever engages voluntarily to serve on board a foreign ship, necessarily undertakes to be bound by the law of the country to which such ship belongs, and the legality of his claim must be tried by such law.\nThe Leon XIII[6]; The Livietta[7]; Lloyd v. Guibert[8]. The law of Norway, as was proved, shewed that the plaintiff was entitled to damages for wrongful dismissal.\nThe plaintiff having been engaged for a particular voyage could not be forced to go elsewhere; and if on his refusal he was replaced by another master, that constituted on the part of the owners of the ship a breach of contract.\nThe amount of the damages awarded was not excessive.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014This is by no means a satisfactory case and the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge are extremely brief. The evidence, as I read it, is contradictory not only as to the salary agreed to be paid to the respondent as master of the ship \"Fort Morgan,\" but also as to the term and the voyage for which he was hired. The learned trial judge finds that when the ship arrived at Halifax, the respondent's salary was $343.75 per month, and this finding I would not disturb as it evidently rests on the credibility of the respondent's evidence as opposed to the statement of Anderson, owner of the ship, that his salary was then only $250.00 per month.\nAs to the voyage for which the respondent was hired, the finding is that he came to Halifax with a view to a West India charter, but that after remaining there the owner chartered the ship for the war zone, and offered the captain and crew an increase of wages provided they would agree to go to Italy, but that the respondent refused the wages so offered him and was discharged without notice. I do not find in the reasons for judgment any express statement as to the term for which the respondent was employed, but I take it that the finding was that the respondent, as he testified, was engaged for a voyage from New York to Halifax and thence to the West Indies. Very probably the appellant, in chartering the ship for the war zone, found such a charter much more profitable than the intended voyage to the West Indies.\nOn the basis of the findings of the learned trial judge there can be no doubt that the respondent was wrongfully dismissed, and the only question is with regard to the amount of the damages to which he is entitled for wrongful dismissal. The judgment appealed from allows him three months' salary and the price of transport to Norway, granting him such compensation \"by analogy to the Norwegian Maritime Code,\" and the amount for which judgment was entered, after a reference to the Registrar, was $1,888.85, being, I take it, $1,031.25 for three months' wages, $302.00 for return to Norway, and the difference, $555.60, for wages due the respondent at the date of his dismissal. Both parties have admitted that the issues in this case are governed by the law of Norway, and proof of this law was made by the Consul General of Norway at New York, Mr. Ravn, who referred to articles 63, 64, 65 and 66 of the Norwegian Code, the effect of which is to give the master wrongfully dismissed in a port outside of Europe, when not engaged for any fixed term, three months' wages, plus his travelling expenses, including subsistence, to the place at which he was engaged in Norway, but otherwise to that port to which the ship belongs.\nThe respondent had been in the United States for over twenty years and was hired at New York, although he says he belongs to Stavanger in Norway. He was not asked whether he had any intention of returning there. If the Norwegian law governs the matter, as both parties admit, the respondent would appear to be entitled to claim the amounts which the learned trial judge allowed, and no special complaint is made in the appellant's factum as to the sum granted for travelling expenses.\nAs I have said this is far from being a satisfactory-case, but I cannot find sufficient ground to justify me in setting aside the judgment of the trial court, and therefore I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

V. ch. 25 (Ont.)\u2014Injury to employee\u2014Compensation from Board\u2014Election\u2014Right of action.\nThe Ontario \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d provides that a workman injured in course of his employment and thereby entitled to bring an action against a person other that his employer, may claim compensation under the Act from the Compensation Board or bring such action. If he elects to claim under the Act, and the compensation is payable out of the accident fund, the Board is subrogated to his rights, and may maintain an action in his name, against the wrongdoer. H., driver of a bread wagon in Toronto, was injured by a collision with a street car and elected to claim, under the Act, compensation payable out of the accident fund which was awarded and paid for a time. He then brought an action against the Toronto Railway. Co. and, after the trial, he obtained an order from the Board allowing him to withdraw his election.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division (45 Ont. L.R. 550; 49 D.L.R. 216), that his right of action was not barred.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014H. should have obtained an order from the Board authorizing him to bring the action and the proceedings on the appeal should be stayed until such order is filed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], varying the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff by directing that the damages awarded should be paid to the Compensation Board to be dealt with under the Act. The only question for decision on this appeal is whether or not the plaintiff\u2019s right of action was barred by his election to claim compensation under the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\u201d The proceedings on his claim so far as they affect that question are stated in the head-note.\nDewart K.C. and Hodgson for the appellants. There is no doubt that the plaintiff elected to claim from the Board. See Scarf v. Jardine[2] , at pages 360-1; Oliver v. Nautilus Steam Shipping Co.[3]\nHaving so elected his right of action against the wrongdoer is gone. Huckle v. London County Council[4] Codling v. Mowlem & Co[5].\nProudfoot K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This was an action brought by the plaintiff against the railway company to recover damages for injuries received by him from the negligent running of the defendant\u2019s railway and in which the jury assessed $2,500 as the damages and found \u201cexcessive speed\u201d of the car as the negligence.\nDuring the trial, it came out in evidence that plaintiff had elected before beginning his common law action to claim compensation under the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act,\u201d whereupon after the jury had been discharged the defendant applied for and obtained leave to add a plea to its other defences that such election had released the defendant from any right of action against it in respect of the injuries he sustained and that his claim for such damages was barred by the provision of the Act.\nAn appeal from the judgment entered by the trial judge on the jury\u2019s findings was taken to the Appellate Division, but the only point raised and argued on the appeal there and afterwards on appeal to this court was as to the effect of the plaintiff\u2019s election and whether it barred plaintiff\u2019s right to recover in this action.\nThe Appellate Division based its judgment, the reasons for which were stated by Mr. Justice Hodgins, upon the fact\nthat the only right given to the Board by the election is that of subrogation\nand when once that has arisen\nthe person possessed of the cause of action can do nothing to prejudice the person subrogated.\nHe further stated that\nthe situation created by the election spoken of in the statute and its consequences cast no additional burden upon the wrongdoer nor any which differs in any way from that which he has brought on himself by this wrongful act. He has no concern with the dealings of the Board and the claimant and, unless he is prejudiced, he has no right to complain. In this case the respondent\u2019s cause of action is not divested: it exists still in him, but, if enforced by him, it must be for the benefit of the Board if he has signed an election.\nAs a result, he stated\nthat the dismissal of the appeal should be preceded by a direction that the amount of the judgment should be paid to the Board to be dealt with by them in due course.\nWith these conclusions of the Divisional Court I am in full accord.\nI agree with the reasons stated by my brothers Idington and Mignault which I have had the opportunity of reading and considering for dismissing the appeal to this court.\nIf the plaintiff had obtained the express authority of the Board to bring the action or a ratification subsequently of his having brought it, that, in the view I take of the legal effect of an election under the \u201cCompensation Act,\u201d would have been a sufficient answer to defendant\u2019s amended plea, because I am clearly of the opinion that such an election cannot and does not discharge a wrongdoer whose negligence has caused damage to another or afford any defence to such an action as the plaintiff\u2019s.\nI cannot, however, accede to the conclusion reached by my brother Anglin that proceedings in the action should be stayed until plaintiff had obtained and filed an authorization of the Board for the bringing and maintenance of the action with the consequence that the plaintiff should be deprived of his costs on this appeal.\nThere are no merits in the appeal. It rests entirely upon what under the circumstances must be called a technical point, and in my judgment the direction in the judgment appealed from,\nthat the amount of the judgment should be paid to the Board to be dealt with by them in due course\namply protects the defendant from any of those injustices which the ingenuity of counsel has conjured up as possible consequences of the absence of express authorization or ratification of the bringing and maintenance of the action by the plaintiff.\nI may add that I do not assent to the assumption of the appeal court that the power of the Board to sue in its own name is necessarily given to it by virtue of the subrogation. On the contrary I incline to think that such a suit or action must be in the name of the party injured to whose rights the Board by virtue of his election is subrogated.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent recovered judgment for injuries caused him, whilst in the employment of the Canada Bread Company as a driver, by negligence of the appellant.\nFor these injuries he would have been entitled to compensation under the provisions of the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act,\u201d of Ontario.\nThe appellant discovered at the trial that respondent had signed a document purporting to elect to receive from the Board administering said Act, such compensation as he would be entitled to under the provisions of said Act.\nThat election, even assuming it to have been operative and effectual, would neither bar nor extinguish the right of action herein in question, but would entitle the Board to continue the action if it so chose.\nSec. 9, sub-sec. 3, of the Act is as follows:\u2014\n(3) If the workman or his dependents elect to claim compensation under this Part the employer, if he is individually liable to pay it, and the Board if the compensation is payable out of the accident fund shall be subrogated to the rights of the workman or his dependents and may maintain an action in his or their names against the person against whom the action lies and any sum recovered from him by the Board shall form part of the accident fund.\nThe employer concerned herein was not individually liable and hence his rights are eliminated from consideration herein.\nThe Board under such circumstances became the beneficiary and entitled to proceed in respondent\u2019s name to recover the damages for the benefit of the accident fund.\nMoreover this sub-section expressly declares that the Board shall be subrogated to the rights of the workman.\nThe rights of the workman at the time when discovery was made of the alleged election were in law to recover herein and the respondent a mere trustee of the Board.\nInstead of adding the Board as a party to the action to make all this clear and instantly effective as I submit might, and perhaps should, have been done, there was adopted a rather roundabout series of unnecessary steps, which, however, resulted in the court of appeal modifying the terms of the judgment so as to render it clear that the recovery was on behalf of and for the Board.\nThe matter should have ended there.\nThe appellant never had any concern in the question of who was to get the money and was only concerned to have all doubt removed as to the possibility of its being called upon in another action using the respondent\u2019s name to re-open the litigation.\nThis it cannot, in face of its resolution put on record herein, purporting to revoke the election made by the respondent, now by any pretence attempt.\nNo doubt it was a proper shrinking from the risks of litigation that led to its adopting the course it did, instead of expressly adopting and ratifying the proceedings, as I hold it was entitled to have done.\nThe election made was something with which appellant had no concern, for that neither helped nor hindered it in any way.\nAnd if those relying upon the doctrine quoted from Lord Blackburn\u2019s judgment in the case of Scarf v. Jardine[6] at pages 360-1, will examine the quotation put forward, they will find not only that that able and accurate judge\u2019s accurate expression of the law not only fails to help appellant in the case of such an election as this was, but, even in a proper case, the election only becomes helpful when\ncommunicated to the other side in such a way as to lead the opposite party to believe that he has made his choice.\nThe election here in question was something between respondent and the Board which in no way altered the rights or obligations of appellant and never was communicated to it, the opposite party in question herein.\nAnd as the delimitation of rights given the Board by the subrogation which the Act expressly gives and defines, requires the application of the proceeds receivable thereby to go to the accident fund, it is to be regretted that through inadvertance the sum of $352.00 was deducted, presumably from what the verdict should have been.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014The decision of this appeal turns upon certain provisions of the Ontario \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act,\u201d that is to say, of sub-secs. 1, 2, 3, 4 of sec. 9, 4 Geo. V., ch. 25, and these provisions are in the following words:\u2014\n9. (1) Where an accident happens to a workman in the course of his employment under such circumstances as entitle him or his dependents to an action against some person other than his employer the workman or his dependents if entitled to compensation under this Part may claim such compensation or may bring such action.\n(2) If an action is brought and less is recovered or collected than the amount of the compensation to which the workman or his dependents are entitled under this Part the difference between the amount recovered and collected and the amount of such compensation shall be payable as compensation to such workman or his dependents.\n(3) If the workman or his dependents elect to claim compensation under this Part, the employer, if he is individually liable to pay it, and the Board if the compensation is payable out of the accident fund, shall be subrogated to the rights of the workman or his dependents and may maintain an action in his or their names against the person against whom the action lies and any sum recovered from him by the Board shall form part of the accident fund.\n(4) The election shall be made and notice of it shall be given within the time and in the manner provided by sec. 7.\nThe accident in respect of which the action was brought occurred on the 17th April, 1918. On the 12th of May the plaintiff made a claim upon the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board for compensation under the Act and on that day executed a document by which he professed to elect to claim compensation from the Board and to forego for the benefit of the Board all rights of action against third parties arising out of the accident. The plaintiff\u2019s claim was allowed by the Board and compensation was awarded to him as from the 17th April, the date of the accident, and for some months was paid, the first payment having been made on 22nd May. The present action was brought on 20th June, 1918.\nThe action was tried in December, 1918, and judgment was given on 18th December against the appellants and after this date certain proceedings were taken by which in effect the Board professed to grant permission to the plaintiff to pursue for his own benefit any right of action he might have against the defendants, notwithstanding his election, and for that purpose giving permission to plaintiff to withdraw his election. It is not disputed that the action was in fact instituted by the plaintiff without the permission of the Board and on his own initiative and for his own benefit.\nThe appellant company contends that the plaintiff conclusively elected to claim and accept compensation from the Board and that by force of the statutory provisions quoted above the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover reparation from the appellant company became beneficially vested in the Compensation Board and that the plaintiff\u2019s action (admittedly as already mentioned instituted on his own behalf) cannot be maintained. The Appellate Division has rejected this view of the effect of sec. 9 and I concur with this conclusion.\nIn sum my view of sec. 9 is this: Its subject matter is the reciprocal rights of the claimant on the one hand and the employer and Compensation Board on the other. The effect of the section may perhaps be more conveniently considered with reference to the case of the employer. As between the employer and the claimant then, the claimant is entitled to choose one of two alternatives. He may claim compensation or he may elect to pursue his remedy against the third party. If he elects to claim compensation, the employer becomes subrogated to the claimant\u2019s rights against the third person; in other words, he becomes entitled to enjoy the benefit of them and may enforce them in the name of the claimant. But all this is intended to be and is a disposition as to the rights of the employer and the claimant inter se. A dispute may arise upon the point whether or not an election has taken place within the meaning of the enactment, but that is a matter to be settled as between employer and claimant. No other party is interested except, of course, a party claiming through one of them.\nAfter the claimant has elected to claim compensation and to give the employer the benefit of his action, it is still open to the employer to allow him to withdraw his election and no third party is entitled to intervene.\nThis view is beset with no difficulties in point of interpretation. The argument advanced on behalf of the appellant rests upon a view of the effect of the word \u201csubrogated\u201d in sub-sec. 3 which makes it equivalent to \u201ctransferred.\u201d But that is not the necessary meaning of the word \u201csubrogated\u201d which points merely to the enjoyment by the party entitled to the subrogation of the rights affected by it. In this view of sec. 9 the third party is amply protected. The term \u201csubrogation\u201d in one very important field of its application in the law of insurance does not confer upon the person enjoying the benefit of subrogation the right to take proceedings in his own name. King v. Victoria Ins. Co[7]; Simpson v. Thomson[8]. It seems a reasonable construction to read the words\nmay maintain an action in his or their names\nas explanatory of the preceding phrase, \u201ctheir names\u201d obviously relating back to \u201cdependents.\u201d This construction finds no little support in the circumstance that the notice of election provided for in sub-sec. 4 of sec. 7 is a notice only to the employer or to the Board.\nIt follows, of course, that the transactions between the Board and the plaintiff are transactions to which for the purpose of this litigation the appellant company is a stranger and that they do not afford any answer to the respondent\u2019s claim in the action.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The effect of sec. 9 of the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d (4 Geo. V. (Ont.), ch. 25), is neither to extinguish the workman\u2019s cause of action upon his making an election to claim compensation under that statute nor to vest his right of action in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, but rather to transfer to the Board the right to control any action brought or to be brought in the workman\u2019s name. The Board is subrogated to his rights and empowered to use his name for the purposes of suit. I doubt whether it can sue in its own name as appears to have been thought in the Appellate Divisional Court.\nWhile, therefore, an absence of authorization of it by the Board is not a defence to the plaintiff\u2019s action, it affords in my opinion a ground upon which that action, carried on without the sanction of the Board, should, upon the application either of the Board itself or of the defendant, be stayed until such an authorization has been obtained and filed with the court in order to prevent possible abuse of its process. Sub-sec. 1 of sec. 9 gives the workman the right either to claim compensation or to bring his action. Read with sub-sec. 3, in the light of sub-sec. 2, however, the effect of this provision would seem to be not entirely to deprive him of the right to sue when he has claimed compensation, but to suspend his right to prosecute an action until the sanction of the Board to his doing so has been secured.\nBoth the Board and the defendant are interested in the action of a man who has claimed compensation being under the control of the Board. Although the appellant asks the dismissal of this action on the ground that under the statute the cause of action is vested in the Board, I think we may not unfairly consider an application for a stay as included in the relief it seeks.\nHad the Board granted in the terms in which it was made the application of the plaintiff\u2019s solicitors of the 8th of January, 1919,\nfor a consent by the Board ratifying all proceedings that have been taken or may hereafter be taken in this action by or on behalf of the plaintiff\u2019s,\ntardy as it would have been, I should have been disposed to accept such an authorization as sufficient to warrant allowing the proceedings to be carried to completion. The defendant would thereby have been given all the protection to which it was entitled. But the Board instead of taking that course sought to put the plaintiff, for the purposes of this action, in the same position as if he had not claimed compensation under the statute, at the same time seeking to reserve under his election to claim such compensation its own right to maintain an action against the present defendant should the plaintiff\u2019s action fail. I cannot think it was competent for the Board to take that course. But whether it was so or not, the document of the 13th February, 1919, signed on its behalf by its secretary is not an authorization of the plaintiff\u2019s action nor a ratification or adoption of it. On the contrary, it is a very plain intimation that the plaintiff\u2019s action must be treated as entirely his own and not as authorized by, or under the control of, the Board.\nIn my opinion proceedings in the action should be stayed to enable the plaintiff to procure and file an authorization of the Board substantially in the terms of his solicitor\u2019s application of the 8th of January. Upon such authorization being filed the appeal should be dismissed but without costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur with the Chief Justice.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The sole grounds of appeal of the appellant company\u2014which, on the jury\u2019s verdict, was condemned to pay $2,500.00 to the respondent\u2014are based on sec. 9 of \u201cThe Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d (Ontario), 4 Geo. V. ch. 25.\nAt the trial it was disclosed that the respondent had elected to claim compensation under the Act, his election being in the following terms:\u2014\nWhereas on or about April 17, 1918, I, Alexander Hutton, employed by Canada Bread Co., of Toronto, received injuries by accident arising out of and in the course of my employment, as follows:\u2014Compound fracture of the leg. And whereas it is alleged that such accident and injuries were caused by the negligence or wrongful act or breach of duty of some person or persons other than my said employer.\nNow, therefore, I, the said claimant, do hereby elect to claim compensation for said injuries under the provision of Part I. of \u201cThe Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d (4 Geo. V., ch. 25, Ontario), and I hereby forego any and all my right or rights of action whatsoever against such third party or parties in respect of such accident and injuries, it being understood that by this election the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board is subrogated to all my rights, rights of action and remedies which otherwise I would have against such third party or parties in respect of said accident and injuries.\nThe appellant contends that this election of the respondent is a complete discharge in its favour. I take it that it does not amount to a discharge, but rather that its effect is that the respondent subrogated the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board to any right which he had against the appellant. Moreover, in my opinion, such an election must be read with sec. 9 in order to determine its legal effect.\nThere was some discussion as to the construction of sec. 9, but upon full consideration it appears to me that this section has not the meaning which the appellant puts on it, and which would in such a case vest the right of recovery solely in the Board.\nIn no way can sec. 9 be considered to be enacted for the benefit or protection of the wrongdoer. It starts out by stating that the injured party, who has by law, and independently of the statute, a right of action\nagainst some person other than his employer,\nmay, if entitled to compensation under the Act claim such compensation or bring such action.\nThen if the action is brought and less is recovered and collected than the amount of the compensation to which the workman or his dependents are entitled under the Act, the difference, between the amount recovered and collected and the amount of the compensation under the Act, shall be payable as compensation to the workman or his dependents.\nIf the workman or his dependents elect to claim compensation under the Act, the employer (if individually liable to pay it) and the Board (if the compen- sation is payable out of the accident fund) are subrogated to the rights of the workman or his dependents,\nand may maintain an action in his or their names against the person against whom the action lies, and any sum recovered from him by the Board shall form part of the accident fund.\nWhile following, although not very closely, the language of the statute, I think I have indicated its meaning. It is clear that the election to claim compensation under the Act does not discharge the wrongdoer, for sub-sec. 3 expressly says that the employer or the Board may maintain an action against him in the name of the workman or of his dependents. And sub\u2011sec. 4, as to the notice of the election to claim compensation under the Act, shews that the election is without any effect quoad the defendant, for notice must be given to the employer or to the Board and never to the wrongdoer. The subrogation mentioned in sub\u2011sec. 3\u2014and perhaps a better word than subrogation could have been used, for at first this term gave me some difficulty\u2014gives the employer or the Board the control of the action of the workman or of his dependents, but does not divest him or them of their right of action against the wrongdoer, or give the latter the right to treat the election to claim compensation under the Act as a discharge from liability. This election does not ensure the granting of compensation by the Board, and therefore it cannot have been intended that by itself it would bar any action against the wrongdoer.\nSo far there appears no serious difficulty, but the appellant having amended its statement of defence at the close of the trial in order to claim that the respondent\u2019s election to take compensation under the Act barred his action against the company, the respondent after the judgment applied to the Board to obtain its consent ratifying all proceedings that had been taken or might be taken in this action by or on behalf of the plaintiff.\nThe Board thereupon made the following order:\u2014\nIn the matter of Claim 74319\u2014Alexander Hutton and\u2014\nIn the matter of an action in the Supreme Court of Ontario, between Alexander Hutton, plaintiff, and the Toronto Railway Company, defendant.\nUpon the application of the plaintiff made unto the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board on Tuesday, the 14th day of January, 1919, and upon hearing counsel for both parties.\nThe Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board hereby consents and agrees that, for the purposes of the said action, the said plaintiff be permitted to withdraw his election to claim compensation from the said Board, and for the said purposes the said Board hereby releases and assigns to the said plaintiff as from the date of the said election all its rights and title to proceed against the said defendant for the cause of action involved therein, provided that, in the event of the said plaintiff\u2019s action failing by reason of the right to bring such action being vested in the said Board, and not in the said plaintiff, the said Board is to be entitled to bring such action as it would have been entitled to bring if this consent and agreement had not been given.\nThe Board\u2019s consent as given goes beyond the relief applied for, and erroneously assumes that the election to claim compensation under the Act vested in the Board any right of action against the wrongdoer, and it unnecessarily purports to assign to the respondent a right of action which he had not lost, the only effect of his election being that the control of his action passed to the Board. I do not therefore think that the Board\u2019s order can in any way help the appellant.\nThe Appellate Division varied the judgment of the learned trial judge so as to order that the appellant do pay to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board the damages recovered by the respondent, to be dealt with by it pursuant to the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\u201d The respondent has not cross-appealed and the appellant appears to me without interest to com- plain of this modification of the judgment. By paying the damages according to the judgment it will be discharged from any possible claim either by the respondent or by the Board. The whole ground of its appeal to this Court was that the election of the respondent to claim compensation under the Act barred his action, and in that the appellant fails, so that in my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Dewart, Harding, Maw & Hodgson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Proudfoot, Duncan, Grant & Gilday.\n[1] 45 Ont.

I am of the opinion that the carefully reasoned judgment of the Appellate Division delivered by Mr. Justice Ferguson dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action is correct. The learned judge has in that judgment stated fully all the material facts and circumstances necessary to reach a conclusion on the points in controversy and as I am in full accord with his findings alike in law and in fact, I cannot see any useful purpose to be gained in again re-stating them with any fullness. In substance they were that the purchase by the respondents Bickell & Co. of the 50,000 bushels of corn in question on the order given to them by the witness Symmes on the 26th August was fully authorized by the plaintiff and that the subsequent sale by the defendants of that corn on the 28th of August owing to a sudden slump in its market price was justified under the conditions subject to which the brokers transacted the business of buying and selling grain for the plaintiff. One of these conditions was that in marginal business which included the one in question the right was reserved by the brokers of closing the transactions without further notice when margins were unsatisfactory. The other finding, reversing the trial judge, was that the transactions in question were not within the prohibitions of section 231 of the Criminal Code; that they were on the contrary bon\u00e2 fide transactions made for good consideration on the Chicago Board of Trade; and that there was no evidence of any express, implied or tacit understanding that the contracts so made were not enforceable or that any loss or gain in reference to the price of the commodities contracted for should be paid by a settlement of differences. Nelson v. Baird[1]. In other words, that the purchase and sale of the wheat in question at the times and in the manner in which it was bought and sold were bon\u00e2 fide trans- actions authorized by the plaintiff and were not illegal gambling transactions within the provisions of sec. 231 of the Criminal Code. See Forget v. Ostigny[2].\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This appeal depends entirely upon a single question of fact on which the two courts below have concurred.\nThat question is whether or not appellant authorized Symmes to employ respondents to make on his (appellant\u2019s) behalf the purchase of 50,000 bushels of May corn in question.\nAnd its answer depends upon the veracity of Symmes in the circumstances.\nIf ever there was a case in which the trial judge\u2019s opinion on the facts must be held, by reason of his seeing and hearing the witnesses, to have had such superior advantages that his opinion must be accepted, this certainly is one.\nSymmes\u2019s mode of thought and manner of answering questions give rise to some suspicion of whether he was trifling with the court and counsel, or merely beset by an absent-minded sort of condition which prevented him from concentrating his mind upon the questions put to him. The learned trial judge alone of those having to consider these peculiar features could, from the advantages he had of watching and hearing the witness, rightly appreciate and determine what importance is to be attached thereto.\nSometimes, indeed often, there exists in a case some outstanding undoubted fact or set of circumstances which may enable an appellate court to overrule the trial judge\u2019s appreciation of the credibility of the respective witnesses on either side of a case, but herein I am unable to find anything of that kind as a guide to support me in maintaining this appeal. Indeed what there is seems to tend the other way. The witness Symmes says, and is not contradicted as he might easily have been if speaking untruly, that though an extensive dealer in the sort of bargaining involved in buying and holding by virtue of margins in and through a broker\u2019s office, he had not up to that time in question so dealt in grain but had confined his operations to dealing in stocks.\nOn the other hand the appellant had been for five months previously constantly dealing, through respondents, in grain chiefly if not solely.\nWhy he should not with such an amount as he had lying idle in respondents\u2019 hands, and not apparently needed for anything else, respond to the chance presented, I see no reasonable explanation for.\nMoreover his conduct and expressions later hardly consist with what he now sets up.\nAnd the transaction does not fit into the only suggestion made in the way of explaining why the witness Symmes should suddenly depart from his accustomed means of enjoying the excitement of the market and enter on a new field therein.\nMoreover there is no explanation of why, if he did so, he should have reported such a deal to appellant on returning to his place.\nThat he did so is corroborated by another witness who could not testify to hearing appellant\u2019s answer, yet does confirm the fact of Symmes reporting it as he says he did.\nThe learned trial judge\u2019s judgment having been concurred in by the Appellate Division I think we cannot reverse under such circumstances.\nThe respondents\u2019 right to resell the grain to protect themselves against loss, if it rested upon the elementary legal right which arises when A. tells B. to go and buy for him and pay so much on account of the purchase and hold it for him might give rise to difficult questions of law and the authorities which appellant\u2019s counsel cites as relevant would help perhaps to another solution of the case giving rise to this appeal than that reached by the Appellate Division.\nI agree entirely with the view of the facts taken by the judgment of the Appellate Division, and think there is ample evidence from which it may and should be inferred that appellant knew and approved of the usual course of the respondents in conducting such like business as he entrusted to them and the right which they were likely to assert in case of necessity to protect themselves against loss on his account.\nThat was reduced to writing well known to appellant, according to my view of the evidence (though I admit it might have been better to have gone a step further in making the proof quite conclusive by calling the mailing clerk as to this transaction), which is set forth in Ex. 15, as follows:\u2014\nPurchases or Sales are made subject in all respects to the Rules, By-laws and Customs existing at the time at the Exchange where executed, and also with the distinct understanding that actual delivery is contemplated and that the party giving the orders agrees to these terms. It is agreed between broker and customer, that all securities from time to time carried in the customer\u2019s marginal account, or deposited to protect the same, may be loaned by the broker, or may be pledged by him either separately or together with other securities, either for the sum due thereon, or for a greater sum, all without further notice to the customer. It is further understood that on marginal business the right is reserved to close transactions without further notice when margins are unsatisfactory.\nThe four or five months of appellant\u2019s existence as a \u201croomer\u201d so called in respondents\u2019 office, did not leave him ignorant of this basis of all his dealings with respondents including that in question, and he has not pretended to say he was ignorant or to deny the receipt of, I imagine, scores of such notices as governing the contractual relations between him and respondents so far as they concerned the brokerage business done by them on his behalf.\nI cannot, therefore, discard that which is therein set forth as forming part and parcel of the understanding existent between these parties, or doubt the efficacy of the last sentence thereof as maintaining respondents\u2019 right to do as now complained of by appellant.\nThe judgment of the Appellate Division sets forth in more detail the facts and circumstances bearing on that issue of fact in such a forcible way that I need not enlarge by repetition of same here.\nMy view of the question of illegality raised by the learned trial judge, so far as of any moment herein, is briefly this: that the counsel on each side being now agreed that if there was in fact an employment of the respondents, it was to conduct purchases on the Grain Exchange in Chicago; I am, therefore, unable to see how our Criminal Code can have any possible effect on contractual relations formed there.\nWe have no proof of illegality relative to the contracts of such a nature there.\nI adhere to my view expressed in Beamish v. Richardson & Sons[3], relative to the law applicable thereto in circumstances such as in evidence in that case.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014This appeal turns upon the question whether the unanimous finding of the Appellate Division to the effect that according to the terms under which the appellant and the respondents had conducted their dealings the respondents were entitled\nto close transactions without * * * notice when margins are unsatisfactory.\nI think this finding is adequately supported by the evidence and that the contracts acquired for his benefit under the transactions of the 21st and 26th August were held under these terms.\nIt seems necessary to add a reference to the opinion of the learned trial judge that on the authority of Beamish v. Richardson & Sons[4], the orders given by the appellant were illegal under sec. 231 of the Criminal Code.\nI am by no means certain that the transactions contemplated by the appellant\u2019s orders were in any relevant sense distinguishable from the transactions which certain members of this court held to be illegal in Beamish v. Richardson4. The purchases authorized by the appellant\u2019s orders were to be purchases in the corn pit of the Chicago Board of Trade and in the usual course of business, that is to say, by agents in Chicago; with the consequence that in the absence of agreement to the contrary, the agents would contract as principals and not as representatives, in other words, the purchases and sales would be purchases and sales enforceable only by the agent. Robinson v. Mollett[5].\nThe contracts which were the subject of discussion in Beamish v. Richardson4, were contracts subject to the \u201crules, regulations and customs\u201d of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange and the Winnipeg Clearing House Association, and were contracts in which, by virtue of the rules of the Exchange, the brokers were necessarily principals on the one hand as buyers or sellers and the Clearing House Association on the other as seller or buyer; and it was made quite clear in the evidence that the vast majority of transactions in grain in Winnipeg at that time took place through the instrumentality of the Grain Exchange and the Clearing House Association, in other words, that the Grain Exchange and the Clearing House Association were not merely conveniences for speculation but together constituted a large market where a great deal of the grain and provision business in Canada were transacted, the brokers, Richardson & Co., being commission merchants trading very largely on their own account on this market. It was made quite clear also that a commission merchant entering into a contract with the Clearing House Association to buy or sell would understand that he must carry out that contract either by actual payment or delivery or by set-off payments against exigible obligations under some other real contract. Such a system of carrying on business of course affords opportunities for speculation and must largely be used for that purpose; and the contracts in question being of the character mentioned, it was held by some members of this Court (in Beamish v. Richardson[6]), that because the customer\u2019s intention was by means of such contracts to speculate in futures merely, with no expectation either of delivering or taking delivery in kind of any commodity, the transactions fell under the ban of the section of the Criminal Code above referred to. Beamish v. Richardson6, nevertheless, is not a decision upon any point as to the application of that section. My brother Idington and my brother Brodeur based their judgment, it is true, upon the view just explained of the effect of the Code, but my brother Anglin, though expressing an inclination of opinion in the same direction, explicitly stated that he did not rest his judgment upon that ground; while the remaining members of the court (the Chief Justice and myself) took the opposite view.\nIn these circumstances I should not consider these opinions (which did not form in whole or in part the ratio decidendi), to be binding on me judicially and I should not feel at liberty to act as if they relieved me from the responsibility of forming and giving effect to my own view. Ex parte Willey[7], at page 127.\nI may add that I entirely concur in the opinion expressed in the judgment of Mr. Justice Ferguson that sec. 231 of the Criminal Code does not reach the transactions under consideration on this appeal.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Ferguson in delivering the unanimous judgment of the Appellate Divisional Court to which I feel that I can usefully add nothing unless it be to supplement Nelson v. Baird[8], cited by the learned judge on the question of the defendants\u2019 right for his and their protection to sell the plaintiff\u2019s corn, which they were carrying for him, by a reference to Foster v. Murphy[9]; Leiter v. Thomas[10], and Belleau v. Lagueux[11].\nBRODEUR J.:\u2014This is a suit between a customer and his broker concerning the purchase of corn on margin.\nThe transactions between them were very numer- ous and very extensive. It appears that at a certain date, on the 23rd of August, 1916, the plaintiff Maloof had to his credit a balance of about $2,000 and that the respondents, his brokers, were holding for him a corn purchase of 25,000 bushels of December corn. He left Toronto, where these speculations were carried on, on the above date, for the Cobalt district, with some friends amongst whom was a Mr. Symmes who is also an active stock operator.\nOn the 26th of August, Symmes called on the telephone the respondent firm to inquire about the market conditions; and, receiving a favourable reply, he gave instructions to purchase for Maloof 50,000 bushels of May corn. He claims that he was authorized by Maloof to give such instructions. Maloof denies it; but Symmes\u2019 story was accepted by the courts below and I am convinced myself that if Maloof has not given formal authority to Symmes he has at least adopted the order which was given.\nThat was on a Saturday. On the following Monday the market turned for the worse and the brokers telegraphed to Maloof for margin money. No answer to their request being received, the respondent company sold the 75,000 bushels of corn they were holding for Maloof.\nThey claim having acted on a well known condition of their stock transactions and which are to be found on their confirmation notices of purchase which contained the following:\u2014\nIt is agreed between broker and customer, that all securities from time to time carried in the customer\u2019s marginal account, or deposited to protect the same, may be loaned by the broker, or may be pledged by him either separately or together with other securities either for the sum due thereon or for a greater sum, all without further notice to the customer. It is further understood that on marginal business the right is reserved to close transactions without further notice when margins are unsatisfactory. The plaintiff cannot very easily deny knowledge of those conditions. He was day by day, and week by week, in the office of the respondent company: in fact, his mail was being received there and undoubtedly he was aware, according to my opinion, of the conditions under which Bickell & Co. were carrying on marginal transactions. According to those conditions Bickell & Co. had the power to sell for the plaintiff the securities which they had in their possession. They asked for money on the 28th August. The market was then in a very bad condition; war had been declared the day before (27th August) by Roumania and on Monday morning corn in Winnipeg and Chicago opened four cents lower than the closing on Saturday. The decline was more than sufficient to wipe out the $2,000 that Maloof had to at his credit the 23rd of August.\nAnother question has been raised in this case as to whether this transaction was a bon\u00e2 fide transaction or one in violation of the provisions of the Criminal Code.\nI would be inclined to think that this case cannot be distinguished from the case of Beamish v. Richardson[12]; but it is not necessary for me to base my judgment upon this ground.\nI am satisfied that the plaintiff has no case and that the judgment of the courts below dismissing his action should be confirmed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The litigation here has arisen out of grain transactions on margin carried out by the respondents, who are stock and grain brokers, on behalf of the appellant, on the Chicago market.\nAs all the facts are fully stated in the judgments appealed from, I may very briefly say that the appel- lant was a large speculator in grain, and for several months\u2014during the greater part of which he spent most of his time in the respondents\u2019 office, where he received his mail and was known as a \u201croom trader\u201d\u2014he had bought and sold grain on the Chicago market through the respondents. On August 23rd, 1916, the appellant had a balance of over $2,000.00 in his favour in the respondents\u2019 books, and the latter had, on August 21st, purchased for him, on his order, 25,000 bushels of December corn at 74. On the evening of August 23rd, the appellant left Toronto with a party, including Mr. H.D. Symmes, a prominent engineer, for Sesikinika Lake, in Northern Ontario, where he had a house. On the 26th August, a Saturday, Mr. Symmes telephoned to the respondents from Sesikinika, instructing them to purchase at the market price for the appellant 50,000 bushels of May corn, which the respondents bought at 78\u00be and 78\u215e, and of this purchase the respondents at once advised the appellant by a telegram sent to Sesikinika. On Monday, the 28th August, the news that Roumania had entered the war caused a break in the grain market and the respondents, in the forenoon of Monday, sent the following telegram to the appellant at Sesikinika:\u2014\nRoumania declared war on Austria. Wheat broke nine cents bushel. December corn now seventy-three. May seventy-seven. Please let us have two thousand. Answer.\nReceiving no reply, at about the close of the market, in the afternoon of August 28th, Mr. Cash-man, of the respondents\u2019 firm, gave orders to close out the appellant\u2019s account, and to sell his 75,000 bushels of corn. The December corn was sold at 72\u00bc and the May corn at 75\u00bd and 75\u215d, with the result that the balance standing to the appellant\u2019s credit on August 23rd, was wiped out, and he became indebted to the respondents in the sum of $156.62. Two questions are involved on this appeal. 1st. Was Mr. Symmes authorized by the appellant to order the purchase of 50,000 bushels of May corn? 2nd. Had the respondents the right to sell out the appellant\u2019s holdings?\nThe learned trial judge found that Mr. Symmes was authorized by the appellant to purchase the 50,000 bushels of May corn, and in this finding the learned judges of the Appellate Division concur. I would not disturb this finding of fact, the more so as the testimony of the appellant and of Mr. Symmes was directly contradictory on this point, and the learned trial judge believed the latter.\nThe second question is not free from difficulty. The notice printed on the confirmation form, that on marginal business the right was reserved to close transactions without further notice where margins were unsatisfactory\u2014assuming that the appellant had received several similar notices, which appears to be a fair inference\u2014is printed in very small type and could be easily overlooked. But the appellant for months had been dealing on a large scale with the respondents, entirely on margin, spending most of his time in the respondents\u2019 office, and he had from time to time been called on to furnish margins, and I cannot believe that he did not fully understand, when he told Mr. Symmes to purchase 50,000 bushels of May corn, that additional margin, over and above the sum standing to his credit, and on the strength of which he no doubt considered the purchase of 25,000 bushels of December corn fully covered, would be required to carry so large a transaction, especially as he was far away and fluctuations in the market could be expected. For the respondents, the carrying of 75,000 bushels of corn in the sudden collapse of the grain market, meant a liability of $750.00 for each cent of decline, and I do not think that they were obliged, not having received an answer to their telegram demanding $2,000.00, to assume such a liability. It is true that the appellant did not receive the respondents\u2019 telegrams, including one of August 28th, informing him of the sale of the 75,000 bushels, until the afternoon or evening of Tuesday, August 29th, but that was the appellant\u2019s misfortune\u2014being at a place where there was no telegraphic communication, and where telegrams had to be telephoned from Swastika some distance away\u2014and not the respondents\u2019 fault. I find that the respondents did what was possible to advise the appellant of the situation that had suddenly developed, and the appellant cannot blame them if their efforts to reach him in time were unavailing.\nThe learned trial judge dismissed the appellant\u2019s action and the respondents\u2019 counterclaim for $156.62 on the ground that the transactions in question amounted to gambling transactions, prohibited as such by article 231 of the Criminal Code. The Appellate Division, on the contrary, decided that they were real purchases and sales under the authority of Forget v. Ostigny[13], and similar cases. In this I agree, but I think, for the reasons stated above, that the appellant\u2019s appeal here fails. The counterclaim of the respondents is no longer in question, the latter not having appealed from the judgment of the trial court by which it was dismissed.\nThe appeal in my opinion should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Johnston, McKay, Dods & Grant.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Dewart, Harding, Maw & Hodgson.\n[1] 25 Man.

Barriers were erected across this pipe-line on both sides of the wire and on each barrier was posted a warning of danger. S., a boy twelve years old, attempted to cross the ravine by the pipe-line and having climbed around a barrier came into contact with the wire and was badly injured. In an action against the power company for damages the jury found that children were not in the habit of going on the pipe-line at the place where the accident occurred.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division (45 Ont. L.R. 449), that owing to this finding of the jury, and the fact that the company could have no reason to suppose that any person would get into a position of danger from the wire the action must fail.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], affirming the judgment at the trial which dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action.\nThe facts are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nAug. Lemieux for the appellant. There should be perfect protection against danger from such an agent as electricity. See Royal Electric Co. v. H\u00e9v\u00e9[2] at pages 466-7 and 470-1; Gloster v. Toronto Electric Light Co.[3] at pages 33 and 39.\nThe defendant company was bound to anticipate contact with the wires and should have had them insulated; Thomas v. Wheeling Electrical Co.[4]\nR.S. Robertson for the respondents referred to Groves v. Wimborne[5]; Woods v. Winskill[6], at page 309.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellants in support of very numerous complaints of error on the part of the learned trial judge in directing, or failing to direct, the jury, are unable to point to any objection by counsel at the trial in regard to any of these alleged misdirections or non\u2011directions which are now for the first time as to the greater part of them brought forward as grounds for relief.\nNeedless to say such grounds are too late and must be discarded. They are, moreover, in substance, so far as I have heard in argument, quite untenable.\nThere seems no ground upon which relief can be given for the reason that the judgment appealed from is right.\nThe rather startling proposition that there were regulations expressly applicable which had been overlooked by solicitors in bringing the action, and counsel in conducting it, and the learned judge in trying it, held our attention for a time, but it seems to turn out to be quite unfounded in fact.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. DUFF J.\u2014I concur in the view of the Chief Justice of the Appellate Division that an insuperable obstacle to the appellant\u2019s success lies in the finding of the jury that boys were not in the habit of frequenting the place where the unfortunate appellant was injured.\nMr. Lemieux contends that the admitted facts give rise to liability under sec. 37 of the \u201cPower Commission Act\u201d of Ontario as amended by ch. 19, sec. 37 of the Ontario statute of 1916. His contention is that the wires from contact with which the appellant received the injuries from which he suffers, were not insulated as required by the regulations under this statute and that the respondents are answerable for the consequences in damages.\nI do not find it necessary to consider the construction of sec. 37 with a view to ascertain whether a right of action is given in respect of the harm caused in consequence of the default of companies or individuals in observing any duty arising out of regulations brought into existence under the authority of the enactment. The regulations produced are\nprinted by order of the Legislative Assembly\nare stated in the preface to\nhave reference only to inside work in ordinary buildings\nand moreover, it is explicitly declared that electric work involving potentials exceeding 5,000 volts are not taken into consideration; and further the notes attached to the rules (A) and (B) upon which Mr. Lemieux desires to base his claim, make it quite clear that these rules apply only to conditions obtaining in some place which in ordinary language would be described as a building.\nIt is quite clear that we should not be justified in granting a new trial to enable Mr. Lemieux\u2019s client to put forward a claim based upon these regulations. ANGLIN J.\u2014A perusal of the evidence has satisfied me that the learned trial judge was right in holding that it discloses no duty owing to the plaintiff by the defendant which it failed to perform and therefore dismissing this action. I agree that there was no evidence proper to be submitted to the jury in support of the plaintiff\u2019s charge of negligence.\nIn view of the improbability of even a venturesome and mischievous boy seeking to walk across a ravine 17-19 feet deep and 300 feet wide on a 12 inch pipe carried on trestles, and of the precautions which the defendant had taken by posting conspicuous \u201cdanger\u201d notices near the place where the plaintiff\u2019s son was injured, which he saw and understood to be such, and making it still more difficult of access by the placing of barricades which any person travelling along the pipe would be obliged either to climb over or to swing around, there was no reason to apprehend that children might find an opportunity of making the company\u2019s high voltage wire crossing nearly four feet above its pipe line a source of danger to themselves or others such as led this court to find negligence and consequent liability in the recent cases of Salter and Geall v. The Dominion Creosoting Co.[7] The principle of the decision in McDowall v. Great Western Rly. Co.[8], there distinguished, I think governs this case. As put by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario:\nIt seems to me that what the respondent company did was just the same as if it had a patrolman who said \u201cdon\u2019t go over into that enclosure. It is dangerous to go there.\u201d And it shocks my common sense to think that a boy or a person who had been warned in that way and does go there and is injured by something he did not anticipate to find, should be entitled to recover.\nIn this court, however, the plaintiff asks that if he should not be entitled to judgment on the case as presented at the trial he should be granted a new trial to enable him to bring before a trial court certain rules and regulations of the Hydro-Electric Power Commission made under the authority of sec. 37 of the \u201cPower Commission Act,\u201d R.S.O. 1914, ch. 39, as enacted by 6 Geo. V. ch. 19, not adverted to in the courts below, which he maintains either directly impose a duty on the defendant which it failed to fulfil or afford evidence of a standard of due care, omission to observe which would constitute negligence on its part. A copy of these regulations\nprinted by order of the Legislative Assembly\nhas been furnished to us.\nIn the first place sub-sec. 8 of sec. 37 itself provides that\nnothing in this Act shall affect the liability of * * * any company, firm or individual for damages caused to any person or property by reason of any defect in any electric works, plant, machinery, apparatus, appliances, device, material or equipment or in the installation or protection thereof.\nSecondly, in the preface to the rules and regulations so published we are informed that they\nhave reference only to inside work in ordinary buildings, e.g., residences, workhouses, factories, etc., and such work may be attached to the outside of such buildings and to the wiring of electric railways, cars and car houses,\nand that all electric work involving potentials exceeding 5,000 volts is not taken into consideration. Finally, in the notes appended to the particular rules (a) and (d) found under the heading \u201cHigh Potential Work, (650-5,000 volts),\u201d which the appellant seeks to invoke it is again made clear that they relate to high potentials in buildings.\nWe are here concerned with an outside transmission line far distant from any building and carrying a current of 11,000 volts. In my opinion these rules and regu- lations could not be successfully invoked by the appellant for any purpose in this case.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by my brother Anglin.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The appellant, a boy of twelve years, was injured by falling from a pipe line of the respondent crossing a ravine and on which he was walking. At about four feet above the pipe line were high voltage wires, and the appellant having touched these wires received a shock which threw him to the ground, causing his injuries.\nThe appellant\u2019s action having come to trial before Mr. Justice Masten and a jury, the latter answered the questions put to them as follows:\nQuestion 1: Was the plaintiff on the pipe line where the accident occurred with the knowledge or permission of the defendants? Ans.: No.\nQuestion 2: Were children and other persons in the habit of walking on the defendants\u2019 pipe lines to the knowledge of the defendants? Ans.: Yes. And if so where? Ans.: Principally on the main line.\nQuestion 3: If so, did the defendants object or seek to prevent that practice? Ans.: No.\nQuestion 4: Were children or others in the habit of walking on the defendants\u2019 pipe lines at the place where the accident occurred? Ans.: No.\nQuestion 5: If so, were the defendants aware of the practice? Ans.: No.\nQuestion 6: Was the plaintiff aware that the barricade and notice thereon was intended to warn persons not to walk on the pipe line at that place? Ans.: Yes.\nQuestion 7: In the construction or maintenance of their lines, were the defendants guilty of any negligence which occasioned the accident? Ans.: Yes.\nQuestion 8: If so, in what did such negligence consist? Ans.: In the electric wires being too close to the pipes. Question 9: If you find that the defendants are liable, at what sum do you assess the damages? Ans.:\nTo the Infant plaintiff.\n$2,500\nTo the Father.\n410\nAt the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, the respondent had moved for a non-suit. This motion was reserved until the evidence for the defence had been put in and the case had gone to the jury. The motion was then renewed and the learned trial judge, without determining whether the plaintiff was a trespasser or a licensee when walking on the pipe line of the defendant, found that the evidence did not disclose any duty owing to the plaintiff by the defendant which the latter failed to observe and perform. He also found that there was no evidence proper to be submitted to the jury in support of question No. 7 or upon which they could find as they had. The motion for a non-suit was therefore allowed and the action dismissed with costs. This judgment was upheld, on appeal, by the Appellate Division.\nTaking the findings of the jury as they are, the answers to questions 7 and 8, in my opinion, impute no negligence to the respondent on which legal liability can be predicated against it. The jury found that children or others were not in the habit of walking on the defendant\u2019s pipe line at the place where the accident occurred, and also, in answer to question 1, that the plaintiff was not on the pipe line where the accident occurred with the knowledge or permission of the defendant. Even if the answer to question 2 could by itself be taken as a finding that children and other persons were in the habit of walking on the defendant\u2019s pipe lines generally to the latter\u2019s knowledge, the reply given to question 4 shews clearly that the answer to question 2 should not be construed as a finding that children or others were in the habit of walking on the branch pipe line where the accident happened. Taking all the answers together, it would seem, although the learned trial judge did not think it necessary to determine the point, that the plaintiff was a trespasser on the pipe line where he was injured, and the jury\u2019s answer to question 6 seems to put this beyond any doubt. This would defeat his action under the authority of Maritime Coal, Railway & Power Co. v. Herdman[9] unless the respondent failed in a duty which it owed him as such trespasser.\nI cannot find that the respondent failed in any such duty. At the argument, the appellant\u2019s counsel referred to the rules and regulations issued by the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario, under the authority of the statute 6 Geo. V. (Ont.) ch. 19, sec. 37, and asked this court to order a new trial so as to permit him to file these rules and regulations in the record. But if the rules in force in 1916, and of which he sent us a copy, prohibited the respondent from maintaining the high voltage wires where they are over the pipe lines, effect could probably be given to them without ordering a new trial, unless more testimony than that actually given were required. Unfortunately, however, for the appellant these rules and regulations, which were framed for the purpose of inside electrical installations, do not apply to the respondents\u2019 wires or to their installation and maintenance where they are. Moreover, as shewn by sub-sec. 8 of sec. 37, the intention of the statute was not to affect the liability of the company for damages caused by reason of defective installation or protection of electric works or appliances.\nThe question therefore remains whether it was negligence to have these wires at a distance of four feet or thereabouts above the pipe line where the accident occurred. In the absence of any statutory prohibition, and in view of the jury\u2019s finding that children or others were not in the habit of walking there, I am clearly of the opinion that this question must be answered in the negative.\nThe pipe over which the plaintiff attempted to walk was a twelve inch pipe carried on trestles, and in the deepest part of the ravine was seventeen feet above the ground. To walk on it, even without the high voltage transmission wires, was extremely hazardous to say the least. A sign had been placed at this spot with the words \u201cDanger, 11,000 volts\u201d in large letters, and a barricade had been erected to prevent anyone going along the pipe. The defendant certainly could not have anticipated that any one would walk over this pipe and be injured by coming in contact with the wires. Under these circumstances, a verdict of negligence against the defendant is one which the jury, considering the whole of the evidence, could not reasonably find.\nIn my opinion the appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Auguste Lemieux.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Fasken, Robertson, Chadwick & Sedgewick.\n[1] 45 Ont.

John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton ([1915] A.C. 330; 18 D.L.R. 353, distinguished, Davies C.J. and Mignault J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThis appeal raises the same question as that in the case immediately preceding.\nThe material provisions of the Manitoba \"Companies Act,\" the validity of which is in question, are the following:\u2014\n106. In this part, except where the context requires otherwise; the expression \"corporation'' means a company, institution or corporation created otherwise than by or under the authority of an Act of the Legislature of Manitoba.\n108. Corporations of the classes mentioned in this section are required to take out a license under this part, viz.:\nClass V\u2014Corporations (other than those mentioned in section 107) created by or under the authority of an Act of the Parliament of Canada, and authorized to carry on business in Manitoba;\nClass VI\u2014Corporations not coming within any of the foregoing classes. 118. No corporation coming within Class V or VI shall carry on within Manitoba any of its business unless and until a license under this part so to do has been granted to it, and unless such license is in force, and no company, firm, broker, agent or other person shall, as the representative or agent of or acting in any other capacity for any such corporation, carry on any of its business in Manitoba unless and until such corporation has received such license and unless such license is in force; provided that taking orders for or buying or selling goods, wares and merchandise by travellers or by correspondence, if the corporation has no resident agent or representative and no office or place of business in Manitoba, shall not be deemed a carrying on of business within the meaning of this part; provided also that the onus of proving that a corporation has no resident agent or representative and no office or place of business in Manitoba shall, in any prosecution for an offence against this section, rest upon the accused.\n122. If any corporation coming within Class V or VI shall, contrary to the provisions of section 118, carry on in Manitoba any part of its business, such corporation shall incur a penalty of fifty dollars for every day upon which it so carries on business, and so long as it remains unlicensed under this part it shall not be capable of maintaining any action, suit or other proceeding in any Court in Manitoba in respect of any contract made in whole or in part within Manitoba in the course of or in connection with business carried on contrary to the provisions of said section 118; provided, however, that upon the granting or restoration of the license, or the removal of any suspension thereof, such action, suit or other proceeding may be maintained as if such license had been granted or restored, or such suspension had been removed, before the institution thereof.\n123. If any company, firm, broker, agent or other person shall, contrary to the provisions of section 118, as the representative or agent of or acting in any other capacity for a corporation, carry on any of its business in Manitoba, such company, firm, broker, agent or other person shall incur a penalty of twenty dollars for every day upon which it, he or they so carry on such business.\n119. No company, corporation or other institution not incorporated under the provisions of the statutes of this Province, shall be capable of acquiring, holding, mortgaging, alienating or otherwise disposing of or lending money on the security of any real estate within this Province, unless under license issued under any statute of this Province in that behalf.\n(2) The foregoing provisions of this section 119 shall apply whether the said company, corporation or institution directly acquires, holds, mortgages, alienates, or otherwise disposes of, or lends money on the security of any real estate within the Province, or through any agent, personal or otherwise.\n112. A corporation receiving a license under this part may, subject to the limitations and conditions of the license, and subject to the provisions of its own charter, Act of incorporation or other creating instrument acquire, hold, mortgage, alienate and otherwise dispose of real estate in Manitoba and any interest therein to the same extent and for the same purposes and subject to the same conditions and limitations as if such corporation had been incorporated under Part I of this Act, with power to carry on the business and exercise the powers embraced in the license.\n*************\n113. The powers of any corporation, licensed under the provisions of this part, with respect to acquiring and holding real estate, shall be limited in its license to such annual or actual value as may be deemed proper.\n126. For a license to a corporation coming within Class V or VI, such corporation shall pay to His Majesty for the public uses of Manitoba such fees as may be fixed by the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council, and no license shall be issued until the fee therefor is paid; provided that, with respect to a corporation carrying on outside of Manitoba an established business, when applying for a license under this part, the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council may reduce the fee payable for such license to such sum as he may think just, having regard to the nature and importance of the business proposed to be carried on in Manitoba and the amount of capital proposed to be used therein. A corporation seeking a reduction under this section shall give to the Provincial Secretary such statements and information respecting its business and financial position as he may call for, and shall verify the same in such manner as he may require.\n(2) There shall be paid to His Majesty for the public uses of Manitoba, upon transmitting to the Provincial Secretary the statement required by section 120, the fee of five dollars if the capital stock of the corporation does not exceed the sum of one hundred thousand dollars, and a fee of ten dollars if the capital stock of the corporation exceeds the said sum of one hundred thousand dollars, and until such fee has been paid such statement shall be deemed not to have been made and transmitted as required by said section.\n109. A corporation coming within Class V shall, upon complying with the provisions of this part and the regulations made hereunder, receive a license to carry on its business and exercise its powers in Manitoba.\n110. A corporation coming within Class VI may, upon complying with the provisions of this part and the regulations made hereunder, receive a license to carry on the whole or such parts of its business and exercise the whole or such parts of its powers in Manitoba as may be embraced in the license; subject, however, to such limitations and conditions as may be specified therein.\n121. If a corporation receiving a license under this part makes default in observing or complying with the limitations and conditions of such license, or the provisions of the next preceding section, or the regulations respecting the appointment and continuance of a representative in Manitoba, the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council may suspend or revoke such license in whole or in part, and may remove such suspension or cancel such revocation and restore such license. Notice of such suspension, revocation, removal or restoration shall be given by the Provincial Secretary in The Manitoba Gazette.\nThe trial court and Court of Appeal held these provisions intra vires.\nWenegast for the appellant\nLionel Davis for the respondent\nChrysler K.C. for the Saskatchewan Government.\nC. C. Robinson for the Dominion of Canada.\nNesbitt K C. and Barton for the Province of Ontario.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting) \u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba which, on an equal division of opinion amongst the judges of that court, upheld the judgment of the trial judge affirming the constitutionality of those provisions of the Manitoba \"Companies Act\" which were in question in that case.\nThe case was one in effect asking the court to construe and apply to the sections in question of that Act the principles laid down by the Judicial Committee in the case of John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[1], which should govern and control provincial legislation with regard to Dominion companies.\nAmongst those principles it was stated by their Lordships of the Judicial Committee that the\nprovince cannot legislate so as to deprive a Dominion company of its status and powers.\nTheir Lordships went on, however, to state that this does not mean that the companies could exercise those powers in contravention of the laws of the province generally, but simply that the status and powers of the Dominion company as such cannot be destroyed by provincial legislation, and they held that it followed from those premises that the provisions of the Act of British Columbia there in question, compelling the Dominion company to obtain a provincial license or to be registered in the province as a condition of exercising its powers or of suing in the courts, are inoperative or these purposes\nApplying these principles and this conclusion of their Lordships to the case of the sections of the Manitoba statute now before us, I cannot reach any other conclusion than that these sections are ultra vires.\nI have, in my reasons for judgment in the case before us on the Saskatchewan \"Companies Act,\" argued at the same time as this appeal was, stated shortly why I reached the conclusions that the sections there in question were not ultra vires of the legislature excepting one section requiring the company carrying on business within the province to take out a licence from the province to enable it to do so, and I there suggested that that one section might and should be construed as applicable only to foreign companies other than Dominion ones. In the case now before us, however, the legislation of Manitoba is entirely different from that of the Province of Saskatchewan, which latter legislation had been revised after the decision of the Judicial Committee in the Wharton Case[2], with the evident intention of complying with the principles laid down in that case.\nIt seems to be clear from the decision of the Judicial Committee in the Wharton Case2, that while to some extent a provincial legislature may regulate and tax the activities within the province of a Dominion company, it cannot for any purpose prohibit or restrict its entry into the province or its carrying on business there. The primary question then with respect to this Manitoba legislation is whether the provisions of Part IV of its \"Companies Act,\" purporting to confer upon such companies when a provincial licence has been obtained, and while it is in force, power to carry on business in Manitoba, exercise their powers, enforce their legal rights in the courts on contracts or otherwise and hold land necessary for their business and until the licence has been granted or after it has ceased to be in force to prohibit them from doing any and all of these things, are ultra vires of the provincial legislature.\nIn my opinion, such legislation, if upheld, would directly deprive the company of its status and powers conferred upon it by its Dominion charter and is clearly contrary to the principles laid down by the Judicial Committee in the Wharton Case[3] as those which should control and prohibit provincial legislation with regard to Dominion companies.\nThe provisions of Part IV of the \"Companies Act\" of Manitoba are, it is true, not identical with those of the British Columbia Act condemned by the Wharton decision, but with the exception of section 18 of the Act of British Columbia empowering the registrar to refuse a licence under certain circumstances to a Dominion company, they are substantially the same.\nI agree with the contention of Mr. Robinson, counsel for the Dominion Government, that the decision in the Wharton Case3, did not rest upon section 18 or upon the fact that under it the registrar had refused a licence to the appellant. The Lord Chancellor, at page 338 of the report of that case, states the question for determination by their Lordships to be whether legislation prohibiting unlicensed companies from suing in the province and penalizing the carrying on of their business there and prohibiting the licensing of a company with the same name as one already in the province was valid legislation. At page 341 he answers his questions as follows:\u2014\nIt follows from these premises that the provisions of the \"Companies Act\" of British Columbia which are relied on in the present case as compelling the appellant company to obtain a provincial license of that kind about which the controversy has arisen, or to be registered in the province as a condition of exercising its powers or of suing in the courts, are inoperative for these purposes.\nThe passage in the judgment at page 343, where their Lordships indicate what legislation would have been competent to the province, shews clearly that the whole of the legislation there in question and not merely section 18 of the British Columbia statute was decided to be beyond the provincial powers.\nFor these reasons and for those stated by Mr. Justice Perdue in the Court of Appeal, with which I fully agree, I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs and the questions with respect to the validity of the sections of the Manitoba Act answered as indicated by Mr. Justice Perdue.\nIdington J.\u2014(See page 26 ante.)\nAnglin J.\u2014Not, I confess, without some hesitation I have reached the conclusion that this appeal should be dismissed. A vital difference, in my opinion, between the Manitoba Act now under consideration and the British Columbia statute dealt with in John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[4], lies in the absence from the former of any provision similar to section 18 of the British Columbia Act (sec. 6, ch. 3, stats. of 1912), which enabled the registrar to refuse a licence to any Dominion company whose name resembled that of an existing company, society, or firm carrying on business, or calculated to deceive, or otherwise, in his opinion, objectionable. The refusal to grant a licence under this provision was the ground of complaint in the Wharton Case[5]. The Manitoba Act, on the other hand, by section 109, expressly provides that the right of a Dominion company\u2014which, in this respect, differs from any other extra provincial company (section 110) \u2014shall be absolute.\nI cannot but think that the condemnation in the Wharton Case5, of several sections of the British Columbia Act prohibiting an unlicensed Dominion company from carrying on business, denying to it the aid of the provincial courts, etc., depended largely, if not entirely, on the fact that the obtaining of a licence by such a company was not made an absolute right under the statute but rested in the discretion of the registrar. These sections were not condemned by the Judicial Committee without qualification, but only \"in their present form\" (p. 343). It was the discretion which section 18 purported to vest in the registrar that, if valid, would amount to an interference\nwith the carrying on of the business in the province of a Dominion company\n(p. 337)\u2014that would enable that provincial official\nto deprive a Dominion company of its status and powers.\nShort of such interference or deprivation, the right of the province to subject Dominion companies, in common with others, to taxation and to registration for purposes pertaining to the administration of justice or to civil rights in the province, such as the holding of property and the making of contracts, is fully recognized by their Lordships (pp. 341 and 343) and the exercise of such control may take the form of requiring the Dominion company, like others, to take a licence to trade from the province. The power to exact compliance with legislation of that character implies the right to enforce it by appending appropriate sanctions. So long as the Dominion company, by paying the tax imposed or by making the entry required, has the absolute right to obtain the provincial licence its status as a company is unimpaired and the exercise of its powers and functions is not unduly fettered.\nOf course a province may not, under the guise of taxation, or of the exercise of any of its powers under section 92 of the \"British North America Act,\" in substance and reality require a Dominion company to re-incorporate or otherwise to acquire from it anything in the nature of status, capacity or powers. The \"pith and substance\" of the legislation must be taken into account. But I agree with the views expressed by Meredith C.J.O. in Currie v. Harris Lithographing Co.[6], at pages 490-1, as to what should be the attitude of the court in approaching the consideration of this phase of the case Dealing with them in the spirit indicated by the learned Chief Justice I incline to accept the view of Mr. Justice Cameron that the concluding words of section 111 of the Manitoba statute,\nsuch limitations and conditions as may be specified in the license,\nwhich would otherwise be a source of embarrassment, should be held to relate only to the other \"foreign\" companies falling under section 110, which contains corresponding terms, and not to Dominion companies excluded from the application of section 110 and specially provided for by section 109, which entitles them to be licensed without qualifications.\nApproaching the Manitoba statute with a view of upholding it, if by fair consideration of them the impeached provisions can be brought within the provincial legislative powers\u2014I think they may be regarded as an exercise of the powers of direct taxation and in regard to the administration of justice and the control of civil rights conferred on the provincial legislatures by section 92 of the \"British North America Act\" and as not involving such an interference with status, capacity or powers of Dominion companies as would bring them within the condemnation of the Judicial Committee in the Wharton Case[7].\nBrodeur J.\u2014The appellant company is incorporated under the authority of the \"Companies Act\" of Canada (R.S.C. ch. 79) and is empowered to carry on its business throughout the Dominion of Canada and with its head office in Winnipeg, in the Province of Manitoba.\nBy the provisions of the \"Companies Act\" of Manitoba (R.S.M. ch. 35, secs. 106 to 130) which deal with extra provincial corporations, a licence has to be applied for by all those corporations to the provincial authorities; the licence will have to be obtained before these corporations can carry on business in the province and they will not be authorized to acquire and hold real estate in the province, except to the amount and the value mentioned in the licence.\nThe appellant company not having applied for such a licence, the respondent, Davidson, one of its shareholders, has instituted an action to force the company to take such a licence and the Attorney-General of Manitoba has intervened in support of that action and to maintain the validity of those provisions which were attacked by the appellant company. It is claimed by the latter that the decision of the Privy Council in the case of John Deere Plow Co. v Wharton[8], sustains their contention.\nThe John Deere Plow Co. Case8, has reference to the construction of the \"Companies Act\" of British Columbia, which empowered the provincial authorities to refuse to a federal company the right to carry on business on the ground that there was another company of the same name upon the local register. The evidence shewed that the John Deere Plow Co had applied for a licence and that its application had been refused.\nSuch legislation and action affected the status of the company itself, though it had been incorporated by the Dominion authorities; and the Privy Council decided (1), that the legislation was ultra vires of a provincial legislature.\nThere is between the British Columbia legislation and the Manitoba legislation a vast difference. While the British Columbia legislation gave the provincial authorities the power to refuse the licence (sec. 18 B.C. statutes) the Manitoba statute declared on the contrary (sections 108-109), the corporations created under the authority of the Parliament of Canada and authorized by their Act of incorporation to carry on business in Manitoba are entitled to receive a licence to carry on their business.\nWhat is the nature of that licence?\nIt is a method of taxation by which to secure a revenue for the purposes of the province. All the companies, whether incorporated by the local legislature, or by the Dominion Legislature, by any foreign state or any other provincial authority, are bound to pay the same licence in proportion to their capital.\nThe object of this legislation is also to keep the public informed as to the status of those companies. They have to file a certified copy of their charter; they are authorized to transact business under their charter; they must have in the province an agent to accept service of process in all suits, except in the case when the head office of the company is in the province, and to publish at their expense in the Official Gazette and in a newspaper the fact that they are duly authorized to carry on business in the province.\nIt is of the utmost importance for a person who contracts with a corporation to know the legal status of the latter and to see whether the contract contemplated is within the powers granted to the company by its Act of Incorporation or its letters patent.\nThe unauthorized and fictitious companies will then be prevented from deceiving the public since any one may obtain from the Provincial Secretary information as to any bon\u00e2 fide company and may ascertain the powers and standing of such company in the same manner as if the company had been incorporated by the provincial authority. Perhaps that knowledge could be procured in applying to the Dominion authorities, but who is going to inform the person desirous of procuring that information that the company is a federal company? It might be a foreign or provincial company. Besides, the distances in our country are so great that each province should have in its capital the necessary data as to the existence, the status and the capacity of any company.\nThe obligation for a federal company to take out a licence under the Manitoba statute is a law of general application. The companies incorporated locally have to pay just as well as the companies incorporated outside of the province. In the case of Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[9], that question has been decided. It was there held that though the banks are incorporated by the Dominion Parliament, they may be bound to contribute to the public objects of the provinces where they carry on business.\nIt is contended by the appellant that its status as a federal company is affected because the law provides that before carrying on business it is bound to take a licence.\nThere is a distinction to be made when it is said that a company will not trade in a district and that a company, if it does so, must have a licence.\nThat question came up in the case before the Privy Council in 1897, of the Brewers & Malsters v. Attorney General[10]. It was the case of a Dominion company incorporated by a Dominion charter and authorized by a Dominion licence to manufacture liquor in all the provinces of the Dominion. The Ontario Legislature passed an Act declaring that before a person could sell liquor in Ontario he would have to take a licence from the provincial authorities. That legislation was held valid.\nI am unable to distinguish this case from that decided by the Privy Council.\nIt is contended also that the legislation is ultra vires, because there is a restriction as to the powers of this federal company to hold real estate in the province.\nThat contention is disposed of by the judgment of the Privy Council in the case of Colonial Building Assoc. v. Attorney-General of Quebec[11].\nIn the John Deere Plow Co. Case[12], so much relied upon by the appellant, the noble lord who delivered the judgment said on that point:\u2014 Thus notwithstanding that a Dominion company has capacity to hold land, it cannot refuse to obey the statutes of the province as to mortmain (Colonial Building & Investment Association v. Attorney-General of Quebec) [13], or escape the payment even though these may assume the form of requiring as the method of raising a revenue, a licence to trade which affects a Dominion company in common with other companies (Bank of Toronto v. Lambe) [14].\nThat expression of views disposes, in my opinion, of the contentions of the appellant company. Its appeal fails and it should be dismissed with costs.\nMignault J. (dissenting)\u2014I so fully agree with the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Perdue; of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba, that it does not seem necessary to state at any length why I am in favour of allowing this appeal.\nIn expressing my opinion I shall strictly confine myself to the concrete case which is before this court and avoid stating general rules governing, in matters of company legislation, the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament or of the provincial legislatures, the more so as the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council has formulated, in the case of the John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[15], a plain rule whereby the present controversy can be decided.\nThe test of the validity of the Manitoba statute can therefore be stated, in the language of their Lordships in the John Deere Plow Co. Case15, at page 341, as follows:\u2014\nIt is enough for present purposes to say that the province cannot legislate so as to deprive a Dominion company of its status and powers. This does not mean that these powers can be exercised in contravention of the laws of the province restricting the rights of the public in the province generally. What it does mean is that the status and powers of the Dominion company as such cannot be destroyed by provincial legislation * * *\nIt follows from these premises that these provisions of the \"Companies Act\" of British Columbia which are relied on in the present case as compelling the appellant company to obtain a provincial licence of the kind about which the controversy has arisen, or to be registered in the province as a condition of exercising its powers or of suing in the courts, are inoperative for these purposes. The question is not one of enactment of laws affecting the general public in the province and relating to civil rights, or taxation, or the administration of justice. It is in reality whether the province can interfere with the status and corporate capacity of a Dominion company in so far as that status and capacity carry with it powers conferred by the Parliament of Canada to carry on business in every part of the Dominion. Their Lordships are of the opinion that this question must be answered in the negative.\nApplying this test to the legislation in question, which was adopted before the John Deere Plow Co. Case[16] was decided there can be no doubt that it cannot be sustained. I am here satisfied to adopt the statement of the purport and effect of this legislation made by Mr. Justice Perdue:\u2014\nIn the \"Manitoba Companies Act,\" Part IV, the expression \"corporation\" means a company, institution or corporation created otherwise than by or under an Act of the Legislature of Manitoba (section 106). Corporations created by or under the authority of an Act of the Parliament of Canada and authorized to carry on business in Manitoba, referred to as Class V, are required to take out a licence (section 108). To this there are certain exceptions, but these do not include the defendant. Class VI includes corporations not coming within the preceding five classes. A corporation coming within the class to which the defendant belongs shall, upon complying with the provisions, of Part IV and the regulations made thereunder and paying the fee required, receive a licence to carry on its business and exercise its powers in Manitoba (section 109). A corporation coming within the class to which the defendant belongs or within Class VI \"may upon complying with the provisions of this part (Part IV) and the regulations made hereunder, receive a licence to carry on the whole or such parts of its business and exercise the whole of such parts of its powers in Manitoba as may be embraced in the licence; subject, however, to such limitations and conditions as may be specified therein.\" See section III. A corporation receiving a licence may, subject to the limitations and conditions of the licence and of its own charter, acquire, hold and dispose of real estate in Manitoba (section 112); but it shall not be capable of acquiring or disposing of real estate unless it has been licensed (section 119). No corporation coming within the class which includes defendant shall carry on any of its business in Manitoba unless a licence has been granted to it and is in force, and no agent of the corporation may carry on its business in Manitoba until a licence has been obtained; exception is made in regard to buying or selling by travellers or correspondence where the corporation has no resident agent or place of business in Manitoba (section 118). If such a corporation carries on business in Manitoba without a licence it shall incur a penalty of $50.00 a day and, so long as it remains unlicensed, it shall not be capable of maintaining any action, suit or proceeding in any court in Manitoba in respect of any contract made in whole or in part in Manitoba (section 122). If its agent carries on any of the business of such a corporation in Manitoba while it is unlicensed he shall be liable to a penalty (section 123).\nThis legislation, no doubt, differs in degree from the British Columbia statute, the validity of which was questioned in the John Deere Plow Co. Case[17], but it clearly fails when the jurisdiction of the Manitoba Legislature is measured by the test laid down in that case. This statute compels the appellant company to obtain a licence and to be registered as a condition of exercising its powers and of suing in the courts. This the legislature could not do.\nIt has been contended that this is a taxation measure and as such was one which it was competent for the legislature to enact. It is further urged that the province has exclusive mortmain jurisdiction and that, therefore, it is for it alone to determine the conditions under which a Dominion corporation can acquire and hold property.\nI think the answer is obvious. Granting the jurisdiction of the province in these matters the province cannot, in my opinion, so exercise this jurisdiction as to deprive a Dominion company of its status or powers. In other words, it cannot, in imposing taxation, prevent the company from exercising its powers until it has paid the taxes imposed. Nor can it, as was done by this statute, deprive the company of its power and capacity to acquire, hold and dispose of real estate in Manitoba, or to carry on its business, unless and until a provincial licence is obtained.\nTo decide otherwise and to sustain the validity of such a statute would in effect restrict the power of the Dominion Parliament to the creation of the company and the enumeration of its powers, but the company would find itself paralyzed and its powers would be inoperative so long as it had not complied with the requirements exacted by the province. I cannot think that the Judicial Committee ever contemplated, in the John Deere Plow Co. Case[18], that this could be done.\nI would allow the appeal and answer the first four questions in the negative and the fifth question in the same manner as Mr. Justice Perdue. The respondent's action and the interventions of the Attorneys-General of Ontario and Manitoba should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: A. E.

L.R. 434). The Appellate Division reversed his judgment and dismissed the action.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Appellate Division (45 Ont. L.R. 28; 47 D.L.R. 551), that the case is not one depending on the credibility of the witnesses or reliability of their testimony in which great weight is attached to the findings, of the trial judge but is one for weighing the evidence as a whole and of inferences to be drawn therefrom. So dealt with the weight of the evidence is that the approach to the bridge was not dangerous and the judgment at the trial was properly set aside.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment at the trial[2], in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe facts are fully stated in the above head-note.\nJ.M. McEvoy and E.W. Flock for the appellants.\nHellmuth K.C. and Weir for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This appeal is from the judgment of the second Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario reversing the judgment of the trial judge which had held the defendant municipality liable in damages for an accident which happened to the plaintiff appellant while travelling in a motor along a highway within the municipal boundaries.\nThe gist of the action was the alleged want of repair of the road along which the motor was travelling and the want of repair consisted in what was for vehicular traffic an alleged dangerous curve in the road at the point where the accident happened leading up to and across a bridge. I consider that if the curve was so sharp, as contended for, as to be dangerous to vehicular, including motor, travel and was in the case in question the cause of the accident, the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nAt the hearing in which we had the assistance of two plans prepared by surveyors, one on each side, shewing the curve, the bridge and the spot where the accident happened, the main question discussed and on which alone our decision must be based was whether or not this curve in the road was so sharp as to constitute a danger to a motor properly driven with necessary and prudent care.\nThat is the sole and only question we have to decide and whether the accident was caused by excessive speed of the motor or by unskilful driving are ancillary questions We are not necessarily called on to determine.\nAt the close of the argument I had formed a very strong opinion that the appeal failed and that the judgment of the Divisional Court was right.\nIn deference, however, to the very strong opinion of the trial judge that the curve in the road was so sharp as to create a \u201cwant of repair\u201d which constituted a breach of the duty of the municipality to keep in repair I felt myself obliged to consider most carefully the evidence given in this case.\nIn the first place, I find that the curve in the road and the bridge to which it led had been in the same position and condition as they were when the accident happened for the previous nine years. During all this time they had been constantly traversed by motors, as many as 50 crossing over them on one day. The only change alleged consisted in the fact that some logs had been placed on the grass alongside of the trita and some three feet away from its edge with the intention of widening the bridge and were there at the time. These logs, however, did not in any way interfere with or encroach upon the trita along which the motors were driven.\nAfter carefully examining and considering the evidence I have without reasonable doubt reached the conclusion that the curve was not a dangerous one to any motor reasonably and with proper care driven over it. Whatever may have been the cause of the accident, whether arising from excessive speed at the curve and approach to the bridge or from unskilful or careless driving of the motor, as to which I say nothing, not being called upon to decide, I remain clearly of the opinion that the curve in question did not constitute a want of repair for which the defendant, respondent, is liable.\nI partly agree with the reasons of the Court of Appeal and with its conclusions.\nThe fact that for some years this curve had been constantly driven over by motors without any accident having happened except perhaps on one very doubtful occasion is a very strong reason, not perhaps a conclusive one, that the curve was not a dangerous one to motors properly driven. Looking at this curve as shewn on the plans produced and applying such common sense and common knowledge as one possesses from seeing daily motors driven without danger and without accident along the streets of Ottawa, where the streets run at right angles one to the other, giving much sharper curves for motors to take in passing from one street to another street, I cannot reach the conclusion that the curve in question was at all a dangerous one.\nIt is true two gentlemen did in their evidence, say that they always found it necessary and prudent as a matter of safety in traversing this curve to stop and back up before crossing the bridge. But that these two very cautious persons should have so acted, can by no means in the face of the evidence shewing that another did not find it necessary so to do but always passed by in perfect safety, overcome the mass of evidence shewing that the curve was not at all dangerous to motors properly driven. The conclusion I have reached without reasonable doubt is that the curve was not dangerous and that the accident must be attributed to some other cause or causes for which the defendant, respondent, is not liable.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The question raised herein is not one that necessarily turns upon the relative credibility of witnesses; in regard to which, save in the exceptional cases I have frequently referred to, the learned trial judge\u2019s opinion so far as that is concerned in any given case must be observed.\nIt should turn, in the ultimate result, upon whether or not the road in question was in such a state of repair as defined by the judgment of the late Chief Justice Armour in the case cited below of Foley v. Township of East Flamborough[3], as follows:\u2014\nI think that if the particular road is kept in such a reasonable state of repair that those requiring to use the road may, using ordinary care, pass to and fro upon it in safety, the requirement of the law is satisfied.\nIf it was, then no action will lie even if an accident has resulted in damages in the course of its use; for accidents may happen merely from error of judgment on the part of him injured and he be without remedy.\nThe right to impute negligence in law to anyone else as the cause must rest upon other relevant facts and cannot be assumed merely from the accident and its consequences.\nThe question presented is one for the exercise of sound judgment, and I cannot say, though not entirely free from doubt, that the view of the majority of the court below is wrong.\nHence I must agree in dismissing the appeal with costs.\nDUFF J.\u2014I have come to the conclusion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nThe appellant is entitled to succeed only upon shewing that the decision in the Appellate Division to the effect that the accident, out of which the litigation arose, was not due to a failure on the part of the municipality to observe its statutory duty in respect of the repair and maintenance of highways, was an erroneous decision, I think Mr. McEvoy has succeeded in shewing that there was some misapprehension of fact on the part of Mr. Justice Kelly, as to the manner in which the car left the road, but the substance and pith of the judgment of the Appellate Division lies in the weight attributed by the court to the mass of evidence consisting of the testimony of motorists of unimpeachable credit and of competent experience who had motored over this road again and again.\nIt is arguable, of course, and there is much to be said in support of the view, that all this testimony was before the learned trial judge and that the weight of it is not sufficient to counter-balance his finding that the car was driven with care, and the deductions that would seem almost necessarily to flow from that finding. I am not, however, entirely confident of the soundness of the conclusion reached by looking at the case in this way. I should not feel justified in holding that the Appellate Division was wrong in attaching predominant importance to the general opinion derived from the general experience that motorists were not exposed to such exceptional risks arising from the narrowness of the bridge or the sharpness of the curve in the roadway approaching it, or from the piles of wood flanking the road, as to support a charge against the municipality of neglect of its duty in respect of highway maintenance.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Seldom have I found it as difficult as in this case to determine what upon the evidence should be held to have been the true cause of an accident. The Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, a trial judge of great experience, has attributed the misadventure here in question to the failure of the defendant municipality to maintain at the place where the plaintiff was injured a highway reasonably sufficient for the needs of the traffic over it as required by sec. 460[4] of the \u201cMunicipal Act\u201d4. The narrow- ness of the bridge over Duffus\u2019s creek or drain, the nature of the approach to it and the presence of a pile of bridge timbers or spiles on the road allowance close to the via trita are the features emphasized by the learned judge, the combined effect of which, as I understand his judgment, in his opinion rendered the turn on to the bridge unnecessarily and unreasonably dangerous and was a proximate cause of the accident in which the plaintiff was injured. He deals with the driving of the automobile in which the plaintiff was travelling in these terms:\u2014\nThe driver of the car and the other persons who were in it testified that in all respects the car was brought to the bridge at a very moderate rate of speed and with due care in all respects. The testimony of the witness Mr. Flock especially, who is the plaintiff\u2019s solicitor in this action, seemed to me to be given with much candour and to be worthy of credit in this respect.\nOn the other hand, an appellate court of five judges, with but a single dissent, has reversed this judgment.[5] Mr. Justice Kelly, who delivered the opinion of the majority, concludes his discussion of the case with this sentence:\u2014\nAfter a careful analysis of the whole evidence I am convinced that the predicament in which plaintiff and his companions found themselves on July 26th, 1917, must be attributed to some cause other than the width of the bridge, the curve from the roadway leading on to it or the presence of the piles or logs on the right of way.\nThe force of this conclusion would seem to be somewhat weakened, however, by a summary of the learned appellate judge\u2019s reasons which immediately precedes it in these terms:\u2014\nWith great respect I am of opinion that the learned trial judge overlooked the inconsistencies in some of the evidence put forward for plaintiff, such as that of Keene, and the effect of the uncontradicted evidence of the actual and continued use of this part of the highway by all kinds of vehicles, some of which, however, witnesses for plaintiff in effect say was impossible, as well as the evidence of McCubbin that this point presents the ordinary conditions found at a crossing of two roads in a rectangular system of surveys.\nHis explicit reference to and somewhat disparaging comment upon the evidence adduced by the defendants to prove that the approach to and crossing of the bridge presented no serious obstacle make it clear that this testimony was present to the mind of the learned Chief Justice and I cannot think that he overlooked whatever inconsistencies appear in the evidence put forward for the plaintiff. Neither does Dr. McCallum\u2019s testimony seem to be quite open to the criticism of it made by the learned appellate judge in the course of his judgment.\nMr. Justice Kelly took the same view of the duty of the municipal council in regard to the maintenance and repair of highways as that held by the trial judge, expressing it in these terms, in which I respectfully concur:\nThe duty imposed by the \u201cMunicipal Act\u201d upon municipalities in respect to keeping highways in repair is imperative and requires them to make the roads reasonably safe for the purposes of travel; and motor vehicles being now an ordinary means of tranportation this would include travel by such vehicles; Davis v. Township of Usborne (1916),[6]; In Foley v. Township of East Flamborough (1898)[7], a judgment of a Divisional Court, Armour C.J. in defining what is meant by \u201crepair\u201d said, \u201cI think that if the particular road is kept in such a reasonable state of repair that those requiring to use the road may, using ordinary care, pass to and fro upon it in safety, the requirement of the law is satisfied.\u201d This judgment of the Divisional Court was reversed by the Court of Appeal[8], but on altogether different grounds, the court not dissenting from the opinion of the Divisional Court which is in harmony with other decisions and may properly be applied here.\nThe learned trial judge based his judgment on the evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses that the narrowness of the bridge in connection with the sharp angle of the immediate approach to it and the adjacent pile of timber made the turn on to it from the south dangerous, if not altogether impracticable; the majority in the appellate court on the other hand placed more reliance on the testimony of numerous witnesses for the defence who deposed that they had made the turn with different motor cars driving at speeds varying from 10 to 18 miles an hour frequently and without experiencing any difficulty.\nThe question presented is not one of mere credibility\u2014and by that I understand not merely the appreciation of the witnesses\u2019 desire to be truthful but also of their opportunities of knowledge and powers of observation judgment and memory\u2014in a word, the trustworthiness of their testimony, which may have depended very largely on their demeanour in the witness box and their manner in giving evidence; it is rather a composite matter of credibility as to facts and of inferences to be drawn from and opinions based on facts found to be established that is involved in determining whether the highway provided met the test of reasonable sufficiency which the statute imposes. The duty of an appellate court under such circumstances has been defined in numerous cases. I mention such leading authorities as Dominion Trust Co. v. New York Life Ins. Co.[9], at page 257; Montgomerie v. Wallace\u2011James[10], at page 75; Wood v. Haines[11]; and Ruddy v. Toronto Eastern Rly. Co.[12], at page 258, merely to make it clear that I have the governing principles, as indicated by our highest judicial tribunal, in mind in approaching the consideration of the problem with which we are confronted.\nHaving regard to the nature of the case and to the conflict of opinion in the provincial courts as to the result of the evidence, I have thought it my duty to adopt the course commended by their Lordships of the Judicial Committee in Syndicat Lyonnais du Klondyke v. Barrett[13], and have made an independent examination and analysis of the evidence bearing on the question at issue. I shall not attempt to set out that analysis in extenso but shall merely state the conclusions to which it has led me, indicating the reasons which have influenced me in reaching them.\nIn the first place, I am by no means satisfied that, if sitting as the trial judge, I should have found that\nthe car was brought to the bridge at a very moderate rate of speed and with due care in all respects.\nA very moderate rate is a relative term and largely a matter of opinion. The learned Chief Justice does not tell us what in his opinion would have been such a rate of speed under the circumstances. Nor does he find what the actual rate of speed was, although Mr. Flock, on whose candour and credibility he places great reliance, testified that\nwhen we made the turn I would say he (the driver) was going 5 or 6 miles an hour, not faster than 6 miles an hour.\nRaymond, the plaintiff, who would be most unlikely to exaggerate the speed, said on discovery that they were going 12 miles an hour; and at the trial he admitted having so deposed and then places the speed at from 10 to 12 miles. Keene, the driver, was not questioned on this very important point, nor was Routledge, the other passenger who gave evidence. On the other hand, Moody, a defence witness, testified that very shortly after the accident Keene said to him:\nI was going so fast that I thought I would jump right over the ditch and go down the other road, and Keene was not called in rebuttal to contradict that statement. Having regard to all the circumstances\u2014to the fact that Keene had not been over the road before, that the turn was visible to him for 250 or 300 feet before he reached it, that Flock sitting opposite him had warned him at that distance, saying, \u201cthat is a very sharp turn,\u201d to which he replied \u201cyes, I see\u201d\u2014if the car was running 12 miles an hour when it reached the turn I should scarcely be prepared to find that such a rate of speed was \u201cvery moderate\u201d or even moderate, or that the approach to the bridge had been made \u201cwith due care in all respects.\u201d The evidence as a whole leaves an uncomfortable impression that a speed too great under the circumstances may at least have been a contributing cause of the failure to cross the bridge in safety.\nBut, as the learned trial judge points out, any negligence in that regard would not be imputable to the plaintiff and as mere contributory negligence is therefore not material. Unless it can be said to have been the sole proximate cause of the accident, excluding any contributing negligence ascribable to the defendants, it cannot serve them as a defence or preclude recovery by the plaintiff. While I am not prepared to find that this has been established, enough in my opinion has been shewn to make it impossible to infer from the mere fact that Keene found himself unable to bring his car on to the bridge that the conditions of the highway constituted a danger amounting to a lack \u201cof reasonable sufficiency for the needs of traffic.\u201d That fact, if it existed, must be otherwise established.\nIf, owing to the narrowness of the bridge and the sharpness of the curve which had to be made in entering upon it, it was necessary for a driver of ordinary skill in handling an ordinary motor car to stop and back up in order to cross it safely, as three witnesses for the plaintiff have stated, I would unhesitatingly find that the highway at this point was not in a condition reasonably sufficient for the needs of the traffic over it since it could very easily have been improved and it would require more than ordinary care and skill to pass to and fro upon it in safety. Keene, the driver, says he went back and again tried to approach the bridge from the south on the afternoon of the day of the accident and then found he could not make the turn and enter on the bridge without backing up, and making a second turn. I can scarcely credit this statement, of which there is no corroboration, in view of the mass of testimony for the defence as to the facility with which the turn can be made even at comparatively high speeds and in cars having wheel bases of 112, 116 and 130 inches. Keene\u2019s Chalmers car had a wheel base of 124 inches. There is no suggestion that the cramping or turning capacity of this car was greatly or at all sub-normal. Of course, if it was unusually limited in that respect, the defendant would not be under an obligation to provide a turn which it could make. On the other hand, I can readily understand Keene\u2019s inability to make the turn on the morning in question having regard to what he tells us about the circumstances of his approach to the bridge.\nLooking at either of the plans produced, which give somewhat different pictures (that of McCubbin, an engineer called by the defendants, seems to be the more precise and accurate), the making of the turn would appear to present little difficulty for a car following the gravelled roadway at its outer or right hand side. As shewn on the plan produced by Sur- veyor Farncombe, called by the plaintiff, the via trita lies 12 feet east of the ditch, which occupies the west side of the road allowance, and the via trita is itself 12 feet wide. A reasonably careful driver approaching at a moderate speed and taking full advantage of the roadway thus available should find no serious difficulty in bringing any ordinary car safely on to the bridge. Even Flock admits that\nif he had made a fuller curve and the spiles were not there he (Keene) might have got around.\nThis leads me to a passage in Keene\u2019s evidence to which little attention seems to have been paid, but which I think probably explains why he found himself unable to make the crossing when the plaintiff was injured. He says:\u2014\nPartly down the hill coming towards this bridge, I could see that the road made a turn, at least it came to an end and made a turn somewhere. It was a few hundred feet away, I would say. I saw that there was a turn in the road. I could not say that it was a bridge at that time. When I got close down to it, I came down the hill with the brakes on on the flat part of the road, I watched very closely for how sharp a turn it was, or how I should turn, thinking it was only a common turn in the road. Getting down closer to the bridge I made a turn out to get past a pile of spiles which were on my right hand side, with the bridge on the left of me. My first wheel touched the bridge, the left hand wheel touched the bridge.\nThis pile of timber or spiles, according to the weight of the evidence, lay in the grass on the road allowance just about opposite to where the road began to turn towards the bridge and, at its nearest point, 3 feet to the east or right hand side of the gravelled roadway, Although Flock said on cross-examination that the piles were \u201con the gravel\u201d\u2014\u201dthree or four feet out on the gravel\u201d\u2014this was probably a slip, since he said on examination-in-chief that they were \u201cwithin three feet from the gravel,\u201d and Keene says they were three or four feet off the travelled roadway. George Jones, another witness for the plaintiff, says: The one end I would judge to be six feet, and the other end three or four feet from the gravel, three feet anyway, away from the road where you turned down.\nNeither Flock, Raymond nor Routledge says anything of the swerve to the left to avoid the piles of which Keene tells. They were not asked about it. It is quite probable that they would not have noticed it. Keene would of course know of it and would be more likely to remember it, and I therefore think it is reasonable to assume that it took place as he says\u2014though the necessity for his making it is somewhat more difficult to appreciate since he tells us that the right wheels of his car were, if at all, only very slightly on the grass, and Mr. Flock says:\u2014\nHe took the turn to the extreme right of the gravel, or possibly a little beyond that.\nComing on this pile of timber as a stranger, however, Keene may on the spur of the moment have imagined that it encroached on the via trita, or was closer to it than was actually the case\u2014so much so that, especially if he was travelling, as the plaintiff says, at 12 miles an hour, he may have thought that prudence required him to turn out when passing it. Swerving to the left\u2014probably unnecessarily, or more than was necessary\u2014he had not time or space sufficient to enable him to recover the position at the extreme right of the travelled roadway necessary to enable him to make a proper approach to the bridge and if he tried to do so he probably got too far to the north before beginning to make the turn to the left to enter on the bridge. This seems to me to be the most likely explanation of the predicament in which he found himself when the left front wheel of his car reached the bridge and he realized that he could not cross it\u2014that his right wheels would not be upon it. Otherwise, I cannot reconcile his testimony with that of the defence witnesses\u2014and the veracity of many of them there is no reason to doubt.\nThere remains the question whether the presence of the pile of timber three feet from the gravelled roadway opposite the point where the driver should have begun to turn on to the bridge was a breach of the defendant\u2019s statutory duty, as above defined. It undoubtedly was if the timber obstructed the turn and made it dangerous.\nIt had been there for several weeks and the evidence of the Reeve establishes that the municipality was responsible for its having been placed there. But the great weight of the evidence is that it did not at all interfere with the turn on to the bridge when driving at a moderate speed. The defendant\u2019s witnesses all so testified, and Dr. Grant, a witness for the plaintiff, tells us:\u2014\nI believe I have noticed them (the pile of spiles) but not to have them an incumbrance to me when turning.\nSuch an idea as that they were in a position to be of the least danger to any one never entered his head. George Jones, also called by the plaintiff, says\u2014the stringers or timbers were not so placed as to interfere with the turn. Dr. McCallum, the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cstar\u201d witness on the danger of the turn, had no recollection of them although he drove over the bridge more than four times a week for six weeks every summer. Important as it is now sought to make them as adding to the danger, Keene tells us that when he returned in the afternoon\nsomebody had pulled them around. I was not interested in how the spiles were.\nOn the whole evidence I find myself unable to reach the conclusion that the presence of the pile of timber constituted a breach of its statutory duty on the part of the defendant.\nNo doubt had the bridge been wider\u2014say 22 feet instead of 13 feet, 6 inches\u2014the accident might have been avoided. Had the curve in approaching its east end been the same as that at its west end the turn which Keene had to make would have been easier. But it does not follow that because both the bridge and the road might have been improved the municipality failed to discharge its statutory duty. On the contrary, looking at the plans and taking the evidence as a whole, if dealing with the case as a judge of first instance, I would incline to the view that the highway was in a condition reasonably safe for the passage over it of the traffic to be expected upon it and that a driver of ordinary skill proceeding at moderate speed\u2014i.e., at a speed suitable for making a right angle turn in a country road\u2014and with reasonable care would experience no serious difficulty in making the turn in question and crossing the bridge in safety with such a car as Keene was driving. Neither could I find that the presence of the pile of timber rendered the turn unsafe or dangerous\u2014still less that it prevented its being made at all as Keene would have us believe.\nIt was suggested by the learned Chief Justice in the course of the trial and by counsel for the plaintiff in argument here that the defendants should at least have set up a notice board or post at some distance warning travellers of the danger of the turn. But the absence of such a notice was not the cause of the accident now under consideration, since Keene was warned of the sharpness of the turn by Flock when several hundred feet away.\nI do not place much reliance on the evidence given of the location of the tracks of the automobile wheels, nor do I consider it of much moment whether the corner post of the bridge was struck by the right front wheel or by the spring of the car.\nOn the whole case, although not entirely satisfied that if sitting in the Appellate Division Court I should have been prepared to hold that the judgment of the learned trial judge was so clearly wrong that it should be reversed, neither am I convinced that the majority in the Divisional Court clearly erred in setting it aside and still less that their conclusion upon the evidence is so manifestly wrong that we should restore the judgment of the trial court. The situation somewhat resembles that with which we had recently to deal in Magill v. Township of Moore[14], and I think the result must be, as in that case, a dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s appeal.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014We are called upon to decide in this case whether the accident of which the appellant was a victim was caused by the bad nature of the road of the respondent corporation.\nRaymond was driving in an automobile, and, having reached a place where the highway makes a curve to cross a bridge the driver of the automobile claims that he was unable, in view of the sharpness of the curve, to cross the bridge. The car went partly into the ditch and the appellant was injured.\nThe question is whether the bridge was of a sufficent width and if the nature of the curve did not render this highway a dangerous one for the motor cars to travel upon.\nIt was claimed by the appellant that piles of logs put on the highway rendered the ordinary condition of the highway more dangerous. But these piles do not seem to have been the proximate cause of the accident, and we have then to decide the case on the nature of the highway itself and we have to consider if the accident was not due to some carelessness on the part of the driver.\nThis road is very much frequented by automobiles. We have the evidence of a large number of persons, some with intimate knowledge of the locality and others who travelled it for the first time, who state they never experienced any difficulty in making the turn and passing the bridge. A few others however stated that they had to take extraordinary precautions to safely pass there.\nIn that regard, we may consider that the evidence is conflicting; but the weight of evidence is certainly in favour of the respondent.\nWe have at the same time the uncontradicted expert evidence of the engineer, Mr. McCubbin, to the effect that the curve along the centre of the gravelled roadway is 39 feet long and that the radius of curvature at the centre of the gravelled portion is 25 feet. These figures shew that there was ample space to make the turn for any automobile going at a moderate speed.\nIt was found by the trial judge that the appellant\u2019s car was going at a moderate rate of speed. Then, in view of this expert evidence, the accident must be due to some other cause than the negligence of the corporation. The onus probandi was on the plaintiff appellant and as he has not shewn that the decision of the Appellate Division was clearly wrong we should not interfere. The weight of evidence is that the road was kept in such a reasonable state of repair that those requiring to use the road may, using ordinary care, pass on the bridge in safety. Foley v. East Flamborough[15].\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014After carefully reading all the evidence I fully agree with the conclusion of His Lordship the Chief Justice of this Court that the curve and the bridge were not dangerous to motors properly driven. That is the only question we have to decide. I do not think that because Keene\u2019s car went into the ditch we must conclude that the curve and bridge were dangerous. There is a great preponderance of evidence that a large number of cars crossed the bridge every day in perfect safety. The only accident in several years, outside of a rather doubtful case mentioned by one Murphy, is the one which caused the appellant\u2019s injuries. Looking at the condition of the road and bridge objectively\u2014if I may use the term\u2014I find that the appellant has failed to prove, as being the cause of the accident, a \u201cwant of repair,\u201d which alone could render the respondent liable.

V. c. 25 (Ont.)\u2014Negligence\u2014\u201cAccident\u201d\u2014Injury by poisonous gases.\nInjury to the health of a workman in a munition factory through continuously inhaling the fumes of poisonous gases is not injury by \u201caccident\u201d within the meaning of that term in sec. 15 of the Ontario \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\u201d\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (45 Ont. L.R. 586; 48 D.L.R. 655), reversed on the merits as there was evidence on which the Jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff and the Appellate Division should not have disturbed their findings.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff, working in a munition factory, claimed damages from his employers for injury to his health caused, as he alleged, by inhaling gas fumes in doing his work. He claimed compensation under the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d but the Board held that the injury was not caused by \u201caccident\u201d and that it therefore was without jurisdiction. He then brought an action in which the jurisdiction of the Board was made an issue. On the trial the evidence was conflicting as to whether or not the illness of the plaintiff was caused by poisonous gases, some doctors testifying that it was impossible, others that there could be no other cause. The jury found in favour of the plaintiff and judgment was entered for him for $3,500. The Appellate Division reversed this judgment and dismissed the action.\nMcBrayne for the appellant. There was ample evidence to justify the findings of the jury and the verdict for plaintiff should not have been set aside. Watt v. Watt[2].\nThe evidence shews negligence in not providing proper ventilation. See Butler v. Fyfe Coal Co.[3]; Toronto Power Co. v. Paskwan[4].\nStrachan Johnston K.C. and H.A. Burbidge for the respondents, referred to Brintons Co. v. Turvey[5]; Glasgow Coal Co. v. Welsh[6].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This action was one brought by plaintiff appellant, a workman at one time employed by defendant company in operating an annealing bath or process in use in defendant\u2019s works in the City of Hamilton for the manufacture of cartridge shells and other war munitions.\nIt was the duty of the plaintiff who was known as a \u201cdipper\u201d to place the cartridge shells, which were made of brass and were at a high temperature, in what was known as a sulphuric acid bath and after a short time to remove them from this bath and place them in another bath known as the cyanide bath.\nOn February 12, 1917, plaintiff became ill and unable to continue his work and was removed to the Hamilton general hospital where he remained under treatment until June, 1918. The contentions on which he based his claims were that his illness was caused by strong, irritating and poisonous gases which were emitted from the baths in which his duty required him to place and remove the cartridge shells and which were inhaled by him in the discharge of his work; and that in addition to these alleged poisonous gases, natural gases of a poisonous character were emitted from and by the natural gas furnaces in close proximity to the baths used in heating the shells and became mingled with the other poisonous gases which he was forced to inhale, and that no system of ventilation of any kind was adopted or furnished by the defendant for the purpose of removing the gases plaintiff was compelled to inhale while at his work, the result being his illness and complete collapse.\nThe defence of the defendant not only put in issue the facts of the defendant\u2019s illness having been caused by irritating and poisonous gases to which his work exposed him and the want of ventilation in the building as charged but also set up as a defence that in any case the plaintiff\u2019s remedy was confined to that given by the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d and that his remedy had, on plaintiff\u2019s application for compensation under the Act, been refused, which refusal was final as to his claim and without appeal.\nAs to this latter defence, I do not think the plaintiff\u2019s common law right of action was taken away by the statute under the circumstances of this case. The Board declined to entertain the claim on the ground that plaintiff\u2019s claim was not one which occurred \u201cfor or by reason of any accident which happened to him in the course of his employment\u201d and I cannot but think in so deciding they were right. The Board therefore had no jurisdiction to award compensation in a case of this kind and the plaintiff was properly left to his common law right of action.\nThe latest case which I have been able to find on the much debated question of what is an \u201caccident\u201d within the meaning of the term accident in the \u201cEnglish Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act,\u201d 1906, 6 Edw. VII., ch. 58, sec. 1, sub-sec. 1, is that of Innes or Grant v. Kynoch[7], decided by the House of Lords. Their Lordships, in very lengthy reasoned judgments in which all the previous cases were referred to and analyzed, decided, Lord Atkinson dissenting, that the fortuitous alighting of the noxious bacilli upon an abraded spot of the plaintiff\u2019s leg, though it did not appear when or how he received the abrasion and it was impossible to say with certainity when the infection occurred, nevertheless constituted an accident within the Act.\nIn the case before us, of course, no such point or controlling fact arose and I take it from reading the judgments delivered that in the absence of proof of the abrasion on the plaintiff\u2019s leg which became infected by certain noxious bacilli, there would not have been any ground for the holding their Lordships reached.\nLeaving that defence and turning to the substantial defences set up by the defendant company to the claim of the plaintiff arising out of the alleged emanation of noxious and poisonous vapours from the baths at which he was working and the absence of proper and efficient ventilation in the factory which would have rendered these gases innocuous, it appears that after a lengthy trial during which a great many witnesses, scientific and otherwise, were examined, the learned trial judge charged the jury on all the disputed ques- tions with a fullness and clearness which does not seem to have left room for any complaint on either side and submitted to the jury for answers a series of questions covering all the debatable issues or contentions. I venture, even at the risk of unduly prolonging my reasons, to transcribe these questions and answers in full rather than give a simple epitome of them because, if there was evidence to justify the findings on the two main points of the emanation and inhaling of noxious and harmful gases and the absence of proper ventilation, these are sufficiently clear and definite as to justify the judgment entered by the trial judge but set aside by the Court of Appeal.\nQUESTIONS FOR THE JURY.\n1.\u2014Were harmful gases generated in the defendants\u2019 factory while plaintiff worked there? If so, what gases? A.\u2014Yes. The three fumes of gases combined: sulphuric acid, cyanide of potassium and natural gas.\n2.\u2014Was defendants\u2019 factory in which plaintiff worked ventilated in such a manner as to keep the air reasonably pure and so as to render harmless as far as reasonably practicable all gases, vapours or other impurities, generated in the course of the manufacturing process carried on by the defendant while the plaintiff was in defendants\u2019 employment? A.\u2014No.\n3.\u2014If you answer no, then what effect did such lack of ventilation have upon the plaintiff; answer fully? A.\u2014The conditions in the factory where the plaintiff worked caused his present and possible future disability.\n4.\u2014Was the defendant guilty of negligence that caused the injury to the plaintiff complained of? A.\u2014Yes.\n5.\u2014If so, what was the negligence? A.\u2014Sufficient ventilation was not provided while plaintiff worked there.\n6.\u2014Might the plaintiff by reasonable care have avoided the injuries complained of?A.\u2014No.\n7.\u2014At what sum do you assess the damages? At common law? A.\u2014We assess the damages at $3,500.00 under the common law.\nUnder the \u201cFactory Act?\u201d A.\u2014$3,664.44.\nQUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MR. JOHNSTON.\n1.\u2014Was the risk of inhaling dangerous gases a necessary incident to the employment of the plaintiff? A.\u2014Yes. It was necessary for the plaintiff to breathe, and in so doing he inhaled the fumes of the gases. 2.\u2014Was the imperfect ventilation, if any, caused by any of the fellow workmen of the plaintiff in keeping the windows and doors closed? A.\u2014No. That the fumes were too heavy to be carried off by natural ventilation in the winter months.\n3.\u2014Did the plaintiff, knowing the conditions, assume the risk connected with the employment? A.\u2014Not knowing that it was a dangerous position he did not assume the risk.\n4.\u2014If the plaintiff was injured in the course of his employment was the plaintiff injured by accident? (No answer).\nI frankly confess that after reading the reasons for judgment of the Divisional Appeal Court delivered by the learned Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, I felt in great doubt whether the judgment entered upon the jury\u2019s findings could be sustained.\nThe question, of course, for our determination is not what we would find as jurymen having heard the evidence and inspected the factory and its means of ventilation in the winter months, but simply and only whether the findings of the jury were such as reasonable men might fairly make on the evidence submitted to them.\nSince the argument at bar at the conclusion of which I still retained my previous doubts, I have read over most carefully the evidence given on both sides and parts of it more than once, and I confess that if I had to give the verdict I would most likely hold that the evidence taken as a whole did not justify the finding of the emanation of noxious and harmful gases from the baths at which the defendant worked, especially having regard to the weak solution of sulphuric acid proved to have been in one vat or tank 5 gallons to an 80 gallon tank, and another solution of cyanide of potassium approximately 25 lbs. to a 75 gallon tank, and to the scientific evidence, not contradicted by any other such evidence, respecting the possibility of these solutions throwing off these alleged noxious gases. I say on this main and controlling issue I would as a juryman probably have found against the plaintiff. But that is not my province. I have only to determine whether in the conflict of evidence we have before us in this case, scientific and practical, we find enough to justify reasonable men in reaching the conclusion these jurymen did. After much consideration and thought I have reached the conclusion, though not without much doubt, that there is such evidence in the record and that I ought not, in view of the extreme jurisdiction which juries are permitted to have over questions of fact, to set aside their findings on mere doubts I may entertain or on my reaching on the reading of the evidence a conclusion different from that the jury reached. Now in this case the jury had the great advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses and of judging how far and to what extent credit should be given to their statements. They had the whole history of the plaintiff\u2019s illness and the facts which preceded and were claimed to have led up to it, given by the plaintiff. They had the evidence very strong and positive of the three medical men who had examined the plaintiff most thoroughly. Dr. Martin was the physician who was consulted by the plaintiff when he first took ill and saw him many times, making, as he stated, a most special examination to determine whether he could exclude from consideration all possible causes, other than poisoning, of the symptoms of illness which plaintiff had and suffered from. In the result he reached the conclusion that poisoning by the inhalation of poisonous gases was the cause of the man\u2019s illness. This conclusion was, of course, founded partly on the plaintiff\u2019s history of his case, partly on the man\u2019s symptoms and partly upon the test of the patient\u2019s urine and blood made by him, excluding or \u201cruling out all other possible conditions.\u201d He called Dr. Nancekivell in consultation who also seems to have made a very thorough examination of the patient and reached the conclusion that the symptoms which the patient had were those of a man suffering from inhalation of poisonous gases and that those symptoms altogether pointed to nothing else. In cross-examination he expressed himself as willing to pledge his oath that the patient was suffering from gas poisoning and that his opinion was not a matter of conjecture but\nthe result of logical analysis, history, and his condition. There is no one disease you will get the inflammation of all the mucous membranes and the symptoms that he produced. No one disease will give you all those symptoms, outside of gas poisoning.\nLastly we have Dr. Holbrook, a medical gentleman in charge of the Hamilton Sanitarium and who was called and examined pursuant to an order made by the court to have an examination of the plaintiff with a view of giving testimony at the trial. The written report of Dr. Holbrook is very full and complete evidencing not a mere casual examination of his patient but a thorough and complete one. The report after describing in detail the history of the man given by himself and the physical examination made by the doctor, of the plaintiff and the conditions in which he found the different parts and functions of the man, winds up by saying:\nIn addition to these conditions a serious condition has been set up probably due to the fumes from the cyanide tank and which might be described as the chronic effects from cyanide poisoning. It seems to have set up a debility which has affected the nerves and muscles by causing a peculiar change which might be described as a loss of tone. This is probably the chief factor in the heart lesion, but while the other tissues would probably in time regain their tone, yet I would consider that this condition in the heart had led to physical changes which will remain permanent. Thus, while I consider it absolutely impossible to make definite statements at this stage, I would consider that his occupation in the munition plant had led to a general debility probably the result of chronic cyanide poisoning; also to an increase of fibrous or scar tissue in the lungs and to some enlargement in the bronchial gland and to a decrease of tone of the heart muscle fibre with dilation of the heart. I would consider that the man is now unfit for any work and that in all probability he will never be able to return to any but very light work for which the remuneration in his case would be small.\nThe doctor\u2019s examination and cross-examination at the trial did not in any way alter or modify the report he had made, indeed it rather accentuated the opinion he had there expressed.\nHe said:\nNow I think that the bronchitis and irritation of bronchial glands was set up by inhalation of the sulphuric acid, and to some extent, cyanide fumes.\nAgain:\nI think the chronic cyanide poisoning is the chief factor. He may have been over working, too long hours and too hard, that may have had something to do with the breakdown, but the symptoms came on and suggested cyanide poisoning more definitely than any other thing. Of course it was a chronic poisoning, more from the inhalation of vapour.\nIn cross-examination he admitted not being an expert on toxicology or the science of the effect of poisons on the human body but gave with great lucidity the symtoms of cyanide poisoning and left the impression on my mind that, while not professing to be an expert in toxicology, he was well grounded on the subject generally and knew well what he was talking about.\nThe other two medical men I have spoken of, Drs. Martin and Nancekivell, were even more emphatic than was Dr. Holbrook in ascribing the plaintiff\u2019s symptoms to noxious and poisonous vapours. It is true the evidence of these medical men was founded to some extent, possibly to a very large extent, upon the history of his case given to them by the plaintiff and that their conclusions as to these symptoms having been caused by noxious and poisonous vapours were most emphatically contradicted by Dr. John A. Oille, a medical gentleman practising for many years past in Toronto and who, at the request of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, had made a very full examination of the plaintiff\u2019s physical condition. In fact, to my mind it is quite impossible to reconcile Dr. Oille\u2019s evidence with that of Drs. Martin, Nancekivell and Holbrook. In substance, Dr. Oille\u2019s evidence was that his diagnosis disclosed pleurisy and osteo-arthritis as the diseases from which the plaintiff was suffering when he examined him and he is emphatic in his statement that\nneither of these diseases could have been caused by sulphuric acid or cyanide, as both of these diseases are infective in origin.\nBy \u201cinfection.\u201d he explained that it \u201cmeant that bacteria get into the body tissues or blood and cause disease.\u201d\nWhen to this positive and clear evidence of Dr. Oille is added that of Mr. Fertig, a chemist and chemical engineer, who came to Canada from the United States on Government work and whose duties as inspector for the American Government took him to the factory here in question very often, it will be understood why I entertained doubts as to defendant\u2019s liability as to there being evidence to sustain the jury\u2019s findings. Mr. Fertig said that a solution of sulphuric acid mixed with water in the proportion of five gallons to an 80 gallon tank, and the water heated to 200 degrees, would not give off any harmful fumes or gases, and that there was no doubt about it; and further that putting 20 pounds of cyanide in the cyanide tank, 20 to 22, containing about 75 gallons, and the water heated to 100 or 110 degrees Fahrenheit, no harmful gas or fumes would be produced. As he put it:\nNo poisonous gases would come off. That bath in itself would be a very dilute bath, 22 pounds to 75 gallons would be a three per cent. solution.\nIn fact, in cross-examination Mr. Fertig went so far as to say that 24 parts of water standing there in place of these tanks containing sulphuric acid and cyanide, would be just as harmful and as harmless and that the combination of sulphuric acid and cyanide as proved was absolutely harmless and that made it unnecessary to make provision to carry off the fumes.\nIn addition to these conflicting statements of the medical men and the experts, there was, of course, the positive statements of the plaintiff himself as to the effect upon him at the time he breathed in the exhalations from the vats or tanks, and of such men as House as to their having had similar experiences when so employed, and evidence to the contrary by others equally qualified to speak from personal experience.\nThe discharge by the jury of their duties was not a light or easy one. I am not able to say that the evidence justifies me or justified the Appellate Division in setting aside their findings. I have discussed the branch of the case made on the noxious exhalations or fumes arising from the tanks, at some length, because probably it is the strongest for the defendant. I think there was sufficient evidence to justify the finding of the absence, under the circumstances as found by them, of efficient ventilation in the winter season.\nFor these reasons I would allow the appeal with costs and restore the judgment of the trial judge upon the jury\u2019s findings.\nIDINGTON J\u2014The appellant claims from the respondent damages for injuries received, whilst serving as a workman in its factory, at part of the process of making shells for use as war munitions.\nHe alleges that, instead of making the place in which he was set to work reasonably safe for those performing the part of the service he was engaged in, it allowed the air, especially in that part of the room where he worked, to be contaminated with poisonous gases, resulting from the operations in which he and others were engaged; and that for want of proper ventilation he was compelled to inhale such poisonous gases and thereby suffered in his health.\nIt is reasonably clear that the building was so constructed that generally speaking in the warmer seasons ample means of ventilation were supplied by means of open windows or doors for all those engaged in the room in question, unless possibly for those few engaged at serving in immediate contact with the source and cause of the noxious gases in question.\nBut in the cooler and winter months the windows and doors were kept closed.\nObviously if, as now pretended, there were no noxious gases of any kind generated, there might be enough fresh air enter the room through the seams of the metal structure, or round the window frames and doors, to keep the room in a reasonable condition to work in.\nIn resolving the legal problem now submitted to us it does not seem necessary to follow that branch of the inquiry at greater length.\nThe appellant was taken ill and submitted the case, which his condition presented, to a physician in Hamilton who seems to give his evidence in a fair and intelligent manner and he attributes the condition of the appellant to the inhalation of just such noxious gases as might arise from the process in which the appellant was engaged. Indeed he gives a very positive opinion, which, if correct, entitled the appellant to succeed, as he did, with the jury who found, in answer to the appropriate questions submitted, including a number proposed by respondent\u2019s counsel, sufficient facts to maintain the action and assessed the damages at $3,500 if based upon the common law or, alternatively, at $3,664.44 if based on the \u201cFactories Act.\u201d\nThe learned trial judge entered judgment for the former sum.\nAssuming the appellant told the truth and the whole truth as to his work and condition of his health, and his physical condition, the case is of a very simple and ordinary character so far as the relevant law is concerned, and in the result was necessarily committed to the determination of fact by a jury.\nThe physician is corroborated in all essentials by a brother practitioner knowing of and being consulted in the case at the time.\nAt a later time in the course of the proceedings in this suit an order was procured by respondent for the examination of the appellant by an independent physician selected by the judge applied to therefor.\nHis report is in the case and he was called also by appellant on the trial.\nHis report and evidence go also a long way to corroborate the view taken by the other physicians called by appellant. He, in view of the examination which he made of appellant having taken place sixteen months or more after his falling ill, properly speaks with caution as to the possibility of something else than the alleged gases producing the results he found. But so far as a skilled physician, not professing to be a profound toxicologist, could properly do so he leaves no doubt on the vital point of, in his opinion, sulphuric acid and cyanide having been a possible and probable cause of appellant\u2019s condition, and of the gases therefrom having possibly been and indeed probably inhaled in the way testified to by the appellant.\nThe basis for all that testimony of experts is, of course, what the appellant and his witnesses swore to.\nThe evidence of Husband, who was foreman in the room and had been discharged evidently for no other reason than that he did not get along with the men under him in a satisfactory way, seems, notwithstanding that incident, to have been given fairly and intelligently. If he and others are to be believed there is abundant evidence corroborative of appellant\u2019s story, and especially of the inhalation of noxious gases during the operations of appellant, and attributable thereto.\nIt would have been, in my opinion, unjustifiable to have granted a non-suit in face of such a case as thus presented, even if it had been moved for.\nIt is remarkable and indeed, in light of the subsequent development in the Second Appellate Division, amusing to find that able counsel, alert to take properly every possible arguable objection during the course of the trial, never thought of either moving for a non-suit at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, nor at the close of the evidence for defence for a dismissal of the action.\nThe evidence for the defence apart from that of the expert evidence to which I am about to refer later, does not, to my mind, meet that of the appellant and his witnesses in any satisfactory way, much less overbear it in weight. Indeed much of it impresses me, after a perusal of the whole, given for the defence, with the view that it had better have been left aside and the defence rested upon the expert evidence alone, coupled perhaps with some few facts testified to by some of the other witnesses for the defence.\nTurning to the expert evidence, it consists of the evidence of a physician of sixteen years\u2019 standing who laboured under the disadvantage of not having seen the appellant until about two years after he had fallen ill, and of a chemist.\nThis physician had, I infer, seen but one case of acute cyanide poisoning, and none of the chronic cyanide poisoning from inhalation.\nI submit that these facts coupled with the testimony he gives, evidently from reading, in regard to this lastly mentioned possibility, a text book, is not very convincing.\nAnother physician called gives unimportant evidence and admits that probably he knows little of the subject matter involved herein.\nThen we have the evidence of a chemist who in a sentence or two denies that when cyanide is in specific proportions put into water of a certain temperature named, no harmful poison or poisonous gases could arise.\nNo accurate examination of the conditions of the water actually used was ever pretended to have been made by him or any one else, or of the actual condition of the cyanide used. The water was supposed to be of the limited temperature named.\nThe evidence discloses a possible cause of the water becoming overheated by reason of the haste of workmen, ignorant of the consequences, plunging into same many of the pieces to be dipped therein before being properly cooled off.\nAs a basis of scientific investigation, which the Appellate Division lays so much stress upon, I submit it would be difficult to found anything in support of the defence so far as rested thereon. To my mind, especially in view of the fact that cyanide was not used by any others engaged in the same process, except one, and that not named, this sort of testimony is next to if not entirely worthless.\nI agree in the desirability of the truth revealed by science, being, when possible, duly observed, but the process of scientific investigation requires a thorough investigation of all the facts, conditions and circumstances so far as possible, before proceeding to determine and formulate any definite assertion of any supposed rule of action or scientific fact founded thereon.\nIt never seems to have occurred to any one concerned to have examined a single specimen of this so-called cyanide and ascertain thereby the quality of that used and then see what results would flow therefrom under such conditions as it was used herein or even approximately so.\nUnless we are to overturn our system of jurisprudence and the one rule of reason governing in law the results of a jury\u2019s verdict I submit the judgment appealed from cannot be permitted to stand.\nThere was ample ground upon which the jury\u2019s verdict might well have been reached within that rule acting upon the evidence placed before them.\nThe judge\u2019s charge was full, fair and unobjected to, save by suggesting what I am about to refer to, and respondent having let it go at that, ought not to have been heard to complain, unless upon the one question of whether or not the evidence did not disclose a mere case of accident.\nI am of the opinion that the ruling of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board was right in holding that it was not a case of accident, in the sense in which that word is used in the Act in question, but, if any- thing, the result of a continuous and systematic method of carrying on the works in question, in violation of either common law or statutory law, or of both.\nHad, for example, an explosion taken place by reason of the same method, if such a result possibly conceivable, then I can conceive of a case so founded being within the term \u201caccident\u201d in the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\u201d Not being so or akin thereto if as I suspect the injuries were the result of months of continuous defiance of nature\u2019s laws by respondent, the appellant\u2019s right of action is not barred by said Act.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the court of appeal, and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored.\nDUFF J.\u2014I have little to add to the reasons given by the Chief Justice with which I concur on the point whether the injuries from which the appellant suffered were due to the inhalation of noxious gases while engaged in the performance of his duties under his employment with the respondents. I find it impossible to concur in the decision of the Appellate Division that the findings of the jury on this point can be set aside or disregarded as without reasonable foundation in the evidence.\nA more serious question is raised by Mr. Johnson\u2019s contention that there is no evidence justifying the finding that by the negligence of the respondents the appellant was deprived of some protection to which he was entitled and through which he would probably have escaped the harmful action of the gases to which he was exposed.\nThe evidence on this point is very meagre. After carefully considering the testimony of Mr. Darling, who was called on behalf of the respondents, together with the evidence as to the state of the atmosphere in which the appellant was working, I cannot concur in the view that there is not some support for the jury\u2019s finding on this point.\nI should add a single word upon the effect of sec. 15 and sub-sec. 1 of the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\u201d I refrain from expressing any opinion on the question whether a claim for compensation having been rejected by the Board on the ground that the facts out of which the injury arose did not bring the case within the category of accident, it is open to the employer to allege in an action by the employee based upon the charge of negligence that the same facts did constitute an accident bringing the case within the operation of the provisions of the Act, including sub-sec. 1 of sec. 15 which on that hypothesis would afford an answer to the employee\u2019s action, if such a contention were open to the employer.\nIt is unnecessary to pass upon this because, for the reasons given by the Chief Justice, I think the respondents\u2019 contention independently of the Board\u2019s decision must fail.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Sec. 43 (1) of the \u201cFactory Act\u201d (R.S.O. ch. 229), as amended by 8 Geo. V., ch. 44, sec. 4, requires that\nthe employer of every factory or shop shall ventilate the factory or shop in such a manner as to keep the air reasonably pure and so as to render harmless as far as reasonably practicable all gases, vapours, dust or other impurities generated in the course of any manufacturing process or handicraft carried on therein that may be injurious to good health.\nAt common law an employer is bound to provide so far as practicable a reasonably safe place for his work- men to work in. Ainslie Mining and Railway Co. v. McDougall[8].\nThe plaintiff complains that while engaged in the defendant\u2019s munition factory he was unnecessarily exposed to the inhalation of poisonous gases generated in the course of its manufacturing process; that such exposure was due to inadequate ventilation of the annealing room where he worked; and that it resulted in serious and permanent injury to his health. On the trial, before Mr. Justice Clute, a jury found these several allegations to be established. On appeal the judgment based on this verdict was unanimously set aside, the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas delivering the judgment of the Divisional Court and holding that on each of the three issues\nthere was no evidence upon which reasonable men could find in the plaintiff\u2019s favour[9].\nOn the plaintiff\u2019s appeal to this court the defendant supports this judgment and also contends that if injury to the plaintiff\u2019s health was caused as he alleges, the case was one of \u201caccident\u201d within the provisions of the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d (4 Geo. V., ch. 25, Ont.) and this action therefore cannot be maintained. It will be convenient to deal first with the latter defence.\nThe plaintiff duly presented a claim for compensation to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board and it was twice considered by that body. On the first occasion it was rejected, as the formal certificate says, on the ground that it did not appear that\nthe claimant sustained a personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment;\nand on the second, because the Board is unable to find that the claimant sustained personal injury by accident within the meaning of the Act.\nThe respondent contends that it is consistent with these certificates that the Board based its rejection of the claim on the view that the plaintiff had not in fact been injured as he avers, and did not determine that if so injured the case would not be one of accident within the meaning of the statute. The second certificate seems to me rather to indicate that the Board meant to hold that any injury the plaintiff sustained was not due to an accident and that it was therefore without jurisdiction. Any possible doubt on this point however is removed by these passages in the evidence given by Mr. Kingstone, one of the Commissioners, who made an investigation on behalf of the Board.\nQ. Did you find when you were inspecting that factory that there were sufficient methods provided by that company to remove sulphuric acid fumes from that room? A. Well, let me answer that by making this mention; I had this in my mind, I was naturally looking under the terms of the Act to see whether or not anything had happened which could be considered an accident, because under the terms of sec. 3 of the Act the claim could only be allowed if it could be found that there had been injury to this man by accident.\nQ. And you decided ultimately it was not an accident? A. I concluded there had been no injury by accident.\nQ. How did you conclude that the injury had been sustained? A. Having excluded the question of accident\u2014\nHis Lordship: The report is very explicit. (Reading report.) Then they found this case was outside the jurisdiction of the Board?\nWitness: Yes, when I found that I did not go so far into the investigation of what was the trouble with the man as I otherwise would have, had I been charged with the responsibility of getting at the whole trouble.\n* * *\nMr. MacBrayne: Q. Speaking as a witness on behalf of the defendants, can you say whether there was sufficient ventilation in this room or not? A. I would not want to express an opinion. Because from that point of view I do not know; all I do know it satisfied me there was no accident.\nHis Lordship: You were not there after September? A. I was just there in connection with another accident on another occasion. Q. You have no knowledge of the conditions in winter? A. No.\nMr. MacBrayne: Did you inquire whether the conditions you saw in September were the same as in January and February of that year? A. Well now, I don\u2019t know that I can say that I did. I inquired sufficient to satisfy me that no accident had happened to this man, within the meaning of our Act.\nBy sec. 6 (1) of the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d the Board is given exclusive jurisdiction to determine all matters and questions arising under Part I. of the Act. That part deals with workmen\u2019s rights to compensation. By sec. 64 the Board is empowered to determine, if an action is brought by a workman against the employer in respect of an injury, whether the workman is entitled to maintain the action or only to compensation under the statute.\nBy an amendment (5 Geo. V., ch. 24, sec. 8 (2)) any party to an action is enabled to apply to the Board for adjudication and determination of the question of the plaintiff\u2019s right to compensation or as to whether the action is one the right to bring which is taken away by Part I.; and such adjudication and determination is declared to be final and conclusive. The re\u2011consideration by the Board of the plaintiff\u2019s application for compensation was at the instance of the present defendant, and I agree with the learned Chief Justice of the Common Pleas that the Board\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s claim was not founded on a personal injury by accident within the meaning of the Act is binding on the defendant and not open to review in this action.\nIf the question were open I should incline to apply and follow the decisions in Steel v. Cammell, Laird & Co.[10]; Martin v. Manchester Corporation[11]; Broderick v. London County Council[12]; and Eke v. Hart-Dyke[13], the authority of which, so far as they require proof of a particular occurrence causing the injury complained of, which happened within some narrow limitation of time has not been materially affected, as I understand it, by the recent judgment of the House of Lords in the readily distinguishable case of Innes or Grant v. G. & G. Kynock[14]. I agree with the learned Chief Justice that the \u201cWorkmen\u2019s Compensation Act\u201d\ndoes not stand in the way of this action.\nBut, I am, with great respect, at a loss to understand how it can be said that there was not any evidence on which the jury could reasonably find as they did in favour of the plaintiff on each of the three issues involved in the question of the defendant\u2019s liability. There was, in my opinion, quite sufficient evidence, if the jury saw fit to credit it, to support their verdict on all three issues. This expression of opinion would perhaps suffice to dispose of this appeal, but, in deference to the learned judges of the Divisional Court, I think I should indicate what the evidence is upon which the jury\u2019s verdict in my view should have been sustained.\nWere there noxious fumes or gases given off from the sulphuric acid and cyanide vats in the defendants\u2019 annealing room?\nThe plaintiff gives this evidence:\nQ. What would be the effect on the sulphuric acid and the cyanide as you put these shells in there? A. Gas fumes, the hot shells going into the hot acid.\nQ. There were fumes? A. As soon as you put them in the acid there was fumes you could see.\nQ. That is steam? A. Yes.\n* * *\nQ. Your work took you practically over those vats? A. Yes.\nWilliam Husband, formerly a foreman with the defendant, says: His Lordship: What was the effect of this closing of the windows?\nA. Why, it would cause a kind of heavy cloud of steam; pretty hard to see through it.\nQ. From where? A. From the steam arising from the vats. The cold air would meet with the steam.\nQ. Was there an odour to this steam that came from the vats? A. Yes.\nQ. Having regard to the plaintiff\u2019s work, and his position during the work, what would you say as to whether or not he might or might not inhale any of the fumes? A. It is possible he may have. I have myself.\nQ. You were not working over them? A. No.\nQ. What do you say of the plaintiff in regard to his position and his work, whether or not he was in such a position that he would inhale it? A. Oh, yes, he would inhale it. He would inhale it more if the wind was on the west side. In the winter time it would blow up a sort of cloud.\n* * *\nQ. Has the cyanide in solution an odour? A. It has.\nQ. What is it like? A. It is sickening to the head.\nQ. Is it an odour that you can readily distinguish? A. It is.\nQ. Then when you were using 20 pounds of this cyanide to 80 gallons of water, was there a perceptible odour? A. There was when we were using the strong stuff.\nQ. And the strong stuff is the 20 pounds to the 80 gallons? A. Yes.\nQ. Were there any fumes or odours from the sulphuric acid? A. Oh, yes.\nMr. Johnston: That is clearly a leading question.\nMr. MacBrayne: I don\u2019t know how I could ask the question in any other way.\nHis Lordship: Q. Was there an odour from the cyanide? A. Yes.\nQ. What was it? A. A kind of sickening smell, and it used to affect my throat and lungs; if I got a good smell of it it would affect my throat.\nMr. MacBrayne: How many cyanide baths were there in that room. A. Two.\nQ. And was the other being operated in the same way? A. Yes.\nQ. With the same strength of pounds? A. Yes.\nQ. Winter and summer? A. Yes.\nQ. You said something to His Lordship about the effect of the odour from cyanide; will you tell us what that was? A. It affected in such a way that it was a kind of sickening smell to the head, and also affected my throat and lungs; each time I worked on the cyanide I would have the feeling till such time as I had reduced the quantity of cyanide.\nQ. Was Scotland\u2019s work such as to keep him in this cyanide odour? A. It was such that there was three sets of vats he had to pass it to; he would be working there most of the time. Q. Did he have any other place to work? A. Well, he was changing around from the tanks. In the beginning he worked on sulphuric alone. After he was there a few weeks I put him to the cyanide tanks, because he was a smart man.\nThe strong mixture of cyanide, 20 or 22 pounds to 75 or 80 gallons of water, was used during most of Scotland\u2019s period of work. A harmless soda mixture is generally used for the same purpose.\nHusband adds:\nHis Lordship: What was the difference between the lesser and the larger amount, in regard to its effect?\nA. The fumes were stronger in the larger amount, and it left a kind of white substance on the cases.\nJames House, a fellow employee of the plaintiff, says:\nQ. All I want you to tell the jury is what was the condition of that room when you were working there? A. The condition of the room, you mean the air, and in regard to the acid and cyanide?\nQ. Yes. A. Well, in the cold weather the air was so thick with the sulphuric acid fumes and the cyanide that you could hardly see one another apart sometimes, and in inhaling the fumes it caused a bitter taste in the mouth, dizziness, headache, pricking of the eyes, and sleeplessness at night, and more tired when I got up in the morning than at night. When I went in I weighed 148, and when I came out I weighed 123 pounds.\nQ. During the winter season what method was there for removing these fumes and letting fresh air in? A. There was no method whatever.\nQ. Was there a window in the north side? A. No, the cold weather would blow the fumes to you, and you could not see, and it was so warm you would get heated up so over the tanks that you could not stand the least cold draft on you.\nQ. What was your particular work? A. Packing the shells as they came out of the tank into the boxes.\nQ. They had been pickled or had their bath? A. Yes.\nQ. Why did you quit? A. Well, I quit on the doctor\u2019s advice.\nJuror: Did you notice the fumes much more when the cyanide was being used? A. Well, you could taste it more.\n* * *\nHis Lordship: What do you say caused the tired feeling?\nA. Well, I believe it was the fumes of the sulphuric acid and cyanide, because before I went there I was in perfect health, could eat anything, and after being there three or four months I lost my appetite, and got up so cross and tired in the morning that I hated myself. Q. Might that be attributed to the hard work? A. No, I worked at harder work before I went there.\nJuror: Did you do any vomiting in the morning? A. Yes, shortly after I had eaten my lunch.\nQ. What was the cause of that? A. The fumes it must have been, a bitter taste in my mouth, and food would not digest.\nJohn Roberts, another fellow employee, gives this evidence.\nQ. That was the only thing that held you up? A. No, I used to be I couldn\u2019t eat, take a little milk food.\nQ. Did you lose any time during the six weeks except for this finger? A. No. I was not thinking the acid was doing any harm till people told me I was looking bad, and was yellow in the face, and couldn\u2019t eat and sleep, so I laid off after Christmas.\nQ. Go to the doctor? A. No.\nHis Lordship: What caused that? A. The work I done before I never felt as I did then, I believe my flesh was yellow, and a nasty taste in my mouth, couldn\u2019t eat or sleep, and always tired getting up, wasn\u2019t the same man anyhow.\n* * *\nQ. That atmosphere is very heavy? A. Yes. Kind of hangs like that. A man inhaling that stuff it makes him sick. I could not eat, no taste of any food, just a little porridge that I had.\nHusband also tells of an employee named Stirling who left the factory saying: \u201cI can\u2019t stand these fumes and acid\u201d\u2014and went to a hospital.\nErnest Darling, a ventilating expert called for the defence, says:\nQ. And so you would expect that these gases that would be in this room should be diluted? A. Yes.\nQ. Why? A. If they are injurious to human health they should be diluted.\nHis Lordship: Do you know whether they are injurious or not?\nA. From my knowledge I would know that cyanide gas is injurious, but sulphuric acid gases I don\u2019t believe are injurious to the same extent.\nNo doubt there is evidence from others, officers and employees of the defendant, that there were no perceptible fumes or gases in the annealing room; and one Fertig, a chemist called for the defendant, denied the possibility of fumes or gases arising from vats containing solutions of sulphuric acid and cyanide in the proportions and at the temperatures which the defendant company was supposed to maintain. In fact, he said these vats\nwere just as harmless as 24 pails of water. * * * Therefore why should any provision be made to take off the fumes?\nOf course the witness assumed that the solutions were always maintained in the proportions directed and that the temperatures never exceeded those prescribed. Either of these conditions might easily have varied from time to time.\nBut it was clearly within the province of a jury to determine what credence should be given to the very positive and sweeping testimony of this witness and whether it should or should not be relied upon in view of the actual experience of the presence of such fumes and gases deposed to by men who had worked in the factory. When to their testimony is added the evidence of the doctors who examined the plaintiff (to be more particularly referred to in dealing with the next question) I confess my inability to understand how it can be said that there was no evidence on which a jury could reasonably have found that harmful gases or fumes were given off from the sulphuric acid or cyanide vats.\nWas the plaintiff\u2019s impairment of health due to the inhalation of these gases\u2014was he a victim of chronic poisoning from them? Dr. Martin, who had the best opportunity of forming a reliable opinion since he saw the man immediately after he was obliged to quit work, is convinced that he was.\nMy diagnosis was poisoning from the inhalation of poisonous gases\u2014that the man\u2019s condition is the result of inhalation of poisonous fumes.\nHe rests his opinion on the symptoms of his patient and the history of the case. How far the plaintiff could be depended upon to give a truthful history the jury had an opportunity of judging. They saw him in the witness box. Dr. Martin deposes that tests were made to eliminate the possibility of other diseases. No evidence of any other condition was found which would account for the symptoms as a whole, and while each of them, if taken separately, might be otherwise accounted for, the Doctor says that \u201cthe symptoms all together pointed to nothing else\u201d than poisoning by the inhalation of poisonous gases, such as sulphuric acid and cyanide fumes.\nDr. Nancekivell, called by Dr. Martin in consultation, also examined the plaintiff two or three days after he was taken ill. His conclusion was that he had been poisoned by poisonous gases. He adds that if the man had come to him and he had not known that he had been working in a brass foundry he would have pronounced it a case of gas poisoning. Asked to do so he pledged his oath that the man is suffering from gas poisoning; and he adds:\nNo one disease will give you all those symptoms (which the plaintiff exhibited) outside of gas poisoning.\nDr. Holbrook, the physician in charge of the Hamilton Sanitarium, who has had experience in gas poisoning cases with a number of returned soldiers, was appointed by the court, at the instance of the defendant, to examine the plaintiff and report upon his condition. He made three examinations, but had not the advantage of seeing the patient soon after he became ill. He found conditions, however, which he ascribes to the inhalation of sulphuric acid and cyanide fumes.\nIt seems to me the cyanide fumes, the effect of that accumulated until a toxic effect was produced. * * * I think chronic cyanide poisoning is the chief factor * * *. Of course it was a chronic poisoning, more from the inhalation of vapour * * *. I think the conclusion I came to was that the cyanide poisoning was responsible for the different conditions he presented, and there was the general lowering of tone, nervousness, vomiting of food and irritability of the stomach * * *. It might be possible to deny that any of the symptoms he had were due to cyanide poisoning, but I think that the general lowering of tone and the symptoms were caused by that and nothing else.\nQ. It might have been caused by one hundred different things? A. Yes, but in fairness to the man I do not think it was.\nDr. Oille, a physician employed by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, called by the defendant, on the other hand, found no conditions that could not be fully accounted for by other causes and an absence of some symptoms which, in his opinion, are characteristic of cyanide poisoning. Dr. Oille admitted, of course, that when sulphuric acid and cyanide fumes reach a certain percentage they become dangerous, and will make a man sick if the percentage is great enough. And according to Drs. Martin and Nancekivell, the plaintiff exhibited most of the symptoms which Dr. Oille states to be those of cyanide poisoning.\nThere is no suggestion that the plaintiff was exposed to the inhalation of poisonous gases anywhere else than in the defendant\u2019s annealing room.\nThe jury found that\nthe conditions in the factory where the plaintiff worked caused his present and possibly future disability.\nBut the Chief Justice delivering the judgment of the Appellate Division says:\nAll the symptoms of illness of the plaintiff deposed to were by all the physicians stated to be symptoms of a common everyday character that may arise from any one of many common ailments; they proved nothing.\nWith deference it would seem that some of the evidence above outlined must have escaped the learned Chief Justice\u2019s attention. Otherwise I cannot account for his comment. He adds:\nNo other conclusion can be reached by me than that reasonable men could not find upon the evidence alone that the plaintiff was injured by poisonous vapours arising from these tanks; though reasonable men might be led by their impulses to do so * * *.\nWith respect, it was clearly competent for the jury to find as they did on this branch of the case. Not only was there evidence to warrant their finding but the weight of the medical testimony supports it. In accepting the evidence of Dr. Oille and rejecting the opinions of the other three physicians because of their lack of \u201cany special knowledge in chemistry or toxicology,\u201d the appellate court would seem to have usurped the functions of the jury. The same observation may be made upon their action in treating the evidence of the chemist Fertig (\u201cthe proper evidence\u201d the learned Chief Justice terms it) as conclusive against the presence in the annealing room of cyanide and sulphuric acid fumes arising from the tanks, notwithstanding their actual experience deposed to by several men who worked there and the conditions found in the plaintiff by three reputable physicians ascribed by them to the inhalation of these gases and for the existence of which no other cause has been or can be suggested and also as to the effect given to the evidence of the defendant\u2019s expert in ventilation notwithstanding the weaknesses in it disclosed on cross-examination and the actual atmospheric conditions in the annealing room deposed to by several witnesses.\nThe evidence on this latter branch of the case must now be considered. Admittedly there was no artificial ventilation and little attention seems to have been paid to the need for it. Open doors and windows provided excellent ventilation during the summer but there is abundant testimony that these were all closed during the cold weather.\nThe plaintiff worked in the annealing room from October, 1916, to February, 1917.\nErnest Darling, the expert in ventilation called by the defendant, deposed that, owing to the character of the building\u2014a shed with sides and ends of corrugated iron sheeting\nthe walls were not tight * * *. The building ventilates itself so to speak * * *. As far as ventilation is concerned it was very well ventilated. I think the trouble is that it is a question of heat and cold.\nThis expert made no examination of the building when the conditions prevailed under which the plaintiff was working. He never saw the factory in operation. On cross-examination it became apparent that he relied on open windows to take care of any noxious fumes that might arise in the room. The opening or closing of windows was left to the whim of the workmen, and some of them tell us that owing to the heat from the natural gas furnaces in the room\u20141200\u00b0 Fahrenheit\u2014and the character of the work they were engaged in they could not stand the draft from open windows during cold weather, working as they did in their shirts or with bare backs, and that consequently windows and doors were kept closed. The witness Darling criticizes their bad judgment in not opening windows on the side of the building on which there was no wind, but gives this significant testimony:\u2014\nQ. Wouldn\u2019t the air in this room if there were not sufficient ventilation, become very much vitiated after ten hours\u2019 work, with the windows closed, the doors open occasionally? A. Yes.\nQ. And are you not trusting to a sort of accidental or providential ventilation when you speak of the doors being open? A. No. I think the men should use their judgment.\nQ. Then is it a good system of ventilation that leaves the question of shoving off the entire ventilation to the control of some workman? A. You would have a great deal of trouble if it is left in the hands of more than one man.\nQ. Shouldn\u2019t it be left in the hands of the management? A. No, the men should do it themselves.\nQ. Is a system which is left to the men themselves and which causes physical injury to a man, a good system of ventilation? A. Not necessarily, no.\nQ. It sounds rather bad? A. Yes.\nQ. Wasn\u2019t that the case here? A. Not necessarily.\nQ. These men who felt the cold should close the windows? A. The amount of gas\u2014\nQ. I am not talking of that? A. The density of the gas is the main feature.\nQ. Is that system of ventilation which is left with workmen, entirely at the whim of any workman, to use or stop using it, a good and sufficient system? A. In that class of building, yes.\nQ. In any class of building? A. No.\nQ. Then with this building, why this building? A. Merely a shed.\nQ. Then the windows don\u2019t amount to anything at all? A. Sure they do.\nQ. Shut them and they still have good ventilation? A. Not necessarily.\nQ. And the ventilators are no good because the cold air is coming in? A. You have to take into consideration the whole operation of the building.\nQ. Because that is a shell of a building, built of corrugated iron, therefore the workman can close those windows or not, and it is still an efficient system of ventilation? A. An efficient system if properly used. You have to use your judgment.\nDarling also states that\nwhere you have concentration of gases\u2014where they become dense or the air becomes saturated with gases\n\u2014forced ventilation is\na necessary part of factory construction\nin order to carry those gases off; and, again, that some provision (should be made)\nnot carrying them off\u2014dilution by supplies of cold air.\nHe also says that for 90% of the time a building such as that of the defendants\u2019 would be satisfactory\nand manufacturers find they can afford as a rule to use a building like that rather than go into a brick building, where it would be unsatisfactory in summer, just simply for a few weeks of cold weather in winter. Mr. Kingston, a member of the Board, testified to finding satisfactory ventilation when he visited the building. But his visit was paid in the comparatively warm weather of September, when windows and doors would be open.\nSome of the evidence on the conditions of the atmosphere in the annealing room and its ventilation during the winter months is as follows:\u2014\nWilliam Husband, a former foreman of the annealing department, tells of having complained of the ventilation in the winter of 1916, while Scotland was working there, to the superintendent, Mr. Embree, and suggested the introduction of suction fans. He says the reply was\nthe cold shoulder; if the men did not like it, get more men at the gate.\nQ. Was there any result from your complaint? A. No, not just then, not till the summer time. When the summer came they knocked off two sheets of galvanized iron on the north and the south and of the roof but not during the winter.\nQ. So the condition you complained of remained all that winter? A. Yes.\nEmbree denies this complaint.\nAsked whether the windows were closed entirely during the winter months, Husband said:\nIt really depends upon the conditions of the weather. If the men are working in front of a draft they close the window. We could not keep them open in the winter, men working in their shirts or bare backs.\nI have already quoted the passage in this witness\u2019s evidence where he describes the effect of the closing of the windows in winter and the atmospheric conditions in the building. To complete it I add this extract:\nSpeaking of the winter season, that these places were closed, did you, as foreman, have these rooms ventilated in any way? A. I might have opened the windows occasionally myself, but they were soon shut, because the men got cold.\nQ. Would the day gang coming in start in with fresh air? A. Not on a cold morning. Q. And would the night gang start in with fresh air? A. Just come in with the same as the day gang left it.\nI have already quoted from the evidence of James House, who was working in the annealing department at the same time as Scotland. To complete what he says I add this passage:\nQ. You could have opened the doors or windows at any time to get fresh air? A. Not very well in the winter. Because we could not stand the cold air.\nQ. The place was heated? A. It was not so hot, a person when perspiring cannot stand cold air.\nQ. You say you could not ventilate the place without getting cold? A. In the winter time.\nFrom the evidence of John Roberts, also employed with Scotland, I extract the following additional questions and answers:\nQ. Then I want you to tell the jury what you found the working conditions to be while you were there? A. Well, I found it a very hot place, very unhealthy.\nQ. Describe the conditions? A. There was two furnaces there in a very small room, about the size of this room, two annealing furnaces, and lots of vats. Two different sorts of vats, and lots of steam coming out of the vats. I did not stay there very long; I stayed there six weeks.\nQ. Was there any method of getting rid of the foul air that might be in the room? A. Yes, I guess there was. There was windows above and all around, and I never seen them open hardly, because we could not very well stand the cold air. It was the winter time, and with the sweat and the hot place the men could not stand the cold air. We were all in short shirts, just pants and boots on. We were so hot that we could not stand any cold air. We were working in just an undershirt.\nQ. Were all the men just working with the undershirt on? A. Yes.\n* * *\nQ. It was very hot there in winter in the Cartridge Company\u2019s factory? A. Yes, very hot.\nQ. Why didn\u2019t you open the windows? A. I was not the boss.\nQ. You would have opened the windows and Husband would not let you? A. If I had opened them you would not very well stand it in the winter time, and a gush of wind, zero weather, and us sweating, and the fumes, you could not stand it, we would be held up in another way.\nQ. So you say it was impracticable to open windows? A. Yes. Better if there had been a fan to take the fumes away. Q. Who told you about a fan? A. Nobody. I have been in different factories and seen them.\nQ. Where would you have put a fan? A. Well, I am not an engineer. Every man has a position. I would not know, but most likely some person would have picked up a place to put a fan.\nQ. Can you suggest any way in which the ventilation of that building could have been improved? A. No, sir, I was not getting that deep into it. I knew I had to quit because I was losing my health.\n* * *\nJuror: Couldn\u2019t you have the top windows open in the winter? A. I could not tell you. I have seen them pulling the chain on the side to open them.\nQ. Do you know if they were opened; could you feel the draft from up there? A. No. But in the side doors a man could not have the draft at his back. And a man sweating with two furnaces on each side of him.\nQ. If the top window was open there was quite a draft to drive up the vapours? A. No, I don\u2019t think it would. It seemed to work slowly. * * *\nQ. You were not over the tank all the time? A. Not the same kind of a tank as he was. Just on the wash-off tank and cyanide, and I would put it in there ready for the press room.\nHis Lordship: Would you get as heavy fumes where you were as Scotland? A. No, because he was getting it all the time. I was getting a chance to get away from it. I was putting them in the clean water part of the time; I was not getting as much as him. He was in it all the time.\nIn view of all this evidence it is not at all surprising that the jury found that the defendant\u2019s factory was not\nventilated in such a manner as to keep the air reasonably pure and so as to render harmless as far as reasonably practicable all gases, vapours or other impurities generated in the course of the manufacturing process carried on by the defendant while the plaintiff was in its employment,\nthat\nthe conditions in the factory where the plaintiff worked (had) caused his present and possibly future disability\nand that the defendant was guilty of negligence which occasioned this injury in that\nsufficient ventilation was not provided while the plaintiff worked there.\nThe finality of a verdict, where it is such as a jury viewing the whole evidence reasonably could properly find, is too well established to admit of discussion. As Lord Atkinson said in Toronto Rly. Co. v. King[15], at page 270:\nThe jury is the tribunal entrusted by law with the determination of questions of fact and their conclusions on such questions ought not to be disturbed because they are not such as judges sitting in courts of appeal might themselves have arrived at.\nIn Commissioner of Railways v. Brown[16], at page 134, Lord Fitzgerald, speaking for the Judicial Committee, said:\nWhere the question is one of fact and there is evidence on both sides properly submitted to the jury, the verdict of the jury once found ought to stand.\nHere no exception is taken to the charge of the learned trial judge.\nAs put by Lord Macnaghten in Cooke v. Midland Great Western Rly. Co. of Ireland[17], at page 233:\nThe only question before your Lordships is this: Was there evidence of negligence on the part of the company fit to be submitted to the jury? If there was the verdict must stand, although your Lordships might have come to a different conclusion on the same materials.\nI reiterate my inability to understand how any answer can be given in the present case to the question presented by Lord Macnaghten other than in the affirmative.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here and in the Appellate Division and would restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The duty of a master towards his servants is to provide such appliances as are necessary for avoiding accidents and for preserving their health; and where there are special circumstances which are likely to cause injury the degree of care required is proportionately higher. Then consummate caution is required. Dominion Natural Gas Co. v. Collins[18].\nThe respondent company was using in its manufacture acids which might produce fumes and gases injurious to the health of its employees. At common law, it was bound to see that its building would be properly ventilated in order that those fumes and gases should cause the least injury possible to its employees.\nThe statutory provisions in force in Ontario under the \u201cFactories Act\u201d and the \u201cPublic Health Act\u201d required that the building in which the plaintiff worked should be ventilated in such a manner as to keep the air reasonably pure so as to render harmless vapours generated in the course of work done.\nThe evidence is rather conflicting as to whether there were harmful gases and proper ventilation. But it was for the jury to decide as to its value. The jury found that there was negligence. There was certainly sufficient evidence to justify such a conclusion. The Appellate Division came to a different conclusion.\nThe respondent relies upon what it calls the uncontradicted evidence of an expert chemist. It is true that this expert stated positively that no injurious gas emanated from the receptacles in which acids were diluted. But the evidence of the co-employees of the plaintiff and of the doctors who attended him shew conclusively that his health has been injured by gases which evidently poisoned him.\nIn these circumstances the findings of the jury should not have been disturbed.\nIt is contended by the respondent that the plaintiff\u2019s right of action has been abolished by the \u201cWork- men\u2019s Compensation Act,\u201d 4 Geo. V. ch. 25, which established a new code of law respecting compensation for accidents to workmen. The statute provided that all claims for accidents to workmen should be dealt with by a Board and that employers would be required to contribute yearly to a fund which should be administered by the Board.\nIn this case the appellant applied to the Board for compensation; but the Board decided that it was not an accident which entitled him to compensation from the Board.\nThe word accident, on the construction of which the plaintiff\u2019s application was dismissed, has been more discussed than any other word.\nIt means some unexpected event happening without design and the time of which can be fixed.\nThe latter condition as to the time cannot be ascertained in the present case.\nIt has been decided that lead poisoning contracted gradually is not an accident.

T. Jones K.C. for the appellant.\nM. B. Peacock for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I have no doubt as to the intent and meaning of the statute in question on this appeal. It reads as follows:\u2014\n1. This act may be cited as \"The Married Women's Relief Act.\"\n2. The widow of a man who dies leaving a will by the terms of which his said widow would, in the opinion of the judge before whom the application is made, receive less than if he had died intestate may apply to the Supreme Court, for relief.\n* * * *\n8. On any such application the Court may make such allowance to the applicant out of the estate of her husband disposed of by will as may be just and equitable in the circumstances.\nThe legislature of Alberta had decided that under the conditions with which it was dealing in that Province the widow of a man dying intestate was entitled to receive as her share of the distributable estate of her husband one half. The statute now before us for construction seems to me simply to mean that the widow shall not be deprived of this statutory right but that if the husband by his will has attempted so to deprive her she may apply for relief to one of the Justices of the Supreme Court who may grant her such relief as he may determine is \"just and equitable in the circumstances.\"\nOn such application the question immediately arises whether there is any and what limitation on this power given to the judge. Is he limited in its exercise by the amount of the statutory provision made for the widow in cases of intestacy, namely one half of the distributable estate of the husband or not; may he allow her without any limitation what he determines is \"just and equitable in the circumstances\" up to the full amount of the husband's distributable estate.\nI think the legislature in determining the widow's share of her husband's estate in cases of intestacy has, in this new statute quoted above, imposed that limitation upon the judge's discretion and that he cannot allow her more than this statutory provision in cases of intestacy.\nI cannot put the point more clearly or concisely than it is stated by Chief Justice Harvey in the Court of Appeal where he says:\u2014 Then again it is clear that if the husband die intestate, under no circumstances can the wife have more than the share fixed by law as her share on intestacy. Similarly, if the will give her that much she can have no more. Then can it be intended that, if the will give her any less, no matter how small the difference, this fact gives the Court the right to set aside the total disposition of the testator of any part of his property. I agree with Mr. Justice Walsh that such an anomaly could scarcely have been intended.\nI fully concur with this conclusion of the Chief Justice and am of the opinion the order of the trial judge on this application must be set aside because it ignores the statutory limitation of the widow's rights in cases of intestacy and is in excess of the jurisdiction given to the judge by the statute.\nThen the question arises what proportion of the half of the husband's distributable estate should be allowed the applicant. Should she be allowed up to the full amount of her rights in cases of intestacy or a smaller amount and if so what. The trial judge under a mistaken construction of his powers allowed her more than the full amount she would be entitled to in case of intestacy. Two of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal agreed with him alike as to his powers and as to the amount he allowed. In these circumstances I think, without attempting to deal with the evidence and fix the allowance in this Court, full justice will be done by reducing the amount allowed by the trial judge to the statutory provision in cases of intestacy, namely one half of the distributable estate; that being the full amount I conclude the Court is entitled to give under the statute.\nI would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the judgment below and allow the widow one half of the distributable surplus of her husband's estate and would refer the case back to the Appellate Division of Alberta to give effect to our judgment.\nAppellant's costs throughout should be paid out of the estate. IDINGTON J.\u2014The Legislature of Alberta in 1910, by an Act entitled \"The Married Women's Relief Act\" sections 2 and 8 thereof, enacted as follows:\u2014\n2. The widow of a man who dies leaving a will by the terms of which his said widow would, in the opinion of the judge before whom the application is made, receive less than if he had died intestate may apply to the Supreme Court for relief.\n* * * * *\n8. On any such application the Court may make such allowance to the applicant out of the estate of her husband disposed of by will as may be just and equitable in the circumstances.\nThe respondent is the widow of the late Robert Thomas McBratney who by his last will and testament devised and bequeathed unto the appellant Janet McGregor McBratney, all his real and personal estate and declared therein that he had made ample provision for his wife by transferring to her certain real properties in the City of Calgary.\nThe respondent, after a fruitless and expensive suit instituted by her to set aside the will, made an application under said section 2, quoted above, for such relief as the Act provides may be given.\nMr. Justice Stuart who heard the application, found that the properties held by the said widow produce about $25.00 a month, after deducting expenses; that she got about $1,000 insurance on her husband's life; and that the estate devised and bequeathed was probably worth $18,000. Out of this estimated value of the estate would have to be paid succession duties, the costs of the litigation brought about by respondent alone at least $2,000 and debts and expenses of administration.\nInasmuch as there was only one child, issue of the marriage, surviving, the widow would, in case of intestacy, have received half of the estate.\nThere is therefore ground for the application under the Act even if property held by the widow is to be reckoned with.\nOn the application the learned judge allowed the respondent $10,198 as a first charge on the estate.\nHe seemed to estimate she should have an annuity of $720 a year payable half yearly in addition to the revenue from the property and insurance monies she had got.\nHe proceeded on the theory that she should get a lump sum that would produce such an annuity\u2014being what he says looking at the annuity tables it would cost. I think if we use common knowledge of the rate of interest in that province she thus gets an income of more than the husband's earnings in health, and income from real estate, at the time of the death combined, which had been found sufficient for the support of both of them.\nWith great respect, that does not seem to me to be the exercise of a reasonable discretion such as we are pressed with by the argument of respondent's counsel that it was.\nNor do I think, if regard is had to the position of the sister who is devisee of the estate and whose earning capacity may terminate ere long and she be left penniless, or nearly so, that such a disposition would, in the language of the statute, be \"just and equitable in the circumstances.\"\nIf an equal division between those concerned of the estate left after paying all costs and all other expenses and charges, which would be what the widow would have got if her husband had died intestate, had been made, I do not think there would have been much room for successful argument on this appeal.\nOr even if the annuity, which the learned judge suggested, had been given the respondent for life, as a charge upon the estate, I should not have felt disposed to interfere, though possibly I might not, if trial judge, have given respondent as much.\nIn the first named alternative she would have got what the law has held for ages to be just under any circumstances; and hence, in the circumstances to be dealt with herein, possibly prima facie just and equitable.\nThat is only after all perhaps a rough measure of justice but it has stood so long as being according to the conscience of our English race just and equitable that I do not think it should be discarded entirely in a case that presents such circumstances as this case does, and protects respondent thereunder in a way that seems ample seeing what she has already got.\nI am not prepared to hold as two of the learned judges of the Appellate Division do that the line so drawn is one limiting the jurisdiction.\nIt is a line that should be given due weight and possibly be adhered to as not inconsistent with what is \"just and equitable\" when the circumstances are such as exist here, for our consideration.\nBut in many cases from conceivably an innumerable variety of circumstances such a line would neither be just nor equitable. It would give in many too little and in many more too much. I am not prepared to sanction any such doctrine, as being what the legislature intended as either the limit of this new jurisdiction or a prima facie rule to be adopted.\nThe far reaching evil consequences of such a doctrine being established as law would, both in a social and economic sense, transcend what I would submit any of us can correctly appreciate.\nI doubt if any one possessed of the necessary intelligence and of calm judgment, and the results of profound study of the problem, has ever proposed what is now seriously contended to be the established rule.\nI say \"established rule\" for if we hold it is implied in the statute as a limit of the jurisdiction it may be said with equal force by others that it must be held an implication of what is just and equitable in the circumstances in any given case. If that was what the legislature intended it was manifestly easy to have said so. But it has not.\nIs the reprobate husband of very small or moderate means entitled to give two thirds, or say a dollar more than the one half of his estate to some undeserving object and leave his wife practically penniless, a widow with children of tender years? Half of such an estate might leave the widow and children in poverty and distress when the circumstances might clearly demand that the entire estate should be given the widow to keep herself and children who depended on her alone. Yet in such a case the judge, according to the pretension put forward could not do that which would be \"just and equitable.\"\nOr is the millionaire who may have had the misfortune of being wedded to a dissolute wife bound to leave her half of his estate, or anything, or alternatively to be debarred from bestowing his fortune, on those deserving to receive his bounties, or giving it to public charities to promote the welfare of his fellow men?\nI merely suggest these extreme cases to illustrate the possible consequences of interpreting the statute, as furnishing an intention of fixing a hard and fast line as to jurisdiction, and thereby possibly suggesting the implication goes much further than a jurisdictional limit which is not given.\nThe implication so found for one purpose can be so easily found for another if the judicial sense would so lean in some case that did not disclose any repulsive features in adopting that innocent looking view.\nAny one who has studied how legislation of the simplest and most reasonable character has become by slow steps the instrument of injustice, must feel how dangerous it is to depart from the plain ordinary meaning of the language used in this enactment. Can there be a doubt that the legislature when confronted with the problem of protecting the wife against the harsh conduct of a husband by his will leaving her unprovided for, had decided first to let her abide by the limits laid down in the Statute of Distribution, if the husband died intestate, or if by his will he had given her what she might have got in such a case, and then default either such event to give her means of relief? A husband who made no will or made one that was in accord with what the law as the exponent of the public conscience on the subject, had long held reasonable or the embodiment of the wife's reasonable expectations, clearly was deemed to have so acted in accord therewith as not to permit his conduct being reviewed.\nA failure in that regard was evidently deemed by the Legislature such prim\u00e2 facie evidence of ill feeling and evil conduct on the part of a deceased husband as to entitle the wife to apply to the court.\nIn such a case the entire burden was cast upon the court without restriction, if plain language means anything, of deciding whether or not she had reason to complain; and next if she had, how far she was entitled to the rectification of any wrong done her, by taking out of the husband's estate for her benefit so much as might be \"just and equitable in the circumstances.\"\nThe burden so cast on the court was one of the heaviest conceivable, I imagine, and must be faced in each case as the plain language indicates.\nThe suggestion that such a complicated subject matter as the distribution of a man's estate \"in the circumstances\" is to depend wholly on the peculiar views of the learned judge who happens to hear the case and his decision is to be final, would lead to curious results.\nI cannot imagine that such was ever the intention of the legislature.\nThe amount in controversy in this case gives us jurisdiction, in my opinion, freed from any difficulties such as have arisen in other cases as to some orders made, merely as a matter of discretion.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with appellant's costs out of the estate and that the appellants may elect and determine whether or not the relief will take the form of an annuity to the widow for her life to be charged on the estate and that form of security to be changed if need be from time to time by leave of the Supreme Court of Alberta, in case in the administration of the estate such a course is desirable; or that the line of relief be the half of the nett residue of the estate after all costs heretofore incurred, or to be incurred, and all other expenses and outgoings in the administration of the estate have been satisfied.\nDUFF J.\u2014This appeal turns upon the construction of certain clauses in an Act entitled \"The Married Women's Relief Act\" which is ch. 18 of the statutes of 1910 of the Province of Alberta. The material clauses are these:\u2014\n2. The widow of a man who dies leaving a will by the terms of which his said widow would in the opinion of the Judge before whom the application is made receive less than if he had died intestate may apply to the Supreme Court for relief.\n* * * * * 8. On any such application the Court may make such allowance to the applicant out of the estate of her husband disposed of by will as may be just and equitable in the circumstances.\n9. Any such allowance may be by way of an amount payable annually or otherwise, or of a lump sum to be paid * * *\nTwo interpretations of this enactment are proposed. According to the first the Act leaves unfettered the discretion of the court as regards the share of the estate to be allotted to the applicant provided the condition of jurisdiction is satisfied by which the authority of the court to intervene only arises when in the opinion of the judge the widow receives under the will less than she would have received if the deceased husband had died intestate. According to the second, assuming jurisdiction to be established, the court is not invested with power to deal with the whole of the estate but only with such aliquot part of it as the applicant would be entitled to in a case of intestacy and to making provision in her relief limited in amount to the value of such part.\nThe second of these views was adopted by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Scott, the first prevailing with Mr. Justice Stuart who presided at the hearing of the application and Mr. Justice McCarthy and Mr. Justice Simmons in the Appellate Division. On the whole I think the weight of argument favours the view of the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Scott.\nThe consideration that was most emphatically pressed in favour of the construction which leaves it in the discretion of the court to apply the whole or any part of the estate in satisfaction of the widow's claim, according as justice and equity may appear to dictate, rests upon the words of section 8 which empowers the court to\nmake such allowance * * * out of the estate * * * disposed of by will as may be just and equitable. These words it is said are unambiguous and have the effect of placing the whole of the deceased husband's estate at the disposition of the court for the purpose of providing for the widow in such a manner as the court may think right\u2014leaving it to the court, as regards the property affected by the testamentary disposition, to remake the testator's will.\nI am not in agreement with the view that this is the only construction of which section 8 is capable. Section 8 must, I think, be read with section 2 which is imported by the phrase \"on any such application\"\u2014defined by section 2 as an application to the Supreme Court \"for relief.\" Relief in respect of what? Relief obviously in respect of a grievance of the applicant arising out of the fact that by the will of her husband she has received less than she would have received under a division of his estate resulting from intestacy. The function of the court, therefore, under this statute is to grant relief in respect of this state of facts in such manner and degree as may be just and equitable and that function of the court is restricted to granting relief to the widow. This authority\u2014by its own implications \u2014 seems to be one which necessarily becomes exhausted the moment the ground of the widow's complaint is removed, that is to say when the share to which the widow would have been entitled under an intestacy is given to her. Consequently I am, as I have already remarked, unable to agree that the words of section 8 are incapable of a meaning supporting the construction of the act which ascribes to the court the more restricted authority.\nIt is nevertheless not to be disputed that the rival construction is also a construction of which these provisions are reasonably capable and the point for determination is which of these two is the preferable? Of course where you have rival constructions of which the language of the statute is capable you must resort to the object or principle of the statute if the object or the principle of it can be collected from its language; and if one find there some governing intention or governing principle expressed or plainly implied then the construction which best gives effect to the governing intention or principle ought to prevail against a construction which, though agreeing better with the literal effect of the words of the enactment runs counter to the principle and spirit of it; for as Lord Selborne pointed out in Caledonian Railway Co. v. North. British Railway Co.[3], that which is within the spirit of the statute where it can be collected from the words of it is the law, and not the very letter of the statute where the letter does not carry out the object of it. See Cox v. Hakes[4]; Eastman Co. v. Comptroller General[5].\nNow the second section appears to me to express sufficiently the object of these provisions. That object is clearly implied, I think, in the condition which is laid down as the very basis of the jurisdiction which enables the court to intervene, the condition requiring that the judge who hears the application must be satisfied, that the share of the widow under the husband's will falls short of the share she would have been entitled to under an intestacy. This condition failing, the machinery for relief provided for by the statute does not come into operation and the implication appears to be that, according to the theory of the legislator, where the share under the will does not fall short in value of the share under the rules governing intestacy, justice is satisfied, so far as it is within the function of the legislator to see that justice is satisfied; this condition being observed, further interposition as between the testator and the natural objects of his bounty would be according to the theory of the legislator unwarranted or undesirable. It follows that the allowance made by Mr. Justice Stuart exceeded the limits set by the statute to the power of disposition conferred upon the court.\nIn deciding what disposition ought to be made pursuant to the statutory direction to make just and equitable provision for the widow, I have discovered no reason for thinking that the respondent should not receive an allowance equivalent to that to which she would be entitled had her husband died intestate; and accordingly I think an order should be made directing that she is entitled to one half of the distributable surplus of the estate.\nThe case should be referred back to the Supreme Court of Alberta to carry this declaration into effect.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Section 2 of \"The Married Women's Relief Act,\" I think makes it reasonably clear that the intent of the legislature in passing this remarkable statute was to enable the court to relieve a widow from the consequences of her deceased husband having by his will attempted to deprive her, in whole or in part, of the rights she would have had in his estate had he died intestate. That being the mischief to be remedied, I am not prepared to place on the language of section 8\u2014broad and general as it undoubtedly is\u2014a construction which would vest in the courts the extraordinary power of disposing of the deceased husband's estate to any greater extent than is necessary to set right whatever wrong or injustice to his widow would otherwise result from his having made a will instead of allowing the law to effect the distribution of his estate. In re Standard Manufacturing Co.[6]; In re Boaler[7]; Watney Co. v. Berners[8]. As the learned Chief Justice of Alberta says:\nThen again it is clear that if the husband die intestate, under no circumstances can the wife have more than the share fixed by law as her share on intestacy. Similarly, if the will give her that much she can have no more. Then can it be intended that, if the will give her any less, no matter how small the difference, this fact gives the Court the right to set aside the total disposition of the testator of any part of his property? I agree with Mr. Justice Walsh that such an anomaly could scarcely have been intended.\nThe discretion conferred on the court in favour of the widow, in my opinion, is restricted to the proportion of her deceased husband's estate which she would have received on an intestacy. The court may, where the circumstances render it just and equitable to do so, give her less: it cannot, in my opinion, give her more.\nWhile I should have preferred to send this case back to the provincial courts to determine what sum, not exceeding one half of the value of the estate, it may be \"just and equitable in the circumstances\" that the applicant should receive, in order to put an end to this deplorable and wasteful litigation I accede to what I understand to be the view of the majority of my learned brothers that we should now determine this question as best we can upon the material in the present record. Three judges of the Alberta Supreme Court, proceeding under the impression that the discretion of the court was unfettered and unlimited, have determined that it would be just and equitable in the circumstances that the widow should receive an amount exceeding one half of the value of the estate. It is therefore quite apparent that if they had understood the power of the court to be restricted as I incline to think it is, these learned judges would have exercised that power to its fullest extent and have allowed to the applicant one half of her husband's net estate\u2014the full amount to which she should have been entitled to on an intestacy. We are without any expression of opinion on this aspect of the case from the two members of the Appellate Division who took the view of the construction of the statute which, in my opinion, should prevail. I think our duty will be best discharged by treating what has been done by the learned trial judge and the two judges of the Appellate Division who agreed with him as a determination that in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion it is just and equitable that the applicant should receive one half of her husband's estate. Had the provincial courts actually so determined, under the view of the statute which I take upon the evidence in the record I would not have been disposed to interfere with the discretion so exercised.\nI would therefore allow the appeal and direct a judgment declaring the widow entitled to receive one half of her husband's net estate. What that will amount to can best be determined after the administration has been completed and all questions as to the extent of the assets and liabilities have been disposed of.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014I think what I may call the policy of the Alberta statute, \"The Married Women's Relief Act,\" chapter 18 of the statutes of 1910, is that the relief which the court may grant to the widow should not put her in a better position than if she had taken a share in her husband's estate under an intestacy. No doubt the language of section 8 is extremely broad, but I think that section 2 is the controlling section and that in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion the court should not grant to the widow an allowance exceeding the share she would have taken if her husband had died intestate. In this case, had there been an intestacy, the respondent would have received one half of the net proceeds of her husband's estate, and in my opinion she should not be granted more.\nI feel some doubt whether or not the respondent has in fact been allowed more than a half share of her husband's estate. The learned trial judge, who granted the respondent $10,198.00 or an annuity of $720.00, stated that the estate was valued in the probate papers at $25,740.00 including a disputed and still undecided claim of $7,000.00, the value of a number of horses which the testator's daughter pretends belong to her under a bill of sale. He thought that the value of the undisputed estate was probably as much as $18,000.00, probably less than that. This creates a state of uncertainty, and there has been a division of opinion among the learned judges whether or not the court could grant to the widow more than she should receive under an intestacy.\nThe learned trial judge, however, stated that the general principle which he always felt disposed to adopt was to so decide the matter as to leave the widow in at least as good a position as she was with respect to her maintenance and comfort when her husband was alive, as far as this can be done without unduly interfering with the rights given by will to other persons who may also have strong moral or legal claims upon the testator with respect to maintenance. I think, with deference, that this is not the principle that should govern the exercise of sound judicial discretion under this somewhat extraordinary statute. The principle stated by the learned trial judge would put the court in the position of the testator and permit it to review the discretion he exercised when he determined what provision should be made for his wife and other persons having moral or legal claims on him. The statute certainly does not go so far, and merely entitles the wife to relief when she receives less under her husband's will than she would have obtained had there been no will. At the most therefore the measure of relief would seem to be the share she would have received in the case of intestacy, but I do not wish to be understood as holding that that share and no lesser amount should be allowed her. But she certainly should not obtain more.\nUnder the circumstances, having stated what I deem to be the policy of the Act, and being unable to concur in the principle laid down by the learned trial judge, I think the case should be remitted to the trial court so that the respondent may be allowed one half of the net proceeds of the estate, appellant's costs to be charged against the estate.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] (1919), 48 D.L.R. 29; [1919] 2 W.W.R. 685, at p. 690.\n[2] (1919) 45 D.L.R. 738; [1919] 2 W.W.R. 685.\n[3] 6 App. Cas. 114.\n[4] 15 App. Cas. 506 at p. 517.\n[5] [1898] A.C. 571, at p. 575.\n[6] [1891] 1 Ch. 627, at p. 646.\n[7] [1915] 1 K.B. 21.\n[8] [1915] A.C. 885, at p. 891.\n"}

L.R. 416; 46 D.L.R. 357; [1919] 2 W.W.R. 297) reversed, Idington and Duff JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Ives J.[2], and dismissing the appellant's, plaintiff action with costs.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported. W. N. Tilley K.C. for the appellant.\nFrank Ford K.C. for the respondent.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting)\u2014This appeal must depend on the construction of section 199 of the \"Railway Act\" which reads as follows:\u2014\n199. If, by any award of the arbitrators or of the sole arbitrator made under this Act, the sum awarded exceeds the sum offered by the company, the costs of The arbitration shall be borne by the company; but if otherwise they shall be borne by the opposite party and be deducted from the compensation.\n2. The amount of the costs, if not agreed upon, may be taxed by the judge.\nHad the intention been to give unlimited costs there was no object or sense in adding to what would have given that, subject to taxation, the words \"and be deducted from the compensation.\"\nWhen using language which would without these words have given the right of action insisted upon some meaning must be given thereto.\nThe most reasonable interpretation seems to imply a limitation of the amount of costs and the most direct method of asserting the method and right of recovery.\nIt is an illustration of the rule that \"where the Legislature has passed a new statute giving a new remedy that remedy alone can be followed.\"\nOf course the judge taxing the costs can only allow such as can be so recovered.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J. (Dissenting)\u2014The compensation awarded the respondents is much less than the amount of the taxed costs. In these circumstances the question arises whether the appellant company has a right of action against the respondents for the amount by which the costs exceed the compensation. The proceedings for determining compensation are prescribed in sections 192 et seq. of the \"Railway Act.\" By section 193, the notice to treat is, among other things, to contain a declaration of readiness to pay a named sum as compensation; and by section 195, if the \"opposite party\" is absent from the county or district in which the lands lie or if he cannot be found, authority is given to a judge to order that the notice to treat may be delivered by publication in a newspaper published in the district or county or, if no newspaper is published therein, then in a newspaper published in some adjacent district or county. Then by section 196, if within ten days after the service of the notice to treat or within one month after the first publication of it, the \"opposite party\" does not give notice to the company that he accepts the sum offered, the judge shall, on the application of the company or of the \"opposite party,\" appoint an arbitrator for determining the compensation. Section 199, upon which the point in dispute turns, is in the following words:\u2014\n199. If, by any award of the arbitrators or of the sole arbitrator made under this Act, the sum awarded exceeds the sum offered by the company, the costs of the arbitration shall be borne by the company; but if otherwise they shall be borne by the opposite party and be deducted from the compensation.\n2. The amount of the costs, if not agreed upon, may be taxed by the judge.\nThe effect of this enactment, according to the construction for which the appellant company contends, is that any person whose lands have been taken by a railway company and who does not within the time mentioned in section 195, as above mentioned, give notice to the railway company accepting the company's offer of compensation, becomes, if that offer prove to have been sufficient, liable to pay the whole of the costs of the proceedings for determining the amount of compensation, even though the costs should exceed the compensation itself; and this although the person whose lands are taken may never have heard of the proceedings.\nThe penalty seems an extreme one. Cases must not infrequently happen in which some investigation is required in order to determine within reasonable limits the extent of the damage the owner is likely to suffer and it truly is a little difficult to understand even in cases where the notice is actually served upon the owner personally why his failure to notify acceptance of compensation should expose him, however reasonable his conduct may have been not only to the penalty of having his compensation applied in payment of costs but should subject him to personal liability as well. I repeat, it seems an extreme penalty.\nAnd in the case where the owner has never heard of the proceedings and through no fault of his own the proceedings are taken behind his back such a penalty could hardly be characterized otherwise than as a palpable injustice.\nThere are two principles of construction which may properly be applied. 1st.\u2014The principle resting on the presumption that Parliament will not impose a palpably unjust burden upon the subject, the best example, perhaps, of the application of this principle being The River Wear Commissioners v. Adamson[3], where the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords agreed that unqualified language must be qualified in order to give effect to this presumption. The second is that the enactment to be construed should be read as a whole. It is quite true that section 199 plainly evinces an intention that, in some degree at all events, the owner may have the compensation awarded him, however reasonable his conduct may have been, applied towards payment of the costs incurred by the railway company in connection with the arbitration. The justice of this may well be doubted; but up to this point the language is clear. Is it quite clear also that the section not only appropriates the compensation in payment of costs but may further subject the owner who has heard nothing of the proceedings and through no fault of his own, to a personal liability?\nComing to the language of section 199\u2014it is clearly enough an admissible view of this section that it does not contemplate cases in which the costs exigible at the instance of the company exceed the amount of the compensation awarded; it is possible that is to say, to read the phrase \"borne by the opposite party\" as explained by what follows; and, having regard to the considerations just mentioned, I think that it is the better construction.\nIt is not a satisfactory mode, of arriving at the meaning of a compound phrase to sever it into its several parts and to construe it by the separate meaning of each of such parts when severed. Mersey Docks & Harbour Board v. Henderson[4].\nI have not overlooked Mr. Tilley's argument that this construction has the effect of deleting the words \"shall be borne by the opposite party.\" As the section stands in its present form this is perhaps so but I incline to think an explanation of these words is afforded by the history of the section, an explanation which would meet the objection. I will not go into that but merely say that redundancy even tautology of expression is so common in Dominion statutes and especially in railway legislation as to deprive this argument of much of the weight it otherwise might have.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I am, with great respect, of the opinion that section 199 of the \"Railway Act\" created a debt on the part of the respondent for the taxable costs incurred by the appellant on the arbitration. I can attach no other meaning to the words \"shall be borne by the opposite party.\" They must have a purport and effect corresponding to that of the preceeding words \"shall be borne by the company.\"\nThe ordinary remedy when Parliament creates an obligation to pay is by action. The Queen v. The Hull & Selby Railway Co.[5]; Booth v. Trail[6]. That remedy is open unless it is taken away or some other exclusive remedy is given. Hutchinson v. Gillespie[7], per Martin B. Do the added words \"and be deducted from the compensation\" provide such an exclusive remedy? If they do the statute is to be construed either as if the words\nthey shall be borne by the opposite party\nwere deleted from it, or as if it read\u2014\nthey shall be borne by the opposite party (to the extent of) and be deducted from the compensation.\nIs there justification either for such deletion or for the interpolation of the bracketted words? I think not, having regard to \"the provisions and object of the enactment.\" Vallance v. Falle[8].\nThe general rule certainly is that\nwhere an Act of Parliament creates a right and points out a remedy, no other remedy exists.\nBut is the provision for deduction from the compensation intended as a remedy? I doubt it. Its purpose may well have been to require the company to resort to the compensation money as the fund for payment of its costs until exhausted and to restrict its right to maintain suit and to levy execution to any balance of the costs not thus satisfied. As a remedy for the realization of the debt expressly created by the preceeding clause it would sometimes, as in the present case, prove grossly inadequate. It does not cover the whole right. The fact affords a prim\u00e2 facie indication that it was not intended to be exclusive or substitutional. Shepherd v. Hills[9]; Vestry of St. Pancras v. Batterbury[10]; Atkinson v. Newcastle Waterworks[11]. The giving of a special remedy does not always take away the remedy by action. Batt v. Price[12], per Lush J. I agree with the learned trial judge and McCarthy J. that in this case the right of action is not taken away either expressly or by implication as to so much of the taxed costs as cannot be satisfied out of the compensation.\nI am also of the opinion that the learned judge who approved the taxation acted as persona designata and that we cannot review the allowances made on the grounds pressed by Mr. Ford without in fact entertaining an appeal from the taxation. So far as the right of the appellant to certain items allowed depended upon findings of fact, it was within the jurisdiction of the learned judge to make such findings and they cannot be reviwed for the purpose of establishing that in making the allowances he exceeded his jurisdiction.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge with costs here and in the Appellate Division. BRODEUR J.\u2014We have to construe in this case section 199 of the \"Railway Act,\" which reads as follows:\n199. If, by any award of the arbitrators or of the sole arbitrator made under this Act, the sum awarded exceeds the sum offered by the company, the costs of the arbitration shall be borne by the company, but if otherwise they shall be borne by the opposite party and be deducted from the compensation.\nSeveral years ago, the appellant railway company desired to expropriate a piece of land belonging to the respondent company. An offer of $733.05 was made by the railway company; but the offer was not accepted by the Saskatchewan Land Company which, on the other hand made a claim of $339,000.00. The award was for $733.05 only and what appears to be the exorbitant claim of the Saskatchewan Land Company was dismissed. Now the Railway Company sues for its costs, which have been taxed by Mr. Justice Simmons at $5,116.20.\nThe trial judge maintained the action(1); but the Appellate Division(2), Mr. Justice McCarthy dissenting, reversed this judgment and dismissed the action on the grounds that the company could not recover more costs than the amount which had been awarded.\nIn view of the large amount which was claimed by the respondent company on the arbitration proceedings, it is no wonder that the costs incurred by the railway company were much larger than the amount awarded. But it is no concern of ours since, as required by sections 2 of section 199, those costs have been duly taxed. The provisions of section 199 seem to me to be clear as enunciating that the railway, company having offered a certain sum of money, if the offer is not accepted, the company will be bound to pay the costs if the amount which is later on granted exceeds the sum offered; but if otherwise, if the amount which is granted is not in excess of the amount offered, then the costs shall be borne by the opposite party, with the additional right however for the railway company to deduct the costs from the award. In such a case, the railway company might, of course, not avail itself of the privilege of deducting those costs and take an independent action to recover the whole amount. But if the railway company wants to deduct those costs from the award, the statute entitles it to make such deduction; but such a deduction will not affect its right to recover by a direct action the balance which might be due.\nThere is no doubt, I think, in view of the decision in Metropolitan Railway Company v. Sharpe[13] that the provision that the costs shall be borne by one or the other of the parties creates a debt recoverable by action.\nIt has been contended by the respondent in this case that the decision of the judge who is persona designata taxing the costs is subject to review in a case where he would have exceeded his jurisdiction. I could have understood such a contention; but it cannot be said that in the present case the judge has exceeded his jurisdiction in taxing the costs but he has simply exercised a discretion which he had under the statute.\nFor these reasons, I am of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs of this court and of the court below and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014Two questions arise on this appeal:\n1. Can the costs of an arbitration under the \"Railway Act\" to fix compensation for the taking of land exceed the amount of the arbitrators' award where the costs are borne by the owner?\n2. Can the taxation of such costs by a judge be revised?\nThe first question involves the construction of section 199 of the \"Railway Act,\" which is as follows:\n199. If by any award of the arbitrators or of the sole arbitrator made under this Act, the sum awarded exceeds the sum offered by the company, the costs of the arbitration shall be borne by the company; but if otherwise they shall be borne by the opposite party and be deducted from the compensation.\n2. The amount of the costs, if not agreed upon, may be taxed by the judge.\nThe whole question is as to the meaning of the words:\nbut if otherwise they (the costs) shall be borne by the opposite party and be deducted from the compensation.\nI think it is impossible to deny that when the statute says that the costs shall be \"borne\" by a party a right of action exists against that party to recover the same, and obviously the whole of the costs can be recovered in such an, action.\nThe construction which the respondent places on section 199 is equivalent to striking out the words \"shall be borne by the opposite party.\"\nFor if the costs can only be deducted from the compensation, all that would be necessary would be to say \"but if otherwise they (the costs) shall be deducted from the compensation.\"\nI cannot think that the intention of Parliament was to render the company liable for all costs when its offer was below the amount awarded, and to limit the liability for costs of the opposite party to an amount not exceeding the compensation, when the offer of the company equalled or was higher than the award. Were that the case, the costs would not be borne by the opposite party, or only indirectly so, but would be borne or paid out of the amount awarded. Giving therefore to each word in this section its proper and natural meaning, my opinion is that the liability for costs of the opposite party is not restricted to the amount of the compensation.\nIt follows that the judgment of the Appellate Division cannot be sustained on this part of the case, and that the judgment of the learned trial judge should be restored.\nThe second question should, in my opinion, be answered in the negative. The judge under section 199 acts as persona designata when he taxes costs, and no appeal lies from his decision; Canadian Pacific Ely. Co. v. Little Seminary of Ste. Therese[14].\nThis rule was not disputed by the learned counsel for the respondent, but he contended that, although there was no appeal, when the judge in taxing the costs acted according to a wrong principle of law, his order could and should be set aside by the court.\nOn due consideration of the reasons adduced by the respondent as constituting a wrong principle of law for the taxation of the costs of the arbitration, I think that while they might be proper grounds of appeal, they would not come under the rule which the respondent asks us to apply, and as to which it is unnecessary to express an opinion.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 14 Alta.

S. 1906, ch. 41, sec. 8. The action is for arrears of taxes upon lands owned by the appellant and situate within the municipality-respondent. When the property was assessed, the name \"Townsite Trustees\" was given in the column with the heading \"name\" opposite the first parcel, and a blank was left in that column opposite the other parcels, without any sign indicating the ownership of these parcels until another name appeared in the column. A general assessment was also made for \"179.60 acres unsubdivided,\" which was the aggregate area of several separate and distinct parcels. The appellant appealed from the assessment \"on grounds of excessive valuation,\" to the Court of Revision which made some reduction, Section 134 of \"The Municipal Ordinance\" gives to that court jurisdiction to correct the roll in respect of any failure to observe the \"provisions and requirements of\" the statute; and section 136 provides that the roll, \"as finally passed by the court and certified * * * shall * * * be valid and binding on all parties concerned notwithstanding any defect or error committed in or with regard to such roll.\"\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that, in the circumstances of the case, the assessments were sufficient to render the appellant liable for the payment of the taxes.\nPer Davies C.J., Duff and Anglin JJ.:\u2014Inasmuch as there was jurisdiction to make the assessments in question, the essential constituents of an assessment, though defective and erroneous, were present in each case and the appellant had notice of them as assessments in respect of which it was intended to demand taxes from it, and since the matters now urged were all proper subjects of \"complaints in regard to persons wrongfully placed on the roll or omitted therefrom or * * * in regard to property * * * which has been misdescribed\" to the Court of Revision, where they might have been easily rectified (sec. 134),. section 136 of \"The Municipal Ordinance\" precludes the appellant urging them in this action as objections to the validity of its assessments; and the appellant, being \"one of the parties concerned,\" is bound by the assessment rolls \"notwithstanding (these) defect (s) or error (s) committed in, or with regard to such rolls.\"\nPer Davies C.J. and Mignault J.:\u2014Upon the evidence, the appellant, by its conduct and actions, estopped itself from urging the points raised by it before this court.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (14 Alta. L.R. 307, 45 D.L.R. 482, [1919] 1 W.W.R. 515), affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the judgment of the trial[2], in favour of the respondent. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nF. H. Chrysler K.C. and S. B. Woods K.C. for the appellant.\nFrank Ford K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014In concurring, as I fully do, in the reasons stated by my brother Duff for dismissing this appeal, I desire to emphasize how greatly the conduct and actions of the appellants have operated on my mind not only as shewing that no possible injustice has been done them in the judgment appealed from but that they have by their conduct and actions estopped themselves from raising in this court the points on which Mr. Chrysler relied.\nThat learned counsel based his argument for the allowance of the appeal upon the contention, as I understood him, that the lands of the appellants had never been legally assessed for the years for which the taxes were sued, first because the proper name of the appellants had not been entered upon the assessment roll, as required by the statute, opposite each lot of land assessed, and secondly because the unsubdivided lands assessed had not been described so as to be identified or capable of being identified. His contention, therefore, was that their assessment was utterly void and that the correspondence, negotiations, appeals to the Court of Revision and District Court judge and general conduct and actions of the appellant could not be invoked to sustain such assessments.\nI cannot accept or accede to this argument and desire to add a few lines to my brother Duff's reasons to shew that in my judgment at least the conduct and actions of the appellants have been such, and the judicial action to which they appealed such, as to preclude them from raising these points in this court at this stage of the controversy.\nThese appeals to the Court of Revision and District Court judge stand on an entirely different footing from the negotiations for time for payment of the taxes and for release from the statutory penalties their non-payment involved and any admissions which might be drawn from the correspondence.\nThe appeals, limited as they were specifically to the one point of \"excessive valuation of the lands,\" necessarily involved a decision by the judge appealed to, having full jurisdiction over the subject matter, of the location and description of the lands he was called upon to value. How else, indeed, could he have reached a decision as to whether and to what extent they had been overvalued?\nThe appeal to the District Court judge succeeded to the extent that the assessment was reduced from $500 per acre to $300 per acre, or from $89,800 to $53,880. The slightest reflection must, therefore, satisfy one that in making such a substantial reduction in the assessment the learned District Court judge must, either from the evidence brought before him or from the admissions of the parties, have been informed of and have adjudicated upon, the location and description of the unsubdivided lands assessed and now in question.\nThis adjudication not having been further appealed from seems to me conclusive against the appellants not only as to the value of the lands as found by the District Court judge, but as to all the essential questions necessary for him to have determined before making that valuation and reduction in the assessment, one of them being the fact that the lands had been properly and legally assessed as against the now appellants, defendants.\nNo question was raised at the trial or here of the ownership at all material times by the appellant company of the lands in question and the strictly limited appeal of the appellants to the District Court judge on the one question of overvaluation and their acquiescence in the judgment of that court precludes appellants from now raising any questions as to the validity of the assessments which were necessarily involved in the adjudication of the District Court judge, as I submit the questions raised by Mr. Chrysler were.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The respondent got judgment at the trial before Mr. Justice Scott for taxes alleged to be due by appellant by virtue of assessments made for the years 1916 and 1917 and that has been maintained by the Appellate Division for Alberta from which this appeal is made. The chief items in question are founded upon an alleged assessment in each of said years for \"179.60 acres unsubdivided.\"\nThese are spoken of by the learned trial judge as follows:\u2014\nThe form of assessment roll given by \"The Municipal Ordinance\" requires that it shall describe the lands in full and the extent thereof shewing the section, township and range or lot or block or other local description. It is shewn that the 179.60 acres intended to be assessed is not one parcel alone but is the aggregate area of several separate and distinct parcels, I may here point out that it would require about thirty folios to give such a description of the several parcels as would enable a surveyor to locate the boundaries thereof.\nThe question raised in respect of them is that this is not such an efficient description as required by \"The Municipal Ordinance\" providing for the assessment of lands in sec. 122, as follows:\u2014\n122. The assessor or assessors shall prepare an assessment roll after revision by the assessment committee as in form F in the schedule to this Ordinance setting down in each column as accurately as may be after diligent inquiry the information called for by the heading thereof, No. 8 of 1897, sec. 159.\nThe only heading in the assessment roll to which this item of the assessment can be attributed is \"Lot\" or \"Lot, Block, Plan.\"\nHow, I submit with respect, such a description embracing several parcels of undivided lands, as the learned trial judge states it is, can be held to be anything approaching the requirements of the section just quoted, passes my understanding.\nAnd when we pursue the inquiry of what uses the assessment roll and assessments so made are intended to lay the foundation for, we find, as is usual in such cases, a provision by sec. 147 for distress being made, not only upon the goods of the party assessed, but also the goods, if found on the premises, the property of or in the possession of any other occupant of the premises. How could there be by any possibility a legal distress made upon the goods of such occupant when each lot or parcel might be occupied by a different person? Then how could the provisions of sec. 182 and following sections for proceedings to sell the lands for the taxes be complied with?\nEach section relevant to the definition or description of the land provides for a specification of each lot and the arrears of taxes due in respect thereof to be set out.\nUnder this group assessment, of many parcels, that would be simply impossible.\nAre we to hold the assessment roll good for one purpose or mode of recovery and absolutely null for another?\nCan the curative sec. 136, to which we are referred, be, by any mode of interpretation and construction, extended so far? I think not.\nWe are referred to a number of cases wherein the curative sections in or supplementary to the \"Assessment Act,\" have been held to furnish an effective validating remedy, but not one of them has gone so far as we are asked to go herein.\nWe are also referred to the recent case of Ragman v. The Merchants Bank[3], upheld on appeal here. It is sufficient to say that was under \"The Town Act\" which is differently worded and left it open to say that what was described therein was ascertainable by the facts the description presented, and in other aspects of the case it is easily distinguishable from this.\nI fail to ee what The Municipality of the Town of MacLeod v. Campbell[4], has in it to support any such contention as set up herein. The gross overvaluation against which the party-assessed appealed to the Court of Revision and failed, and then failed to pursue her appropriate statutory remedy of appeal to the district judge against such an assessment was all that was involved therein.\nIf it could be applied at all, it would be against respondent according to my reasoning. It certainly was open for the municipal authorities and the appropriate remedy on the appeal to the district judge in 1917 by present appellants either to have asked on that appeal being heard to rectify the roll or to have directed an appeal by the assessor or any one else qualified to do so, to rectify the same and cure a blunder. Indeed, I incline to think, it was not only the right but also the duty of those representing the respondent on the appeal so taken, to have asked the judge to rectify in respect of the blunder now complained of and set down opposite to each parcel the assessment settled by the learned judge.\nI cannot find any legal duty resting upon the appellant to have done so against its own interest.\nI must conclude that the assessments in question of the \"179.60 acres unsubdivided\" were null.\nCity of Toronto v. Russell[5], in the Privy Council, decided the neat point of whether or not the respondent could waive the notice which the statute in question required to be personally given him. He having been one of the governing body directing the proceedings and knowing his lands were involved, was held not entitled thereafter to complain.\nAll else in that case is mere dicta.\nComing to the collector's roll, I cannot see how the secretary-treasurer was at all justified in adopting a novel plan of framing such a roll without the slightest authority in law.\nAs the learned Chief Justice points out in the Appellate Division[6], the amendment of \"The Town Act\" permitting such a novel experiment did not apply to respondent city.\nThe duty imposed by the statute here in question in sec. 144 was very plain.\nIt reads as follows:\u2014\n144. The secretary-treasurer shall on or before the first day of September in each year prepare a tax roll containing columns for all information required by this Ordinance to be entered therein in which he shall set down in full the name of every person assessed, his post office address and the assessed value of his real and personal property and taxable income as ascertained from the assessment roll as finally revised; he shall calculate and set down opposite each such entry in columns headed \"General Fund,\" \"Debenture Fund,\" \"School Fund,\" \"Statute Labour Fund,\" as the case may be, the sum for which such person or property is chargeable on account of each rate and under the column headed, \"Arrears of Taxes\" the sum which may appear on the books of the municipality as arrears on such parcel of land at that date; and in the column headed \"Total\" the total amount of taxes for which each parcel of land is liable.\nSuch a collector's roll as he made omitting all names of those liable and the description of each parcel of land and its liability, ought not to be held a compliance with the Act. Yet it is on a certified copy of this nullity that the action rests in virtue of sec. 152 of the Act.\nTown of Trenton v. Dyer[7], cited by appellant, is worth looking at in this aspect of the case.\nThat, to my mind, disposes of the other items in the claim made herein.\nHad there been a proper collector's roll I should, under the authorities and curative section coupled with the response of the appellant's agent to the notice of its assessment indicating a recognition of the name, have been inclined to examine more closely than I have done the question of whether the mere mistake of name was not overcome so far as other items were concerned. In the view I have expressed, it does not seem to me necessary to do so.\nThe taxes are imposed by a by-law striking the rate and thereby a valid debt is created, if and so far as, founded upon a valid assessment roll. It is not the collector's roll that constitutes the debt. Sec 152 declares the taxes to be a debt and proceeds to declare that as a piece of evidence which entitles to recover, a certified copy of the collector's roll will suffice. I submit proof of a valid assessment and valid by-law fixing and imposing the rate, would be equally efficient. Hence if that proof had been properly adduced the respondent should, perhaps, have succeeded as to the minor items if as fairly arguable on the decided cases the name could be held sufficient. I would reserve that right if worth pursuing.\nNor need I enter at length upon the question of the doubtful possibility hinted at the argument of holding independently of the roll that a debt was created by means of the imposition of rates by by-law and conduct of the parties, for that was not attempted below or seriously here, though I imagine had the case been so directed at the trial as to establish such a proposition, possibly something more arguable might have been produced than the support of this assessment roll as to the main items.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout without prejudice to a recovery hereafter in respect of minor items.\nDUFF J.\u2014This appeal arises out of an action brought by the respondent municipality against the appellant company for the recovery of taxes alleged to be payable for the years 1916 and 1917 in respect of certain real property owned by the company.\nThe defence is that owing to non-compliance by the municipality with the procedure laid down in the statutes of Alberta in relation to the assessment of property and the levying of taxes, the taxes demanded never became lawfully collectable.\n1. It is alleged that there was no lawful assessment of the company's property and 2nd, there was no collector's roll within the meaning of the law, and 3rd, the by-law levying the taxes was invalid because the rate was in excess of that which the corporation was entitled by law to exact.\nAs to the last mentioned point, the by-law was not produced and I concur with the learned Chief Justice of the court below in the view that in the absence of the by-law it cannot be assumed that no part of the rate levied was for defraying the cost of local improvements.\nThe assessor in assessing the property of the company did not enter the name of the company in the column provided for the name of the owner but used the name \"Townsite Trustees,\" which has been accepted as sufficiently descriptive. In the case of the great majority of parcels, moreover, the assessor did not\u2014and this is one of the points relied upon as vitiating the assessment\u2014actually write the name \"Townsite Trustees\" in the owner column opposite the number of the parcel, his practice being where there was a sequence of parcels assessed to the company to write down the name \"Townsite Trustees\" in the \"owner\" column for the first member of the sequence leaving blank the space provided in that column for each of the other parcels. The law, it is said, specifically requires that the name of the owner shall be actually written in the \"owner\" column in a space assigned for that purpose for each parcel.\nA special objection relates to the assessment of parcel 1562, sheet No. 63; and summarily stated, the objection is that the entries in the roll in relation of that parcel do not include what is alleged to be an essential element of a valid assessment, a description of the property conforming to the provisions hereafter quoted.\nThe law governing the decisions of the questions raised is to be found in \"The Municipal Ordinance of the N.W.T.\" (ch. 70 of the Consolidated Ordinances of 1898). By the provisions upon which the appellant relies, the assessor is required to prepare an assessment roll as in form \"F,\"\nsetting down in each column as accurately as may be after diligent inquiry the information called for by the heading thereof,\nthe heading of the second Column in form \"F\" being in these words;\u2014\nThe name in full if the same can be ascertained, of all taxable persons who have taxable property or income within the municipality, and the name of the owner when the occupant is not the owner;\nand that of the 5th column being this:\u2014\nThe description in full or extent and amount of property against each taxable person or any interest which is liable to assessment, township and range, or lot and block, or other local description.\nThe word \"taxable person\" in the heading of the second column is defined by sub-sec. 12 of the interpretation section as:\u2014\n(a) any person receiving an annual income or the owner of any personal property not exempted from taxation;\n(b) the owner of lands not exempted from taxation where the same are occupied by the owner or unoccupied, otherwise the occupant.\nThe appellant company contends that as regards those parcels in relation to which the entries do not include some actually written name or description in the second column professing to designate the owner, there is therein a departure from the directions of form \"F\" that invalidates the assessment of those parcels. As regards parcel No. 1562 there is, it is said, no description of property in compliance with the requirements of form \"F,\" and that this again is a fatal defect nullifying the assessment of that parcel.\nBefore entering upon the discussion of the points raised by these contentions it will be necessary to refer briefly to other provisions of the statute.\nBy sec. 126 every person assessable is required to give all information to the assessor and it is provided that he may deliver to the assessor a statement in writing setting forth the particulars of the property for which he should be assessed. Sec. 123 provides for the appointment of an assessment committee whose duty it is, on completion of the assessment roll, to check over the roll and to make such corrections as they may decide upon, and then a right of appeal is given to a Court of Revision. The right of appeal may be exercised not only by the person assessed but also by any ratepayer as well as by the municipality. The jurisdiction of this court is defined by sec. 134, which is in the following words:\u2014\nThe court shall try all complaints in regard to persons wrongfully placed upon the roll or omitted therefrom or assessed too high or too low in regard to any property of any person which has been misdescribed or omitted from the roll or in regard to any assessment which has not been performed in accordance with the provisions and requirements of this Ordinance as the case may be.\nAnd by sec. 136:\u2014\nThe roll as finally passed by the court and certified by the secretary-treasurer as passed shall, except insofar as the same may be further amended on appeal to a judge, be valid and binding on all parties concerned notwithstanding any defect or error committed in or with regard to such roll or any defect or error or mis-statement in the notice required by sub-sections 4 and 5 of the foregoing section of this Ordinance or the omission to deliver or transmit such notice.\nThe enactments of the statute prescribing the method of preparing the assessment roll and the duties of the assessor in relation to the preparation of it must be read, of course, and applied in the light of secs. 134-5-6. The first of these sections we have seen gives to the Court of Revision jurisdiction to correct the roll in respect of overvaluation or undervaluation, the omission of property from the roll or misdescription of property entered in the roll; and further in respect of any failure to observe in the assessment the \"provisions and requirements\" of the statute; by sec. 135 this jurisdiction may be invoked by the person assessed or by the municipality, and then there is sec. 136 which, as appears above, enacts that after the roll has passed the Court of Revision and been certified as prescribed, it shall be\nvalid and binding on all persons concerned notwithstanding any defect or error committed in or with regard to such roll.\nNow, I do not at all dissent from the argument forcibly presented by Mr. Chrysler, that it is a \"roll\" which by virtue of sec. 136 is to be \"valid and binding upon all parties\" and that it is an \"assessment\" which is the subject of appeal by virtue of sec. 134; and that in order to bring these two sections into play, you must have something which, within the intendment of them, is an \"assessment\" and a \"roll.\"\nBut it is one thing to say as regards a given state of facts: Here is no assessment\u2014here is no roll. It is another thing to say: Here are a roll de facto and an assessment de facto, but a roll and an assessment which because some essential requirement of the law has been neglected in preparing and effecting them are, from the point of view of the law, invalid.\nSecs. 134 and 136 both contemplate such departure from the provisions of the Act as would but for these sections make the assessment invalid. On this point, the meaning of the language is unmistakable and the combined effect of these sections is that if the property is assessable and if the person is a taxable person, then an assessment which contains the elements of a de facto \"assessment\" within the meaning of sec. 134, may be appealed against and corrected by the Court of Revision and that notwithstanding the departures from the requirements of the statute \"in or with regard to the roll\" such an assessment once the roll has passed the Court of Revision and been certified in the manner provided for, shall be valid.\nThe lurking fallacy in the argument presented in support of the appeal resides in the confusion between an assessment inoperative in law because of the failure to observe some legal requirement and something which cannot be described as an \"assessment\" in fact, within the contemplation of sec. 134.\nThe questions before us in this appeal must be distinguished from the questions which arose in Toronto Railway Co. v. City of Toronto[8], and in other cases in the Ontario courts which preceded that decision. In the Toronto Rly. Co.'s Case(1), the assessor had professed to assess property which by law was exempt from assessment. In Nickle v. Douglas[9], the property that the municipality was endeavoring to tax was held to fall within the scope of an exemption clause. In the City of London v. Watt & Son[10], a similar question arose and the Supreme Court of Canada held that the assessor having professed to assess property which was not subject to taxation in the municipality where it was assessed, the validity of the assessment was not a question cognizable by the Court of Revision, and the assessment roll in consequence not binding upon the defendant. It is, of course, not disputed in the case before us that the lands assessed were subject to taxation and it was accordingly the duty of the assessor to assess them and if through neglect of the assessor the owners were to escape taxation in respect of these lands, it would, of course., be manifestly unjust to the taxpaying community as a whole. Where property is taxable, justice and convenience seem to require that mere errors or deficiencies in procedure shall, so long at all events, as no substantial injustice arises, not have the effect of conferring an exemption contrary to law. This is the principle of secs. 134, 135 and 136, and the scope of 136 is indicated by the last sentence which makes the roll valid and binding notwithstanding the failure to give notice under sub-sees. 4 and 5 of sec. 135.\nThe argument pressed upon us by the appellant is that sec. 136 has no application where some requirement of the statutory procedure has been omitted or departed from and the requirement and omission or departure are of such a character that in the absence of secs. 134, 135 and 136 the assessment must have been held to be of no legal validity. The argument proves too much. The result of its rigorous application would be to deprive of all effect the declaration in sec. 136 which makes the roll \"valid\" notwithstanding defects in it. Sec. 136 obviously contemplates proceedings which otherwise would be invalid; indeed all the enactments of the statute prescribing what is to be done in respect of the assessment roll, including those provisions which are alleged to have been disregarded in the assessments now in question, must be read subject to and qualified by the provisions of secs. 134, 135 and 136.\nComing now to the question whether in the years 1916 and 1917 this property was in fact assessed so that in those years there was something which could properly be described as an assessment within the language of secs. 134, 135 and 136, and 1st, as to those cases in which the name or description of the owner is not actually written in the \"owner\" column opposite the number of the parcel, I have no doubt that for the present purpose one is not obliged to treat each parcel as a water-tight compartment; one must look at this assessment roll and consider it as a whole. When that is done, one finds abundant evidence that the assessor has done what people frequently do, that is to say, instead of repeating the same name or the same description through a long list of items he has simply written the description at the head of the list and left spaces blank where a more meticulous or more fussy person would have rewritten the entry. No person looking at the document and forming a practical judgment upon it could doubt the intention or the meaning of these entries and blank spaces.\nThen as to the description of the property included in item 1562. It is difficult to suppose that anybody reading this could have any doubt that a parcel of acres of unsubdivided land was intended to be assessed and when the roll is looked at as a whole and it is seen that all the other property assessed in the names of the same owners is subdivided land it seems to be reasonably clear from the roll itself that this parcel included all the assessable unsubdivided property of these owners in the municipality and I think this is not seriously disputed. But the description \"all the unsubdivided land\" owned by a given person within a named area is a good description, even for the purposes of formal conveyancing. The citation of authorities in such a point should be superfluous but Miller v. Travers[11], may be referred to; see also Halsbury, Laws of England, \"Deeds,\" vol. 10, at page 465. We have therefore as regards all these impeached assessments abundant evidence of an attempt on the part of the assessor to make an assessment, an attempt carried out in conformity with his practice and an attempt which has at least resulted in this, that he has, for the purposes of the assessment, identified the owners and that he has also identified the property.\nAnd continuing the history of the assessment roll we have an examination by an assessment committee and the acceptance of these entries as sufficient. We have, moreover, the notice sent to the company, we have in one year, 1917, an appeal to the Court of Revision by the appellants on the ground of overvaluation in the case of item 1562 and a reduction of the valuation by the Court of Revision. This appeal to the Court of Revision I shall refer to again in another aspect; in the meantime I mention it as one of the facts bearing upon the question whether or not there is here something which can fairly be described as an \"assessment\" de facto within the meaning of these sections. But in this connection the acts of the appellants themselves are not without significance. Russell v. City of Toronto[12].\nIn the year 1915 communications took place between the company and the assessor and the company furnished the assessor with some information. The letter written by the appellant to the assessor was excluded by the learned trial judge, upon what principle I do not quite understand, but there is plenty of ground for the inference that what the company furnished was the aggregate number of acres comprised in all the \"unsubdivided\" land in respect of which it was taxable. The assessor purporting to assess this property made the entry quoted above (the entry relating to parcel 1562) and this entry was copied first in the roll for 1916 and then in the roll for 1917.\nThe demand for taxes addressed to the appellants in 1916 is in evidence and through that the appellants were informed that this land was described in the roll in the manner mentioned. The notice of assessment for 1916 is in precisely the same form and so also as regards the notices and demands for 1917. The appellants, moreover, in prosecuting their appeal from the assessment of 1917 described this property as \"our unsubdivided property.\" I have already called attention to the fact that in 1917 not only was the appeal prosecuted but a reduction of the assessment, that is to say, a reduction of the valuation was obtained. It might very plausibly be argued on the principle of Roe v. Mutual Loan Fund Limited[13], and Smith v. Baker[14] that as this appeal proceeded on the basis of there being at least a real assessment within the meaning of sec. 134 and that on this basis they got a judgment of the Court of Revision reducing the assessment the appellants are now precluded from setting up the contention now relied upon.\nBut I prefer to treat this proceeding as very important in the light it throws upon the question of fact, whether there was or was not a de facto assessment of the property and in this view the proceeding is just as significant in its bearing upon the question raised with regard to the assessment of 1916 as with reference to that of 1917.\nI conclude that the impeached assessments were real assessments, assessments within the purview of secs. 134, 135 and 136. The last question is whether the tax roll was fatally defective. I concur with the Chief Justice of Alberta in the view that there is nothing in the Act prohibiting the course taken by the assessor, who also is the collector and the treasurer, in making use of the assessment roll so far as it went for the purpose of compiling his tax roll. I think \"The Towns Act\" and the practice under \"The Towns Act\" affords sufficient evidence that there is nothing in this procedure inconsistent with legislative policy.\nOf course it does not necessarily follow that the defects in the assessment cured by secs. 134, 135 and 136 might not be fatal in the case of a tax roll to which these last mentioned sections do not apply. But when the roll is looked at as a whole, I think there is a substantial and sufficient compliance. The statute does not require literal conformity with the directions of form \"F\" in the case of a tax roll.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The material facts of this case and most of the statutory provisions bearing upon them appear in the judgments delivered in the courts below[15] and in the opinions of my learned brothers.\nThe exigibility as debts of the taxes sought, to be recovered from the defendants is attacked on several grounds which can best be dealt with separately.\n(1) It is urged that the name of the defendants does not appear in the assessment rolls and collector's rolls at all\u2014that some of the parcels on which taxes are demanded from them are entered on the rolls in the name of \"Townsite Trustees\" and that as to others no name whatever appears in the column of the roll headed \"Owner or Occupant.\"\nUpon the evidence I am satisfied that \"Townsite Trustees\" was, under the circumstances of this case, a sufficient designation of the defendant company. It is clear that it had notice of all the assessments and it saw fit to allow them to stand in that name, which it might readily have had changed on appeal to the Court of Revision (sec. 134). On this point I desire to add nothing further to what has been said by the learned Chief Justice of Alberta.\nIn most instances the parcels in question, in respect of which no name appears in the \"Owners,\" column of the assessment roll, immediately follow in sequence other parcels assessed to the \" Townsite Trustees.\" A more painstaking and exact assessor would, no doubt, have entered the name of the owner opposite each of the succeeding parcels in the several groups or would at least have placed the word \"ditto,\" or its abbreviation \"do,\" or dots commonly used as signifying that word, in the owners' column, or would have bracketed the numbers of the separate assessments or the descriptions of the parcels comprised in each group.\nBut I have no doubt that the blanks left in the rolls before us would be readily understood by any person reading them as implying the assessment of the lots opposite which they occur to the persons whose names respectively appear in the owners' column opposite the first member of each group or sequence of assessments.\nAs put by Mr. Justice Scott:\u2014\nAn inspection of the rolls shews that the practice followed by the assessor was that where a number of lots of the defendant in the same locality were entered the name \"Townsite Trustees\" would be entered in the owner column opposite the first one only. The plain inference is that the name was intended to apply to all subsequent lots until the name of another person appeared in that column in the same manner as if the word \"ditto\" had been entered opposite each lot.\nThe extracts from the rolls in evidence shew, however, that the application of this method of dealing with a consecutive series of assessments of properties belonging to the same owner was not confined to properties owned by the appellant. It extended to other ratepayers as well. In fact it appears to have been general. This objection is thus disposed of except as to the assessment numbers 1535, 1536 and 1537 on the roll of 1916, and No. 1212 on the roll of 1917, which upon the facts cannot be so dealt with. I shall reserve them for special consideration towards the close of this opinion.\n(2) The sufficiency of the description of the property included in assessments numbered 1562 of 1916 and No. 1251 of 1917\u2014\"179.60 acres unsubdivided\"\u2014is challenged. I strongly incline to the view that this description is in se inadequate. Re Jenkins and Township of Enniskillen[16]; Blakey v. Smith[17], Wildman v. Tait[18]; Carter v. Hunter[19]; Whitemouth v. Robinson[20]; Clive School District v. Northern Crown Bank[21]; Rural Municipality of Minto v. Morrice[22]. It is certainly not the \"accurate and sufficient\" description which the \"Assessment Acts\" require; Toronto v. Russell[23]. When it is borne in mind that these two assessments covered several parcels of land scattered over the town area, its insufficiency becomes more obvious. It is argued that taking the assessment roll as a whole the description was equivalent to\nall the taxable unsubdivided property held by the Townsite Trustees,\nand that such a description would be good. But this argument, if sound, would justify an assessment (embracing numerous scattered parcels owned by one person not named elsewhere in the roll) in which the owner's name is followed merely by the words\nall (his) assessable real property in the municipality.\nI cannot accept the view that this would be a sufficient description to render such an assessment valid.\nIt may be that such a description would suffice to enable the owner to identify his property. But others than the owner are interested. Every taxpayer is entitled to find in the assessment roll information by which he can identify any other owner's property in order to satisfy himself that it is fairly assessed. He has a right of appeal if he thinks it is not. As Mr. Justice Beck says in Clive School District v. Northern Crown Bank[24], at page 552, the provision of the \"Assessment Act\" requiring that the roll shall contain a description of the property assessed is one of those\nintended for the security of the citizen, or to ensure equality of taxation, or for certainty as to the nature and amount of each person's taxes.\nHere again, however, the appellant had notice that all its unsubdivided land in the municipality was assessed under the description \"179.60 acres unsubdivided\" and it did not see fit to avail itself of its right of appeal to have it rectified and made more accurate and precise.\nAs remedial of all \"defects and errors\" in the assessment rolls the respondent invokes sec. 136 of the \"Assessment Act,\" which reads as follows:\u2014\n136. The roll as finally passed by the court and certified by the secretary-treasurer as passed shall, except in so far as the same may be further amended on appeal to a judge, be valid and bind all parties concerned notwithstanding any error committed in Or with regard to such roll or any defect or error or misstatement in the notice required by subsections 4 and 5 of the foregoing section of this Ordinance or the omission to deliver or transmit such notice.\nAfter some hesitation I have reached the conclusion that, inasmuch as there was jurisdiction to make the assessments in question, the essential constituents of an assessment, though defective and erroneous, were present in each case and the appellant had notice of them as assessments in respect of which it was intended to demand taxes from it, and since the matters now urged were all proper subjects of\ncomplaints in regard to persons wrongfully placed on the roll or omitted therefrom or * * * in regard to property * * * which has been misdescribed\nto the Court of Revision, where they might have been easily rectified (sec. 134); sec. 136 precludes the appellant urging them elsewhere as objections to the validity of its assessments. As \"one of the parties concerned\" it is bound by the assessment rolls,\nnotwithstanding (these) defect (s) or error (s) committed in, or with regard to such rolls.\nI agree with Mr. Chrysler's contention that sec. 136 cannot be invoked to validate and give efficacy as an assessment to that which can in no sense be said to be an assessment. But we are here dealing with what purport to be assessments and they contain the essential constituents of assessments\u2014designation of owners and descriptions of properties\u2014imperfect no doubt, and perhaps so much so as to invalidate the assessments. But sec. 136 was not needed to remedy mere irregularities. It must have been to rectify and overcome the consequences of defects otherwise fatal that it was enacted, and we have before us in this case, in my opinion, just such defective assessments as it was designed to cure and render unexceptionable.\nThe appellant's conduct in seeking a remission of penalties for default added to the 1916 taxes and its appeal to the Court of Revision against the valuation of it's unsubdivided property in 1917, if they fall short of what would be necessary to raise an estoppel against it, at least cast grave suspicion on the good faith of its present attempt to escape payment of these taxes.\n(3) I agree with the disposition made by Harvey C.J. of the objection taken to the collector's roll or tax roll.\n(4) I also agree with the learned Chief Justice that the constitution of the assessment committee is not open to the objection taken.\n(5) If the appellant meant seriously to contest the legality of the rate for 1917, under sec. 8 of the \"Wetaskiwin Charter\" (statutes of 1906, ch. 41), because in excess of 20 mills, it should have shewn that no part of the rate was levied\nfor the purposes of meeting the cost of any public work, or works under the provisions of an \"Act to incorporate the City of Wetaskiwin.\"\nIn the absence of such evidence it cannot be presumed that the rate of 21\u00bc mills did not include such costs.\n(6) As already stated, assessments Nos. 1535, 1536 and 1537 of 1916, and No. 1212 of 1917, call for special attention. No name appears in the owner's column in these assessments. Assessments Nos. 1535, 1536 and 1537 immediately follow 1533 and 1534, which are assessments of properties in the name of Alex. Hinchburger, in the roll of 1916; in that of 1917, No. 1212 follows No. 1211, which is an assessment in the name of the City of Wetaskiwin itself. Taking the same view of these assessments as indicated above in regard to others where blanks occur in the owners' column, the lots covered by them, although belonging to the appellant, were wrongfully assessed to Alex. Hinchburger and the City of Wetaskiwin respectively. It is said, however, that these errors were manifestly proper subjects of\ncomplaints in regard to persons wrongfully placed on the roll or omitted therefrom, for the correction of which the Court of Revision had appellate jurisdiction, and since the appellant had notice of the intention to assess it for the properties covered by these assessments and failed to avail itself of its right of appeal, the rolls are valid and binding upon it as one of the parties concerned (sec. 136). But as to what are they valid and binding? The assessments stand as to numbers 1535, 1536 and 1537 of 1916 as assessments to Alex. Hinchburger, and as to No. 1212 of 1917 to the City of Wetaskiwin; and the appellant and \"all (other) parties concerned\" are bound, as to all matters dependent on those assessments, to treat them as rightfully so made. There is not\u2014there never was\u2014an assessment in Nos. 1535, 1536 and 1537 of 1916 and in No. 1212 of 1917 of the appellant, and making the rolls valid and binding upon it cannot convert the Hinchburger and Wetaskiwin assessments into assessments of C. & E. Townsites Limited. The effect of sec. 136 in this view of the matter is merely to preclude the appellant and the respondent alike from averring that the properties covered by these assessments were not rightly made to Alex. Hinchburger and the City of Wetaskiwin respectively.'\nOn the other hand, if the blank in the \"owners'\" column in each of the three assessments for 1916 should not be treated as filled in with the name \"Alex. Hinchburger\" and that in assessment No. 1212 for 1917 with the name \"City of Wetaskiwin,\" they must all be dealt with as omissions of the name of a known owner in contravention of sec. 122. From each an essential constituent of an assessment is entirely lacking\u2014with the result that there was not merely a defective or erroneous assessment which might be cured by sec. 136, but no assessment at all and therefore no subject matter for the remedial operation of that section. Now taxes are recoverable as debts only by virtue of statutory authority. Lynch v. The Canada North West Land Co.[25], at pages 208 et seq., per Ritchie C.J. and Pipestone v. Hunter[26]. Sec. 152 of the Municipal Ordinance (ch. 70 Con. Ord. N.W.T., 1898) reads as follows:\u2014\n152. Taxes may be recovered with interest and costs as a debt due to the municipality in which case the production of a copy of so much of the tax roll as relates to the taxes payable by such person purporting to be certified as a true copy by the secretary-treasurer of the municipality shall be prim\u00e2 facie evidence of the debt.\nThe certified extracts from the tax rolls on their production afford prim\u00e2 facie evidence either that Alex. Hinchburger is the person liable to pay the taxes levied under assessments Nos. 1535, 1536 and 1537 of 1916, and of the like liability of the City of Wetaskiwin as to the assessment of No. 1212 of 1917, or that no person was assessed for any of the properties covered by these four alleged assessments. The debts, if any, evidenced by the rolls in respect of these assessments, are those of Hinchburger and the city respectively and not of the appellant. Sec. 152 does not make the taxes in respect of these assessments recoverable as debts from a person or body not in any way named in respect of them in the tax rolls. The appellant is in this position. As to these assessments therefore, were it not for what I am about to say, I would have inclined to the view that the appeal should succeed and that the judgment should accordingly be modified by reducing the amount recoverable for 1916 taxes by $18.04, and that for 1917 by $6.99, with corresponding reductions in interest.\nBut there is no plea specially directed to these items, and the points in regard to them, which I have been considering, though made in this court, do not seem to have been discussed at the trial or in the Appellate Divisional Court. At least, I find nothing in the record to indicate that they were. Moreover, they would seem almost to fall within the ancient maxim de minimis non curat lex. I am therefore not disposed to dissent in respect of these comparatively trifling items from the judgment of the majority of my learned brothers, especially since, even had I done so, my inclination would have been, subject to a modification of the judgment as indicated, to dismiss the appeal, and with costs because, in view of the comparative triviality of the variation effected, it would have substantially failed.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The question here is as to the validity of the assessment made by the respondent against different parcels of land belonging to the appellant for the years 1916 and 1917, the amount of which is claimed in this action by the respondent from the appellant. Many objections to the validity of the assessment were made by the latter in its plea, but I propose to discuss only two objections, which appeared to be the only ones really insisted on, being content as to the others to rely upon the reasons given by the learned judges in the courts below for deeming them unfounded.\nThese two objections are serious if they are true in fact and if, in the circumstances of this case, it is open to the appellant to urge them as a reason for escaping liability for the taxes claimed from it in this action. I will consider these objections only in connection with the assessment of the unsubdivided property belonging to the appellant.\nThe first objection is that there is no name of owner on the assessment roll in connection with these proper- ties (as well as in connection with many other parcels bearing subdivision numbers), and the second, as I understand it, is that no properties are indicated as being assessed. If these objections are well founded there would be no assessment, and the question would not be of an informality or irregularity covered by the curative provisions of the Municipal Ordinance, but of the total absence of any assessment whatever.\nThat the proceedings of the assessor in preparing the assessment rolls were very informal cannot be denied. The appellant was a large property owner, and its name appears frequently in the assessment rolls. But when several properties of the appellant were assessed, its name as \"Townsite Trustees\" was given in the column with the heading \"name\". opposite the first parcel, and a blank was left in that column opposite the other parcels, without a \"ditto\" or any sign indicating that the appellant was the owner of the following parcels, until another name appeared in this column. With regard to the unsubdivided property, which is under number 1562 of the roll for 1916, there is a blank in the \"name\" column opposite that number, and opposite the preceding numbers up to No. 1558, where the name \"Townsite Trustees\" is inserted. Similarly in the roll for 1917, also in connection with the unsubdivided property, under No. 1251, there is a blank in the \"name\" column at that number and opposite Nos. 1250, 1249, and 1248, while at No. 1247 we find the name Townsite Trustees.\nThe 1916 and 1917 rolls are even more informal in so far as any description of the unsubdivided property to be assessed is concerned. Both rolls, as required by the statute, have a column for \"description of the property,\" and in the case of subdivided property belonging to the appellant the subdivision number is given, but in both rolls, as regards the unsubdivided property, there is a blank in the column for description of the property. In each roll, however, in the \"address\" column, there is the entry \"179.60 acres unsubdivided,\" and further on, on the same line in the 1917 roll, covering the four columns entitled respectively \"description of personalty or business floor space,\" \"No. of acres assessed,\" \"No. of acres under cultivation,\" \"remarks and court of revision notes,\" is the entry; \"reduced on appeal to $53,880 being $300 per acre\" and below the signature \"W. A. D. Lees, J.D.C.\", being the signature of Judge W. A. D. Lees of the District Court. I may add, always with regard to this unsubdivided property, that the assessed value is $89,800 in the 1916 roll and $53,880 in the 1917 roll, being the correction made after the reduction above referred to.\nThe secretary-treasurer of the respondent, Mr. Roberts, who also acted as assessor on appointment by the latter, was the only witness examined. He filed some correspondence to which I shall refer, and stated that the description \"179.60 acres unsubdivided\" was taken from the 1915 assessment roll, adding, however, that the city had come to an agreement with the Townsite (meaning, I presume, the appellant), as to the acreage, this agreement being on the occasion of an appeal taken in 1917 against the valuation of the subdivided property.\nIt appears by the statement of Mr. Knox, counsel for the respondent before the trial court, that the unsubdivided land described as \"179.60 acres unsubdivided\" is made up of several parcels, one portion in one part of the city and another portion in another part of the city, and so on. Certificates of title of the unsubdivided land belonging to the appellant were filed, but the total acreage is not given, but I presume could be calculated, although it would be no doubt a complicated process. But Mr. Roberts testified that the acreage had been adjusted between the appellant and the city, and no contradiction of this statement was made by the former.\nThe correspondence filed is important. On February 8th, 1917, Mr. Roberts wrote to Messrs. Osier, Hammond & Nanton, agents of the appellant, calling their attention to the fact that two years' taxes were then due and threatening action if the same were not paid. To this letter, Messrs. Osier, Hammond & Nanton replied on March 3rd, 1917, enclosing a cheque for $600 on account of the 1915 taxes, and asking for time to make financial arrangements in order that they might pay the taxes of 1915 in full and at least pay something on account of the 1916 taxes. On April 2nd, 1917, they wrote to Mr. Roberts that they had a limited amount of funds on hand for paying taxes and would like very much to know if the city council would deduct all penalties charged against their property provided all arrears were paid in three instalments, say on the 30th April, May and June. The request for deduction of penalties was not granted and the secretary-treasurer again wrote demanding payment. It appears that the balance of the 1915 taxes, however, was paid and this action is only for the 1916 and 1917 taxes.\nIt is to be observed, and this was brought out by the learned counsel for the appellant in his cross-examination of Mr. Roberts, that the description of the unsubdivided land as \"179.60 acres unsubdivided\" was taken from the 1915 roll, taxes under which were paid by the appellant without it appearing that it objected to this description. The same description was repeated in the 1916 roll and the appellant's agents applied for time to pay the 1916 taxes without complaining of the description. When the 1917 roll with the same description was made and an assessment notice was sent to the appellant, the latter appealed to the Court of Revision, composed, I understand, of the city council, which rejected its appeal, and then the appellant, on the 14th July, 1917 (the notice of appeal is dated the 14th June, but this is an obvious error), appealed from the Court of Revision to the district judge against\nthe assessment of their unsubdivided property within the City of Wetaskiwin in so far as the same refers to the land therein without buildings or improvements, and in particular against the lands mentioned in assessment notice as number 1251.\nThe grounds of said appeal are that said assessment is excessive, and on other grounds sufficient in law to support this appeal.\nIt is on this appeal that Mr. Roberts testifies that the acreage of the unsubdivided property was fixed by an agreement between the parties, and this must be so because the district judge reduced the valuation of the unsubdivided property to $300 per acre, which, for the 179.60 acres, would give the total valuation of $53,880 certified by the signature of the district judge on the 1917 assessment roll.\nIt is under these circumstances that when sued for the 1916 and 1917 taxes, the appellant complains of the insufficient description of the unsubdivided property and of the fact that no name is inserted in the two rolls as owner of the same.\nI am of opinion that the appellant cannot now be heard to urge these two objections. Although no name was inserted in the roll opposite the assessment of the unsubdivided property, the appellant received the assessment notice containing the entry of the unsubdivided land, and it never complained that this assessment was not against it, but on the contrary asked for delay to pay the 1916 taxes, and appealed from the 1917 assessment on the ground of excessive valuation and actually succeeded in having the valuation reduced. The appellant clearly understood that it was the party assessed and had no doubt as to the identity of the unsubdivided land referred to, and this being so, how can it now pretend that no name of owner was given in the roll and that the description of the unsubdivided land was insufficient? If insufficient, to transpose the words of Lord Atkinson in the case of Toronto Corporation v. Russell[27], at page 499, its alleged insufficiency was not shewn to have misled anybody, least of all the appellant.\nIn the case just referred to the description was:\n8 57\/100 acres 1240 x 300 east side Carlaw Avenue, north of Queen street.\nI am free to admit that this might have been better as a local description than \"179.60 acres unsubdivided,\" referring as it did to parcels situated in different parts of the city, and if no question of acquiescence in this description arose I would have great difficulty in coming to the conclusion that it satisfied the statute, but the appellant, in its notice of appeal against the 1917 assessment, adopted this description as referring to its unsubdivided property within the City of Wetaskiwin, and actually claimed and obtained a reduction in its valuation. On that ground my opinion is that the appellant cannot now attack the assessment roll of 1917 for misdescription or rather want of description of its unsubdivided property, and the objection, however serious it appears at first sight, cannot now be entertained.\nAs to the assessment of 1916, there is the fact that the description was taken from the 1915 roll, and the appellant paid the 1915 taxes. Moreover, by their letter of March 3, 1917, the appellant's agents asked for delay in order that they might pay the 1915 taxes in full and at least something on account of 1916 taxes. There was here no complaint against the assessment of the unsubdivided property, and more, there was an unquestioned assumption of liability for the assessment as made. So in my opinion the objection also fails as to the 1916 roll.\nI base my decision on this ground of complete acquiescence and assumption of liability, and do not require to consider whether the curative provisions of the municipal ordinance dispose of the appellant's objections. I may perhaps add that municipal authorities place themselves in a rather perilous position when they proceed in the loose manner which characterized the preparation of these rolls. The assessment is here sustained but it owes its success to the conduct of the appellant rather than to its own merits.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 14 Alta.

In order to help the company to discount its note of $15,000, one Lubin, the president of the company, obtained from the respondent his own note for $10,000 made payable to the company and to be used as collateral security. According to evidence adduced by the appellants, although objected to by the respondent, Lubin afterwards approached the appellants, informed them that the company held respondent's note for $10,000 and agreed with them that, if they would indorse the company's note for $15,000 to enable him to discount it with the bank, he would pledge the respondent's note as collateral and they would thus be liable only for $5,000; and, on this understanding, the appellants indorsed the company's note. The company went into liquidation before its note of $15,000 became due. The appellants paid the bank $5,000, but refused to pay more. The bank then sued the respondent for $10,000 which he paid; but he called the appellants in warranty asking to be reimbursed in full of his payment to the bank.\nHeld, Brodeur and Mignault JJ. dissenting, that the respondent, by giving his note to Lubin without any limitation placed on its use, had given him authority to use it as collateral in any manner he might deem advisable to enable the company to discount its own note, and that such authority was lawfully exercised by Lubin to impose on the respondent the obligation of indemnifying the appellants against their indorsement to the extent of $10,000.\nHeld also, Brodeur and Mignault JJ. dissenting, that, as the appellants as to $5,000 were sole sureties and as to $10,000 were sureties to the bank but not co.-sureties with the respondent, such arrangement takes this case out of article 1955 C.C. as the parties did not \"become sureties for the same debtor and the same debt.\" Held also, Brodeur and Mignault JJ. dissenting, that parol evidence as to the understanding between Lubin and the appellants, although the civil contract of suretyship was the subject matter of the testimony, was admissible under art. 1233 (1) C.C., as it concerns liability on promissory notes discounted with a bank in the carrying out of what was undoubtedly a commercial transaction.\nJudgment of the Court of Review (Q.R. 55 S.C. 516), reversed, Brodeur and Mignault JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Superior Court sitting in review at Montreal[1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge[2], and maintaining the respondent's action in warranty.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nFalconer K.C. and Ogden K.C. for the appellant.\nPerron K.C. and Vall\u00e9e K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIdington J.\u2014This action was brought by respondent to recover from appellants contribution as alleged co-securities with him for a debt due by Star Films Limited, a corporation carrying on a moving picture show in Montreal.\nAppellants and respondent were respectively shareholders in said company. The respondent by reason of his holding of shares for a much larger amount than either of the others, as well as by reason of liabilities he had undertaken on behalf of the company prior to that now in question, was far more deeply interested in the company's success than either of the appellants, or indeed both together. The pith of his story as to the transaction in question is told in the following passage from his evidence:\u2014\nM. Lubin voulait d'abord escompter un billet de vingt mille piastres ($20,000). Je me suis rendu au bureau de la compagnie, en compagnie de M. Ecr\u00e9ment et d'une autre personne. Il voulait me faire endosser le billet. J'ai refus\u00e9. J'ai dit: \"Je n'endosserai jamais le billet. Ce que je suis pr\u00eat \u00e0 faire, pour aider la compagnie, je suis pr\u00eat \u00e0 donner un billet en suret\u00e9 collat\u00e9rale \u00e0 la banque, engageriez-vous votre billet pour dix mille piastres ($10,000) \u00e0 la banque?\"\nJ'ai dit: \"Pour aider l'affaire, je ferai cela.\"\nNous avions \u00e0 la banque les cent cinquante mille piastres de d\u00e9bentures et je me pensais parfaitement garanti.\nAt another part of his story he speaks as follows:\u2014\nQ.\u2014You have already stated in your examination on discovery that you did not see either Mr. Ball, or Mr. Rawlings in connection with this transaction? A.\u2014I never saw them.\nQ.\u2014You also stated in your examination on discovery that you had received one hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($150,000) worth of the capital stock of the Star Films, Limited, in consideration of lending the company your name to the extent of ten thousand dollars ($10,000)? A.\u2014I received ten thousand dollars ($10,000) of bonds first of all, and fifteen hundred shares of the company's stock.\nQ.\u2014That is one hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($150,000) worth of the capital stock of the company? A.\u2014Yes.\nBy the Court. Q.\u2014You obtained ten thousand dollars ($10,000) worth of bonds? A.\u2014Yes.\nBy the Court. Q.\u2014How \u00ednany shares? A.\u2014Fifteen hundred shares, amounting to par value one hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($150,000) which I took as collateral to guarantee me in signing the note.\nBy defendant's counsel. Q.\u2014Did you not get that stock in consideration of indorsing this note? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014But you were not to give those shares back to Mr. Lubin if the company paid its notes? A.\u2014No.\nQ.\u2014You were to keep the shares? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Did you receive those shares previous to the discount of the company's note of the 4th of March, nineteen hundred and sixteen (1916)? A.\u2014Yes, I had some shares of the Allied Features and some shares of the Star Films Company Limited, and Mr. Lubin bonded them all in one certificate of fifteen hundred shares.\nQ.\u2014You had already eighteen hundred and thirty-three (1,833) shares. A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Of which fifteen hundred (1,500) shares came to you on this transaction? A.\u2014I had some before.\nQ.\u2014You had eighteen hundred and thirty-three (1,833) before? A.\u2014Yes. Q.\u2014Fifteen hundred (1,500) came to you from this transaction under your letter Exhibit D-4 on discovery. A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014According to that letter you were to get fifteen hundred shares (1,500) on account of this transaction? A.\u2014Yes, but I still maintain that those fifteen hundred (1,500) shares comprised previous shares, but my book-keeper can tell you that.\nQ.\u2014Anyway, some of the fifteen hundred (1,500) shares came to you in connection with this transaction? A.\u2014Yes, most of them.\nQ.\u2014Were those shares delivered to you before the 4th of March, nineteen hundred and sixteen (1916)? A.\u2014I could not say. I do not remember that.\nQ.\u2014In any event you obtained them? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Did not you get those shares delivered to you almost immediately after you signed the note? A.\u2014I do not remember, but I know I got bonds and these shares came after, as far as I can remember. In fact I attached very little importance to those shares as I knew the company was on the rocks, if we did not help them along.\nQ.\u2014That money you gave them to help them along. A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014And you got consideration for doing so? A.\u2014Yes, as they were insolvent.\nLubin was president and general manager of the company. He having thus got the $10,000 note which reads as follows\nMontreal, Feb. 17th, 1916.\n$10,000.\nFour months after date I promise to pay to order of Star Films Limited, Ten Thousand Dollars at 26 Wellington Street, Montreal. Value received.\nPaul Galibert.\nfrom respondent, moved by said several considerations to give same, approached each of the appellants and by shewing them said ten thousand dollar note of respondent, a man well able to pay it, and assuring them that it was given for good consideration and would stand between them and loss to the extent of $10,000, induced them to agree to indorse, merely as sureties, a fifteen thousand dollar note of the company.\nBoth notes were used at the bank to obtain the desired loan.\nThe parties hereto never met each other, nor did any of them go to the banker, who discounted said note, until at a later date when the company failed and the bank looked, of necessity, to these parties hereto for payment. As none of them seemed prepared to produce the cash, the bank dropped the company and took by way of renewals from the appellants their note for $15,000 and from respondent a renewal of his note concurrent therewith. And so the business was continued till appellants has paid the $5,000, which they had agreed to go surety for, and refused to pay more as the respondent's turn had come to meet the balance. Of course that could have been no answer in law to the bank.\nThe bank, however, no doubt recognizing from its knowledge of the transaction, and as I should say any business man would from looking at the face of the transaction, and noting the original dates and being told how all these parties came to be co-sureties for $15,000, the justice of the appellant's contention, demanded payment from the respondent who refused until sued by the bank. Then he paid up and claimed to recover from the appellant.\nThe learned trial judge allowed such recovery to the extent of one-third of eight thousand dollars from each of the appellants.\nIn that regard he was upheld by the Court of Review. From that this appeal was taken and, I think, should.be allowed.\nI cannot understand upon what principle the judgment is founded.\nThe learned judge, who writes the only notes of reasons appearing in the case, quotes largely from English authorities and indeed cites no other except article 1955 of the Civil Code of Quebec.\nI have no doubt that the law is identical, whether English law or French law as presented in said article is proceeded upon and that both are derivable from the same source.\nThe first puzzle is: Why, if the doctrine of common suretyship for the same debt (which was one of $15,000) is to prevail in enforcing contributions, the judgment did not proceed upon the recognition of these men becoming surety for the same debt, and why that debt was not assumed to be as it is contended the facts demonstrate a debt of $15,000; and each allotted an equal share of the burden to be borne which would have resulted in each being called upon to contribute $5,000?\nInstead of that the result of the judgment appealed from is that whilst appellants each pay $5,166, the respondent only pays the sum of $4,666.33 of which he had got out of the said original joint transaction, $2,000, by being relieved to that extent of $20,000 for which he had become liable, long before appellants had anything to do with the liabilities of the company, save indirectly as shareholders.\nThat $2,000 item, and all involved therein, presents us with our next puzzle. As between the parties hereto it was respondents' debt, existent when they became indirectly in appearance concurrent sureties for the $15,000. The theory of concurrent suretyship for the payment of the said $2,000 part thereof is indefensible, if good faith is to be observed, and it should be eliminated. Then the debt for which each must be held to have become, though separately liable, yet joint sureties, would be $13,000.\nIn any event, on that theory of the total being the same debt, the third of $13,000 would be what each should have borne, and the respondent have paid $3,333.33 and become entitled to call upon each of the appellants for the like sum. But they had each by paying their share of the $5,000 already discharged their respective shares of the whole debt to the extent of $2,500 as against respondent's nothing.\nThe courts below appropriate that $2,000 in the reduction of $10,000 which they seem to assume was \"the same debt\" for which in the language of the Code all the parties had become liable.\nBut why so assume? For surely \"the debt of the same debtor\" was $15,000, if anything is clear in this case. Of course the reply is: Oh, no, for respondent only agreed to go surety for $10,000.\nQuite so; and appellants only agreed to go surety for $15,000 if and when, or so far as, the respondent should fail to meet the $10,000 he had agreed for good consideration prior to their assuming any responsibility to pay.\nAs the old saying has it: That is a poor rule that won't work both ways.\nIf the court can examine the facts behind the appearances and take upon itself to appropriate that $2,000 to do justice in one way of looking at the situation, I most respectfully submit, it must go further and examine all the facts and thus find that the real situation involved not only the appropriation of that $2,000, but the application of the entire actual facts, and they demonstrate beyond peradventure that the parties never in fact intended to become or were sureties for the same debts of the same debtor but that the respondent was surety previously for $10,000 of the debt incurred and the appellants for $5,000 of it and no more unless and until he had failed to meet his prior obligation.\nMoreover, when we bear in mind that Lubin had induced the appellants, by shewing them the note which respondent had given, and assuring them it was for good consideration, and their protection against the payment of more than $5,000, I fail to understand why the man who put the power in Lubin's hands of so misleading them, can thus be permitted to escape from the natural consequences of his placing it in Lubin's power to so mislead these others.\nIt seems to me respondent was thereby estopped from claiming relief against those his conduct had so misled.\nThis is in effect a suit to recover, at the call of him who had so misled, from those he induced to incur a responsibility which, as regards him, they were assured he had assumed and would bear for himself.\nIt seems to me, with due respect to others, a very plain violation of the principles of justice which are what constitute the relevant law governing parties so concerned.\nArticle 1955 of the Quebec Civil Code relied upon is as follows:\u2014\n1955. When several persons become sureties for the same debtor and the same debt, the surety who discharges the debt has his remedy against the other sureties, each for an equal share.\nBut he can only exercise this remedy when his payment has been made in one of the cases specified in article 1953.\nThe obvious intention of each set of sureties was that respondent should be surety for the ten thousand and appellants for the balance of five thousand which they have discharged leaving respondent to bear that burden he faced and was paid for facing.\nIn other words, I repeat that on the true interpretation of the facts, these parties never were to become sureties for the same debt, and hence the claim does not fall within the provisions in said article.\nI fail to see how the case of The Oriental Financial Corporation v. Overend Gurney & Co.[3], which decided only the question of a surety being discharged by an agreement to give time, can help herein.\nPossibly it was argued before the court below that because the surety was paid for his suretyship that he had not the ordinary rights of a surety to contribution.\nTo prevent misapprehension I may say that in my opinion the fact of being paid to act as surety does not of itself necessarily so affect the rights of the surety. But when we have to determine whether or not the sureties were such jointly for the same debt or only each to bear a relative part of the total debt, then it becomes a very weighty matter in order to ascertain clearly whether or not the sureties stood upon the same footing or not, to learn all that passed.\nIn this case the incidents of payment and other advantages which the prior surety had, and especially the significant fact that there was given respondent a corresponding amount of bonds equivalent to the sum guaranteed, ought, I submit, to go a long way in supporting the conclusion of facts I have reached. That is that as between the sureties respondent became alone surety for the last $10,000, and appellants alone cosureties for the balance of the total of $15,000.\nAs I read Lord Blackburn's judgment in Duncan Fox & Co. v. North and South Wales Bank[4], at page 19, cited by the learned judge below, I think it supports what I have been urging against the non-observance of the principle there enunciated that\neach shall bear no more than its due proportion.\nWhat was the due proportion? Certainly not what has been allotted to each herein.\nMoreover, the partner there, as the shareholder here, deposited security to answer the debt. And the consequences of such act, in Lord Blackburn's view, appears on page 20 of the report (1), where he says:\u2014 And if the bank had applied the whole of the proceeds of the security, as far as they went, to the payment of those bills, it seems quite clear that Samuel Collins Radford could not have come to the indorsers to repay him part of the debt which he had thus paid. The answer would have been that he was, as between him and the indorsers, bound to pay the whole.\nIt seems to me that the bank having chosen to call upon respondent on his general security up to the sum of $10,000 and make him pay, he has no more recourse than said Samuel Collins Radford in Lord Blackburn's opinion might have had.\nIt has been clear ever since Dering v. Earl of Win-chelsea[5], that the sureties whether known to each other or not are in equity bound to contribute and it has been equally clear ever since Craythorne v. Swin-burne[6], that a surety may contract himself out of such a liability by limiting his share.\nThe doctrine in each case rests not upon contract but upon the equities of the case.\nHere it is quite clear upon the facts that it would be most inequitable to permit the respondent to call upon the appellants for that which they distinctly contracted against.\nThe cases upon the liabilities of co-sureties are collected in the notes to the Dering Case5, in White & Tudor's Leading Cases in Equity, vol. 1, part 1, and on this branch now in question at page 123 et seq. of the American edition in 1888.\nThe principle in its application to suretyship arising from accommodation indorsement presumes that the first of such indorsers has no recourse over against the later indorsers. And why? Simply that the acts of the persons so indorsing shew the relation they stand without any oral evidence. The English law permits oral evidence in other cases to shew what the parties intended. Here the written evidence properly read shews that.\nOf course it goes without saying that the relation as established at the origin of the transaction is what must govern and cannot be affected by what happens later unless there is an express contract changing the relationship for which latter case there is no foundation herein.\nI think, notwithstanding second argument, the appeal should be allowed with costs and the respondent's action in warranty dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nAnglin J.\u2014While they appear to have acceded to the admissibility of the parol testimony given at the hearing of this action and to have credited it, the learned trial judge and the learned judges of the Court of Review seem to me, with great respect, to have failed to give effect to it. The respondent objected at the trial to the reception of the oral evidence given by the appellants as to the understanding in regard to the respondent's liability upon which their indorsement of the company's note for $15,000 was procured, and he now strenuously contests its admissibility. That evidence had relation to the respective obligations inter se of the appellants and the respondent. It was, in my opinion, testimony upon \"facts concerning a commercial matter\" admissible under article 1233 (1) C.C. It is neither contradictory of, nor inconsistent with, the obligations which the signatures of the parties to the promissory notes in question evidence, but is merely explanatory of the relations which existed between them, on which their respective rights and obligations depend. It established the authority given by Galibert, the maker of a promissory note for $10,000 in favour of Star Films Limited, to one Lubin, the president of the company, in regard to the use to be made of that note; and it shewed what took place between Lubin\u2014both in his capacity of president of Star Films and as the quasi-mandatory of Galibert\u2014 and the appellants, Rawlings and Ball (indorsers of a note of the company for $15,000, for which the $10,000 note was pledged as collateral on its discount with the Provincial Bank) in regard to the manner in which the Galibert note would be dealt with and as to the rights and liabilities inter se of Galibert and of Rawlings and Ball.\nSo far as it goes to establish the nature and the scope of Lubin's authority from Galibert and what he did in execution of it Forget v. Baxter[7] would seem to afford conclusive authority for its admissibility. See, too, Desrosiers v. Brown[8], Although the civil contract of suretyship is, no doubt, the subject matter of the testimony in question, yet since it concerns liability on promissory notes discounted with a bank in the carrying out of what was undoubtedly a commercial transaction of a company engaged in commerce (Une entreprise de spectacles publics; 6 Mignault, Droit Civil, p. 64) I cannot entertain any doubt of its admissibility. Ibid, note (e): Ville de Maisonneuve v. Chartier[9]; Hamilton v. Perry[10]; H\u00e9bert v. Poirier[11]; Banque d'Hochelaga v. Macduff[12]; Scott v. Turnbull[13].\nWhat does the testimony establish? In the first place it shews that having refused to indorse Star Films' note for the $20,000, Galibert, for certain valuable consideration, gave to Lubin his own note for $10,000, made payable to that company, to be used\nto help them (the company) finance the note of $20,000 (afterwards reduced by agreement with Galibert to $15,000), to help discount Star Films' note.\nThese are Galibert's admissions on discovery. There was no limitation placed on the use that Lubin might make of the Galibert note for the purpose indicated, except that Galibert's liability was to be collateral to that of the company.\nArmed with this authority, Lubin approached the appellants (who had likewise refused to endorse the company's note for $20,000), informed them that the company held Galibert's note for $10,000 for valuable consideration, assured them that it was good for this amount, and agreed with them that, if they would indorse Star Films' note for $15,000 to enable him to discount it with the bank, he would pledge the Galibert note as collateral and they would thus be liable only for $5,000 as Galibert's note would protect them as to the other $10,000. On this footing the appellants agreed to indorse the company's note which was duly discounted by the Provincial Bank, Galibert's note being pledged as collateral. While the appellants no doubt assumed liability for the entire $15,000 to the bank, the basis of their obligation as between themselves and Galibert was that, on Star Films' default, he should pay $10,000 and they $5,000. It was within the scope not merely of the ostensible, but of the actual, authority given by Galibert to Lubin that the latter might so use the $10,000 note as to commit Galibert to such an engagement and what took place between Lubin and the appellants should, I think, be regarded as having effected a contract between Galibert and them that he would indemnify them against their indorsement of the company's $15,000 note to the extent of $10,000. That I take to be within the intendment of the 7th paragraph of the plea of the defendants in warranty. If not, the facts having been fully gone into at the trial, I would allow whatever amendment may be necessary to raise that defence formally as equity would seem to require. \"Supreme Court Act,\" secs. 54, 55. This arrangement of the sureties' liability inter se in my opinion takes the present case entirely out of article 1955 C.C. They did not \"become sureties for the same debtor and the same debt.\" As to $5,000 the appellants were sole sureties. As to the other $10,000 they were sureties to the bank, but not co-sureties with Galibert. They were rather sureties to the bank for him, i.e., their obligation was to pay the bank on his default, while his obligation was to pay the bank in the first instance on the default of Star Films and to indemnify Rawlings and Ball should they be compelled to do so. This also accords with the English law applicable to a case such as this. See Craythorne v. Swinburne[14]; Re Denton's Estate[15]; Macdonald v. Whitfield[16].\nThe courts below, with respect, would seem to have overlooked the unlimited scope of the authority given by Galibert to Lubin to use the $10,000 note as collateral in any manner he might find necessary or deem advisable to enable the company to obtain the discount of its $15,000 note and the fact that the authority was lawfully exercised by Lubin to impose on Galibert the obligation of indemnifying Rawlings and Ball against their indorsement to the extent of $10,000.\nWhat took place subsequent to the commencement of the liquidation of Star Films was not intended to alter or affect the existing rights and liabilities of the appellants and respondent inter se. Rawlings and Ball did not by signing the renewal note then required by the bank assume the position of principal debtors or otherwise increase their liability.\nThese were my views after the first argument of this appeal. Nothing advanced on the re-hearing, in my opinion, warrants modification of them.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here and in the Court of Review and would dismiss the action in warranty with costs to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendants.\nBrodeur J.

Le g\u00e9rant de la compagnie, Lubin, s'est adress\u00e9 \u00e0 Galibert et, apr\u00e8s certaines n\u00e9gociations, il a obtenu la signature de ce dernier sur un billet de $10,000.00, qui ne devait pas \u00eatre escompt\u00e9 mais d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 la Banque Provinciale en garantie collat\u00e9rale d'une somme de $15,000.00 que la compagnie devait emprunter de cette banque.\nLubin s'est alors adress\u00e9 aux appelants Rawlings et Ball et, ayant obtenu leur endossement, sur un billet de la compagnie, de $15,000.00, va le faire escompter \u00e0 la Banque Provinciale et il d\u00e9pose en garantie collat\u00e9rale du pr\u00eat que la banque faisait le billet de Galibert.\nIl para\u00eet bien \u00e9vident que, dans toutes les n\u00e9gociations de Lubin avec Galibert et de Lubin avec Ball et Rawlings, il s'agissait pour la compagnie de trouver une somme de $15,000.00 dont elle avait absolument besoin pour continuer ses op\u00e9rations. Comme Galibert, Ball et Rawlings \u00e9taient des actionnaires, il \u00e9tait assez naturel que son g\u00e9rant essay\u00e2t de les induire \u00e0 l'aider. L'emprunt qu'il s'agissait de faire ne constituait qu'une seule et m\u00eame dette dont Rawlings et Ball \u00e9taient les cautions pour le tout, vu qu'ils avaient endoss\u00e9 le billet de $15,000.00 et que Galibert avait \u00e9galement cautionn\u00e9 jusqu'au montant de $10,000.00.\nLa compagnie n'a pas pu \u00eatre sauv\u00e9e du naufrage et elle est tomb\u00e9e en faillite. Il s'agit de savoir si cette somme de $10,000.00 doit \u00eatre partag\u00e9e entre les cofid\u00e9jusseurs en portions \u00e9gales, ou bien si elle doit \u00eatre pay\u00e9e int\u00e9gralement par Galibert.\nRawlings et Ball all\u00e8guent dans leur plaidoyer que Lubin, en leur demandant d'endosser le billet de $15,000.00, leur a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il avait l'endossement de Galibert pour $10,000.00 et qu'alors, pour me servir de l'expression de leur d\u00e9fense\nthe liability of the pleading defendant in warranty in any event would not exceed the sum of $5,000.00 inasmuch as if the Company Star Films Limited did not pay its note or retire the same that pleading defendant in warranty would be protected by the note of the said Paul Galibert for $10,000.00 to the extent thereof.\nCes d\u00e9clarations de Lubin changent-elles la nature des relations des cofid\u00e9jusseurs? Je dis que ces d\u00e9clarations ne pourraient exempter les d\u00e9fendeurs d'\u00eatre condamn\u00e9s \u00e0 payer sous les dispositions de l'article 1955 du Code Civil. Lubin, en recevant le billet de Galibert, aurait pu facilement le transf\u00e9rer \u00e0 Rawlings et Ball et ces derniers, en l'endossant et en le payant, auraient eu un recours plus tard, comme porteurs de bonne foi, contre Galibert, en vertu de l'acte des lettres de change.\nMais malheureusement pour les d\u00e9fendeurs ce n'est pas ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Ils ne sont pas devenus porteurs du billet promissoire endoss\u00e9 par Galibert. Ils ont eux-m\u00eames endoss\u00e9 un billet pour l'accommodation de la compagnie Star Films. Ce billet devait \u00eatre escompt\u00e9 \u00e0 la Banque Provinciale, comme de fait il l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 : et en garantie collat\u00e9rale de ce billet de $15,000 on y a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le billet de Galibert.\nPlus tard, m\u00eame quand la compagnie est devenue insolvable, Rawlings et Ball ont renouvel\u00e9 le billet de $15,000.00 non pas en l'endossant mais en le signant eux-m\u00eames: et Galibert renouvela lui aussi son billet, mais en d\u00e9clarant que ce renouvellement \u00e9tait donn\u00e9 en garantie collat\u00e9rale du billet de Rawlings et Ball.\nEn admettant que Lubin ait dit \u00e0 Rawlings et Ball, quand il a obtenu leur endossement sur le billet de $15,000.00, que leur responsabilit\u00e9 ne serait que de $5,000.00, vu la garantie collat\u00e9rale donn\u00e9e par Galibert, cela constituait de la part de Lubin une opinion l\u00e9gale qu'il a donn\u00e9e sur la port\u00e9e et la nature de leurs obligations respectives: mais s'il a err\u00e9, s'il a fait des repr\u00e9sentations qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9 par Galibert de faire, alors ils ne sont pas d\u00e9charg\u00e9s de la responsabilit\u00e9 que la loi leur impose comme cautions, c'est-\u00e0-dire de payer leur part de la dette cautionn\u00e9e.\nMais on dit: Lubin, en faisant ces repr\u00e9sentations agissait comme mandataire de Galibert et la port\u00e9e de ces repr\u00e9sentations de Lubin constituait Galibert responsable de toute la dette vis-\u00e0-vis ses cofid\u00e9-jusseurs. Naturellement une des cautions peut par son acte de cautionnement stipuler \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ses cofid\u00e9jusseurs une plus grande responsabilit\u00e9 que celle \u00e9dict\u00e9e par la loi. Ce contrat ne serait pas contraire \u00e0 l'ordre public et serait par cons\u00e9quent valable. Son mandataire pourrait \u00e9galement le faire pour lui. Mais le mandat \u00e9tant un contrat civil, il ne pourrait \u00eatre prouv\u00e9 que par \u00e9crit ou par l'aveu du mandant. La preuve testimoniale ne pourrait pas \u00eatre faite. Dans la cause actuelle, o\u00f9 est la preuve l\u00e9gale du mandat donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Lubin par Galibert de modifier son obligation \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ses cofid\u00e9jusseurs? La preuve testimoniale qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite ne nous dit pas que Galibert lui-m\u00eame s\u00fbt qu'il devait y avoir d'autres cautions. Il n'a donc pas pu donner mandat \u00e0 Lubin de modifier la port\u00e9s de son obligation. Il remet simplement son endossement \u00e0 Lubin sur un billet de $10,000.00. Comme porteur de ce billet, Lubin pouvait le transporter \u00e0 un tiers et alors Galibert serait devenu responsable pour tout le montant (article 40, acte des lettres de change). Mais Lubin d\u00e9pose ce billet en garantie collat\u00e9rale d'une dette qu'il contracte \u00e0 la banque, dette que Rawlings et Galibert ont cautionn\u00e9e. Alors les relations qui s'\u00e9tablissent entre les parties sont celles de cofid\u00e9jusseurs et nous devons d\u00e9terminer leur responsabilit\u00e9 entr'eux suivant les dispositions de l'article 1955 du code civil.\nLe cautionnement est un contrat civil et il conserve ce caract\u00e8re lors m\u00eame que l'op\u00e9ration principale est commerciale; telle est du moins l'opinion g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement admise en doctrine et en jurisprudence.

(dissenting)\u2014Les appelants nous demandent d'infirmer le jugement de la cour de revision \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al qui a unanimement confirm\u00e9 celui de la cour sup\u00e9rieure.\nCette cause avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9e au terme de mai dernier et une question s'\u00e9tant pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au cours du d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 sur laquelle les parties n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entendues, la cour a ordonn\u00e9 une r\u00e9audition et a formul\u00e9 cette nouvelle question comme suit :-\u2014\nWhether upon the facts in evidence it was within the authority as to the use to be made of his note given by Galibert to Lubin to so use it that he, Galibert, should be liable to indemnify any indorser for Star Films in respect of his endorsement of that company's note to the extent of $10,000.00.\nAvant d'exprimer mon opinion sur le jugement qu'il convient de rendre sur la contestation mue entre les parties comme sur cette nouvelle question, il sera utile d'exposer les faits de la cause qui sont peu compliqu\u00e9s.\nLes appelants, Rawlings et Ball, et l'intim\u00e9, Galibert, \u00e9taient actionnaires d'une compagnie connue sous le nom de Star Films, Limited, et partant int\u00e9ress\u00e9s \u00e0 son succ\u00e8s. Pour \u00e9tendre les op\u00e9rations de cette compagnie, le nomm\u00e9 Herbert Lubin, son pr\u00e9sident, cherchait \u00e0 obtenir de l'escompte de la Banque Provinciale du Canada. Il voulait d'abord escompter un billet de $20,000.00 et avait obtenu de l'intim\u00e9 Galibert un billet de $10,000.00 dont il devait se servir comme garantie collat\u00e9rale, et en retour il promettait de donner \u00e0 Galibert $150,000.00 d'obligations de cette compagnie et $150,000.00 de ses actions et un ch\u00e8que de $5,000.00 en paiement d'une dette ant\u00e9rieure. Cependant la banque ne voulant avancer que $15,000.00, Lubin fit un billet de ce montant, et s'adressa aux appelants. Rawlings et Ball, pour obtenir leur endossement, leur repr\u00e9sentant qu'il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 un billet de Galibert pour $10,000.00 et que le plus qu'ils pourraient \u00eatre appel\u00e9s \u00e0 payer serait $5,000.00.\nCette conversation entre Lubin et Rawlings prend de l'importance surtout en vue de la question qui a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la r\u00e9audition, et je vais citer la version de. Rawlings lui-m\u00eame, que ce dernier a donn\u00e9e sous r\u00e9serve de l'objection \u00e0 la preuve testimoniale faite par l'intim\u00e9 :\u2014\nMr. Lubin came to me with a note for fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000:00), and wanted me to endorse it: I refused. I said \"I will not,\" he tried a second time and I refused: then he came back some time after that, and asked me to do it again. I said: No; he said \"It will be allright, I have a note from Mr. Galibert for ten thousand dollars made out in favour of Star Films Limited, now this note of Galibert's for $10,000 and this other note of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00) which I want Mr. Ball and yourself to endorse will be handed over to the bank, and the only liability that you would have would be the difference between your fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00) and Mr. Galibert's ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) which is five thousand dollars ($5,000.00),. and that five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) would be between you and Mr. Ball: I said \"Well, if you have Mr. Galibert's note in favour of the company and as Mr. Galibert's note would come before my note, I would be agreeable to sign it or endorse the company's note.\" La date de cette conversation n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e, mais le billet de $10,000.00 de Galibert en faveur de Star Films et le billet de cette compagnie pour $15,000.00, endoss\u00e9 par Rawlings et Ball, sont dat\u00e9s tous deux du 17 f\u00e9vrier 1916, et le billet de $15,000.00 garanti par le billet de $10,000.00 a \u00e9t\u00e9 escompt\u00e9 par la Banque Provinciale le 4 mars 1916.\nPour revenir \u00e0 la conversation entre Lubin et Rawlings et aux repr\u00e9sentations qu'on pr\u00e9tend que Lubin aurait faites, Rawlings et Ball, au lieu d'exiger que Galibert confirm\u00e2t ces repr\u00e9sentations\u2014ce qui e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 de prudence \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire\u2014consentirent \u00e0 endosser le billet de $15,000.00 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par Lubin. Ce billet fut escompt\u00e9 par la banque, et le billet de $10,000.00 de Galibert, fait par celui-ci \u00e0 l'ordre de la compagnie Star Films, Limited, fut transport\u00e9 \u00e0 la banque en garantie collat\u00e9rale. Galibert ne re\u00e7ut pas de la compagnie les $5,000.00 qu'il s'attendait \u00e0 avoir \u00e0 m\u00eame le produit de l'escompte, mais seulement $2,000.00 en argent. La banque ayant exig\u00e9 les obligations de la compagnie que Galibert devait recevoir, celui-ci para\u00eet n'en avoir eu que pour $10,000.00, mais il re\u00e7ut $150,000.00 d'actions. Dans toutes ces n\u00e9gociations, les appelants d'une part et l'intim\u00e9 de l'autre rest\u00e8rent \u00e9trangers les uns aux autres, et il n'est intervenu entre eux aucune convention quelconque.\nLa compagnie Star Films, Limited, fut mise en liquidation avant l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du billet de $15,000.00, et ce billet fut renouvel\u00e9 pour un montant moindre (les appelants ayant fait un paiement \u00e0 compte), en par Rawlings et Ball signant eux-m\u00eames le billet de renouvellement et d\u00e9posant le billet de Galibert en garantie, ce billet, d\u00e8s ce moment, comportant \u00e0 sa face \u00eatre donn\u00e9 en garantie collat\u00e9rale du billet de Rawlings et Ball. Apr\u00e8s plusieurs renouvellements, Galibert refusa de renouveler davantage son billet en garantie, et la cr\u00e9ance de la banque ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duite \u00e0 $10,000.00 par des paiements effectu\u00e9s par Rawlings et Ball, la banque poursuivit Galibert pour ce montant, et celui-ci appela en garantie Rawlings et Ball, leur demandant de le garantir pour le plein montant de la poursuite. C'est sur cette instance en garantie que les jugements a quo sont intervenus. Il appert par la preuve que la banque ayant obtenu jugement contre Galibert, celui-ci acquitta la dette en capital, int\u00e9r\u00eat et frais.\nAinsi que je l'ai dit, Faction en garantie de Galibert demande aux appelants de l'indemniser en plein de toute condamnation qui serait port\u00e9e contre lui \u00e0 la poursuite de la banque. Cependant, la cour sup\u00e9rieure, envisageant les parties comme \u00e9tant toutes des cautions de la compagnie Star Films, Limited, et tenant compte des $2,000.00 re\u00e7us par Galibert, condamna chacun des appelants \u00e0 garantir Galibert pour le tiers de $8,000.00 et cela en appliquant les principles du cautionnement, et notamment l'article 1955 du code civil, qui dit que\nLorsque plusieurs personnes ont cautionn\u00e9 un m\u00eame d\u00e9biteur pour une m\u00eame dette, la caution qui a acquitt\u00e9 la dette a recours contre les autres cautions chacune pour sa part et portion.\nMais ce recours n'a lieu que lorsque la caution a pay\u00e9 dans l'un des cas \u00e9nonc\u00e9s en l'article 1953.\nIl est possible que la cour sup\u00e9rieure ait adopt\u00e9 une solution que ni l'une ni l'autre des parties ne d\u00e9sirait, en transformant l'action en garantie de Galibert en une action en indemnit\u00e9 partielle, et en traitant toutes les parties comme \u00e9tant les cautions du m\u00eame d\u00e9biteur et pour la m\u00eame dette. Galibert cependant accepta le jugement, et Rawlings et Ball cherch\u00e8rent en vain \u00e0 le faire infirmer par la cour de revision.\nLes pr\u00e9tentions que Rawlings et Ball font valoir devant cette cour sont que Galibert, avant qu'il f\u00fbt question pour eux d'endosser le billet de la compagnie Star Films, avait donn\u00e9 \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re son billet de $10,000.00; que faisant \u00e9tat de ce billet, Lubin, le pr\u00e9sident de la compagnie, avait obtenu l'endossement de Rawlings et Ball, en leur repr\u00e9sentant que leur responsabilit\u00e9 se limiterait en tout \u00e0 $5,000.00; que l'arrangement effectu\u00e9 entre Galibert et la compagnie \u00e9tait distinct de celui que cette compagnie avait fait avec Rawlings et Ball et \u00e9tait compl\u00e9t\u00e9 avant que ces derniers consentissent \u00e0 endosser pour la compagnie; que partant Rawlings et Ball se trouvaient dans la m\u00eame position que s'ils avaient eux-m\u00eames avanc\u00e9 $15,000.00 \u00e0 la compagnie Star Films, et s'\u00e9taient ensuite servis du billet de Galibert et de leur propre billet pour obtenir de l'escompte de la banque au montant des $15,000.00 ainsi avanc\u00e9s.\nJ'\u00e9carte imm\u00e9diatement cette derni\u00e8re pr\u00e9tention en disant que ce n'est pas l\u00e0 l'esp\u00e8ce que nous avons \u00e0 juger. Si Rawlings et Ball avaient eux-m\u00eames avanc\u00e9 $15,000.00 \u00e0 la compagnie, sur la garantie du billet de Galibert, ils seraient devenus porteurs de ce dernier billet pour valeur, et partant Galibert aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 leur d\u00e9biteur personnel, et il va sans dire qu'il n'aurait pas eu de recours contre eux. Telle n'est cependant pas la transaction qui est intervenue entre les parties.\nLe d\u00e9biteur principal, les parties l'admettent, c'\u00e9tait la compagnie Star Films. Si l'intim\u00e9 et les appelants ont acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'obligation de cette derni\u00e8re ce ne peut \u00eatre que comme cautions. Le cr\u00e9ancier de l'obligation principale et des obligations accessoires et distinctes des cautions \u00e9tait la banque; et les parties ont cautionn\u00e9 la m\u00eame dette, c'est-\u00e0-dire les $15,000.00 emprunt\u00e9s de la banque par la compagnie Star Films.\nOr le contrat de cautionnement se fait entre le cr\u00e9ancier et les cautions, et non pas entre celles-ci et le d\u00e9biteur principal (Paul Pont, Cautionnement, no. 10). L'erreur fondamentale des appelants, c'est de croire que, par un arrangement avec le d\u00e9biteur principal, ils peuvent restreindre leur responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'une autre caution qui les a lib\u00e9r\u00e9s par son paiement. Les repr\u00e9sentations que Lubin a pu faire \u00e0 Rawlings et Ball qu'ils ne r\u00e9pondraient que de $5,000.00 peuvent bien l'engager personnellement, mais ne peuvent \u00eatre oppos\u00e9es \u00e0 la banque ni \u00e0 Galibert, pour lesquels elles sont res inter alios acta. Dans l'esp\u00e8ce, Rawlings et Ball ont cautionn\u00e9 l'obligation du d\u00e9biteur principal pour le tout, $15,000.00, et Galibert jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de $10,000.00. Peu importe que Galibert ait donn\u00e9 son cautionnement sans compter sur Rawlings et Ball comme endosseurs futurs du billet de $15,000.00, et que son cautionnement soit enti\u00e8rement distinct de celui qu'ils ont subs\u00e9quemment donn\u00e9. Car une caution peut exercer, en cas de paiement, le recours de l'article 1955 C.C., malgr\u00e9 que son cautionnement ait pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le cautionnement des autres cautions, et il n'est pas du tout n\u00e9cessaire que la caution premi\u00e8re en date ait compt\u00e9 sur le cautionnement des cautions subs\u00e9quentes, ni qu'elle l'ait m\u00eame connu (Paul Pont, Cautionnement, no. 316). Il suffit que son paiement ait lib\u00e9r\u00e9 les autres cautions, et alors celles-ci, par application d'une r\u00e8gle d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 (ce qu'on appelait autrefois une action utile) maintenant consacr\u00e9e par un texte formel, doivent l'indemniser jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de leur part de la dette cautionn\u00e9e, ou, comme disent les auteurs, ainsi que l'article 1955 C.C. lui-m\u00eame, pour leur part et portion virile (Paul Pont, Cautionnement, no. 321; Guillouard, Cautionnement, no. 213). Lors de la r\u00e9audition, M. Falconer, conseil des appelants, s'est appuy\u00e9 moins sur un mandat donn\u00e9 par Galibert \u00e0 Lubin par la remise \u00e0 ce dernier du billet de $10,000.00, que sur ce qu'il a appel\u00e9 \"the constructive delivery\" de ce billet par Lubin \u00e0 Rawlings et Ball, rendant ces derniers en un sens porteurs de ce billet, ou du moins limitant leur responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de Galibert, \u00e0 la somme sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 $10,000.00, pour laquelle ils endosseraient le billet de la compagnie Star Films.\nLe savant conseil des appelants a cit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audition deux d\u00e9cisions anglaises, Craythorne v. Swinburne[17], et Brocklesby v. Temperance Permanent Building Society[18], qu'il soutient \u00eatre favorables \u00e0 ses pr\u00e9tentions, et \u00e0 la r\u00e9audition il a cit\u00e9 une autre d\u00e9cision anglaise, London Joint Stock Bank v. Simmons[19].\nBien que je sois d'avis que le droit civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec est assez riche en pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents et en jurisprudence pour qu'il ne soit pas n\u00e9cessaire d'en chercher ailleurs\u2014et du reste ces jugements ne font pas autorit\u00e9 en cette province\u2014j'ai examin\u00e9 ces trois d\u00e9cisions.\nLa seconde ne s'applique pas(2). Il s'agissait d'un p\u00e8re qui avait remis \u00e0 son fils des titres sur lesquels le fils avait emprunt\u00e9 d'un tiers de bonne foi une somme plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e que celle que son p\u00e8re l'avait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9lever; et on a donn\u00e9 raison au pr\u00eateur, qui r\u00e9clamait la somme enti\u00e8re. Il n'y a aucune difficult\u00e9 sur ce point.\nIl en est de m\u00eame de la cause de London Joint Stock Bank v. Simmons19. L\u00e0 on avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 entre les mains d'un courtier des obligations n\u00e9gotiables sur la garantie et sur la remise desquelles la banque avait de bonne foi avanc\u00e9 des fonds au courtier. La r\u00e8gle qu'on a appliqu\u00e9 en cette cause \u00e9tait (p. 212 du rapport),\nthat whoever is the holder of a negotiable instrument has power to give title to any person honestly acquiring it.\nIl est clair que cette cause ne s'applique pas. Lubin \u00e9tait d\u00e9tenteur du billet de Galibert, mais il n'en a pas dispos\u00e9 en faveur de Rawlings et Ball. S'il l'avait fait et si Rawlings et Ball avaient acquis de bonne foi et pour valeur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ce billet, nul doute qu'ils auraient pu r\u00e9clamer les $10,000.00 de Galibert. Mais encore une fois ce n'est pas l\u00e0 l'esp\u00e8ce que nous avons \u00e0 juger.\nLa cause de Craythorne v. Swinburne[20], \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, pr\u00e9sente une certaine analogie avec celle qui nous occupe; mais il y a cette diff\u00e9rence essentielle que la caution Craythorne, qui r\u00e9clamait la contribution \u00e0 Swinburne, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 elle-m\u00eame cautionn\u00e9e par ce dernier aupr\u00e8s de la banque, de sorte qu'elle se trouvait \u00eatre la d\u00e9bitrice principale \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de Swinburne. Si Galibert avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cautionn\u00e9 par Rawlings et Ball, je renverrais son action contre ceux-ci, mais rien de tel n'existe dans l'esp\u00e8ce, et les appelants ne le pr\u00e9tendent pas.\nLa proposition que soumettent les appelants \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 dire que Lubin, qui \u00e9tait porteur du billet de Galibert\u2014lequel billet \u00e0 la connaissance de Rawlings et Ball, lui \u00e9tait donn\u00e9 pour servir de garantie de l'emprunt que Lubin voulait faire \u00e0 la banque\u2014aurait pu formellement promettre \u00e0 Rawlings et Ball, au nom de Galibert, que si eux aussi consentaient \u00e0 garantir Cet emprunt, en d'autres termes si avec Galibert ils devenaient les cautions de Lubin ou de sa compagnie, et que Galibert payait le montant de son cautionnement, il n'aurait pas contre eux le recours contributoire de l'article 1955 C.C. Pour faire cette promesse au nom de Galibert il faudrait certainement un mandat de celui-ci, et ce mandat n'existe pas. Peut-on inf\u00e9rer un tel mandat de la simple remise du billet de $10,000.00 par Galibert \u00e0 Lubin, ou, pour poser cette question dans les termes m\u00eames de la question qui a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la r\u00e9audition,\nwas it within the authority as to the use to be made of his note given by Galibert to Lubin to so use it that he, Galibert, should be liable to indemnify any indorser for Star Films in respect of his endorsement of that company's note to the extent of $10,000.00?\nJe r\u00e9ponds non, et j'ajoute qu'on n'a cit\u00e9 aucune autorit\u00e9, anglaise ou fran\u00e7aise, en faveur de cette pr\u00e9tention.\nDu reste, d'apr\u00e8s la version m\u00eame de Rawlings, Lubin n'a fait autre chose que d'exprimer son opinion et cette opinion \u00e9tait mal fond\u00e9e en loi. Lubin ne parlait pas au nom de Galibert, mais en son propre nom et dans mon humble opinion ce serait le renversement de tous les principes qui r\u00e9gissent les contrats, que de pr\u00e9tendre qu'il a fait avec Rawlings une convention liant Galibert.\nEt quant au \"constructive delivery\" invoqu\u00e9 par le savant avocat des appelants, il n'y a jamais eu livraison, r\u00e9elle, feinte ou \"constructive,\" du billet de Galibert \u00e0 Rawlings et Ball, mais \u00e0 la connaissance de ces derniers ce billet devait \u00eatre remis \u00e0 la banque pour assurer \u00e0 celle-ci le paiement du billet que Rawlings et Ball endossaient. Et dans les renouvellements subs\u00e9quents, le billet de Galibert porte express\u00e9ment qu'il est donn\u00e9 en garantie du billet de Rawlings et Ball.\nPour revenir maintenant \u00e0 l'expos\u00e9 de la doctrine du code civil sur le cautionnement, je puis ajouter que le fait que la caution a donn\u00e9 son cautionnement en consid\u00e9ration d'une valeur re\u00e7ue par elle du d\u00e9biteur, n'emp\u00eache pas le contrat d'\u00eatre un v\u00e9ritable cautionnement. (Paul Pont, Cautionnement, no. 16.) Dans l'esp\u00e8ce, la cour sup\u00e9rieure a tenu compte de la somme de $2,000.00 que Galibert avait re\u00e7ue de la compagnie Star Films. Toutefois, comme Galibert ne s'en plaint pas, nous n'avons pas \u00e0 nous prononcer sur la question de savoir si cette d\u00e9duction aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre faite, et je me contenterai d'exprimer mes r\u00e9serves sur ce point.\nCette cause pr\u00e9sente toutefois cette particularit\u00e9 que Rawlings et Ball ont cautionn\u00e9 toute la dette de $15,000.00 et que Galibert ne l'a garantie que pour $10,000.00, c'est-\u00e0-dire pour les deux tiers. Il n'y a aucune difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9cider que la contribution entre cautions qui r\u00e9pondent de toute la dette doit \u00eatre \u00e9gale, car l'article 1955 C.C. para\u00eet envisager ce cas qui sera le plus fr\u00e9quent. Mais l'article 1955 C.C. n'exclut pas l'hypoth\u00e8se de cautions qui s'engagent d'une mani\u00e8re in\u00e9gale, et elles ne contribueraient pas au paiement fait par l'une d'elles \"chacune pour sa part et portion,\" si on ne tenait pas compte, dans la contribution au paiement de la dette, de la proportion dans laquelle elles l'ont respectivement cautionn\u00e9e.\nOn peut donc dire qu'en payant \u00e0 la banque $5,000.00 sur le billet de $15,000.00, Rawlings et Ball ont pay\u00e9 la partie de la dette qu'ils avaient seuls cautionn\u00e9e et ce paiement n'a apport\u00e9 aucun b\u00e9n\u00e9fice \u00e0 Galibert qui restait responsable de sa garantie de $10,000.00. Ayant pay\u00e9 cette derni\u00e8re somme, Galibert a recours contre Rawlings et Ball suivant la proportion de leurs cautionnements respectifs, ou, pour poser la question autrement mais avec le m\u00eame r\u00e9sultat, on peut dire que les appelants et l'intim\u00e9 se trouvant sur un pied d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 quant aux deux tiers de la dette rest\u00e9e due apr\u00e8s que les appelants eussent pay\u00e9 $5,000.00 \u00e0 la banque, ils devraient contribuer \u00e9galement au paiement de cette somme de $10,000.00.\nLa cour sup\u00e9rieure ne les fait contribuer \u00e9galement que pour la somme de $8,000.00, donnant ainsi \u00e0 Rawlings et Ball le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la somme re\u00e7ue par Galibert de la compagnie Stair Films comme le prix de son cautionnement. L'intim\u00e9 cependant ne se plaint pas de cela. Ayant fait mes r\u00e9serves sur ce point, je crois que la cour sup\u00e9rieure et la cour de revision ont fait une application de l'article 1955 C.C. dont les appelants sont mal fond\u00e9s \u00e0 se plaindre. Leur appel doit donc \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nJe n'ai pas cru n\u00e9cessaire de discuter la question de la preuve testimoniale des repr\u00e9sentations de Lubin, car dans mon opinion ces repr\u00e9sentations ne peuvent affecter Galibert. Mais si on veut prouver un contrat fait par Lubin, comme mandataire de Galibert, comportant renonciation au recours contributoire de l'article 1955 C.C., je suis d'avis que la preuve testimoniale est inadmissible. Un tel contrat n'est \u00e0 aucuns \u00e9gards commercial alors m\u00eame qu'il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour obtenir l'endossement d'un tiers sur un billet qu'on se proposait d'escompter.\nL'appel devrait donc \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Fleet, Falconer, Phelan, Bovey and Ogden.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Perron, Taschereau Rinfret, Vall\u00e9e and Genest.\n[1] Q.R. 55 S.C, 516; sub nom.

VII. c. 19, ss. 330, 331 (1) and 559 (4).\nThe Legislature of Ontario has not given the municipalities of the province authority to permit telephone companies to occupy the streets and highways with their poles and wires for a longer period, at one time, than five years.\nAn agreement by a municipality to permit, by irrevocable license, a telephone company to occupy the streets with poles and wires is ultra vires.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (44 Ont. L.R. 366), reversed; that on the trial (42 Ont. L.R. 385), restored.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment at the trial[2], in favour of the appellant.\nThe respondent brought action for an injunction to restrain the Town of Cobalt from removing its poles and wires from the streets and for damages. The streets were so occupied under an agreement with the town made in 1905 which the respondent claimed gave it a perpetual franchise. The two questions raised were whether or not the perpetual franchise was given and, if it was, whether or not the town had power to give it. The present appeal was disposed of on the second question. Tilley K.C. for the appellant.\nH.J. Scott K.C. for the respondent.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The question raised herein is whether or not respondent, which is a telephone company incorporated under and by virtue of the Ontario \u201cCompanies Act,\u201d has, under the circumstances I am about to refer to, the right to maintain on the public highways of appellant, which is a municipal corporation, poles and wires and ducts against the will of appellant\u2019s council.\nIt may conduce to clarity of thought on the subject to appreciate correctly the limits of power, right, and jurisdiction which these corporate bodies respectively had, or have, in the premises in question.\nThe respondent is a legal entity which only has the capacity given it by its charter and so far only as that is effective by virtue of the said \u201cCompanies Act.\u201d\nThat charter only professes to give it the corporate capacity:\u2014\nTo carry on within the District of Nipissing the general business of a telephone company and for that purpose to construct, erect, maintain and operate a line or lines of telephone along the sides of or across or under any public highways, roads, streets, bridges, waters, water courses or other places, subject, however, to the consent to be first had and obtained, and to the control of the municipal councils having jurisdiction in the municipalities in which the company\u2019s lines may be constructed and operated, and to such terms for such times and at such rates and charges as by such councils shall be granted, limited and fixed for such purposes, respectively.\nThe exercise of such powers as it may thus acquire is subjected to the limitations contained in a long proviso following this definition of capacity, expressed in distinctly separate paragraphs enumerated from (a) to (k).\nMany of them are express limitations on the jurisdiction of the municipal corporations which may be concerned and designed to protect the public against the possibilities of neglect by municipal authority or aggressive acts of respondent impairing the rights of others.\nIt is to be observed that all the respondent can acquire is by the above quoted definition of its capacity expressly subject\nto the consent to be first had and obtained, and to the control, of the municipal councils having jurisdiction * * * and to such terms for such times and at such rates * * * as by such councils shall be granted * * *\nIt does not always happen that the legislature is so cautiously and properly restrictive relative to what a municipal council can do as has been thus expressed. Its acts here in question should be interpreted and construed consistently therewith.\nNow let us turn to the powers of the municipality and see how far its council could go in disregard of the rights of those coming after it.\nThe title in and to the road allowance for a public highway may be, and generally is, technically vested in the municipal corporation, whose council has jurisdiction over it. But the jurisdiction of its council over that property is limited to discharging the duties relative to its maintenance and use as such, and it has no more power to grant concessions such as now in question to any one, than any man on the street has save so far as expressly conferred by statute.\nAs to its powers in that regard we are referred in argument to the provision in the \u201cMunicipal Act,\u201d 3 Edw. VII. ch. 19, sec. 559, sub-sec. 4, enabling the council to pass by-laws:\u2014\n(4) For regulating the erection and maintenance of electric light, telegraph and telephone poles and wires within their limits.\nAnd to the amendment of that by 6 Edw. VII. ch. 34, which amended it by substituting the following:\u2014 (4) For permitting and regulating the erection and maintenance of electric light, power, telegraph and telephone poles and wires upon the highways or elsewhere within the limits of the municipality.\nThese are simply general powers under the caption of Highways and Bridges to pass general by-laws, repealable when the council chooses, relative thereto and, besides the fact that no such by-law of appellant is in evidence, give respondent nothing more than in substance is conferred, by sub-sec. 3 of same section, on cabmen to occupy certain stands on the street.\nCan any one pretend that because a certain stand has been so allotted as therein provided, a cabman acquires thereby a right in perpetuity to stay at or on that same stand no matter what change of circumstances or by-law?\nAll that the amendment does relative to our present inquiry is to insert the word \u201cpermitting\u201d which was rather stupidly omitted from the first of those enactments.\nThey furnish, however, incidentally, a very good illustration of how little importance is to be attached to the mere power of permission without anything more being given.\nSection 331 of same Act is in truth the only one the respondent can rely upon and that is as follows:\u2014\n331. (1) The council of every city, town and village may pass by-laws granting from time to time to any telephone company upon such terms and conditions as may be thought expedient the exclusive right within the municipality for a period not exceeding five years at any one time to use streets and lanes in the municipality for the purpose of placing in, upon, over or under the same poles, ducts and wires for the purpose of carrying on a telephone business and may on behalf of the municipal corporation enter into agreements with any such company not to give to any other company or person for such period any licence or permission to use such streets or lanes for any such purpose; but no such by-law shall be passed nor shall any such agreement be entered into without the assent of two-thirds of the members of the council of the municipality being present and voting therefor. I fail to find in this section any warrant for the claim that a perpetual franchise could be granted by the municipality even if it desired. Nothing but an exclusive franchise and that for a limited time is countenanced in a single syllable of this section and, properly so, those who stop to think will say.\nThe implication in the proposition put forward that there is such a power seems to me, I submit with due respect, bordering upon the absurd, if not quite beyond.\nThe grant may be \u201cfrom time to time\u201d but it must be exclusive. The municipality cannot, as a matter of public convenience, grant more than one such company rights to encumber and endanger the public highway, and the terms thereof must be so well considered and approved of, that two-thirds of the members of the council must approve.\nThe enactment of the provision therein specifically enabling the council to assure the successful applicant for the grant that no other shall be granted indicates how limited the legislature deemed the contracting powers of the council relative to such a subject matter had been.\nAnd it can only be for a term of five years that it can be granted. The only right, otherwise given, is pursuant to another provision to give private parties a personal convenience, if desirable for their business reasons, and not detrimental to the public.\nThe assumption that the enactment in above quoted section was ever contemplated as giving powers to grant concurrent franchises to more than one public company is fraught with such evil consequences that it can only be reached, I submit, by a disregard of the future possibilities of a growing town and an over-looking of the nature of the subject matter so involved. The business is of a nature that, from every point of view, must involve a crossing of streets, by the works to carry it on, even if the cumbering of the public highway with poles or other appliances could be avoided; prudence, therefore, palpably dictates that the like appliances should not be multiplied.\nThe legislature, no doubt, had that in view and conferred no other power than the granting of one such concession at a time. It is not a kind of interference with public right to use the highway which we should try to spell out from possible constructions of the language used. It is a jurisdiction given to be used within the most restricted meaning possible that will effectuate the obvious purpose had in view in the same manner as every private act invading public rights is construed.\nI submit there is no such plain and express language conferring the jurisdiction alleged to have been exercised as would have entitled the council of the appellant to have granted a perpetual franchise.\nNor do I think the council ever so intended by the agreement in question. To read the first clause of that standing alone as governing the whole instrument is not the way to interpret such a document.\nIt must be governed by the same restrictive canon of construction as relative to private Acts.\nRead as a whole, and as amended by the later agreement if we have regard to the scope and purpose of the business in hand, can there be a doubt as to the intention of the council?\nAnd as to the particularistic criticism of the amendment indicating a longer term than five years to which to apply the operation of the amendment, surely there was within the view of all concerned the possibility, pay, probability, of a satisfactory service leading to a continuation of business relations between these parties on the same terms as then reached.\nOn any other supposition we are driven to say that the first clause alone of the whole agreement was to stand when all else in it had become null and void and the respondent had a free hand unrestricted by the necessity of observing obligations important to the appellant to be duly observed by one serving the public.\nIn other words, the respondent was no longer to be a public servant, but a master of the public streets and possessed of a right of property therein which would debar the appellant from closing or widening or narrowing any of same unless upon such terms as the respondent should choose to dictate.\nTo test the construction contended for, and upheld below, suppose the agreement had consisted of nothing but clause 1, could it have been maintained as within the power conferred by section 331?\nI cannot reach such a conclusion as to answer in the affirmative, and, therefore, think the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout, and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiff company sues for an injunction to restrain the defendant municipal corporation from removing poles and wires of the plaintiffs from its streets, the company having itself refused to do so. The learned trial judge dismissed the action[3], holding that the only right of the company to maintain its poles and wires on the streets of the town was conferred by an agreement made in June, 1912, with the municipal corporation, that the power of the latter to enter into such an agreement existed only by virtue of sec. 331 (1) of the \u201cMunicipal Act\u201d of 1903 (3 Edw. VII. ch. 19), and that under that section\nthe right to operate as a monopoly for the period of five years could alone have been given.\nIn passing I may observe that, notwithstanding the history of sec. 331 (1) (see Biggar\u2019s Municipal Manual, page 345, note) and its collocation, I agree with what I conceive to have been Mr. Justice Middleton\u2019s idea that it should be regarded not as merely providing for an exception to the prohibition of sec. 330, but as conferring a substantive power to create a monopoly which a municipal council might not possess even were sec. 330 not in the \u201cMunicipal Act.\u201d But I cannot accede to the view that sec. 331 (1) is the only provision of that Act empowering a municipal council to authorize the use of its highways by a telephone company.\nIn the second Appellate Divisional Court this judgment was reversed[4], the majority of the court (Mulock C.J., Sutherland and Kelly JJ.), holding that a municipal corporation had power under sec. 559 (4) of the \u201cMunicipal Act,\u201d as enacted by 6 Edw. VII. ch. 34, sec. 20, irrevocably to authorize the use of its streets by a telephone company for the purpose of erecting and maintaining its poles and wires for an indefinite period or in perpetuity, although its power to confer an exclusive right was restricted by sec. 331 (1) to a term of five years, and that upon the proper construction of the agreement in question such authorization for an indefinite term or in perpetuity had been granted. Riddell and Latchford JJ. dissented, holding that on the proper construction of the contract the authorization was limited to the five year term for which the municipal corporation had agreed that the right of the company should be exclusive. The Town of Cobalt is in the District of Nipissing. In June, 1912, the plaintiff company had already established telephone lines in the town. In that month an agreement was made between the company and the municipal corporation on the efficacy of which as an irrevocable consent or licence to the exercise of its powers within the municipality it is now conceded that the right of the company to maintain its poles and wires on the streets of Cobalt solely depends. It thus becomes unnecessary further to consider what the company had done in Cobalt prior to June, 1912, or the physical conditions then existing in regard to its poles and wires on the streets of that town, on which, at an earlier stage of this case, the plaintiffs had partly rested their claim of right to continue to maintain them.\nWhile two questions\u2014the first one of construction of the agreement of June, 1912, and the other one of the power of the municipality to make that agreement, if it should bear the construction put upon it by the plaintiff company\u2014are presented for our consideration on this appeal, I have found it necessary to deal only with the second of these questions, which may be stated as follows:\u2014If, notwithstanding the negative provision of the seventh clause of the agreement limiting the exclusive rights of the company to a period of five years and other clauses relied upon as indicating that the consent of the municipal corporation\nto the company exercising its powers by constructing, maintaining and operating its lines of telephone upon, along, across, or under any highway, square or other public place within the limits of the town, etc.,\ngiven by the first clause should be likewise restricted in its operation to the same term of years, the consent, permit or licence so accorded should be regarded as having been intended to be effective and irrevocable for an unlimited period, was it within the power of the municipal corporation to give such a consent, licence or permission?\nHaving regard to its definition clause, its scope and the fact that telephone companies were the subject of a special statute concurrently enacted, I agree with Mr. Justice Middleton that the \u201cMunicipal Franchises Act\u201d of 1912 (2 Geo. V. ch. 42) does not apply to those companies.\nThe \u201cTelephone Companies Act\u201d of 1912 (2 Geo. V. ch. 38) only came into force on the 1st July of that year and, therefore, did not apply to the agreement of the 19th of June, 1912.\nThe plaintiff company was incorporated in April, 1905, by Letters Patent issued under the Ontario \u201cCompanies Act\u201d (R.S.O. 1897, ch. 191)\nto carry on within the District of Nipissing the general business of a telephone company, and for that purpose to construct, erect, maintain and operate a line or lines of telephone along the sides of, or across, or under, any public highways, roads, streets, bridges, waters, water courses, or other places,\u2019 subject, however, to the consent to be first had and obtained, and to the control, of the municipal councils having jurisdiction in the municipalities in which the company\u2019s lines may be constructed and operated, and to such terms, for such times and at such rates and charges as by such councils shall be granted, limited and fixed, for such purposes respectively.\nUnder section 9 of that Act the Lieutenant-Governor in Council was empowered to grant a charter of incorporation,\nfor any of the purposes and objects to which the legislative authority of the Legislature of Ontario extends,\nwith certain immaterial exceptions. By section 15 it was enacted that the corporation so created\nshall be invested with all the powers, privileges and immunities which are incident to such corporation or are expressed or included in the Letters Patent and the \u201cInterpretation Act\u201d and which are necessary to carry into effect the intention and objects of the Letters Patent and such of the provisions of this Act as are applicable to the company. At bar the case was discussed as if, apart from the effect of any municipal by-law or contract conferring powers or rights upon the company, ch. 191 of the R.S.O., 1897, were the only legislation to be taken account of in determining its status, capacity, powers and rights. No allusion was made, nor do I find any in the judgments below or in the factums, to the legislation of 1907 repealing that Act and replacing it by a new \u201cCompanies Act\u201d (7 Edw. VII. ch. 34) which, by sec. 210 (c), is made applicable (except so far as otherwise provided) inter alia\nto every company incorporated under any special or general Act of the Legislature of the Province of Ontario.\nBy sec. 211 (1) this statute enacts that:\u2014\nAny Letters Patent * * * made or granted with respect to any company, corporation or association within the scope of this Act under any enactment hereby repealed shall continue in force as if it had been made or granted under this Act.\nIt would seem to follow that the plaintiff company cannot invoke sec. 15 of ch. 191 of the R.S.O. 1897, of which I find no counterpart in the Act of 1907, to support or justify the existence or exercise of any powers or rights subsequent to the 1st of July, 1907.\nOn the other hand, Part XII. of the Act of 1907, dealing with\ncompanies operating municipal franchises and public utilities,\nis, by section 154, confined in its operation to \u201capplications for incorporation\u201d by such companies, and would, therefore, seem not to apply to a company like the plaintiff already incorporated, unless it should seek reincorporation (sec. 9) or (possibly) the grant of additional powers by Supplementary Letters Patent (sec. 10). Section 3 of the Act of 1907 re\u2011enacts sec. 9 of the superseded statute of 1897, and its purview is unaffected by a subsequent formal amendment made by the 8 Edw. VII. ch. 43, sec. 1. Section 17 is in part as follows:\u2014\n17. A company having share capital shall possess the following powers as incidental and ancillary to the powers set out in the Letters Patent or Supplementary Letters Patent:\u2014\n* * * *\n(f) To enter into any arrangements with any authorities, municipal, local or otherwise, that may seem conducive to the company\u2019s objects, or any of them, and to obtain from any such authority any rights, privileges and concessions which the company may think it desirable to obtain, and to carry out, exercise and comply with any such arrangements, rights, privileges and concessions.\n* * * *\n(i) To purchase, take on lease or in exchange, hire or otherwise acquire, any personal property and any rights or privileges which the company may think necessary or convenient for the purposes of its business and in particular any machinery, plant, stock\u2011in\u2011trade;\n* * * *\n(q) To do all such other things as are incidental or conducive to the attainment of the above objects.\nThe corresponding provisions of the present law are to be found in the R.S.O. 1914, ch. 178, sec. 23, sub-sec. 1, clauses (f), (i) and (q).\nIt may be probable that under the Act of 1907 Letters Patent in the terms of those granted to the plaintiff would not be issued and it is not improbably the correct view that a company obliged to have recourse to clauses (f), (i) and (q) of that Act as the source of its powers and rights in that regard would possess nothing more than a subjective capacity to receive from a municipal corporation such rights upon its highways as it should see fit, acting within its powers, to confer. But I incline strongly to the view that the opening paragraph of section 17 has the effect of a legislative recognition of the existence of the powers which their Letters Patent purport to confer, if not in the case of companies incorporated under the Act of 1907, at all events in that of companies then in existence which had been incorporated under any of the superseded Acts\u2014inter alia ch. 191 of the R.S.O. 1897. That recognition, I think, placed companies incorporated under the Act of 1897 in the same position after 1907 with regard to the character and efficacy of the powers and rights which their Letters Patent purported to confer as if section 15 of that Act were still in force.\nI am, with respect, unable to appreciate the force of the contention of counsel for the appellant that the powers and rights of a company incorporated as this company was under the Ontario \u201cCompanies Act\u201d of 1897 in regard to the use and occupation of the streets of a municipality (apart from the effect of the \u201cCompanies Act\u201d of 1907) differed from what they would be had it been incorporated by a private statute conferring the same rights and powers in identical language.\nWe are probably bound, in deference to the authority of the Judicial Committee in Bonanza Creek Gold Mining Co. v. Rex[5], to hold that a company incorporated by Letters Patent under the Ontario \u201cJoint Stock Companies Act\u201d\npurports to derive its existence from the act of the Sovereign (through his representative the Lieutenant-Governor) and not merely from the words of the regulating statute,\nand therefore possesses\na status resembling that of a corporation at common law\u2014a general capacity analogous to that of a natural person.\nBut\u2014I speak with deference\u2014it possesses, in addition within the province whatever capacity, powers and rights, within its competence the legislature, having provided for the creation of the corporation by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, as its delegate, has seen fit by the terms of the \u201cCompanies Act\u201d itself to bestow upon it when so created; and it derives its existence, at least in part, from that statute under and pursuant to which the Lieutenant-Governor in Council purported to act in creating it and in defining its purposes, I am, with respect, unable to read the facultative language of authorization of sections 9 and 15 of the Ontario \u201cCompanies Act\u201d of 1897 as amounting to nothing more than\nwords * * * which merely restrict the cases in which such a grant (i.e., of corporate existence) may be made\nby the Lieutenant-Governor in the exercise of the prerogative[6]. In both cases alike\u2014that of such a company incorporated by Letters Patent issued under the Act of 1897 and that of the like company incorporated by special Act\u2014the source of the power or right to use or occupy the highways is the legislature, the corporate body enjoying them being brought into existence in the one case by the act of its delegate, the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, and in the other by direct legislative action. In both alike, on the assumption that it is conferred in identical terms, the exercise of the power or right is conditional on the consent of the municipal corporation being obtained\u2014which, so far as the constating instrument of the company affects the matter, may be given on such terms as the municipal corporation sees fit to impose\u2014and remains subject to its control and regulation. But when and so far as that consent is effectively given the condition is satisfied and the power and right is then exercisable not by virtue of the consent, which merely removes a restriction that might not exist if unexpressed: City of Toronto v. Bell Telephone Co.[7]; but see Sherbrooke Telephone Association v. Corporation of Sherbrooke[8]; but by virtue of the authority of the legislature over public highways exerted on behalf of the company, British Columbia Electric Rly. Co. v. Stewart[9].\nIf, on the other hand, the view should prevail that the effect of its incorporation, whether by Letters Patent issued under the \u201cCompanies Act,\u201d or by special statute (the purpose and powers in either case being formulated in the terms of the plaintiff company\u2019s letters patent and of the Ontario \u201cCompanies Act\u201d of 1897 above set forth), is merely the endowment of the company with a quasi-subjective capacity to acquire from those in control of it rights and powers in regard to the use of property vested in others, so that the exercise of such rights and powers when they are conferred upon it by those in control of the property on or over which they are to be enjoyed will not be ultra vires of the company or something to which any shareholder may object\u2014for instance, to acquire from a municipal corporation the right to use and occupy highways under its control, so that the true source of the company\u2019s rights and powers in that respect is the act of the municipal council\u2014what I am about to say as to limitations upon the consent, licence, or permission to use its highways which a municipal council in Ontario may give to a telephone company will lose none of its force.\nWhen the question before us is considered from the aspect of the power of the municipality to permit or consent to the use of the public highways, it may well be that such a power would be implied from a special Act of the legislature incorporating a company and granting to it powers similar to those here conferred in similar language, whereas the like implication would not arise upon the grant of Letters Patent of incorpora- tion under the \u201cCompanies Act\u201d couched in like terms. The Lieutenant-Governor in Council is not by that Act made the delegate of the legislature to confer powers on municipal corporations. Any implication from a special Act incorporating a telephone company, however that power is thereby conferred on a municipal corporation to license the use of its highways by the company, would, in my opinion, be subject to such restrictions as are imposed by secs. 330 and 331 (1) of the \u201cMunicipal Act.\u201d\nBut if the charter of the plaintiff company did not impliedly authorize the Corporation of the Town of Cobalt to give the requisite consent to the exercise of its powers by the plaintiff company within that municipality, sec. 559 (4) of the \u201cMunicipal Act,\u201d in my opinion, clearly did so, subject, however, to such limitations as were imposed by secs. 330 and 331 (1) of the same Act.\nSub-section 4 of sec. 559 (as enacted by 6 Edw. VII., ch. 34, sec. 20) and secs. 330 and 331 (1) of the \u201cMunicipal Act\u201d of 1903 (3 Edw. VII., ch. 19) are as follows:\u2014\n559. By-laws may be passed by the councils of the municipalities and for the purposes in this section respectively mentioned, that is to say * * *\n* * * *\n(4) For permitting and regulating the erection and maintenance of electric light, power, telegraph and telephone poles and wires upon the highways or elsewhere within the limits of the municipality.\n330. Subject to the provisions of secs. 331 and 332 of this Act no council shall have the power to give any person an exclusive right of exercising within the municipality any trade or calling or to impose a special tax on any person exercising the same or to require a licence to be taken for exercising the same unless authorized or required by statute, so to do, but the council may direct a fee not exceeding $1 to be paid to the proper officer for a certificate of compliance with any regulations in regard to such trade or calling.\n331 (1). The council of every city, town or village may pass by-laws granting from time to time to any telephone company upon such terms and conditions as may be thought expedient the exclusive right within the municipality for a period not exceeding five years at any one time to use streets and lanes in the municipality for the purpose of placing in, upon, over or under the same poles, ducts and wires for the purpose of carrying on a telephone business and may, on behalf of the municipal corporation, enter into agreements with any such company not to give to any other company or person for such period any licence or permission to use such streets or lanes for any such purpose; but no such by-law shall be passed nor shall any such agreement be entered into without the assent of two-thirds of the members of the council of the municipality being present and voting therefor.\nSections 331 (1) and 559 (4) being both found in the same statute must, if possible, be harmonized. So far as they may conflict, sec. 331 (1) dealing with the special subject of user of highways by telephone companies must prevail over sec. 559 (4), which has to do with the more general subject of the erection and maintenance by electric light, power, telegraph and telephone companies of poles and wires, whether on highways or elsewhere within the limits of the municipality. Whatever restriction or limitation may be necessary to give full effect to sec. 331 (1) must be placed on sec. 559 (4).\nFor the purposes of this appeal I shall assume that, were it not for the effect of secs. 330 and 331 (1), the defendant municipal corporation might, under sec. 559 (4), have permitted or licensed a telephone company to erect and maintain its poles and wires upon highways within the municipality for an indefinite term without power of revocation. Whether that has in fact been attempted in the present instance is, of course, another question. But I am, with respect, of the opinion that secs. 330 and 331 (1) impliedly precluded the giving of such a consent or the granting of such an irrevocable permit or licence to be effective for more than a term of five years. It was, in my opinion, incompetent for the municipal corporation to do any act which would have the effect directly or indirectly either of creating a monopoly prohibited by section 330, or of divesting itself of, or curtailing the free exercise of, the power conferred on it by sec. 331 (1) of providing, by by-laws to be passed from time to time, for an exclusive right of user of its streets for the purpose of carrying on a telephone business during a period of five years being vested in some one telephone company.\nA municipal corporation cannot validly contract not to use discretionary powers committed to it for the public good. Ayr Harbour Trustees v. Oswald[10], at page 634, per Lord Blackburn; Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal Navigation v. Birmingham Canal Navigations[11], at pages 268, 278-9; Brice on Ultra Vires (3rd ed.), p. 111. Dillon on Municipal Corporations (1911), par. 245; Town of Eastview v. Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Ottawa[12]. This case does not fall within the line of exceptions to or qualifications on this salutary rule indicated in Stourcliffe Estates Co. v. Corporation of Bournemouth[13]. The municipal corporation in the exercise of its control over streets is a trustee for the public. It can sanction or licence the exercise of rights which derogate from the public right of user of the highways only in so far as it is given legislative authority to do so.\nThe necessary effect of granting for an indefinite period\u2014a period which might, therefore, endure throughout the existence of the licence\u2014an irrevocable licence or permit to use the streets of the municipality for the purpose of carrying on a telephone business would be to preclude the municipal council from granting to any other company at any future time such an exclusive right as sec. 331 (1) contemplates it may grant \u201cfrom time to time.\u201d The continued existence of such a licence is incompatible with the creation of such an exclusive right. In Hull Electric Co. v. Ottawa Electric Co.[14], cited at bar, the licence of the respondent was revocable.\nHaving regard to the practical necessity for a single telephone system in a municipality owing to the manifest and manifold disadvantages and inconveniences of duplication, the granting of such an irrevocable licence for an indefinite term would, in effect, be tantamount to the conferring of an exclusive right of equally indefinite duration upon the licensee. The legislature certainly did not contemplate that a municipality should be enabled, however indirectly, to tie itself up to one company as a donee of an exclusive right of indefinite duration. Its doing so would alike be contrary to the spirit, if not to the letter, of the prohibition of section 330 and would set at naught the limitation imposed by sec. 331 (1).\nUpon the grounds that the granting of an irrevocable consent or a licence or permit of indefinite duration, such as it had been held the respondent company obtained, would involve the municipal corporation divesting itself of the discretionary power conferred by sec. 331 (1), which it was the manifest policy of the legislature that it should retain in order to be in a position to exercise it from time to time in the interests of the municipality, and would, in effect, operate as an evasion, if not a direct violation, of section 330, I am of the opinion that such a consent, licence or permit, if the agreement here in question purported to grant it, would be ultra vires and therefore void.\nI would, accordingly, allow this appeal with costs here and in the Appellate Division and would restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014Without expressing any view on the power of a municipal corporation to make a perpetual grant to a telephone company I am of opinion that in this particular case the contract passed between the appellant and the respondent would not authorize the respondent to claim a perpetual franchise in the streets of Cobalt.\nThe telephone company had no right to put its poles upon the streets of the municipality without the consent of that municipality and on such terms for such times and at such rates and charges as were agreed upon with the municipal authorities. In this particular case, the time limit was five years and even during that time the privilege should be exclusive.\nThe contract was for that period of time only. The municipal corporation is now entitled, the five years having expired, to have the poles removed from the streets and the telephone company cannot claim a perpetual franchise.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs of this court and of the court below and the respondent\u2019s action should be dismissed.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014The question involved in this appeal is whether the appellant having, in 1912, made a contract with the respondent, whereby it consented to the latter exercising its powers by constructing, maintaining or operating its lines of telephone in the Town of Cobalt; and having agreed during the period of five years not to give to any other person, firm or company any licence or permission to use the highways, squares and public places of the town for the purpose of carrying on a telephone business, the respondent has the right to maintain its lines and poles in the said town indefinitely and in perpetuity.\nIt would, I must confess, require very cogent reasons to make me think that the parties ever contemplated that by this contract the Town of Cobalt had granted to the respondent a perpetual right to use its streets and public places for the purposes of its business. And notwithstanding the negative form of clause 7 preventing the town from granting to any other person or company during five years the right to use its highways, I would think, reading the contract as a whole, that it should be construed as having given to the respondent an exclusive right for five years to construct, maintain and operate its telephone lines, and that at the expiration of this term any right of the respondent to maintain its lines and poles in the public streets of the town came to an end unless a new agreement was made. I would not easily assume, in the absence of an express and clear covenant, that a perpetual right was granted, which would virtually deprive the town from exercising its full powers as to its streets and from making improvements or alterations therein.\nBut, if I am wrong in this construction of the agreement, I am of the opinion that in view of the terms of secs. 330 and 331 of the \u201cMunicipal Act\u201d of 1903 (3 Edw. VII. ch. 19), fully discussed by my brother Anglin, the appellant could not grant a perpetual right to the respondent to construct and maintain its telephone lines and poles in the Town of Cobalt. Had the appellant granted such a right\u2014and I think it has not\u2014it would have abdicated its power to\npass by-laws granting from time to time to any telephone company upon such terms and conditions as may be thought expedient, the exclusive right * * * for a period not exceeding five years at any one time to use streets and lanes in the municipality for the purpose of carrying on a telephone business.\nThat such abdication by a municipal corporation of its powers over and to its streets and highways would be contrary to law and against public policy does not seem to me open to doubt. Dubuc v. La Ville de Chicoutimi[15].\nIf the consent contained in the first clause of the respondent\u2019s contract with the appellant be severable from the exclusive right conferred on the respondent by the seventh clause, so that it would continue after the expiration of the exclusive period, I would think that it would amount to a mere licence or permission which would be revocable at any time after the five years.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs here and in the Appellate Division, and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nMASTEN J. (ad hoc).\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Province of Ontario, declaring that the respondent has the right in perpetuity to maintain and operate on the streets of Cobalt its telephone system, and enjoining the appellant corporation from interfering with such rights.\nConcurring as I do in the result at which other members of the court have arrived, I think the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nI base my conclusions on the view that the rights of the respondent company were acquired by agreement with the municipality of Cobalt and that such rights terminated either on the expiry of the five year term mentioned in clause seven of the agreement of June, 1912, or by an effective revocation by the appellant corporation of any licence granted under clause 1 of that agreement\u2014if such licence continued in force after the expiry of the five year term.\nI think that what is termed in popular language \u201cthe franchise\u201d granted by the agreement is to be defined in legal phraseology as a licence coupled with an interest and the duration of such licence, that is to say whether it was terminable or existed in perpetuity, is to be ascertained by an investigation of the intention of the parties and of their powers.\nNo express stipulation is made in the written agreement with regard to the continuance of the licence after the expiry of five years of exclusive enjoyment and consequently the intention of the parties as to its duration falls to be ascertained by a general consideration of all the terms of the agreement, the surrounding circumstances, the capacity of the parties and by an application of the principle that a grant in derogation of a public right is in case of doubt to be construed in favour of the public and against the licencee. I agree with the view expressed by Riddell J. in the court below, that clause 9 of the agreement (see Note \u201cA\u201d below) indicates that the parties intended an agreement for a certain term, that is a terminable agreement, not an agreement in perpetuity.\nNote A.\u2014Clause 9 above referred to is as follows:\u2014\nThat the said company shall not, during the term of said franchise, charge more than forty dollars per year for a business wall telephone and twenty dollars per year for a private wall telephone to said municipality.\nI also think that there is great force in the argument of the appellant corporation as stated in their factum in these words:\u2014\n* * * that the Letters Patent shew clearly that a consent once given is not an end of the matter particularly where, as here, no consent whatever was given before the lines were constructed. The first action by the town that is claimed to amount to a consent occurred in 1912. By the Letters Patent, the consent of the Municipal Council was a condition precedent and they also provide for \u201ccontrol\u201d by the municipality after consent is given. It could also impose and fix \u201cterms,\u201d \u201ctimes,\u201d \u201crates and charges,\u201d at any time after granting consent. Assuming, therefore, that the town consented to the respondent using its streets and originally imposed no limitation as to time and fixed no terms and rates, it could at a subsequent date limit the time and impose and fix terms and rates. Until the company fixed a time in a binding way its hands were free. The Letters Patent so provided.\nFor the terms of the charter see Note B.:\u2014\nNote B.\u2014To carry on within the District of Nipissing the general business of a telephone company and for that purpose to erect, construct, maintain and operate a line or lines of telephone along the sides of or across or under any public highways, roads, streets, bridges, waters, water courses or other places subject, however, to the consent to be first had and obtained, and to the control of the municipal councils having jurisdiction in the municipalities in which the company\u2019s lines may be constructed and operated and to such terms for such times and at such rates and charges as by such councils shall be granted, limited and fixed for such purposes respectively.\nWith respect to the surrounding circumstances, I note that in June, 1912, the respondent company had for some years been occupying the streets of the appellant corporation with their poles and wires. No consent had been given to such occupation and claim had been frequently put forward on behalf of the appellant corporation that the respondent company were trespassers. I think that clause 1 of the agreement was intended to operate as a fulfilment of the requirement of the charter as to municipal consent and an elimination of the claim which had theretofore been put forward that the respondent company had been or were then trespassers. Having thus cleared the ground, the next step taken by the parties was to provide by the combined operation of clauses 1 and 7 for an exclusive franchise definitely granted for a period of five years. It is possible that at the expiry of the five years of exclusive franchise the situation as contemplated by the parties was that the respondent company should still be in occupation of the streets, not as trespassers, but as licencees under the provisions of clause 1. In other words, that clause 1 remained in effect notwithstanding the expiry of the exclusive franchise granted for the first five years, but in that event I think that the right of the appellant corporation to fix the time of the duration of the licence came into operation and enabled it to effect a revocation, which it has done.\nWith respect to the capacity and power of the appellant corporation, I observe, without attempting to reach any positive conclusion, that it is manifest from the course of judicial decision in this case that grave doubts exist regarding the extent of the powers conferred on the municipality by the \u201cMunicipal Act.\u201d In ascertaining the intention of the parties respecting the duration of the franchise the presumption is that the appellant corporation intended to act within the powers which it clearly possessed and not that it intended to assume powers the right to which was at least doubtful.\nLastly, if doubt remain notwithstanding the consideration to which I have adverted, such doubt is to be resolved in favour of the public right and against the respondent company.\nI think that the principle of construction enunciated by Lord Stowell in The Rebeckah[16], at page 230, applies to this case.\nAll grants of the Crown are to be strictly construed against the grantee, contrary to the usual policy of the law in the consideration of grants; and upon this just ground that the prerogatives and rights and emoluments of the Crown being conferred upon it for great purposes and for the public use it shall not be intended that such pre- rogatives, rights and emoluments are diminished by any grant, beyond what such grant by necessary and unavoidable construction shall take away.\nI think that the principle so stated applies to a licence granted by a municipal corporation whereby the rights of the public in a highway are diminished. The principle was so applied by the Supreme Court of the United States in Knoxville Water Co. v. Knoxville[17], where Mr. Justice Harlan, in delivering the judgment of the court, after referring to the various cases where the above principle had been applied, said:\u2014\nIt is true that the cases to which we have referred involved in the main the construction of legislative enactments. But the principles they announce apply with full force to ordinances and contracts by municipal corporations in respect of matters that concern the public. The authorities are all agreed that a municipal corporation, when exerting its functions for the general good, is not to be shorn of its powers by mere implication. If by contract or otherwise it may, in particular circumstances, restrict the exercise of its public powers, the intention to do so must be manifested by words so clear as not to admit of two different or inconsistent meanings.\nThe same view was maintained in Blair v. City of Chicago[18].\nThis conclusion renders it unnecessary for me to consider the capacity or powers of the appellant corporation or of the respondent company, but in view of the discussion that has taken place in the courts below respecting the effect of the \u201cCompanies Act\u201d and the Letters Patent incorporating the respondent company, I ought perhaps to add one word.\nIt seems to me that when the agreement of June, 1912, was made the respondent company was governed by the \u201cCompanies Act\u201d of 1907 as amended in 1908 and 1910. In support of that view I refer to secs. 210 (c) and 211 (1) of the \u201cCompanies Act\u201d of 1907. I agree with the view that the ultimate source from which the powers of a company are derived is the legislature and in certain cases the Crown (Bonanza Creek Gold Mining Co. v. Rex[19]). I also agree that the legislature can clothe the company with rights as well as with powers and that in so doing it can act either directly or by delegating to the Governor-in-Council the necessary authority. I fail, however, to find in the provisions of the \u201cCompanies Act\u201d of 1907, as amended in 1908 and 1910, any warrant for holding that there has been delegated by the legislature to the Lieutenant-Governor in Council power to confer on a company objective rights as distinguished from subjective powers, or that this company was invested with such rights in 1912. I think that the \u201cpith and marrow\u201d of the \u201cCompanies Act\u201d of 1907 is the incorporation of a company\u2014the designation of its powers and the definition of the mutual rights of its shareholders inter se. In other words, the authority conferred upon the Governor-in-Council is, in my opinion, merely to bring into existence the entity known as the company and to endow it with certain powers, but I think the Act gives to the Governor-in-Council no authority as against other subjects of His Majesty to confer on the company so created objective rights of the kind here in question.\nDealing concretely with the facts of this case, I think that no actual immediate right, to occupy the streets of Cobalt was, or could be, conferred on the respondent company through the provisions of the \u201cCompanies Acts\u201d under which it was constituted, but that any such right must have been acquired from the appellant corporation. I agree on this point with the views expressed by the trial judge and by Kelly J. in the courts below. The appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Tilley, Johnston, Thomson & Parmenter.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F.L.

The Nova Scotia Mining Co. operated a reduction mill near the lake from 1910 to 1912 and deposited the tailings in the lake apparently without any authority, but no objection was made by the respondents. In 1912 the Nova Scotia Company made an assignment and the appellants became possessed of its assets and rights.

He also held that if it did a written description was still necessary.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada, while deciding that identification of the land by metes and bounds by reference to the plan would be sufficient, agreed with the Judge of the Exchequer Court, the Chief Justice dissenting, that it could not be so identified.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nHenry K.C. and Sangster for the appellant.\nJenks K.C. and McIlreith K.C. for the respondent.\n[1] 16 Ex.

This judgment was reversed by the Appellate Division and the action dismissed. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada:\u2014\nHeld, that as the \u201cFatal Accidents Act\u201d permits but one action to be brought for the entire damages sustained by the class entitled to compensation and the appeal must be from the judgment as a whole the full amount of $1,500 is in controversy in this appeal and the court has jurisdiction to entertain it.

L.R. 375; 41 D.L.R. 78), affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division[1] reversing the judgment on the trial[2].\nThe material facts sufficiently appear from the above head-note. Tilley K.C. and Logan for the appellant.\nTowers for the respondent The Township of Moore\nWeir for the respondent The Moore Municipal Telephone Association.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014I agree so fully with the reasons assigned by the learned trial judge for his judgment, and those reasons assigned by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario for not disturbing said judgment, that I need not repeat same here.\nIt occurred to me, however, in considering this appeal that the acts of the respondent township relative to the additional wires it put up and of which its reeve speaks as a witness, deserved, perhaps, more stress laid upon that phase of the case than has been directly done by either of said learned judges.\nThe reeve seems to put beyond doubt the fact that the lower wires were put there by the respondent township, as appears from the following:\u2014\nHIS LORDSHIP.\u2014The wires were put on before the accident, and after the Board had made their report? A.\u2014Yes, the wires were put on after the Railway Board had made their report. There was a space, with pins there for the six wires.\nHaving regard to the jurisprudence which requires, in many cases, as a condition precedent to liability therefor, notice of want of repair of a highway, to be brought home to the municipal authorities, and the fact that the original construction in question was put there by an independent corporation for whose mere negligence the township could not readily be held responsible, it relieves one, when having to pass upon the question raised herein, of much of the inherent difficulty of the case to be able to consider the party accused from the point of view of having been an actor, rather than as one having a mere possible authority to interfere and hence having only a remote duty, if any, to see that another having acquired a legal right to invade the highway, keeps strictly within its licence to do so.\nAnd that is still more satisfactory (for the judge at all events) when having to pass upon the argument presented to us that the township is relieved by reason of the order of the Ontario Railway and Municipal Board authorizing, under the \u201cOntario Telephone Act,\u201d the township to take over and impliedly to continue the works in question.\nTo that argument there is the answer that what the Board had to deal with obviously was the financial aspect and all incidental thereto. Its exercise of authority by the order relied on goes no further. It enabled the township to acquire the works and proceed to carry on the business.\nIn course of doing so the primary obligation resting upon it, was not to invade the right of everyone to enter upon the highway wherever and whenever he saw fit. No one, save others in the common exercise of the same right, has the slightest authority to minimize the free and untrammelled use of the highway for the purpose of carrying any load he chooses, unless and only so far as statutory authority has expressly limited said right, by conferring on others a privilege, or restricting the use thereof by someone else, by reason of anything the legislature sees fit to prohibit.\nNothing of the latter kind is in question herein. The only thing involved here is the exercise of a privilege; and the question is whether it has been so exercised according to law.\nClearly the burden of asserting and proving that such an exercise of privileged rights has been done within the law conferring it, rests upon him asserting it. And these principles are none the less obligatory because the township council happens to be acting in a dual capacity as it were of guardian of the public highway and of the public who travel thereon, and at the same time of a trustee for others interested in claiming the exercise of the privilege.\nI think the township failed absolutely in proving any such legal exercise of privilege and did an illegal act when it put on those wires constituting the lowering of the head-room under which deceased had to drive.\nThe cross-bar being there may have been a temptation which the careless man directing the placing of the wires could not resist, but did not in law enlarge the privilege.\nIf there is no rule laid down in the statutes conferring such a privilege, as to the correct means of its exercise, the law, of course, will imply that a reasonable regard for the rights of others must be observed. That was wholly neglected by him who was too stupid or too careless to consider what was necessary to preserve for him owning the field and entering it at the point in question his right of access to the highway.\nI cannot understand why a man should blind himself with such sophistries as put forward by one of the witnesses testifying to the mode of construction adopted, of one height of head room for a gate at a farm yard and another for that at a field liable to have as high loads carried in and out.\nCuriously enough he recognized that a similar gate in same vicinity was furnished with a higher set of poles.\nSo much for the aspect of the matter if free from regulations having force by statute. When we apply these there does not seem to have been a vestige of right left in the township for adding to the wires already on as it did after the regulation of 20th April, 1914, which obliterated all former regulations of a like kind and established a standard which it was obligatory upon the township to have observed.\nTrue it points to the provision in section 26 of the \u201cTelephone Act\u201d as if that constituted all prior erections valid. It does nothing of the kind as I read it. It preserves the rights of those erected, but of course, presupposes them to have been legally erected.\nIf my view, as above set out, is correct then this erection did not fall within the reservation and all done there must fall within the regulation.\nThe learned trial judge seemed troubled with the want of evidence of the exact date of the latest work. I respectfully submit that it was for those claiming the privilege to have proven they acted within and by virtue of it.\nHolding as I do the erection illegal the argument presented in support of a defence of contributory negligence looks very much as if a ruffian had slapped in the face a man driving a load to market and thereby led to the team running away and killing the man, he could be excused from paying damages so resulting by shewing that the load was not built in the best way possible.\nIndeed, some of the arguments elaborately put forward as to the alleged contributory negligence are amusing. Because the head-room was not ample, there should have been a wagon with higher wheels to render it less ample; or a culvert constructed which, of certainty, would involve an approach also lessening the head-room, or perhaps both; and, in short, deceased should not have been there; all of which seem ill-fitted to this case.\nI have no doubt of the liability of the township and am only sorry I cannot see my way to deal with the quest on of giving relief over as desired so that the burden fall on those for whom the township were trustees and relieve the ratepayers not concerned.\nBut on this record, and having regard to the course of events at the trial, the only thing open to this court is to declare that the judgment should be without prejudice to that right if it can be established.\nI, therefore, express no opinion as to such right either one way or another.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs of appellant but not of respondent here and below as against the township.\nI have some doubt if the extra costs created by adding said co-defendant should not be disallowed appellant.\nANGLIN J.\u2014At the opening of the argument of this appeal a question of jurisdiction was raised by the court. While the judgment entered in the trial court was for $1,500, that sum was apportioned under sec. 4 (1) of R.S.O. ch. 151, $500 to the plaintiff William Magill, and $1,000 to the plaintiff Louisa Magill. We held in the recent case of L\u2019Autorit\u00e9, Ltd. v. Ibbotson[3], that where eleven plaintiffs joined in one action alleging injury by the same libel published in the defendant\u2019s newspaper and each claiming $2,000 damages, an appeal to this court from the Court of Review by the defendant could not be entertained, the minimum appealable amount from that court being $5,000. There, however, each plaintiff had a distinct cause of action; each could have brought a separate action. There might be defences as to one or more which did not exist as to others. There might be an appeal as to only one of the plaintiffs or a separate appeal as to each of several or of all of them. Therefore as to each plaintiff the matter in controversy on the appeal was his own right to recover damages for the injury done to himself. The court regarded the action as a joinder of several actions.\nHere the right of action is purely statutory (R.S.O. ch. 151, sec. 3). The statute gives but one action (sec. 6) to be brought by the personal representative, or, on his default (sec. 8), by one or more of the relatives of the class for whose benefit it may be maintained. The cause of action is single; it is for the entire damages sustained by the whole class in whose behalf the statute provides that compensation may be recovered. Either of the present plaintiffs might have maintained this action without joining the other and would have recovered the whole amount to which both have been held entitled. Before that amount is distributed any costs not recovered from the defendants may be deducted from it (sec. 4 (1)). The appeal to a divisional court was necessarily from the judgment as a whole. The appeal to this court is to restore that judgment as a whole, and it is the whole amount of it, $1,500, that is \u201cthe matter in controversy on the appeal\u201d (\u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d sec. 48 (c)). The court was unanimously of this opinion and jurisdiction to hear the appeal was, therefore, maintained.\nThe material facts sufficiently appear in the reports of the judgments of the learned trial judge and of the Appellate Division[4]. I assume, without so deciding, that there was not statutory authority for placing the telephone wires just as they were, such as would bring this case within the principle of the decision in Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Roy[5]. Having regard to the conflicting views as to the proper inferences to be drawn from the proven facts, as to which there is little, if any, dispute, I have thought it necessary to study and analyze with care all the evidence in the record. I shall, however, content myself with stating the conclusions to which it has led me. Unless in exceptional cases no good purpose is served, in my opinion, by setting out at length the considerations on which inferences of fact are based in an ultimate court of appeal. No question of credibility being involved, our right, if not our duty, to review the inferences drawn by the courts below is unquestionable. Dominion Trust Co. v. New York Life Ins. Co.[6]\nBefore reversing the judgment appealed from, however, we should be satisfied that it is erroneous. I am not so satisfied. On the contrary, my study of the evidence has left me in absolute uncertainty as to whether the presence of the telephone wires at the gateway contributed at all to the upsetting of the load of hay which resulted in the death of James Magill. While it is quite possible that it did, having regard to all the circumstances, it seems to me more likely that it did not\u2014that, if the wagon, loaded as it was, had been driven in the same course, the same results would probably have ensued had there been no wires to have been passed under. Solely on this ground and without finding anything in the nature of a voluntary assumption of risk or contributory negligence on the part of the deceased and also without requiring that it should be established that the negligence of the defendants was the sole cause of the occurrence which resulted in James Magill\u2019s death, I would dismiss this appeal\u2014with costs if demanded.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014In my opinion this appeal should be allowed.\nThe learned trial judge found as a fact that the telephone wires in question, which were only 13 feet 9 inches above the ground, were so placed on the highway as to form an obstruction and interfere with the driver on the top of an ordinary load of hay in driving out of the field on to the highway. He also found that the position of the wires causing the deceased to stoop or to crouch down in passing under them was the proximate cause of the horses getting from under that control which was necessary to procure the safe passage of the load. He further found that the deceased was not guilty of contributory negligence.\nThe Appellate Division reversed the judgment, Sir William Meredith C.J. dissenting, the main reason, as I read the opinion of Mr. Justice Hodgins, being that while the learned trial judge was entitled to draw the inference that the obstruction resulting from the wires, having caused the driver to stoop or crouch down, was the proximate cause of the horses getting out of control, other inferences could be made, so that the matter was left in doubt and the present appellants could not succeed.\nI think, with deference, that the inference drawn by the learned trial judge was a very reasonable one in view of the evidence of the boy Hird, who was on the top of the load with the deceased. There was a clearance of only 3 feet 9 inches between the top of the load and the wires, of which there were six on the lower cross bar, so that the driver would have to stoop and in so doing would be unable, while crossing a considerable space, to control his horses. Under these circumstances, I cannot say that the findings of fact of the trial judge are clearly wrong.\nI also approve of the disposition of the case by the learned trial judge with regard to the respondent, The Moore Municipal Telephone Association.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here and in the Appellate Division and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nMASTEN J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: John R.

(dissenting).\u2014The authority given by the respondent in its telegram of 21st December, 1916, confirmed by its letter of 22nd December, 1916, would seem to confer ample authority on the alleged agents to make an agreement for a lease for five years subject to submission to the respondent of the tenders for repairs and improvements.\nPursuant thereto the agents on 27th January, 1917, and 30th January, 1917, reported all that seemed required as condition precedent and named appellant as proposed tenant.\nTo this respondent answered by a telegram on 5th February, 1917, as follows:\n290 Garry Street, Feb. 5, 1917.\nRomeril, Fowlie & Co.,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nWhat rental is Mr. Anderson prepared to pay for ground floor? Not given in your letter.\nMortgage Company of Canada.\nTo this wherein the name of the proposed tenant was accidentally confused with that of the man tendering for the work to be done, the following reply was sent by the agents:\u2014\nPrince Albert, Sask., Feb. 5th, 1917\nMortgage Company of Canada,\n290 Garry Street,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nGround floor one hundred month not including heat. Tenant John Mitchell, rush lease Avenue.\n(Sgd.) Romeril, Fowlie & Co.\nOn the 8th February, 1917, the appellant and the said agents of respondent agreed as evidenced by the following receipt:\u2014\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nReceived from Mr. John D. Mitchell the sum of Fifty Dollars, being deposit on rental of St. Regis ground floor, building taken at $100.00 per mo., for a term of five years to start from completion of repairs or when handed over to Mitchell.\n$50.00. Romeril, Fowlie & Co.,\nA. Romeril. The date is not given but that is supplied by the cheque of the appellant shewn to have been given at same time.\nThis documentary evidence read in light of the surrounding facts and circumstances leaves no doubt in my mind of a concluded contract sufficient to meet the requirements of the Statute of Frauds.\nThe date of the beginning of the term was made certain within the recognized maxim id certum est quod certum reddi potest.\nCases of this nature requiring certainty of the term of a lease are curiously enough those which the learned author of Brooms Legal Maxims puts in the foreground of his commentary on this maxim and cites in 7th ed., p. 465, as illustrative of the meaning of the maxim.\nThe only question raised by the Court of Appeal seems to have been the effect to be given the concluding words of the receipt \"or when handed over to Mitchell\" which that court seems to have read as casting a doubt upon the certainty of meaning in the receipt.\nI feel no difficulty in regard thereto for obviously there is nothing more implied than if there had been added to the preceding language a stipulation that in the event of the parties agreeing on another date that might by consent be substituted for the operative words already used, which in themselves were binding.\nThese words on which stress is laid are clearly, as counsel for appellant suggests, mere surplusage.\nThe bargain thus closed could not be affected by the later correspondence between respondent and its agents, which tried to introduce a term, previously unthought, of giving the right to the respondent to terminate by a three months' notice the five years' lease it was bound to give.\nNor could the doubt suggested later of the repairs and improvements contemplated throughout by the earlier correspondence being likely to exceed the estimate, affect the contract.\nAny possible difficulty on that score was, as matter of fair dealing, removed by the offer of appellant to bear the extra expense.\nThe contract if need be might be read as one to spend at least the sum named in such repairs, alterations, or improvements and thus remove any difficulty of non-compliance with the Statute of Frauds which might in law attach to the verbal offer of the appellant to bear such extra expense.\nThe question of the agents signing their own name instead of the respondent's was not very seriously pressed in argument, but is amply answered by the authorities cited in Leake on Contracts, 4th ed., 189: and in Fry on Specific Performance, 4th ed., 236: and see also the case of Rosenbaum v. Belson[2], and the case of Fred Drughorn Limited v. Rederi Aktiebolaget Transatlantic[3].\nI do not think we are bound to exercise our mental ingenuity to find excuses for any one pursuing the course respondent saw fit to pursue.\nThe appellant if confined to a claim for specific performance might be sufficiently met by some of these subterfuges but I submit it had broken a pretty plain obvious agreement and should pay the damages thereby suffered.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored with costs here and below.\nDuff J.\u2014The contract, if there was one, between the appellant and the respondent company was that a certain building, of which the respondent company was the proprietor, should be altered in certain respects; and that on the date of the completion of the alterations the appellant should receive and accept a lease of part of it for five years, subject to determination on three months' notice. This contract as a whole would be a contract within the fourth section of the Statute of Frauds, the agreement to make the changes being in part consideration for the undertaking by the appellant to accept the lease.\nI am inclined to think that the provision as to determination upon notice is not sufficiently evidenced in writing, but assuming it to be so, it is quite evident that it is at least doubtful whether the respondent company's agents had authority to undertake to effect alterations at a cost greater than $800.00, and there is no doubt that when it was discovered that the cost of the projected alterations would exceed this figure both the appellant and the company's agents proceeded to negotiate afresh, treating the whole matter as at large. An understanding between them was reached, but the conclusion I have arrived at, after carefully reading the statement of the 15th of February and the letters of the 20th and 24th of the same month, is that there is too much indefiniteness in the expressions used in relation to the subject of alterations to enable one to say that the beginning of the contemplated term is ascertained by reference to the date of the \"completion of repairs\" within the meaning of the memorandum of February 20th.\nThe appear should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Duff.\nBrodeur J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an action for specific performance of an agreement for a lease or for damages The property in question is on the ground floor of a property known as the St. Regis Hotel in the Town of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. It had been for a few years without any tenant and was probably in a very dilapidated condition. The respondent company was the owner of it and as its office is in Winnipeg it had instructed the firm of Romeril, Fowlie & Co., of Prince Albert, to rent the ground floor of the building, the company undertaking to make some repairs not to exceed $1,000.00, and they wrote them on the 22nd of December, 1916, that they would \"rent the ground floor at $100.00, per month, we to do the repairing to the plumbing and heating, and any other repairs that are absolutely necessary.\"\nOn the 8th of February, those agents agreed with the appellant to rent that property and gave him the following receipt:\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nReceived from Mr. John D. Mitchell the sum of Fifty Dollars being deposit on rental of St. Regis ground floor, building taken at $100.00, per mo., for a term of five years to start from completion of repairs or when handed over to Mitchell.\n$50.00. Romeril, Fowlie & Co.,\nA. Romeril.\nIt appears that the appellant intended to carry on on those premises a restaurant and that a man named Maclean, who was keeping a restaurant in the vicinity, did not like the idea of having a competitor in his neighbourhood and tried to obtain the lease for himself, offering to pay part of the repairs and also to give a larger rent.\nThose new offers evidently tempted the respondent company; and, disregarding the most elementary principles of honesty, it accepted the proposition to lease the property to Maclean.\nBeing sued by Mitchell for specific performance or for damages, it was condemned by the trial judge to pay a sum of $550.00 in damages. The Court of Appeal[4], reversed that judgment on the ground that the agreement was not a concluded agreement which would satisfy the Statute of Frauds and that the receipt given by the real estate agents did not specify the date at which the lease would start.\nThe respondent company pleaded also that the agents had no authority to give the receipt which they had given to the appellant; but the two courts below decided against it in that respect and this point was not very strongly pressed at the argument. There is no doubt that Romeril, Fowlie & Co. were the agents of the respondent company, that they had been instructed to lease the property in question for a sum of $100.00 per month and that they had agreed to do some repairs and alterations in order to render the property habitable; and there is nothing in the receipt which would induce one to question the authority of the agents. It must be stated to credit of the agents that they had been urging upon the respondents to carry on their agreement with Mitchell; but evidently the temptation of having a larger sum of money was too strong for the honesty of the company.\nThere is no doubt that it is essential to the validity of a lease that it shall appear on what day the term is to commence. There must be a certain beginning: otherwise it would not be a perfect lease, and in a contract for lease, in order to satisfy the Statute of Frauds, the term of commencement must be shewn. Marshall v. Berridge[5].\nBut the commencement of the term may be collected from the memorandum or by reference to some of their writings. Then the question comes up whether we can collect from the language of the agreement at what date the lease was to commence.\nIn the case of Oxford v. Provand[6], it was decided that where a certain amount of rental has to be paid from the date at which a building should be completed that those terms expressed with sufficient clearness the intention of the parties to bind themselves from the time it was made to do the several acts stipulated. Mr. Justice Lamont in the Court of Appeal admitted that, if the agreement provided simply that the term should commence when the repairs should be completed, the case of Oxford v. Provand6, would apply; but that by inserting in the receipt given by Romeril, Fowlie & Co. an alternative time for the beginning of the term it was impossible to hold that the commencement is fixed or can with reasonable certainty be concluded from the document.\nThe lease stated that the term was to start from the completion of the repairs or when the building was handed over to Mitchell. I would construe this language as meaning that the lease shall commence at the termination of the repairs; but if by a new agreement between the parties the property was handed over before or after the repairs were complete, in such a case the lease would start from the latter date. But I maintain that the primary agreement of the parties was that the rent should start from the date at which the repairs would be complete and that there is no reason then to distinguish the present case from the case of Oxford v. Provand6.\nIn those circumstances, I have come to the conclusion that the judgment of the trial judge should be restored and the appeal allowed with costs of this court and of the court below. Mignault J.\u2014The appellant sues for specific performance, or, in the alternative, for damages on a contract of lease which he alleges he made with the respondent of certain premises in the City of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. The agents of the respondent for renting these premises were Messrs. Romeril, Fowlie & Co., and assuming that the latter did rent the premises to the appellant, there is a question whether the agents did not exceed their authority by not stipulating the right of cancellation on giving three months' notice. I think however that for the decision of this case it will suffice to determine whether or not the writing on which the appellant relies satisfies the requirements of the Statute of Frauds. This writing is in the following terms:\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nReceived from Mr. John D. Mitchell the sum of Fifty Dollars, being deposit on rental of St. Regis ground floor, building taken at $100.00 per mo., for a term of five years to start from completion of repairs or when handed over to Mitchell.\n$50.00. Romeril, Fowlie & Co.,\nA. Romeril.\nThe rule to be applied has been authoritatively stated as follows:\nIt is essential to the validity of a lease that it shall appear either in express terms or by reference to some writing which would make it certain, or by reasonable inference from the language used, on what day the term is to commence. There must be a certain beginning and a certain ending, otherwise it is not a perfect lease, and a contract for a lease must, in order to satisfy the Statute of Frauds, contain those elements. Marshall v. Berridge[7], at p. 244.\nMeasured by this rule, the receipt relied on by the appellant evidently fails to satisfy the requirements of the Statute of Frauds. I doubt whether the parties ever intended it to be a memorandum witnessing a contract, or anything more than a receipt for the money paid by the appellant. Even if it can be looked on as a memorandum it is impossible to determine from it the time of beginning of the lease. The term of five years is stated\nto start from completion of repairs or when handed over to Mitchell.\nThese repairs are not described, nor is it said who is to make them. It is true that the respondent, in correspondence with the agents, expressed its willingness to spend on repairs the sum of $800.00, and that the agents, but only after the date of the receipt, sent it an estimate specifying certain repairs and improvements amounting to $1,122.00. When the respondent demurred at paying more than $800.00, the appellant says that he agreed to pay the excess in cost, over and above the $800.00, which would shew that the matter had not been finally closed by the receipt which imposed on him no such obligation.\nBut looking at this receipt, the time of commencement of the lease is not stated nor can it be inferred from its language. Could Mitchell be forced to take possession and pay rental before the repairs were completed? Or when these repairs, and they had not then been specified, were made, and a delay ensued before the premises were handed over to Mitchell, from which of the two events, the completion of the repairs or the handing over of the premises, would the five year lease begin? The receipt is too vague to permit any answer being given to these questions, and consequently it cannot be taken as complying with the Statute of Frauds.\nThe appellant relies on the decision of the Privy Council in Oxford v. Provand[8], but I think that this decision is clearly distinguishable from the present case. In Oxford v. Provand8, the Privy Council as a court of equity considered the surrounding circumstances and the conduct of the parties in dealing with the property comprised in an agreement vague in its language, in the interval between the making of the agreement and the commencement of a suit for its enforcement. The tenant, who attacked the memorandum, had before the suit taken possession and had sub-rented a part of the buildings referred to in the agreement as having to be constructed, or the building of which had then to be completed. I would have had no hesitation in the present case had the appellant been put in possession of the premises referred to in the receipt. But such was not the case and the receipt stands alone and without the aid of any surrounding circumstances or of any conduct of the parties in dealing with the property that can shew a certain time at which the term of the lease would begin.\nAlthough I cannot think that the respondent acted in the matter as the rules of fair dealing required, still there is no escape from the conclusion that in law the appellant cannot succeed in this appeal, which must in my opinion be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Halliday & Davis.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lindsay & Mudie.\n[1] 11 Sask.

[1903] ch. 159 \"An Act respecting Sewers and Marsh Lands\" to the conditions existing in Albert County as disclosed in the above head-note Mr. Justice White who tried the case decided all the material issues in favour of the respondent and his judgment was affirmed by the Appeal Division (1) Crockett J. dissenting. Only one of these issues was dealt with by the Supreme Court of Canada on this appeal, namely, whether or not the sole Commissioner of Sewers who remained in office after one of the three elected had refused to act and another had tendered his resignation which was accepted, could fix a rate for payment by the districts of the parish of the cost of work done by the board.\nMr. Justice Crockett based his dissent from the judgment of the Appeal Division on the incapacity of the sole remaining commissioner to make the rate notwithstanding the fact that it was done in obedience to a writ of mandamus ordering the \"Commissioners of Sewers\" to levy the assessment. The majority of the judges in the Supreme Court of Canada, in reversing the judgment appealed against, contented themselves with adopting the reasoning of this dissenting opinion, Mr. Justice Anglin adding the view ascribed to him in the head-note. The appeal was allowed with costs.\nJ. B. M. Baxter K.C. appeared for the appellants and Teed K.C. for the respondent.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: M. B. Dixon.\nSolicitors for the respondent: M. & J. Teed.\n[1] 45 N.B. Rep. 90.\n"}
