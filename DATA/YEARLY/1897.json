Sampson\nCollection\nSupreme Court Judgments\nDate\n1897-01-25\nReport\n(1897) 26 SCR 707\nJudges\nGwynne, John Wellington\nOn appeal from\nOntario\nSubjects\nAppeal\nDecision Content\nSupreme Court of Canada\nMartin v. Sampson, 26 S.C.R. 707\nDate: 1897-01-25\nThomas B. Martin (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nWilliam Sampson and H.R. Angus (Defendants) Respondents.\n1897: January 15, 25.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nAppeal\u2014Time limit\u2014Commencement of\u2014Pronouncing or entry of judgment\u2014Security\u2014Extension of time\u2014R.S.C. c.135, ss. 40, 42, 46.\nOn the trial of an action to set aside a chattel mortgage the plaintiff obtained a declaration that the mortgage was void and an order setting it aside without costs. This decision was reversed on appeal and the action dismissed, with costs both in the Court of Appeal and in the court below, by a judgment pronounced on the seventh of November, 1895. The minutes of judgment were not settled until some days afterwards, and at the time of the settlement the draft minutes were altered by the Registrar of the Court of Appeal refusing costs to one of the respondents and changing a direction therein as to the payment over of funds on deposit abiding the decision of the suit.\nAn application was made to the Registrar of the Supreme Court, sitting as judge in chambers, more than sixty days after the judgment was pronounced, for approval of security under sec. 46 of the S. & E.C. Act:\nHeld, per Gwynne J. affirming the decision of the Registrar, that nothing substantial remained to be settled by the minutes so as to take the case out of the general rule that the time for appealing runs from the pronouncing of the judgment, and the application was too late. MOTION by way of an appeal from the decision of the Registrar sitting as Judge in Chambers dismissing an application made for approval of security under section 46 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act.\nThe action was brought by an assignee for the benefit of creditors to set aside a chattel mortgage, which was alleged to be void on the ground that the affidavit of bona fides was incorrect and insufficient under the statute. During the pendency of the action, by consent of the parties, the property mortgaged was sold and the proceeds deposited in the Bank of Hamilton to abide the final judgment. In the trial court the judge held that the chattel mortgage was void, and directed that it should be set aside without costs. An appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario by the mortgagee was allowed and the action dismissed with costs both in appeal and in the court below. This judgment was rendered on the 7th November, 1895, and the plaintiff did not move for approval of security for costs to be given on an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada until the 8th January, 1896, when he made an application to that effect before Mr. Justice Osler, one of the judges of the Court of Appeal for Ontario. Assuming that the time for bringing the appeal, as limited by section 40 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, began to run from the pronouncing of the judgment, the application was too late, but the plaintiff contended that the time ran from the entry of the judgment and not from the date when it was pronounced, and consequently that his application was within the prescribed time.\nThe facts upon which the plaintiff\u2019s contention was based, appeared from affidavits filed to be as follows:\u2014After the rendering of the judgment on the 7th November, 1895, the solicitors for the appellant, (the mortgagee), served the usual notice for settlement of the minutes of the judgment and in their draft minutes as served included a direction that costs should be paid both to the appellant and the respondent the mortgagor (he having been joined in the action and named with the mortgagee, the appellant, as a defendant), but the plaintiff contended that although named as a respondent in the appeal, the mortgagor was never actually a party to the appeal and was not represented by counsel nor heard upon the appeal. The draft minutes also contained a direction that the Bank of Hamilton should pay over the funds on deposit there to the defendant, the mortgagee. Upon the settlement of the minutes the Registrar of the Court of Appeal held that the mortgagor had not been a party to the appeal and was not entitled to costs on appeal, but to verify the minute in his own book he undertook to refer to the Chancellor\u2019s note book in order to ascertain whether in fact the mortgagor had been present or represented by counsel, and his minute having been confirmed by the Chancellor\u2019s note of the case, he decided that the mortgagor was not entitled to any costs of appeal. He also refused to make the direction as to payment by the bank as drafted by the solicitors, as the bank was not a party, but he altered the draft minutes by making the provision in this respect to read as a declaration that the defendant, mortgagee, was entitled to the moneys on deposit. No objection was taken by either side to this alteration, nor to the alteration of the draft minutes respecting payment of costs to the mortgagor, and the minutes were not spoken to before either a judge or the court, but the plaintiff on the application to be allowed to give security which he made to the judge of the Court of Appeal, (Osler J.) contended that as the subject-matter of these alterations was substantial, and that as until the minutes were finally settled and entered the plaintiff could not know exactly from what he had to appeal, therefore under the Supreme Court decisions on the subject the time should run only from the entry of the judgment, and that in any event, if the judge held that the time ran from the pronouncing of the judgment he ought to extend the time under the provisions of the 42nd section of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act.\nAfter conferring with Maclennan J., Osler J. held that the time ran from the date when the judgment was pronounced and that the application was too late, and also refused to extend the time.\nThe plaintiff, appellant, then made application to the Registrar of the Supreme Court upon the same grounds, and the Registrar having heard counsel came to the same conclusion as Mr. Justice Osler as to the application having been made too late, which was the only question before him, there being no power in the Supreme Court or a judge of that court to enlarge the time for appealing.\nGWYNNE J. on appeal from the Registrar, confirmed his decision with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\nGeorge Kidd for the appellant.\nHamilton Cassels for the respondents.\n",

The material facts of the case are as follows:\u2014 In February 1895 the plaintiff Kearney, a wholesale tea merchant of Montreal, came to Quebec with a job lot of teas which the defendant Letellier agreed to buy, the plaintiff producing samples of the tea in tin boxes on which the price of each grade was marked. The price was to be paid by Letellier partly in wine and the balance by acceptances at 6, 8, 10 and 12 months. In March, 1895, the parties exchanged invoices, that of the plaintiff charging for the tea a uniform rate of 16 cents per pound, the defendant's being for the wine at the price agreed upon. In April part of the tea was shipped to the defendant and the balance in July in which month also the plaintiff received and stored the wine.\nThe defendant in April accepted three drafts on account of the price of the tea and a fourth for the balance claimed by the plaintiff was drawn on him after the last shipment of the tea, in August, which he refused to accept claiming that the amount was in excess of the balance actually due and alleging, for the first time, that he bought the tea at the several prices marked on the samples produced by the plaintiff when the bargain was made and not at one rate of 16 cents per pound for the lot. The plaintiff then brought an action to compel acceptance of the last draft, or, in default, for payment of the amount, and also for the value of 25 hogsheads of the wine, which he claimed was not of the quality agreed upon, and the charges thereon. At the enqu\u00eate the plaintiff supported his own evidence as to the price being 16 cents per pound by the production of an invoice, sent to the defendant before the tea was delivered and kept by him some five months without objection, in which that price was charged. As against this there was the evidence of the defendant, who swore that the sample price was agreed upon, his son who swore that that the tea was first offered to him at the prices marked on the samples and the referred the matter to his father, and a broker who was present when the bargain was made but who was not very positive as to the terms as appears from the following extracts from his testimony:\u2014\nQ. What did you do with the samples there in the hotel? A. Well, we looked at them, and I put the prices and quantities on them.\nQ. Then, you went with Mr. Kearney to Mr. Letellier's? A. No, after that we went to the office with the teas with the samples. I don't know whether we brought the samples down to the office, but eventually they got to the office.\nQ. Did you go with Mr. Kearney to Mr. Letellier's? A. I am not sure whether we went over alone or went over together; however we eventually got there.\nQ. Will you state what was the price agreed upon for the tea? A. I understood it to be the prices marked upon the samples.\nQ. As a matter of fact, is that the price they were sold for? A. I think so.\nQ. State whether after the sale was made, after the contract was completed, you said anything to Mr. Letellier about the price of the tea in the presence of Mr. Kearney? A. I think I said \u201clet there be no mistake about this \" and I wrote the terms down on a piece of paper.\nQ. What terms? A. The time at which they were to be paid.\nQ. Did you write the price on that piece of paper? A. No.\nQ. Did you say anything about the price? A. There was a question about sixteen cents.\nQ. That was a term of the bargain? A. I don't think so; I think that the idea was that these teas at these prices would come to sixteen cents. It appears they have not.\nI guess he may have said it (that it would average sixteen cents) at Mr. Letellier's. There was so much talk about it I don't exactly remember.\nQ. Can you remember exactly what he said about sixteen cents? A. No, I cannot.\nQ. Did you mention at all and let there be no mistake did you mention at all what was the price the tea was sold for? A. I don't think so.\nQ. Did he ask you for the price? A. He must have done so. I left the samples and put the prices on there. I left the samples with Mr. Letellier. Speaking of the sale of teas by sample the witness\nSays:\nMost of the Quebec people buy them in that way. Q. On what? On appearance? A. On appearance to see if they suit them. Q. And they can tell by appearance if they suit them? A. I presume so, if they buy them.\nQ. Will you tell us exactly what took place at the time of the purchase of those teas between Mr Letellier and Mr. Kearney? A. I did tell you. Q. Repeat it over again in detail? A. When? Q. All that took place at the time the bargain was made? A. No, I cannot. I will undertake to swear that according to the way I understood it, the prices marked on the samples would average about sixteen cents the prices marked on the samples I certainly understood the sale to be. Q. You have no doubt about that? A. According to my way of thinking I have no doubt whatever.\nQ. Did you at that time (in a conversation within ten days before) tell him, (Mr. Kearney), you did not recollect whether it was for sixteen cents a pound or the prices marked on the samples? A. I may have said so.\nMr. Justice Andrews, who tried the case stated that he could not give credence to the evidence of the broker and he held that the defendant should pay at the rate of sixteen cents basing his decision on the retention by the defendant of the invoice without objection. He also held the plaintiff liable to pay for the wine as he had retained it for a long time without complaint and had credited it to defendant in the invoice for the tea. The plaintiff did not appeal from this judgment. The defendant appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench where the judgment against him was reversed, the court holding that though the acceptance of the invoice without objection afforded a presumption against the defendant, such presumption was completely rebutted by the evidence that the price of the tea was that stated on the samples.\nThe plaintiff then brought the present appeal to this court.\nFitzpatrick Q. C. for the appellant.\nLanguedoc Q.C. and Dorion for the respondent. The judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nGIROUARD J.\u2014La bonne foi, qui doit pr\u00e9sider aux\nOp\u00e9rations d'un n\u00e9gociant, imposant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessite d'une protestation dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable, s'il n'\u00e9tait pas satisfait de la facture de l'appelant. Non seulement il garde le silence, mais il en confirme la teneur en l'ex\u00e9cutant, c'estradier en envoyant, ses traites pour des montants tellement rapproch\u00e9s de la facture qu'il \u00e9tait raisonnable de supposer qu'elle \u00e9tait accept\u00e9e. Ce n'est qu'apr\u00e8s cinq mois, lorsque le dernier lot des marchandises lui est exp\u00e9di\u00e9, qu'il communique \u00e0 l'appelant ses objections au prix indiqu\u00e9. C'\u00e9tait trop tard. Par son silence et sa conduite l'intim\u00e9 avait \u00e9lev\u00e9 contre lui une pr\u00e9somption de fait que la facture \u00e9tait correcte conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 1242 du Code Civil, pr\u00e9somption qui militera contre lui tant qu'elle ne sera pas repouss\u00e9e par une preuve contraire. Or cette preuve n'existe pas. Quatre t\u00e9moins out \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus sur le fait du prix du th\u00e9. L'appelant et l'intim\u00e9 se contredisent carr\u00e9ment. Le fils de l'intim\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent lorsque la vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclue. Le t\u00e9moignage du courtier Baldwin est si vague et incertain que, selon moi, il est sans valeur. L'appelant doit donc avoir jugement selon la facture.\nCette pr\u00e9somption a re\u00e7u la sanction des plus hautes autorit\u00e9s fran\u00e7aises en droit commercial. Gilbert sur Sirey, art. 109 du Code de Commerce, n. 17, dit: \u201cL\u2019acheteur qui garde la facture que lui envoie le vendeur, l'accepte par cela m\u00eame.\" Il cite Pardessus. no. 248; D\u00e9samarre et Le Poitevin, t. 1er n. 158; Mass\u00e9, t. 4 no. 2445; Voir aussi dans le m\u00eame sens, Rivi\u00e8re, p, 258; Boistel, p. 302; B\u00e9darrides Achats et Ventes, nos. 820 et suivants. Namur, t. ler, p. 376, observe que \" lorsqu'une facture contient des \u00e9nonciations contraires \u00e0 la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 par exemple relativement \u00e0 l'indication du lieu de paie ment, l'acheteur doit s'empresser de r\u00e9clamer, parce qu'une facture accept\u00e9e sans protestation fait preuve contre lui Il cite un arr\u00eat de Bruxelles du 13 octobre 1827, qui jugea ainsi. B\u00e9darrides nos. 320 et 322, en cite plusieurs autres dans le m\u00eame sens; Colmar, 18 juillet 1832; Nancy, 5 juillet 1837, et Aix, 24juin 1842; Puis, au no. 323, il conclut:\nDonc, d\u00e8s qu'elle (la facture) arrive en ses mains, l'acheteur est en demeure, et par cons\u00e9quent dans la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de s'expliquer, de con tr\u00f4ler les pr\u00e9tentions du vendeur d'en \u00e9tablir l'exactitude. En cons\u00e9quence, l'acceptation pure et simple de Ia facture, contrairement \u00e0 cet int\u00e9r\u00eat ne peut \u00eatre que la reconnaissance de la sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 des conditions qu'elle \u00e9nonce, reconnaissance dont le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice, d\u00e9sormais acquis au vendeur, ne saurait lui \u00eatre enlev\u00e9 par la pr\u00e9tention lut\u00e9 rieur de se refuser \u00e0 la consommation du march\u00e9.\nPuis, il ajoute au no. 325:\nLa cour de Bordeaux consacrait le principe et l'appliquait m\u00eame dans le cas o\u00f9 la chose vendue doit \u00eatre livr\u00e9e par parties et \u00e0 des \u00e9poques diff\u00e9rentes. Cet arr\u00eat est juridique. L'ex\u00e9cution partielle de a vente r\u00e9git le contrat quant aux conditions auxquelles elle a eu lieu.\nAjoutons que le Code de Commerce n'a pas de dis position particuli\u00e8re sur ce point. L'article 109 d\u00e9clare simplement que les achats et ventes se constatent de diff\u00e9rentes mani\u00e8res, et entr\u2019actes par la correspondance, les livres des parties, la preuve testimoniale ou \"une facture accept\u00e9e\". Ce n'est qu'en appliquant les principes du Code Civil concernant les pr\u00e9somptions de fait, semblables en substance a ceux de notre code, que la doctrine la jurisprudence ont consacr\u00e9 Ia r\u00e8gle que nous venons d'indiquer.\nM\u00eame si notre code \u00e9tait silencieux les r\u00e8gles sur la preuve prescrites par les lois d'Angleterre \u2014que nous devons suivre en l'absence de dispositions dans notre code, art. 1206\u2014sont sur ce point semblables \u00e0 celles du droit fran\u00e7ais. Taylor on Evidence, ed. 1895, sect. 810, dit: \"Among merchants, an account rendered will be regarded as allowed if it be not objected to within a second or third post, or, at least, if it be kept for any length of time without making an objection.\" Il cite plusieurs d\u00e9cisions qui ont jug\u00e9 dans ce sens.\nLa majorit\u00e9 de la cour est donc d'avis d'infirmer le jugement de la Cour d'Appel, et de r\u00e9tablir le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, avec d\u00e9pens devant toutes les cours.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This appeal must, in my opinion, be determined by application to it of the rule so often enunciated and acted upon in this court\u2014that we will not reverse a judgment rendered in respect of a pure matter of fact unless we are clearly satisfied that it is manifestly wrong and wholly unsupported by the evidence, and this cannot, in my opinion, by any means be said of the judgment which is before us on this appeal.\nThe question simply is, as to what in. point of fact was the contract upon which certain teas, the price of which is the sole matter in dispute were sold by the plaintiff to the defendant. The plaintiff who gave evidence on his own behalf swears that they were .sold at 16 cents per 1b. and he has shewn in evidence, and it is admitted by the defendant, that the plaintiff in a letter addressed to the defendant bearing date the 11th March 1895 which was in due course received by the defendant, enclosed an invoice bearing date the 1st of March wherein is shewn the weight of several half chests of tea numbering in the whole 1384, with marks upon each indicating the correspondence of the several packages with certain boxes of samples left with the defendant at the time of the sale at the foot of which the whole was summed up thus\u201462,6011\/2 1bs. at 16 cents$10,016.24. The evidence of the plaintiff was that on the negotiation for the sale, which took place through the intervention of a broker named Baldwin, he left with the defendant several boxes containing samples of the teas upon which were marked the brands and quantities of the several teas offered for sale In answer to a question whether certain figures indicating prices were not also on the several boxes of samples, he replied\u2014I presume so, I don't know I am sure. Being further interrogated whether he had not himself mentioned to the defendant the prices marked on the boxes, he replied \" I mentioned one price, I mentioned that ten cent one, saying it was very cheap,\" and being asked if he had not in a general way referred to the prices marked on the boxes, he replied\u2014\"Not a general way no. I remarked these teas were very cheap; at the average price of 16 cents they would be still cheaper at the prices marked on the tins. Being asked if he had not instructed his broker Mr. Baldwin to mark the prices on the boxes, he replied\u2014\"No, I did not give him any instructions; he asked me as a favour to give him the relative values of the different teas and to the best of my ability I did.\" He said further that Mr. Baldwin requested him to give an estimate of the different values of the teas the pro rat\u00e2 value of the different teas; and being asked what this would be for, he replied:\u2014\nTo give Mr. Baldwin an idea of the different values He said he did not know the value. I quoted the price to Mr. Baldwin that he was to give to Mr. Letellier Mr. Baldwin said I don't know the different values of these goods. I said it doesn't matter to me, I don't know either. He said we must put a value on the different lines. I said it didn't make any difference to him so long as they averaged sixteen cents. So with that understanding he commenced to value them from ten cents to twenty-two cents which would make an average of sixteen cents; he commenced at the low line of ten cents and went to the top line\nand he added that this marking of the prices on the boxes had no bearing whatever as far as he knew with the contract of sale so far as Mr. Letellier was concerned. The defendant only consented to purchase the teas if the plaintiff would purchase from him certain wine which he had for sale, to the amount of $2,937.12, and this being agreed to by the plaintiff the bargain was concluded, as the plaintiff says, in this manner:\nWe had, he says, a good deal of talk. Mr. Letellier did not want to take the whole of it, and when he accepted the whole account Mr. Baldwin got up and said, \" let this be distinctly understood, you take these teas at 16 cents a pound and you take this wine at Mr. Letellier's price.\" Mr. Letellier said all right and we packed up the samples,\nand so they parted, the plaintiff leaving with the defendant the samples of the tea with the prices marked thereon, and taking away with him samples of the wine given to him by the defendant.\nNow this account of the transaction is contradicted in the most unqualified manner by the defendant and his son, and I must say that I cannot dissent from the conclusion arrived at by the court whose judgment is appealed from, namely, that it is contradicted also by the broker Baldwin. The teas were first offered by the plaintiff in the office of the broker Baldwin to the defendant's son who swears in the most positive manner that the teas were offered to him by the plaintiff at the different prices and quantities marked on each box. His account of the transaction with him is this: Mr. Baldwin asked him: Is your father open to buy a big lot of tea?\nJ'ai dit, cela d\u00e9pend de la quantit\u00e9. Il dit, I will show you the samples, \u2014\u2014monsieur Kearney s'est lev\u00e9 il dit: il y a telle et telle marque et il y en a tant de caddys, le prix, et \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9, cela vaut tel et tel prix. L\u00e0-dessus, j'ai dit que le lot \u00e9tait pas mal consid\u00e9rable. J'ai dit qu'on prendrait peut-\u00eatre une marque, ou une partie de chaque marque mais que je ne pensais pas qu'il prendrait tout le lot. L\u00e0-dessus, il dit: J'irai voir votre p\u00e8re au bureau. Il m'a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 peu pr\u00e9s l'heure qu'il y serait, il dit J'irai an bureau avec M. Baldwin et on arrangera cela. The witness added that Mr. Baldwin had sent on the samples in about half an hour after witness had returned to his father's office. The defendant says that the contract of sale was made on the 13th February, 1895; what took place on that day is in his own words as follows:\nM. Kearney est arrive au magasin apr\u00e8s-midi, il \u00e9tait tard dans l'apr\u00e8s-midi, avec M. Baldwin. Les \u00e9chantillons \u00e9taient sur mon bureau, mais pas ouverts, et puis M. Kearney m'a demand\u00e9, tous les deux m'ont demand\u00e9 si j'ach\u00e8terais du th\u00e9. Ils ont ouvert les \u00e9chan tillons et me les ont montr\u00e9s. J'ai trouv\u00e9 la quantit\u00e9 un peu forte. J'ai h\u00e9sit\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s les pourparlers, j'ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Kearney s'il ach\u00e8terait du vin de messe et je lui ai montr\u00e9 mes \u00e9chantillons Nous avons convenu, je me suis d\u00e9cid\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre le th\u00e9 au prix mentionn\u00e9 sur les \u00e9chantillons et je jure positivement qu'il n'a pas \u00e9l\u00e9 question d'autre chose. Il m'a vendu les th\u00e9s \u00e0 ces prix l\u00e0. Il a peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 dit dans la conversation que cela averegerait, que cela faisait une moyenne de seize cents, je n'avais pas de chiffres pour \u00e9tablir cela, moi. Je crois qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mention de seize cents, mais j'ai achet\u00e9 positivement sur ces prix-l\u00e0, sur les prix mentionn\u00e9s.\nFrom the 13th February until the 9th March nothing was done. On the 9th March the defendant sent to the plaintiff an invoice of the wines sold by him, and on the 11th of March the plaintiff in his letter of that date enclosed the invoice of the tea which bore date as already said of the 1st March. The teas were forwarded in there parcels upon the 10th and 13th April and 8th July, 1895; the wines were at plaintiff's request left with defendant until required. Upon the 18th April the plaintiff drew two bills upon the defendant for $1750.00 each payable the one at six months and the other at eight months, and on the 15th July another for like amount payable at ten months from the 1st March as of which date all of the bills were drawn. All of these bills the defendant accepted and it was not until the 15th August, after the plaintiff had drawn a bill for $1829.12 which the defendant refused to accept, that he pointed out to the plaintiff what the defendant insists now is an error in the invoice of the tea sent on the 11th March, the defendant being willing and offering to pay the amount really due according to defendant's contention at the prices named upon\nthe respective boxes of samples; and he explains why he had not sooner drawn attention to the error which he now insists on by saying that he had the samples which shewed the prices at which he bought, and he never entertained the idea that Mr. Kearney would claim sixteen cents a pound when he had sold at the prices named on the samples; and he says that he accepted the bills because he had full value in his possession and he expected that Mr. Kearney when the last draft should be sent would correct the error in the invoice sent in March.\nMr. Baldwin says Mr. Kearney brought a lot of samples to him and handed them to him and asked him to try and sell them. At this time there were no prices marked on the samples. He put the prices on each box according to prices named to him by Mr. Kearney. The boxes with the prices and quantities marked upon them he left with the defendant; the plaintiff was present with him. Being asked whether the defendant asked for the price he answered, \"He must have done so, I left the samples and put the prices on them and left the samples with Mr. Letellier \"\u2014and he adds \" I always understood the prices were marked and the quantities.\" During the negotiations for the sale both he and the plaintiff had called on the defendant several times. Upon the day on which the sale was completed, he says that the defendant looked at the teas and at the prices and the quantities on each, the only discussion that there was being that the defendant thought it a big lot. Mr. Baldwin re members no discussion with regard to prices at all; he says that the defendant looked at the teas upon which the prices were marked which spoke for themselves. He says that if he mentioned sixteen cents at all, but he does not think he did, he mentioned it as that the teas would average sixteen cents at the prices marked, and he says that he will undertake to swear that he understood the sale to be according to the prices marked on the samples and that these prices would average about sixteen cents, and that as to this, according to his way of thinking, he has no doubt whatever. He says in another place that although sixteen cents was mentioned he does not think it was mentioned as a term of the bargain; what h\u00e9 understood was that the prices marked on the samples were the prices at which the tea was sold but that at these prices the teas would come to sixteen cents, which, he says it appears now they have not. What took place at the close of the bargain according to him was this, that he said \" let there be no mistake about this,\" and he wrote the terms of payment on a piece of paper but nothing whatever as to the price, which, according to his understanding of the bargain, was as already stated above.\nNow upon this evidence it is impossible, I think, to say that there is manifest error in the judgment of the Court of Appeal at Quebec to the effect that Baldwin's evidence corroborates that of the defendant and his son, and that whatever may be thought to be unsatisfactory in the reasons given by the defendant for his not having sooner drawn the attention of the plaintiff to what the defendant insists is error in the invoice sent to him on the 11th March it cannot, I think, admit of a doubt that the evidence of the plaintiff as to the prices put upon the samples is equally unsatisfactory. It seems absurd that any man of business could for a moment entertain the idea that his broker was asking for and putting the prices named by the plaintiff upon the samples placed in his hands for sale of the tea for any private purpose of the broker's own, or for any other purpose than to show the prices of the tea he was authorized to sell. So likewise is it impossible, in my opinion, to say that the judgment appealed from is manifestly erroneous in the estimate attributed by the court to the whole of the evidence unless in the face of the evidence of the defendant, his son and the plaintiff's broker, we must hold that the defendant's silence as to the error in the invoice he received in March, 1895, is absolutely uncontrovertibly and conclusive. This we cannot do. The case therefore comes precisely within the class of cases with the judgments in which, as involving questions of mere matter of fact, this court will not interfere and this appeal therefore, in my opinion, ought to be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Fitzpatrick & Taschereau.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Miller & Dorian.\n[1] Q.

(D.)\u201445 V. c 20 (Q.).\nBy a deed made in August, 1882, the appellant ceded to the Government of Quebec, who subsequently conveyed to the respondent, an immovable described as part of lot no 1937 in St Peters Ward in the City of Quebec, situated between the streets St. Paul St. Roch Henderson and the river St. Charles with the wharves and buildings thereon erected.\nOf the lands which the respondents entered into possession by virtue of said deeds they remained in possession for twelve years with out objection to the boundaries. They then brought an action to have it declared that, by the proper construction of the deeds, an additional strip of land and certain wharves- were included and intended to be transferred. They contended that the description in the deed was ambiguous, and that Henderson street as a boundary should be construed as meaning Henderson street ex tended, and they sought to establish their case by the production of certain correspondence which had taken place between the parties prior to the execution of the deed of August, 1882.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Lower Canada, the Chief Justice and King J. dissenting that the words H Henderson Street t as used in the deed must be construed in their plain natural sense as meaning the street of that name actually existing on the ground; that the correspondence was not shown to contain all the negotiations or any finally concluded agreement, and could not be used to contradict or modify the deed which should be read as containing the matured conclusion at which the parties had finally arrived; that the deed should be interpreted in the light of the conduct of the parties in taking and remaining so long in possession without objection, which raised against them a strong presumption, not only not rebutted but strengthened by the facts in evidence; and that any doubt or ambiguity in the deed, in the absence of evidence to explain it, should be interpreted against the vendees, and in favour of the vendors.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), reversing the judgment of the Superior Court for the District of Quebec, which had dismissed the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe questions at issue in this case sufficiently appear by the statements in the judgments reported.\nPelletier Q C. for the appellant. The property claimed by the respondent is not comprised in the deed of 21st August 1882, between the Quebec Government and the present appellant. We contend that the description means the lot bounded towards the west by St. Roch Street towards the south by St. Paul Street, towards the east by Henderson Street and towards the north by the river St. Charles. According to the respondents construction of the deed the river St. Charles would not be a boundary, and there would not be a boundary given to the lot on the north side. The correspondence does not explain the deed, it merely shows that the parties were not agreed as to what the bargain should be; the deed alone must be looked at to discover the final arrangements, and the proper interpretation is found in the execution of their intentions by the delivery of the station grounds, Caron wharf, etc., to respondent, and the absence of any change of occupation of the property now in dispute. Each took possession of and continued to occupy their respective portions of the block no. 1937 for over 12 years prior to this suit. It is absurd to interpret the deed as actually including the \"Palace Harbour,\" navigable waters, which the city could not convey in any event for private uses. The act 45 Vie. ch. 20 (Q), confess no power on the appellant to sell the property claimed. The legislature of Quebec had no right to grant such power. The rights of the appellant over \"Palace Harbour are not rights of proprietorship, but of trust and administration for public purposes, therefore they cannot be compelled to transfer the property.\nShould it be held that the property claimed by the respondent is comprised in the deed between the appellant and the government, still the respondent company has no right of action as it is in fact defunct and has ceased to have existence by the accomplishment of the purposes and object for which it was formed (Quebec Act 45 Vic. ch. 20), and all its the property. and rights of every kind are now vested in the Canadian Pacific Railway Company by virtue of Dominion Acts 46 Vic. ch. 24, sec. 6 and ch. 54; 17 Vic. ch. 8 sec. S 48 & 49 Vie. ch. 58 sec. 3; and 54 & 55 Vic. ch. 11; art. 368 C. C. and the dealings had between the respondent and the Canadian Pacific Railway Company.\nLangelier Q. C. for the respondent. The respondent company was not dissolved by the acts mentioned; the effect of the instruments referred to was merely to transfer the stock to persons interested in the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. The North Shore Railway Company has never become subject to any such conditions as would involve dissolution but still holds title to the lands, notwithstanding the arrangements effected with the Canadian Pacific Rail way Company, and is the only proper party to bring the present action. The lands were subject to alienation notwithstanding the public trust involved; see R. S. Q. art 5164 clauses 3-8. The deed gives us, as the northern boundary, the main channel of the river St. Charles and all doubt as to the property intended to be surrendered to the government of Quebec is removed by the clear intention of the parties shown by their correspondence immediately preceding and leading up to the execution of the deed. We must regard the deed merely as giving effect to the bargain the parties had already made, through those negotiations. The rules of construction require that we should have recourse to the correspondence to explain so much of the deed as is ambiguous. The correspondence leaves no doubt that the government intended to acquire, and the appellant to transfer, all the Palace Harbour property still owned by the appellant, that is to say, not already transferred either to the Gras Company or to the Government. There is nothing in the correspondence from which one may suspect that the appellant was desirous of reserving any of the property; and that is what the parties intended, unless the deed is clearly to the contrary. Now, not only does it not contain anything contrary but it scarcely admits of any other construction. By the deed the Government is to have all that is owned by the appellant, down to the river St. Charles, between St. Roch and Henderson Streets. By the construction of the respondent the Government would not have acquired the property as far as the river St. Charles between these two streets nor any of the wharves not even such as are admitted to have passed by that title.\nThe only construction in accord with the correspondence and the balance of the deed would make the deed to read as follows: \" All that belongs to the corporation between St Paul Street to the south-east the river St Charles to the north-west and Henderson Street continued to the river St. Charles to the north-east.\" With that description, the respondent is entitled to the two wharves claimed in this case. As to the conduct of the parties and actual possession by each of respective parts of the Palace Harbour properties, it is against all rules of evidence to in terpret a written instrument by the conduct of the parties; Taylor on Evidence, 9 ed. secs. 1204, 1205; and as a matter of fact, that reasoning would work against the appellant. The appellant allowed respondent to take possession of all the wharves in Palace Harbour, except the two of which we now ask possession, and never protested nor pretended to have reserved any interest or claim in them, thus showing by their conduct in delivering a part of the property north of Henderson street to us, that we were entitled to all their lands and wharves in that quarter.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of opinion that there is no error in the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench which is the subject of this appeal. Upon the point principally insisted upon by the appellant, namely, that the description contained in the notarial deed of the 21st August, 1882, entered into between the Hon. Henry Starnes the Provincial Commissioner of Railways, and the Mayor of Quebec, included the property sought to be recovered by the respondent in the present action, I am entirely of accord with the Court of Queen's Bench and concur in the reasons given in the opinion of Mr. Justice Cimon. It is shown by the deposition of Mr. Baillairg\u00e9, the City Engineer of Quebec, that the properties in question form, and always formed, part of Palace Harbour (Havre du Palais), a lot or parcel of beach ground and premises which by that denomination the Crown had, by letters patent of the 22nd November, 1851 granted to the City of Quebec and all of which, at the date of the notarial deed before mentioned, remained vested in the city with the exception of so much as had been previously expropriated by the Provincial Government for the purposes of the railway, and the portion sold to the Gras Company.\nThe seventh clause clearly recognises that all the property thus remaining vested in the city was intended to be sold to the Government. This appears conclusively from the words:\nEn consid\u00e9ration de la cession par la dite corporation des revenus du havre du Palais c\u00e9d\u00e9s par les pr\u00e9sentes.\nThis so clearly demonstrates what was the intention of the parties that it cannot possibly be controlled by any subsequent ambiguity and inaccuracy in the definition of the boundaries contained in the second paragraph. Without repeating the reasons of the Court of Queen's Bench and the argument in support of them contained in the able opinion of Mr. Justice Cimon, I may say that I regard those reasons as unanswerable, and adopt them as the grounds of my judgment.\nThere is nothing in the point that the property in question has under certain contracts entered into between the North Shore Railway Company and the Grand Trunk Railway Company, between the Grand Trunk Railway Company and the Dominion, and between the Government and the Canadian Pacific Rail way Company, become vested in the latter company. The first of these contracts, upon which any title in the Canadian Pacific under this pretended cession must depend, does not vest any property belonging to the respondent in the Grand Trunk Company, but merely embodies an agreement that the Grand Trunk shall have the control of the respondents line of rail way and the direction of the traffic carried on upon it. The respondent was not a party to the subsequent agreements, and therefore is unaffected by those contracts. The legislature merely confirms the several contacts.\nThe objection that article 2098 of the Civil Code applies is destitute of foundation. The words \"without effect\" in that article manifestly apply to the registration of subsequent deeds made by the party making the acquisition of property, and not to the cession to him or to the title acquired by him under it. An un registered deed is perfectly good and valid between the parties, and is only affected by non-registration when the vendor cedes the same property to a subsequent party who registers before the first purchaser has registered his deed.\nIt is contended in the appellant's factum that the respondents have become extinct as a corporation. There is no proof whatever of this.\nThe Letters Patent of the 22nd November, 1851, by which the Crown granted Palace Harbour to the City of Quebec, contained a clause prohibiting the alienation of the property granted by the city. Assuming such clause of prohibition to be valid it would not, I think, apply to an alienation such as that contained in the notarial deed of the 21st August, 1882, inasmuch as that was virtually a reconveyance to the Crown itself.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion the appeal must be dismissed.\nGYWNNE J. \u2014The learned counsel for the appellants in his very able argument made two main points in support of the appeal, upon both of which, in my opinion, our judgment must be for the appellant\u2014 namely:\n1st. That the piece of land to recover possession of which this action is brought is not comprised in the deed of the 21st August 1882 between the Quebec Government and the appellant; and 2nd. That whatever right, title or interest in the said piece of land, if any, did pass by the said deed to the Quebec Government the same is vested in the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, and the plaintiffs have no right title or interest therein, nor any claim whatsoever thereto.\nThe piece of land surrendered by the appellants to the Quebec Government by the deed of the 21st August, 1882, is therein very explicitly described as being that part of lot no. 1937 in the ward of St. Peter in the City of Quebec which is situated between the streets St. Paul St. Roch Henderson and the river St. Charles. A. reference to a plan produced in evidence shws that the piece so described is bounded on the west by St. Roch Street, on the south by St. Paul Street, on the east by Henderson Street, and on the north by the river. The language is free from ambiguity that all that was surrendered was that part of the lot of land known as no. 1937 which was within the boundaries above named; the quays and buildings which were erected within those boundaries were also expressed in the deed to be surrendered. The sole question involved in the present appeal is as to the construction to be put upon the words \"Henderson Street t as used in the deeds.\nThe northern limit of Henderson Street was prior to and at the time of the passing of the deed of 1882 and still is in point of fact the southern limit of a street or highway in the City of Quebec shown as \"Orleans Place.\" Of a portion of the lot 1937 immediately north of and abutting on the northern limit of Orleans Place a company called the Quebec Gras Company has been seized and possessed by title from the corporation since 1847. In the year 1875 the corporation of the City of Quebec entered into an agreement with the Gas Company for the sale to them of another portion of the said lot 1937, lying north of and contiguous to the piece of which they were already seized. On the 30th March, 1875, the said company paid the city the sum of $6,000.00, the purchase money agreed upon for the said piece of land. Many years prior to 1875 the City Corporation had constructed on the beach of the river St. Charles adjoining and along the western, northern and north-eastern limit of the said pieces of land a quay and breakwater extending into the river St. Charles in a north-westerly direction from the northern limit of the said pieces of land. No deed of sale of the piece of land agreed to be sold by the corporation to the company and for which the, company paid the purchase money in 1875 appears to have been executed until November 1887. By an act of the Legislature of the Province of Quebec passed on the 18th of May 1887 (50 Vic. ch. 57, sec. 22) it was en acted as follows:__\nThe Mayor of the City of Quebec is hereby authorized to grant and sign for and on behalf of the corporation to the Quebec Gas Company a clear and valid title deed for the sale of the land situated in the Palais Market effected in the year 1875 by the said corporation to the Quebec Gas Company, which laud the said company has ever since enjoyed, and the price whereof has been paid to the corporation.\nOn the 26th November, 1887, the Mayor of the City by deed expressed to be made and executed by him under the authority of the said act did sell and assign unto the said Gas Company with guarantee against all troubles the said piece of the said lot no. 1937 so purchased and paid for by the company in 1875, described as being situate on said Orleans Place in the City of Quebec and measuring one hundred and fifty eight feet and six inches on the south-easterly line, two hundred and sixteen feet and two inches on the north-easterly line one hundred and seventy-three feet on the south-westerly line and thirty-six feet and five inches on the north-westerly line.\nNow the piece of land for which this action is brought is the quay or wharf and embankment which the appellants had constructed on the beach of the river St. Charles extending from the northern limit of the said Orleans Place in a northerly direction along the westerly and northerly limit of the said pieces of land of which one had been so long in the possession of the G-as Company and the other sold to them in 1875 and extending from the northern limit thereof in a north-westerly direction into the river St. Charles. It is perfectly obvious and this is not disputed that \"Henderson\" Street as it was known to exist always prior to and at the time of the execution of the deed of August, 1882, did not at any point abut upon or bound the said quay or wharf and embankment or any part thereof. It never extended further north than the southern limit of said Orleans Place. The words \" Henderson'' Street as used in the deed must be construed in their plain natural sense, as meaning the street of that name as actually existing on the ground, and so construed the piece of land for which the action is brought is plainly not within the limits which are assigned in the deed as bounding the piece of land therebv surrendered. But the contention of the re spondents is, and this contention appears to have been adopted by the Court of Appeal at Quebec, that the deed is to be read as if Henderson Street was extended northerly across Orleans Place and through the pieces of land sold to the Gras Company and beyond the northern limit thereof; so extended it would leave a strip of land purchased by the Gras Company lying between the western limit of Henderson Street so ex tended and that portion of the quay or wharf for which this action is brought lying west of and contiguous to the Gas Company\u2019s lands. Such an extension could not in point of fact by possibility be effected except by purchase of sufficient land from the Gras Company for the purpose, and no principle can be urged upon which the deed should be construed as assuming that to be done which could not be done at all without the assent of the Gas Company who were no parties to the deed. The only suggestion upon which this construction is based is that it is necessary for the purpose of giving effect to an intention which is said to be apparent in certain letters which passed between the Quebec Government and the Corporation containing negotiations for the purchase by the Government of the piece of land which they required to be surrendered by the corporation but these letters contain no stipulation in terms that the piece of land for which this action is brought should be included in the surrender, nor any finally concluded agreement, and we must read the deed as containing the matured con elusion at which the parties to the negotiation contained in the letters had finally arrived. It appears to me I confess, inconceivable that the corporation after their sales to the Gras Company in 1847 and in 1875 and receipt of the purchase money for land which it is but natural to assume was enhanced in value by the quay wharf and embankment which are the subject of this action, when describing the piece of land surrendered as bounded on one side by Henderson Street could have contemplated that they should be under stood as meaning not Henderson Street as it existed on the ground but as extended indefinitely across Orleans Place and through the pieces of land sold to the Gas Company from the southern to and beyond the northern limit thereof The manner in which the parties to the surrender of 1882 have dealt with the property expressed to be surrendered is strong proof, as observed by the learned judge in the Superior Court, that the Corporation of Quebec did not intend to surrender nor the Government to acquire the piece of land for which this action is brought.\nFor these reasons we cannot I think adopt the construction put upon the deed of surrender by the Court of Appeal at Quebec. The appeal therefore must be allowed upon the first of the above grounds as urged by the appellants. While it is therefore unnecessary to determine the second point I think it clear that whatever right title or interest if any ever was acquired by the plaintiffs in or to the piece of land in question has by force of the Acts of Parliament referred to in the case passed to and become vested in the Canadian Pacific Railway Company; but as already stated this point is immaterial as the piece of land in question did not pass by and is not included in the deed of surrender.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I concur in the opinions expressed by my brothers Grwynne and Girouard. I think that the appeal should be allowed with costs for the reasons stated in their written judgments.\nKing J.\u2014I dissent and, for the same reasons as the Chief Justice, I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014L'appelante a soulev\u00e9 plusieurs questions par cet appel l mais la principale, et la plus importante, est celle de savoir si la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 revendiqu\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9e est comprise dans l'acte d'ali\u00e9nation du 21 ao\u00fbt 1882 consenti devant Mtre A.

L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la correspondance qui a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 imm\u00e9diatement les actes du 21 ao\u00fbt 1882 fait voir que l'intention des parties \u00e9tait de transf\u00e9rer tout ce qui restait de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du Havre du Palais, avec tous ses quais, et plus particuli\u00e8rement le Quai Caron et le Quai du Gaz, et qu'\u00e0 l'aide de cette correspondance, ii faut corriger la description notari\u00e9e, en prolongeant Ia rue Henderson jusqu'\u00e0 la rivi\u00e8re Saint-Charles, par une ligne imaginaire \u00e0 travers une place publique, appel\u00e9e Place d'Or l\u00e9ans, et la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 contigu\u00eb de Ia Compagnie du gaz, laquelle ligne est trac\u00e9e sur les dits plans par l'intim\u00e9e. L'honorable juge Andrews a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'opinion que l'ambi [Page 117]\nguit\u00e9 devait s'interpr\u00e9ter contre l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 raison de sa conduite et de son long silence depuis le jour de son acquisition:\nConsidering that the validity of this contention turns upon the interpretation to he given to the description or designation of the real estate intended to be so conveyed by said deeds; that is whether such designation by the metes and bounds therein given doss or does not include therein the said wharf;\nConsidering that by their conduct the parties have themselves solved the said question; for that they have\u2014the defendants by retaining and not making delivery of the said wharf and by collecting for all the twelve years which elapsed between the execution of the said deeds and the month prior to the bringing of this suit all the revenues of the said wharf, and the plaintiffs by never during all that time making any claim thereto\u2014interpreted the said ambiguous designation or description in said deeds as not including the said wharf, &c.\nLa Cour d'Appel, compos\u00e9e de Blanchet et Hall JJ., et Bourgeois et Cimon JJ., ad hoc, a recherch\u00e9 l'intention des parties dans la correspondance ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 l'acte notari\u00e9, et infirm\u00e9 le jugement de Ia Cour Sup\u00e9rieure:\nConsid\u00e9rant que ces quais et ce terrain, tel que ci dessus d\u00e9crits, se trouvent compris dans la cession que l'intim\u00e9e a faite au gouverne ment de Qu\u00e9bec le 21 ao\u00fbt 1882, par acte devant Mtre Tourangeau, notaire, et que le dit gouvernement a ensuite le m\u00eame jour, par acte devant le m\u00eame notaire, faite \u00e0 l'appelante, etc.\nM. le juge Cimon, qui a prononc\u00e9 le jugement de la Cour, dit:\nCette correspondance ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 l'acte notari\u00e9\u2014qui constitue une preuve \u00e9crite\u2014contient, pour ainsi dire, le mandat que les repr\u00e9sentantes des parties ont rempli, en signant cet acte du 21 ao\u00fbt 1882 i elle fait voir l'intention commune, v\u00e9ritable des parties et ce tr\u00e9s claire ment. Tous les auteurs et la jurisprudence sont d'avis Que les \u00e9crits ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e9man\u00e9s des parties peuvent \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9s pour expliquer ou interpr\u00e9ter le contrat, vide 25 Demolombe, nos. 8 \u00e0 11 (bis); 16 Laurent no. 508. D'ailleurs qu'y a-t-il de plus fort que des \u00e9crits?\nOr, ce que cette correspondance d\u00e9montre clairement, c'est que la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec consentait de c\u00e9der tout le havre du Palais, toutes les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qu'elle avait la, les b\u00e2tisses, les quais et aussi tous les revenus du havre du Palais: et le gouvernement ne voulait pas avoir moins. Ii y a sp\u00e9cialement une somme de $75,000 stipul\u00e9e pour l'abandon des revenus du havre du Palais.\nJe ne puis accepter Ia mani\u00e8re de voir du savant juge. Les principes qu'il invoque sont incontestables, mais ils ne s'appliquent pas \u00e0 l'esp\u00e8ce. Je ne puis admettre que la correspondance ant\u00e9rieure suffit pour d\u00e9truire on contredire un contrat, on y suppl\u00e9er \u00e0 moins qu'il ne soit prouve qu'elle fait partie du contrat on du moins qu'elle contient toutes les n\u00e9gociations, et c'est ce que l'intim\u00e9e n'a pas fait, Si tel \u00e9tait le fait ii lui \u00e9tait facile d'\u00e9tablir que la correspondance produite forme toute la correspondance et toutes les n\u00e9gociations qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 les actes du 21 ao\u00fbt 1882. Sans cette preuve, je ne puis accepter cette correspondance pour juger de l'intention des parties.\nS'il y avait erreur ou lacune dans la description de l\u2019immeuble et de ses accessoires, elle aurait d\u00fb l'all\u00e9 guer et la prouver par les moyens ordinaires. Sans cette preuve je ne me sens pas dispose de mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 le contrat et d'accepter \u00e0 sa place la correspondance ant\u00e9rieure.\nJe dois supposer qu'au dernier moment, les parties out modifi\u00e9 leur volont\u00e9 et que l'intention qui doit d\u00e9cider des droits des parties est celle qui est manifest\u00e9e an contrat.\nNul doute que la correspondance produite d\u00e9montre que la premi\u00e8re intention du gouvernement \u00e9tait d'ac qu\u00e9rir tout ce qui restait du havre du Palais, moyen nant consid\u00e9ration qui, \u00e0 l'origine, ne me para\u00eet pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 bien comprise Dans une lettre an maire, \u00e0 la date du 17 ao\u00fbt 1882 M. W\u00fcrtele le tr\u00e9sorier de la province, demande \u00e0 acqu\u00e9rir \"tous les droits qu'elle (la Cit\u00e9) peut avoir sur le havre du Palais, et les'pro pri\u00e9t\u00e9s connues sous le nom du Palais,\" et \u00e0 payer $50,000 \u00e0 la ville \"pour l'abandon par celle-ci des revenus provenant du havre du Palais.\" Lelende main, 18 ao\u00fbt, le maire r\u00e9pond qu'il consent \u00e0 la \"cession du havre du Palais et des terrains qui l'avoisinent,\" et il demande $100,000 \"pour retour de l'\u00e9change des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s du Palais, au lieu de $50,000 que vous offrez.\" Le m\u00eame jour, M. W\u00fcrtele r\u00e9plique que les conditions de l'arrangement \"seraient d\u00e9finitivement comme suit: Entr'autres de la part de la Cit\u00e9: \"Cession du havre du Palais et des terrains qui l'avoisinent avec les b\u00e2tisses y \u00e9rig\u00e9es,\" et p paiement d'une somme de $75,000 en retour de l'\u00e9change des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s du Palais an lieu de $50,000.\nPuis, lorsqu'on arrive \u00e0 la passation du contrat trois jours plus tard, le 21 ao\u00fbt, ce n'est plus le havre du Palais et tout ce qui en d\u00e9pend qui sont c\u00e9d\u00e9s, mais simplement \"tous les droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et autres qu'elle (la Cit\u00e9) a et peut avoir,\" sur cette partie du num\u00e9ro 1937 du cadastre, \"situ\u00e9e entre les rues Saint Paul, Saint-Roch, Henderson et la rivi\u00e8re Saint-Charles, avec les quais et b\u00e2tisses sus \u00e9rig\u00e9s.\" Le gouverne ment s'engagea de payer $75,000 \"en consid\u00e9ration de la cession par la dite corporation des revenus du havre du Palais c\u00e9d\u00e9s par les pr\u00e9sentes.\"\nLes parties avaient \u00e9videmment modifi\u00e9 leur intention, et, pour une raison on une autre qui n'appara\u00eet pas, la cession de Ia part de la cite \u00e9tait consid\u00e9rable ment r\u00e9duite.\nCette modification \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re heure n'a rien d'\u00e9tonnant; bien an contraire. Durant le cours des n\u00e9gociations qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 ces actes de nombreux chan gements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits. En lisant la section 7 du chapitre 20 de la 45 Victoria, sanctionn\u00e9e le 27 mai 1882, le gouvernement de Qu\u00e9bec avait en vue des modifications importantes a son \"premier contrat avec la Compagnie du chemin de fer du Nord et la Cite de Qu\u00e9bec. Ces modifications devaient \u00eatre compl\u00e9t\u00e9es le, on avant le 27 ao\u00fbt suivant aux termes du statut. Le 17 ao\u00fbt, M. W\u00fcrtele ouvre une correspondance officielle avec le maire de Qu\u00e9bec; \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re heure, il a pu et a d\u00fb consentir \u00e0 prendre moins de terrain, sans pr\u00e9judicier aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du gouvernement qu'il repr\u00e9sentait; car il stipule dans les deux actes du 21 ao\u00fbt 1882, que \"le pr\u00e9sent arrangement est sujet \u00e0 la ratification du lieutenant-gouverneur en conseil.\"\nLe 18 ao\u00fbt, le maire de Qu\u00e9bec demandait $100,000 \"pour retour de l'\u00e9change des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s du Palais, au lieu de $50,000 que vous offrez.\" le m\u00eame jour, M. W\u00fcrtele consentait \u00e0 donner $75,000 \"en retour de l'\u00e9change,\" et il demandait une r\u00e9ponse \"au plus t\u00f4t.\" La correspondance produite finit l\u00e0. Quand l'acte fut sign\u00e9 trois jours apr\u00e8s, la cit\u00e9 accepte $75,000 \"en con sid\u00e9ration de la cession des revenus du havre c\u00e9d\u00e9s par les pr\u00e9sentes; \" et elle r\u00e9duit Ia quantit\u00e9 des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qui lui \u00e9taient d'abord demand\u00e9es. Ce ne sont plus toutes les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s du Palais, mais seulement cette partie qui est d\u00e9crite dans l'acte, qu'il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 si simple de d\u00e9crire comme, dans la correspondance, si telle \u00e9tait encore l'intention des parties, savoir: tous les droits de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et autres de la Cite dans le havre du Palais avec le num\u00e9ro du cadastre.\nMais il y a plus. Le 18 ao\u00fbt 1882, M. le maire est autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure avec, le gouvernement. Cette autorisation est par r\u00e9solution du conseil de la ville de Quebec, comme suit:\u2014\nR\u00e9solu\u2014Que Son Honneur le Maire soit, et ii est par la pr\u00e9sente autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure avec le gouvernement un arrangement de ses r\u00e9clamations contre Ia corporation, d\u00e9coulant principalement de Ia souscription de Ia cite au fonds capital du Chemin do fer du Nord, et de la corporation contre le gouvernement, le tout aux conditions incorpor\u00e9es dans le rapport du comit\u00e9 des finances qui vient d'\u00eatre unanimement adopt\u00e9 par le conseil\net pr\u00e9c\u00e8de imm\u00e9diatement l'acte du 21 ao\u00fbt qui en fait une mention expresse. Or, cette r\u00e9solution ne dit pas que l'acte sera fait conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la correspondance du 11 et du 18 ao\u00fbt entre le maire et le tr\u00e9sorier de Ia province, mais \"aux conditions incorpor\u00e9es dans le rapport du comit\u00e9 des finances qui vient d'\u00eatre unanimement adopt\u00e9 par le conseil.\" Quelles sont ces conditions? Sont-ce celles mentionn\u00e9es dans la correspondance ant\u00e9rieure? Le comit\u00e9 a-t-il accept\u00e9 $75,000 au lieu de $100,000 pour le retour des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s que les parties se proposaient d'\u00e9changer? Ou bien, a-t-il accept\u00e9 cette r\u00e9duction de la soulte en consid\u00e9ration de la r\u00e9duction de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 c\u00e9der? Il est impossible de le dire. L'intim\u00e9e, dont le devoir \u00e9tait de produire toute pi\u00e8ce essentielle de sa cause, n'a pas produit le rapport du comit\u00e9 des finances; et \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de cette preuve, ii est impossible, suivant moi, d'aller chercher l'intention des parties ailleurs que dans le contrat.\nL'appelante a invoqu\u00e9 l'obligation contract\u00e9e par le gouvernement de Qu\u00e9bec \"\u00e0 faire draguer au bout des et entre les quais du havre du Palais et \u00e0 mettre les quais en bon ordre, etc.,\" (et non pas seulement e entre les dits quais,\" c'est-\u00e0-dire, les quais c\u00e9d\u00e9s, ainsi que le d\u00e9clare l'acte consenti par le gouvernement \u00e0 l'in tim\u00e9e), comme une preuve ou au moins une forte pr\u00e9somption que tous les quais du havre du Palais ne lui \u00e9taient pas c\u00e9d\u00e9s. Si l'appelante, en effet, ne devait plus jouir d'un seul quai, elle n'avait aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat particulier \u00e0 imposer cette condition. Il me semble qu'il y a lieu de pr\u00e9sumer que le but de ce dragage \u00e9tait d'augmenter la facilit\u00e9 de la navigation aupr\u00e8s de tous les quais du hayre du Palais, afin d'accro\u00eetre par l\u00e0 les droits de quaiage perceptibles par la Cit\u00e9 sur le quai ou les quais qui lui restaient.\nM. le juge Cimon ne peut accepter ce raisonnement.\nIl y a, de suite,\" dit-il, \"une r\u00e9ponse p\u00e9remptoire \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re raison\u2014c'est que l\u2019acte lu 21 ao\u00fbt 1882, stipule cette somme de $75,000 en faveur de l'intim\u00e9e, en consid\u00e9ration de la cession par Ia cite au gouvernement 'des revenus du havre du Palais c\u00e9d\u00e9s par les pr\u00e9sentes'. Oui, des revenus du havre c c\u00e9d\u00e9s par les pr\u00e9sentes,\" c'est-\u00e0-dire, tels que d\u00e9finis par la description des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s c\u00e9d\u00e9es, et non pas des revenus de tout le havre, qui ne sont pas c\u00e9d\u00e9s.\nLe savant juge continue:\nDraguer 'au bout des quais et entre les quais'\u2014ce n'est donc pas pour accro\u00eetre les droits de quaiage perceptibles par la cit\u00e9, puisque l'acte d\u00e9clare que la cite a c\u00e9d\u00e9 ces droits de quaiage au gouvernement moyennant ces $75,000.\nL'acte d\u00e9clare seulement que les quais des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u00e9crites sont c\u00e9d\u00e9s et rien de plus.\nL'acte entre le gouvernement et la Compagnie du Chemin de Fer du Nord contient dans la description des expressions qui ne se trouvent pas dans l'acte entre le gouvernement et la cite de Quebec, savoir: \"a avec tous les droits de quaiage taxes et revenus\". Mais fussent-elles dans ce dernier acte, elles ne peu vent s'entendre que des d droits de quaiage, taxes et revenus,\" provenant des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s d\u00e9crites et c\u00e9d\u00e9es, c'est-\u00e0-dire, tant du quai Canon, qui projette dans la rivi\u00e8re, que des quais qui bordent la rivi\u00e8re Saint-Charles\nMais, observe l'intim\u00e9e, \u00e0 moins de prolonger la ligne de la rue Henderson, \u00e0 travers la Place d'Orl\u00e9ans et les immeubles de la Compagnie de Gaz, jusqu'\u00e0 Ia rivi\u00e8re Saint-Charles, la' propri\u00e9t\u00e9 c\u00e9d\u00e9e ne peut avoir cette rivi\u00e8re pour confin, et la Compagnie du Chemin de Fer du Nord n'a droit \u00e0 aucun quai, pas m\u00eame au quai Caron. La question soulev\u00e9e par l'action de l'in tim\u00e9e n'est pas de savoirsi elle a droit \u00e0 d'autres quais, mais uniquement si le Quai du Graz est compris dans le contrat, et sur cc point je n'ai aucun doute que ses pr\u00e9tentions sont mal fond\u00e9es. Si jamais nous avons \u00e0 nous prononcer sur une action en d\u00e9limitation ou en bornage ce sera alors le temps de d\u00e9finir les bornes de l'immeuble. Cependant, je ne vois pas que cette delimitation puisse pr\u00e9senter des difficult\u00e9s s\u00e9rieuses. On ne devra pas tirer une ligne droite de l'extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 de la rue Henderson pr\u00e8s de la Place d'Orl\u00e9ans \u00e0 la rue Saint-Roch. La rivi\u00e8re Saint-Charles doit \u00eatre l'une des limites de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et l\u00e0 on elle l'arrose au point le plus rapproch\u00e9 de la rue Henderson, l\u00e0 cette limite commence et se continue le long de la gr\u00e8ve, jusqu'\u00e0 la rue Saint-Roch, et comprend \u00e9videmment le Quai Caron et les autres quais qui bordent la rivi\u00e8re sur tout le parcours de cette limite. Elle ne comprend pas le Quai du Gaz qui touche \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la Compagnie du Gaz, une construction de ce genre ne pouvant \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme la rivi\u00e8re elle-m\u00eame qui se trouve couverte et remplie; et si le doute \u00e9tait possible l\u00e0 dessus il suffirait de lire le contrat pour se convaincre que, dans l'esprit des parties, les quais et la rivi\u00e8re ne signifient pas la m\u00eame chose, mais au contraire, sont deux choses distinctes. Je ne. puis donc accepter la ligne imaginaire de l'intim\u00e9e prolong\u00e9e sur la Place d'Orl\u00e9ans et les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de la Compagnie du Gaz, jusqu'au chenal de la rivi\u00e8re Saint-Charles.\nC'est d'ailleurs l'interpr\u00e9tation que les parties out donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l'acte par la prise de possession de l'intim\u00e9e; et si sa conduite post\u00e9rieure ne constitue pas un aveu parfait de sa part que son titre exclut le quai du Gaz, elle est suffisante pour \u00e9tablir une forte pr\u00e9somption contre elle, qu'il est libre au juge d'appr\u00e9cier d'apr\u00e9s les circonstances conform\u00e9ment aux articles 1238 et 1242 du Code Civil. M. le juge Andrews a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 cette pr\u00e9somption comme concluante contre l'intim\u00e9e et \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de preuve pour la d\u00e9truire mais bien an contraire en pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e des faits et circonstances qui Ia confirment, je suis de son avis. La r\u00e8gle qu'\u00e9nonce Demolombe ([2]), re\u00e7oit ici son enti\u00e8re application: Il faut encore mettre au rang des r\u00e8gles les meilleures d'interpr\u00e9tation quoique notre Code ne Ia mentionne pas, celle que fournit l'ex\u00e9cution qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e par les parties de la clause de leur convention, dont le sens est maintenant controvers\u00e9 entre elles.\nL'ex\u00e9cution de la clause, c'est l'interpr\u00e9tation vivante et anim\u00e9e !\nC'est, en quelque sorte, l'aveu de la partie ! et \u00e0 moins qu'elle ne prouve que l'ex\u00e9cution, qu'elle y a donn\u00e9e, a \u00e9t\u00e9 le r\u00e9sultat d'une erreur, il est logique et \u00e9quitable qu'elle ne soit pas, en g\u00e9nCral, admise \u00e0 revenir contre son propre fait;\nTalis enim proesumitur proecessisse titulus, qualis apparet usus et prossessio.\nTels sont les termes, dans lesquels on pourrait, d'apr\u00e8s Dumoulin, poser notre r\u00e9gle. (Comm. sur Ia Cout. de Paris, \u00a7 68, no. 23; comp. Merlin, Quest. de Droit. t. II. pp. 232 et 238; Toullier, t. III, no. 320; D. Rec. alph., vo. Obligations. No. 865).\nEnfin reste-t-il encore quelque doute, qu'il soit impossible de dissiper? La r\u00e8gle de droit, \u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 l'article 1019 de notre Code Civil, devra \u00eatre notre guide: \"Dans 1e doute, le contrat s'interpr\u00e8te contre celui qui a stipul\u00e9, et en faveur de celui qui a contract\u00e9 l'obligation.\" En France, en mati\u00e8re de vente on d'\u00e9change, tout pacte obscur on ambigu s'interpr\u00e8te contre le vendeur on l'\u00e9changiste qui c\u00e8de. C. N. art. 1602,1707. Pans le syst\u00e8me de notre Code, art. 1473, 1599, nous suivons les principes ordinaires, ceux \u00e9nonc\u00e9s en l'article 1019. Pans cette cause, c'est l'appelante qui a contact\u00e9 l'obligation de livrer ce qu'elle a vendu on \u00e9chang\u00e9 et c'est en sa faveur que le doute doit s'inter pr\u00e9ter. L'intim\u00e9e, et dans sa plaidoirie devant nous et dans son factum, admet qu'il y a ambiguit\u00e9 dans la description de la chose vendue on \u00e9chang\u00e9e.\nAll the difficulty in the case,\" dit-elle, c comes from the ambiguous manner the notary who has drafted the deed of the 21st August 1882, has described the property sold by the appellant to the Government.\nJe suis d'avis qu'en l'absence de tout autre moyen de d\u00e9couvrir la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, l'ambiguit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e contre l'intim\u00e9e, et en faveur de l'appelante, et ici je ne crois pas pouvoir mieux conclure qu'en rappelant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e ce passage de Demolombe dans ses commentaires sur cette r\u00e8gle d'interpr\u00e9tation:\nJe ne comprends pas; tant pis pour vous; votre preuve n'est pas faite ([3])\nPour toutes ces raisons, et sans me prononcer sur les autres moyens de l'appel, je suis d'opinion de renvoyer la demande de l'intim\u00e9e et d'infirmer le jugement de la Cour d'Appel avec d\u00e9pens devant toutes les cours.\nAppeal allowed with costs\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.

C.\nTo rebut the presumption created by article 1629 of the Civil Code of Lower Canada it is not necessary for the lessee to prove the exact or probable origin of the fire or that it was due to unavoidable accident or irresistible force. It is sufficient for him to prove that he has used the premises leased as a prudent administrator (en bon p\u00e8re de famille), and that the fire occurred without any fault that could be attributed to him or to persons for whose acts he should be held responsible.\nJudgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada affirmed, Strong C J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]), reversing the decision of the Superior Court, which dismissed the plaintiff's action and condemned him, upon defendant's incidental demand, to pay damages for the loss of rent of premises destroyed by fire with a reservation to the defendant, incidental plaintiff, of his recourse by a subsequent action for further damages.\nThe respondent leased from the appellant certain premises in the City of Montreal described in the deed of lease for the purpose of carrying on the business of manufacturing and importing furniture, the property at the time consisting of vacant lots upon which the buildings to be occupied by the respondent as a furniture factory were to be erected by the appellant. The lease was for ten years and two months from the 1st of March 1889, and the rental, to be determined by the value of the buildings so to be erected, was definitively fixed at $4,175 per annum, plus a certain amount for municipal and school taxes, to be paid on the 1st of November of each year. The lease provided that the lessee should pay to the lessor all extra premiums of insurance which the latter might be called upon to pay the insurance companies above the minimum rate in consequence of business carried on by the lessee, and in addition to the ordinary stipulations concerning the keeping of the leased premises in good condition and repair, etc. it was agreed that the respondent should pay the appellant $3,500 as a guarantee for the carrying out of the obligations of the lease, the said sum to bear interest at 7 per cent per annum which was to be set off against the rent, the principal to be imputed in payment of the balance of the last year's rent.\nThe respondent took possession of the leased premises and occupied them until July, 1894, regularly paying the rent, taxes and extra insurance premiums up to that date. On the 25th July, 1894, a fire broke out amongst some bales of tow or jute stored in the basement of the leased premises and almost completely destroyed the buildings occupied by the respondent. These buildings having become uninhabitable, the respondent brought his action for the resiliation of the lease and reimbursement of the sum of $2,500.55, being the difference between the said $3,500, with certain amounts of interest, and the sum of $1,060.90 representing three months' rent due on 31st July. The appellant, relying on art. 1629 of the Civil Code, answered the respondent's claim by stating that he held him responsible for the damages resulting from the fire and required him to reconstruct the buildings which had been destroyed, in default where of he would himself reconstruct them at the expense of the respondent and hold him liable for all damages resulting from the fire; and further pleaded that in virtue of a stipulation contained in the lease, if the lease were dissolved before the end of the term in con sequence of the non-fulfilment by the lessee of any of the obligations mentioned in the lease, the said sum of $3,500 and interest accrued thereon should be for feited and should belong to the lessor as damages for the dissolution of said lease; that the fire in question was caused by the fault and negligence of the respondent or his employees so that the lease was dissolved by the non-fulfilment of the respondent's obligations and consequently the said sum of $3,500 became forfeited to the appellant.\nThe appellant also by an incidental demand alleged that the fire caused him damage to the extent of $12,897.79, and claimed that sum from the respondent.\nThe respondent replied by a general answer that the fire did not occur through his fault or the fault of persons for whom he was responsible, but that as far as ascertained it was purely accidental, and by a plea to the incidental demand containing substantially, the same reasons as those of the declaration in the principal action.\nIn addition to the facts already stated the evidence taken at the trial shewed facts from which the appellant claimed that the respondent was guilty of acts of negligence in leaving dangerous matter such as tow in the basement which was frequently resorted to by the workmen for considerable periods of time without supervision, and that they used to sit or lounge about on the bales of tow while waiting to get into the closet which was situated in the basement. That while thus waiting there was danger that the workmen might smoke or commit acts which might kindle a fire. That the tow was so kept without the appellant's knowledge and that respondent did not take the necessary precautions to prevent a fire breaking out in this inflammable substance. That no water buckets were kept in the basement ready for emergency in case of fire, although such buckets were provided in all other flats of the factory. That cotton waste, (rags and refuse saturated with oil, varnish and turpentine) was put into barrels after it had been used in the factory and was allowed to be carelessly removed by boys. That the message to the fire station was not by telephone although there was an instrument in the factory and that the respondent had not accounted for his actions at or about the time of the commencement of the fire. The respondent's proof in rebuttal of the presumption established by article 1629 was in substance as follows:\u2014\nThe fire broke out in full daylight between 1.15 and 1.30 in the afternoon. Three or four of respondent's employees were in some manner witnesses of the beginning of the fire. There was no fire in the establishment with the exception of two or three gas jets in the basement attached to posts, carefully covered with tin. The water closed was in this basement and all the employees of the establishment except those in the office had access thereto. At about 1.15 a witness (M) who went to the cellar, passing quite close to the spot where the fire broke out, saw no fire; he was not smoking as he never smoked, and had no matches, or other explosive or combustible materials on his person, and as he was leaving met another witness (D), going in the direction of the closet. D entered the closet' and at the moment perceived through a crack in the door the fire which arose in puffs from the bales of tow. At the same moment another employee, going to the closet when within 15 feet of them, saw that the door was closed and at the same time saw the fire rising between two bales of tow. Thereupon the alarm was given and a messenger ran to call the fire men at a station within about a hundred yards, but the fire spread rapidly. There was no water tap in the basement. All the employees of the establishment swore positively that neither they nor the respondent did anything which could have caused the fire. Smoking was strictly prohibited in the establishment, and employees were not allowed to fill their pipes in the place nor to smoke on the side-walk along side of the factory. The establishment was kept in the most irreproachable manner and was considered a model establishment.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court declared the lease cancelled, reserved the appellant's recourse for the loss of rent which he might suffer from May 1st., 1894 to May 1st., 1899, dismissed the respondent's action and allowed the appellant on his incidental demand the sum of $640.90; the decision being based on the ground that the respondent had failed to prove the origin of the fire as required by art. 1629 of the Civil Code, and that he was consequently responsible for the damages resulting from the fire.\nOn appeal the Court of Queen's Bench reversed the judgment, holding that the evidence destroyed the presumption against the lessee and showed that the fire had not been caused by his fault or by that of the persons for whom he was responsible. From this latter decision the present appeal is taken. Trenholme Q.C. and B\u00e9ique Q.C. for the appellant.\nThe law governing the case is found in the Civil Code of Lower Canada, articles 1053, 1200, 1629, 1632, and 1633, which respectively correspond with the Code Napol\u00e9on, arts. 1382, 1383, 1302, 1733, 1730 and 1731. The Canadian codifiers remark on article 1629 that \"it declares the same rule as that expressed in article 1733 C.N., but not in the same form, the object of both articles being to establish, that in case of loss by fire the presumption is against the tenant, and hence his liability.\"\nThe legal question involved, is as to what kind of evidence must be adduced by the tenant, in order to constitute proof that the fire was not caused by the fault of himself or his subordinates. The principle adopted by the Court of Queen's Bench, judged from the notes of Chief Justice Lacoste filed in the cause, is that \"so soon as the lessee shall convince the mind of the judge that he is not in fault, by whatsoever proof he does it, he ought to be exonerated. There is no need for him to prove the cause of the fire, nor even the impossibility of establishing it otherwise than by a fortuitous event; it would be enough for him to establish by the circumstances of the case that there is not an act of negligence or imprudence attributable to him.''\nIf the tenant is not bound to prove the precise cause of the fire, he must shew beyond question that it was due to fortuitous event or irresistible force, as otherwise he is to be presumed responsible. Jamieson v. Steel ([2]); Evans v. Skelton ([3]). In the case of the Seminary of Quebec v. Poirtras ([4]) the defendant proved more than respondent has done in this case, yet the court held that, \" in order to destroy the presumption declared in article 1629 C. C., it is not sufficient for a tenant to show that he acted with the care of a prudent administrator, and that the fire which destroyed the premises leased could not be accounted for; he must show how the fire originated, and that it originated without his fault.\" See also B\u00e9langer v. McCarthy ([5]); and specially the remarks of Johnson J. at p. 182.\nThe lessee has been held responsible under art. 1733 C. N. even when there were defects in construction; Zichitelli v. Gille et at.([6]). It is not enough for the lessee to say that as no fault has been proved against him the fire must be attributed to a fortuitous event or irresistible force; Compagnie d' Assurance le Nord, v. Carrier et al. ([7]). Even where the fire is incendiary the lessee must exculpate himself; Compagnie Nationale v. Pelcot ([8]); Compagnie d'Assurance le Monde v. Durand ([9]); Compagnie d' Assurance l'Orl\u00e9anaise v. Compagnie d'Assurance l' Urbaine ([10]). See also Pothier, Louage no. 194; Marcad\u00e9 sur l'art. 1733; 4 Aubry & Rau, par. 367 and nn. 20-22. The case of La Compagnie Nationale v Chartrain ([11]), cited by Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9 in the appeal judgment, does not support his theory; the appellate court there held that:\nBy the terms of article 1733 Code Civil, the lessee is answerable for the fire, unless he proves that it has happened by fortuitous event or irresistible force, or by defect in construction, or that the fire was communicated by a neighbouring building, or at the very least unless he establishes the impossibility of his imprudence or fault.\nIn the case cited by Boss\u00e9 J., Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Moulin du Ch\u00fbteau-Narbonnais v. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Industrielle du Sud Ouest ([12]), decided by the Court of Toulouse, the tenant was condemned, so the judgment evidently cannot be an authority against us. The question now in dispute did not present itself in that case, and no legal proposition applicable to the present controversy, was either required or intended to be laid down; the foot note shows no modification of opinion on the part of Dalloz. In fact, the note shows he never entertained the opinion he is supposed to have modified.\nOur article 1629 is not in conflict with art. 1200, which alone is sufficient for our purpose, as it requires for the exculpation of the debtor the allegation and proof of fortuitous event. On this point see 24 Dem. no. 562; 28 Dem. no. 769; 25 Laurent, no. 284. Our code merely declares in general terms what the Code Napol\u00e9on expresses in detail.\nThe evidence shows respondent to have been guilty of acts of negligence, and his witnesses are manifestly interested and do not corroborate each other but each one speaks for himself. Judge Gill,who saw and heard them, gave a verdict for appellant, see Arpin v. The Queen ([13]), and it is altogether more probable (or to take the most extreme view, equally probable,) that some one of these many interested witnesses should be mistaken or untruthful, than that some wonderful phenomenon should have happened, at the very time when several of them were on the spot.\nArticle 1239 C. C. relieves us from making any direct proof of special negligence. We rely on the uncontradicted legal presumption against the tenant, that the fire was caused by some act or fault by him or his employees which neither he nor they are willing to acknowledge. They will not voluntarily accuse themselves but the law places on the respondent a burthen and he has failed to exculpate himself. See art 1071 C. C.; DeSola v. Stephens ([14]); The Canadian Pacific Railway v. Pellant ([15]). The tenant in the circumstances was under the necessity of using extra ordinary care to protect the premises against fire and in this obligation he made default. Sirey, Code an. art. 1733 no. 56. And in case of doubt the inference is against the tenant, upon whom has been laid the onus probandi.\nLafleur and Fortin for the respondent.\nThis is not a case where the trial judge has found facts which ought to be accepted in appellate courts; he merely has drawn inferences which are subject to the appreciation of the judges of the higher courts. The trial judge was mistaken in supposing that our Civil Code, art. 1629, corresponds with the Code Napoleon, art. 1733; our article is far less restricted than the French law, and consequently the rigorous interpretation given by French jurisprudence to the presumption there established against the lessee cannot be applied in construing the provisions of the Quebec Code. Even in France the rigorous application of art 1733 C. N. has been modified by the courts. See Sirey, Code an. no. 41 and the authorities there cited. The respondent has disassociated himself from the facts attending the origin of the fire and has established in his evidence that he used the premises only for the purposes leased and with all care required of a bon p\u00e8re de famille (art. 1626 C. C.) and has thus made such rebuttal of the presumption under art. 1629 C. C. as excuses him from civil responsibility, and shifts the onus to the plaintiff, who is bound to prove negligence to sustain his case. Evans v. Skelton ([16]). He has failed to do so. On the other hand he not only leased but actually built the premises for the purpose of leasing them to the respondent for the risky purposes of a furniture factory and knew the risk so well that he stipulated in the lease for the payment by the tenant of the extra-hazardous fire insurance rating due to the character of the trade carried on in the building. If a loss by fire exceeded the amount of the insurance the appellant is the party to be blamed. La Compagnie Royale d'Assurance v. Grandual et al, ([17]). The landlord must also be held responsible under these circumstances, for the effects of any overcrowding or want of accommodation in the building as a defect of construction for instance for inadequate provision in the closets for the number of workmen employed in such an establishment, or for want of facilities for extinguishing incipient fires, all of which he might easily have foreseen and provided for when erecting the factory buildings.\nArt. 1627 C. C. leads up to art. 1629 and shews that the lessee is permitted to rebut the presumption of fault or negligence. We have repelled the harsh presumption by evidence the credibility of which is not even attempted to be impeached, except by mere sup position or suggestion of human weakness as an obiter dictum by the trial judge ([18]) which can have no effect before this court. See remarks on the evidence by Boss\u00e9 J. in the report of the Queen's Bench judgment.\nOn the evidence no fault or negligence can be imputed to the respondent or to his employees, and in consequence he cannot be held liable in damages.\nThe Chief Justice. \u2014I am of opinion that the judgment of the Superior Court was in all respects free from error.\nThere can be no doubt of the application of art. 1629, the plain language of which required the respondent to displace the prim\u00e2 facie presumption which the law raises against him. That the respondent did not destroy this presumption is in my opinion the inevitable conclusion from the evidence. It has indeed been proved that the fire was first observed in a bale of tow in the cellar, but there was nothing to show how the fire was communicated to the tow; it must therefore be presumed that the tow became ignited through some negligence or default of the respondent himself, or of persons for whom he is responsible. There is an entire absence of evidence sufficient to shift the burden of this presumption; it therefore follows that, unless we are altogether to ignore the provisions of this art. 1629, embodying what I admit to be a very harsh rule of law, we must give this lessor the benefit of it.\nI am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Superior Court restored with costs to the appellant in all the courts.\nGWYNNE, SEDGEWICK and King J. J. concurred in the judment of Mr. Justice Girouard.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014De toutes les r\u00e8gles de notre Droit\nCivil, il n'y en a peut-\u00eatre pas qui aient donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 autant de proc\u00e9s et de divergences d'opinions que celles qui d\u00e9terminent la responsabilit\u00e9 civile. Le principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral est cependant simple:\nToute personne capable de discerner le bien du mal est responsable du dommage caus\u00e9 par sa faute \u00e0 autrui, soit par son fait, soit par imprudence, n\u00e9gligence on inhabilit\u00e9. C. C. 1053, 1071; C. N. 1382 et 1383.\nMais l'application en a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 fort embarras sante, car il n'est pas toujours facile de savoir quand il y a faute. C'est l\u00e0 plut\u00f4t une question de fait qui est laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appr\u00e9ciation des juges de premi\u00e8re instance. R\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, c'est \u00e0 celui qui all\u00e8gue la faute \u00e0 la prouver. Il y a cependant des exceptions \u00e0 cette r\u00e8gle, et la responsabilit\u00e9 du locataire envers le locateur en cas d'incendie des lieux lou\u00e9s en est une. Elle nous vient du. Droit Romain o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait pour ainsi dire une n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, vu que l'assurance y \u00e9tait inconnue. Cependant, elle n'y recevait pas l'application s\u00e9v\u00e8re que l'ancien droit fran\u00e7ais et le Code Napol\u00e9on lui ont donn\u00e9e. Le locataire n'\u00e9tait responsable de ses domestiques quo dans le cas o\u00f9 il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame en faute d'avoir pris \u00e0 son service ou re\u00e7u chez lui des peronnes de la part desquelles il y avait lieu de craindre de pareils accidents. Pandectes de Pothier, ([19]); 11 Touiller, n. 167, 168; Pothier, Contrat do Louage, n. 193; Rousseau de La Combo, vo. Incendie, n. 8; Guyot, vo. Incendie, L'ancienne France qui ne connut l'assurance contre le feu qu'apr\u00e8s le milieu du dernier si\u00e8cle, adopta tout naturellement la r\u00e8gle du Droit Romain. Les pays do droit \u00e9critt r\u00e9gis par le Droit Romain, n'eurent pas d'objection \u00e0 la suivre; elle faisait partie de leur droit commun; m\u00eame les pays de droit coutumier, sans attendre l'intervention l\u00e9gislative, n'offrirent aucune r\u00e9sistance qui vaille la peine d'\u00eatre mentionn\u00e9e. Il est vrai que Bouvot, vo. Brulement, et Guyot, vo. Incendie, citent plusieurs arr\u00eats qui semblent annoncer que les parlements de Flandre et de Dijon \u00e9taient contraires. Parmi les auteurs dont l'opinion faisait autorit\u00e9, on cite Bouvot, Henrys et Voet, et quelques autres moins connus, tels que Bertrand, Christin et Mascardus, qui soutiennent que c'est au propri\u00e9taire \u00e0 faire la preuve de la faute du locataire. Mais Bretonnier, le savant annotateur d'Henrys, nous dit que son opinion a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par la jurisprudence bien \u00e9tablie du Royaume de France. Cette jurisprudence alla m\u00eame plus loin que le droit Romain. Saligny et d'autres auteurs rendirent le locataire responsable de la faute \"tr\u00e8s l\u00e9g\u00e8re\" e; mais Godefroy, Balde, Denizart et Rousseau de La Combe, entreprennent de d\u00e9montrer que cette opinion \u00e9tait mal fond\u00e9e. Voir Guyot, vo. Incendie. Tous en seignent cependant que le locataire est responsable de ses domestiques et de tous ceux qu'il a sous son con tr\u00f4le; plusieurs arr\u00eats vont jusqu'\u00e0 exiger de sa part la preuve de l'origine de l'incendie; mais il faut avouer que certains jurisconsultes se contentent de demander comme le Droit Romain, que le locataire \u00e9tablisse que l'incendie a eu lieu sans faute de sa part ou des gens de sa maison. Ajoutons ici que l'Angleterre, qui a connu l'assurance contre le feu pr\u00e9s d'un si\u00e8cle avant la France, n'a pas adopt\u00e9 la pr\u00e9somption du Droit Romain. Le propri\u00e9taire est tenu de prouver la n\u00e9gligence du locataire comme dans les cas ordinaires. Il en est de m\u00eame en Ecosse et la Louisiane, o\u00f9 le Droit Romain forme pourtant le droit commun surtout en mati\u00e8re de responsabilit\u00e9 civile. L'article 2723 du Code de la Louisiane dit en toutes lettres que le locataire n'est responsable de l'incendie, que lorsqu'il est prouv\u00e9 qu'il a en lieu par sa faute ou celle de sa famille. A l'\u00e9poque de la promulgation du Code Napol\u00e9on, au commencement de ce si\u00e9cle, l'assurance contre le feu en France \u00e9tait encore \u00e0 son enfance, et il n'est pas surprenant qu'il ait reproduit lancienne jurisprudence. L'article 1733 se lit comme suit:\nIl (le locataire) r\u00e9pond de l'incendie, \u00e0 moins qu'il ne prouve que l' incendie est arriv\u00e9 par cas fortuit ou force majeure, ou par vice de construction: ou que le feu a \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9 par une maison voisine.\nComme l'observent le juge en chef Lacoste et M. le juge Boss\u00e9, la doctrine et la jurisprudence en France ont r\u00e9agi contre une interpr\u00e9tation litt\u00e9rale de cet article. Analysant les arr\u00eats et les commentateurs, les savants juges trouvent que pas moins de trois syst\u00e8mes diff\u00e9rents out des d\u00e9fenseurs distingu\u00e9s et que deux de ces syst\u00e8mes ont pour but d'adoucir, je dirais presque de modifier, la rigueur du texte du Code Napol\u00e9on. Aujourd'hui que le propri\u00e9taire a toute la protection d\u00e9sirable dans une police d'assurance contre le feu, \u00e0 des prix minimes qu'il peut entrer dans le prix de la location, l'esprit de justice s'est presque r\u00e9volt\u00e9 contre la s\u00e9v\u00e9rit\u00e9 de l'article 1733 du Code Fran\u00e7ais et un projet de loi fut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 dans le but de l'abroger. La commission charg\u00e9e de l'examiner se pronon\u00e7a contre, il est vrai; mais son rapport fait voir que l'\u00e9tat actuel de la jurisprudence en France est loin de la doctrine enseign\u00e9e par Toullier, Marcad\u00e9 et d'autres jurisconsultes non moins \u00e9minents:\u2014\nIci, comme partout, dit la commission, les cours et tribunaux ont accompli leur ceuvre. N'est-il pas de jurisprudence aujourd'hui, non-seulement qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que le locataire \u00e9tablisse la cause pr\u00e9cise de l'incendie, non-seulement qu'il n'est pas besoin que Ia force majeure soit d\u00e9termin\u00e9e et sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9e, mais m\u00eame que l'appr\u00e9ciation des faits qui peuvent constituer une faute de la part du preneur ou qui peuvent, au contraire, mettre sa responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 couvert, appartient souverainement aux juges de fait. 'Et, ' ajoute Guillouard vol. 1 no. 210; ' D\u00e9sormais le sens de l'article 1733 est fix\u00e9, et il n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenu dans notre l\u00e9gislation qu'avec cette interpr\u00e9tation. '\nLe locataire prouve p\u00e9remptoirement qu'on ne peut lui imputer aucune faute par imprudence ou par negligence; cela ne suffirait pas. Il faudrait encore que pour \u00e9chapper \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 qui p\u00e8se sur lui, il prouv\u00e2t la cause pr\u00e9cise de l'incendie. Pourquoi cette exigence?\nNous comprenons que le l\u00e9gislateur demande au locataire, comme \u00e0 tout d\u00e9tenteur de la chose d'autrui, la preuve que la perte de la chose qu'il d\u00e9tient est arriv\u00e9e sans sa faute.\nMais une fois cette preuve faite, que peut-on lui demander au del\u00e0? Ni les r\u00e8gles des contrats, ni les principes de la responsabilit\u00e9, si \u00e9tendue qu'elle soit, ne pourraient justifier une pareille exigence et rien u'autorise \u00e0 croire qu'elle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 dans la pens\u00e9e des r\u00e9dacteurs du code Guillouard, no. 269.\nIl y a lieu de s'\u00e9tonner que le Code de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 en 1866, ait consacr\u00e9 le principe de la pr\u00e9somption l\u00e9gale contre le locataire en cas d'incendie des lieux lou\u00e9s. Il est vrai que la jurisprudence qui l'a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e9tait dans le sens litt\u00e9ral de l'article du Code Napol\u00e9on que l'on consid\u00e9rait comme l'expression de l'ancienne jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise, et ii faut bien avouer que les arr\u00eats rendus depuis vont aussi loin. S\u00e9miinaire de Qu\u00e9bec v. Poitras, ([20]); B\u00e9lan ger v. McCarthy, ([21]). Evidemment dans ces causes et autres les tribunaux out \u00e9t\u00e9 entra\u00een\u00e9s par la doctrine ancienne et le Code Napol\u00e9on. Je dois dire de suite que je ne puis accepter leur interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 1629 du Code Civil. Cet article est d'une nature p\u00e9nale et je ne puis lui donner que le sens et la port\u00e9e que les expressions de cet article comportent. L'esprit de justice de nos gens s'est presque r\u00e9volt\u00e9 contre la rigueur de cette loi, puisque presque toujours les propri\u00e9taires y renoncent sans m\u00eame \u00eatre requis de le faire; les blancs imprim\u00e9s des notaires out m\u00eame une renonciation pr\u00e9par\u00e9e d'avance.\nL'article 1629 du Code se lit comme suit:\nLorsqul'il arrive un incendie dans les lieux lou\u00e9s, il y a pr\u00e9somption l\u00e9gale en faveur du locateur qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 cause par Ia faute du locataire-ou des personnes dont il est responsable; et \u00e0 moins qu'il ne prou ye le contraire, ii r\u00e9pond envers le propri\u00e9taire de la perte soufferte.\nEt ici, je ne crois pas pouvoir mieux exprimer na pens\u00e9e qu'en citant ce passage de M, le juge Boss\u00e9:\u2014\nOn est donc fix\u00e9 en France, sur ce point; et Si l'on y juge mainte nant ainsi, apr\u00e8s une longue experience de l'application de l'article 1733, \u00e0 plus forte raison, devons-nous, au Canada, faire de m\u00eame, sous l'empire d'un texte bien plus large et en appliquant une loi qui, au contraire du Code Napol\u00e9on, lib\u00e8re en termes expr\u00e8s le preneur, s'il prouve le contraire de la pr\u00e9somption de faute \u00e9tablie par le texte, sans limiter cette preuve \u00e0 des faits ou des causes particuli\u00e8res, mais lui laissant sans restriction la facult\u00e9 de prouver que l'incendie n'a eu lieu ni par sa faute ni par celle de ceux dont il est responsable.\nLe savant juge en chef consid\u00e8re que la faute du locataire dont il est question dans l'article 1629 est celle \" du d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 chez ce dernier.\" L'article 1629 dit plus que cela; il consacre un principe de droit p\u00e9nal qui doit recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation stricte et rigoureuse. Le savant juge est d'opinion que le locataire est responsable de la faute \"tr\u00e8s l\u00e9g\u00e8re,\" aux termes de l'article 1053. Sans admettre que la faute \" tr\u00e8s l\u00e9g\u00e8re \" soit celle qui est en vue dans l'article 1053\u2014je ne puis accepter cette doctrine. L'article 1053 n'a jamais eu l'intention d'\u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles con cernant les d\u00e9lits et quasi-d\u00e9lits pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s ou \u00e9tablis par la loi, mais seulement les d\u00e9lits et quasi-d\u00e9lits r\u00e9sultant du fait de I'homme. D'ailleurs l'article 1626 du Code indique hors de tout doute le degr\u00e9 de la faute du locataire dont fait mention l'article 1629. Cet article lui permet d \"d'user de la chose lou\u00e9e en bon p\u00e8re de famille \" et \u00e9videmment ii ne peut \u00eatre en faute tant qu'il se tient dans la limite de son droit. Tel me parait \u00eatre le sentiment des commentateurs et en particulier de Laurent, ([22]):\nD apr\u00e8s 1 article 1732, le preneur r\u00e9pond des d\u00e9gradations qui arrivent pendant sa jouissance, a moins qu'il ne prouve qu'elles ont eu lieu sans sa faute. Quelle est cette faute? Pour le bail, il ne peut y avoir de doute, puisque le preneur est oblig\u00e9 d'user de la chose en bon p\u00e8re de famille (art. 1728); c'est donc la faute g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de I'article 1137.\nOr cet article 1728 correspond \u00e0 l'article 1626 de notre Code et l'article 1137 \u00e0 notre article 1064. Domat, liv. 1, tit. 4, sect. 2, no. 4, n'exige rien de plus: Le preneur est responsable de toutes fautes \"o\u00f9 ne tomberait pas un p\u00e8re de famille soigneux et vigilant.\" Merlin, au mot \"Incendie\" du R\u00e9pertoire de Guyot enseigne la m\u00eame doctrine:\nAinsi, dit-il, point de doute que celui a qui j'ai accord\u00e9, pour un certain temps, l'habitation gratuite de ma maison, ne soit garant de l'incendie arriv\u00e9 par sa faute m\u00eame tr\u00e8s l\u00e9g\u00e8re Si le contrat ou quasi-contrat a pour objet l'utilit\u00e9 commune des parties, la faute lourde et la faute l\u00e9g\u00e8re sent r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement les seules dont on doit r\u00e9pondre en mati\u00e8re d incendie. Merlin ajoute que ce sont les termes des lois romaines et qu'elles s'appliquent au locataire.\nJe consid\u00e8re donc que le mot \" faute \" qui se trouve dans l'article 1629 r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 l'obligation impos\u00e9e au locataire par l'article 1626, et veut dire pratiquement contravention aux obligations que cet article d\u00e9cr\u00e8te. C'est \u00e0 lui \u00e0 \u00e9tablir qu'il n'y a pas eu contravention de sa part, qu'il a joui des lieux lou\u00e9s en bun p\u00e8re de famille et qu'il n'a rien fait qui put \u00eatre la cause de l' incendie. C'est une question de fait qui est laiss\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appr\u00e9ciation du tribunal.\nL'appelant invoque deux d\u00e9cisions de cette cour \u00e0 l'appui de ses pr\u00e9tentions; Jamieson v. Steel ([23]), o\u00f9, dit-il cette cour d\u00e9cida en 1878, Henry J. dissident, que le locataire \u00e9tait responsable \"as he had failed to account for the fire according to articles 1627 and 1629 of the Civil Code.\" La cause n'est pas rapport\u00e9e. Jen trouve une mention plus pr\u00e9cise dans le 2e tome du Digest de Stephens, p. 457: \" Held, confirming the judgment of the Queen's Bench, that having failed to establish that the fire occurred without any fault of his or of his men, in accordance with the terms of art. 1629 of the Civil Code, he (le locataire) should be condemned to pay the damages caused to the premises leased by him, and moreover that respondent (le pro pri\u00e9taire) having proved that it was through the negligence of appellant that the fire occurred, he was liable under art. 1630 of the Civil Code for the damages to adjoining premises.\" C'est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment la doctrine que i'ai essay\u00e9 d'\u00e9tablir La d\u00e9cision de cette cour a \u00e9t\u00e9 non pas que le locataire devait prouver l'origine du feu, ou m\u00eame l'impossibilit\u00e9 qu'il eut pris par son fait ou celui de ses employ\u00e9s, mais simplement que le locataire n'avait pas repouss\u00e9 la pr\u00e9somption de faute. M. le juge Beaudry, qui avait rendu le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure avait exprim\u00e9 la m\u00eame opinion l\u00e9gale, mais avait diff\u00e9remment appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 les faits. Suivant le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de M. Cassels, car son jugement n'est pas rap port\u00e9, le savant juge \u00e9tait d'opinion \" that the weight of evidence was that no fault could attach to the defendant or his employees.\" En appel, cette appr\u00e9ciation de la preuve fut rejet\u00e9e, Ramsay et Tessier JJ., dissidents. Ii ne faut pas oublier que les juges Beaudry et Ramsay ont pris une large part \u00e0 la confection du Code.\nL'autre cause est celle de Evans v. Skelton ([24]). L'interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 1629 donna lieu \u00e0 une savante plaidoirie de la part des avocats; mais le jugement de la cour fut bas\u00e9 sur une clause du bail qui disait que le locataire, \u00e0 son expiration serait tenu de rendre les lieux en aussi bon \u00e9tat qu'il les avait re\u00e7us u reasonable wear and tear and accidents by fire excepted\" La majorite de la cour, compos\u00e9e de Strong, Fournier et Gwynne JJ., d\u00e9cida que ces expressions suffisaient pour constituer, de la part du locateur, une renonciation \u00e0 la pr\u00e9somption consacr\u00e9e par l'article 1629 du Code Ritchie J. C. et Taschereau J. dissidents.\nIl ne me reste qu'\u00e0 examiner la question de fait. Le juge de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieur l'a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 contre le locataire mais ii suppose qu'il \u00e9tait tenu d'expliquer l'origine du feu: \"Il (le locataire) a bien prouv\u00e9 o\u00f9 et \u00e0 peu pr\u00e9s quand le feu a pris, mais rien n'explique comment il a pris.\" Ii n'\u00e9tait pas tenu, suivant moi, de faire cette preuve. Les t\u00e9moins Major, Brien-Durocher et Martineau, les seuls employ\u00e9s qui \u00e9taient dans la cave avant et au commencement de l'incendie ont vu le feu \u00e0 son origine dans les balles d'\u00e9touppe qui \u00e9taient dans la cave; ils ne peuvent l'expliquer, mais ils jurent positivement qu'il \u00e9tait impossible qu'ils aieut pu causer l'incendie. L'honorable juge ne jette aucun discr\u00e9- dit sur le t\u00e9moignage de ces ouvriers; il ne dit pas qu'il ne les croit pas; mais ii observe que s'ils ont commis quelque imprudence ou acte coupable, ii n'est pas raisonnable de supposer qu'ils viennent s'en accu ser. La Cour d'Appel \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'un avis contraire. M. le juge Boss\u00e9 observe:\nTout au contraire, rien n'indique chez ces t\u00e9moins mauvaise foi ou mauvais vouloir. Ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis a un interrogatoire des plus serr\u00e9s et n'ont montr\u00e9 ni incertitude, ni h\u00e9sitation. Leurs r\u00e9ponses sont claires et empreintes du cachet de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9. Leur caract\u00e8re et leur r\u00e9putation n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 attaqu\u00e9s. Nous devons croire qu'ils ne pouvaient l'\u00eatre, et nous devons, partant, prendre leurs t\u00e9moignages pour vrais.\nJe suis aussi de cette opinion.\nL'appelant signale particuli\u00e8rement cinq ou six faits comme autant de fautes de la part de l'intim\u00e9.\n1. Ii n'y avait pas dans la cave, comme aux autres \u00e9tages de seaux d'eau pour \u00e9teindre un commence ment d'incendie, Mais \u00e0 qui la faute? L'appelant n'avait pas m\u00eame plac\u00e9 de robinet dans la cave pour y prendre de l'eau Le locataire \u00e9tait-il tenu d'v garder des seaux d'eau pour pr\u00e9venir un incendie? Je ne le pense pas.\n2. L'intim\u00e9 n'a pas pris le soin n\u00e9cessaire des d\u00e9chets de coton satur\u00e9s d'huile. En supposant que la preuve justifierait cet avanc\u00e9, bien que c'est le contraire qui est prouv\u00e9, ces d\u00e9chets n'ont eu aucun rapport avec l'incendie. Evans v. Skelton ([25]).\n3. L'intim\u00e9 laissait ses employ\u00e9s attendre dans la cave leur tour d'aller au cabinet, m\u00eame de s'appuyer ou s'asseoir sur les balles d'\u00e9touppe qui ont pris feu. A qui la faute? Si ce n'est \u00e0 l'appelant qui a jug\u00e9 qu'un seul cabinet d'aisance suffisait dans une usine o\u00f9 se trouvaient quarante ou cinquante ouvriers. C'\u00e9tait, \u00e0 mon avis un vice de construction de la part du pro pri\u00e9taire. 4. L'intim\u00e9 n'a pas rendu compte de ses mouvements an moment du feu. Il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9 par l'appelant et il ne pouvait offrir son t\u00e9moignage dans une cause purement civile. Les t\u00e9moins Martineau, Major et Brien-Durocher jurent qu'il n'y \u00e9tait pas. Il \u00e9tait en effet en dehors, vaquant \u00e0 ses affaires, et ii ne faisait qu'arriver \u00e0 son bureau an moment de l'incendie, an dire d'autres t\u00e9moins\n5. L'intim\u00e9 n'a pas t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 la station des pompiers de la Place Chaboillez, qui se trouvait \u00e0 deux arpents de son \u00e9tablissement. Mais il a envoy\u00e9 un courrier, ce qui \u00e9tait plus s\u00fbr et aussi exp\u00e9ditif, vu la courte distance \u00e0 parcourir.\n6. L'intim\u00e9 a empil\u00e9 des balles d'\u00e9toupe dans la cave, \u00e0 quelques pieds du cabinet d'aisance. Ces balles \u00e9taient le long du mur sur la terre et dans un endroit que l'intim\u00e9 consid\u00e9rait comme offrant le plus de s\u00fbret\u00e9. Elles servaient \u00e0 la manufacture de l'intim\u00e9 qui est celle de fabriquer des meubles. La b\u00e2tisse avait \u00e9t\u00e9 non seulement lou\u00e9e, mais construite par l'appellant pour l'intim\u00e9 dans le but avou\u00e9 d'y avoir cette manu facture et ii avait m\u00eame stipul\u00e9 au bail que son locataire paierait tout exc\u00e9dent de prime que les compagnies d'assurance exigeraient \u00e0 raison de la nature de son m\u00e9tier et de fait il lui a pay\u00e9 cet exc\u00e9dent presque le double de la prime ordinaire. En mettant ces balles d'\u00e9toupe dans la cave, il n'a fait qu'user du droit que lui garantissait son bail et l'article 1626 du Code Civil. Toutes les pr\u00e9cautions possibles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises pour emp\u00eacher la communication du feu \u00e0 ces balles d'\u00e9toupe. Un passage avait \u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00e9nag\u00e9 pour permettre aux ouvriers de se rendre an cabinet; le gaz \u00e9clairait toute la journ\u00e9e \u00e0 divers endroits de la cave pour en faciliter l'acc\u00e8s; et les becs de gaz \u00e9taient soigneusement enclos dans du fer blanc on du zinc. Personne ne fumait dans toute la b\u00e2tisse et les t\u00e9moins qui ont vu commencer l'incendie jurent qu'ils n'ont rien fait pour le causer. L'incendie a eu lieu d'une mani\u00e8re inconnue, mais non imputable \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 ou \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s. C'est la conclusion \u00e0 la quelle en est arriv\u00e9e la cour d'Appel \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9 et \u00e0 moins d'erreur manifeste de sa part, la jurisprudence de cette cour et celle du Conseil Priv\u00e9 out \u00e9t\u00e9 de ne pas intervenir sur une simple question de fait.

McBeath, (1897) 27 S.C.R. 13\nDate: 1897-01-25\nThomas Adams (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nDuncan McBeath (Defendant) Respondent.\n1896: October 20, 21; 1897: January 25.\nPresent: Sir Henry Strong C.J. and Gwynne, Sedgewick, King and Girouard JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA.\nWill\u2014Undue influence\u2014Evidence.\nIn order to set aside a will on the ground that its execution was obtained by undue influence on the mind of the testator it is not sufficient to show that the circumstances attending the execution are consistent with the hypothesis that it was so obtained. It must be shown that they are inconsistent with a contrary hypothesis. APPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of British Columbia[1] reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe action was brought to set aside the will of Samuel Adams, deceased, uncle of the plaintiff Thomas. Adams, bequeathing all his estate, worth about $10,000, to the respondent a stranger in blood to the testator. The will was alleged to be invalid on the ground of undue influence on the part of the beneficiary.\nThe testator, Samuel Adams, was at the time of his death about 84 years of age. He had no relatives in Canada, the plaintiff and another nephew residing in England. He lived entirely alone, did his own cooking and took care of his house himself. On November 9th, 1891, a neighbour became uneasy at not having seen him for three or four days and summoned a friend of his (the testator's) to go into the house and see if anything was wrong, and he having done so the old man was found lying on the floor of his kitchen in a helpless condition having fallen in a fit or seizure of some kind and remained there for nearly three days. He was put in bed and assistance summoned. The respondent, with whom he had been somewhat intimate, came to see him and on the following day took him to his own house where he remained until his death.\nThe testator came to respondent's house on Tuesday November 10th, and on Wednesday he asked respondent to have a will drawn up in his (respondent's) favour. Respondent went to a solicitor and instructed him to prepare a will leaving all testator's property to him (respondent). The solicitor drew the will and went to the house, read it over to the testator and asked him if he understood it; on his replying in the affirmative the will was executed, the solicitor and a brother-in- law of the respondent being the witnesses. The testator lived for a week after the execution of the will.\nOn the trial a number of letters written by the testator to the plaintiff were put in evidence, the correspondence beginning in 1878 and continuing at intervals down to June 1891. In the earlier letters the testator informed the plaintiff that he intended leaving him the property he owned and in 1884 he said in one letter \" there will be no necessity for me to write to you again, as you now know what my intentions are, unless you should change your place of residence.\" After that there was no evidence of testamentary intentions in his letters and towards the end of the correspondence he once wrote expressing his satisfaction at plaintiff having entered an institution in Liverpool where, as he expressed it, \" you were very fortunate in getting into that institution, as you will never want anything as long as you remain in it.\"\nShortly before the last illness of the testator he had a will drawn up leaving his property to the plaintiff, but it was never executed.\nThe doctor who attended him in his last illness testified that he was perfectly capable of attending to business and that his mental faculties were unimpaired.\nThe trial judge held that the will was invalid and made a decree setting it aside. The full court reversed this judgment holding that the evidence showed capacity in the testator, failed to prove undue influence, and satisfied the court that the testamentary intentions in favour of the plaintiff, contained in his earlier letters, had been abandoned. The plaintiff then appealed to this court.\nMoss Q.C. for the appellant. The will having been executed under peculiar circumstances the onus is on the defendant, who is the sole beneficiary, to prove the testator's capacity. Tyrrell v. Painton[2]. The solicitor should have drawn the testator's attention to the fact that he was disinheriting his relatives and obtained positive evidence that he knew the full effect of his action. Hanwood v. Baker [3]; Wilson v. Wilson [4]; Boughton v. Knight [5].\nThe evidence sufficiently establishes that the testator did not express his own intention when he executed the will and was not in the mental condition required by law for such an act. See Currie v. Currie [6]; Baptist v. Baptist [7].\nS. H Blake Q.C. for the respondent. The respondent is only required to produce reasonable evidence to satisfy the court that the will was executed voluntarily and with knowledge of its contents. Barry v. Dutlin [8]; Brown v. Fisher [9].\nThe evidence of the doctor as to the testator's mental condition, and that of the witnesses who knew the circumstances under which the will was executed, make a stronger case in favour of this will than many of those reported in which the courts have refused to undo the act of a testator. See Martin v. Martin [10]; Ashwell v. Lomi [11]; Parfitt v. Lawless [12].\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014On the 18th of November, 1891, one Samuel Adams died at Victoria, B.C. On the 11th of November, a few days before his death, he had executed a will, by which all his property, consisting both of realty and personalty, and amounting in value to about $10,000.00, was given to one Duncan McBeath, the defendant and respondent in this case. The will was duly proved on the 24th of November and McBeath took possession of the property coming to him under it. On the 18th of October, 1892, this action was instituted, the plaintiff being the nephew of the deceased, for the purpose of setting aside the will and for the distribution of the estate as if the testator had died intestate. The suit was tried before Mr. Justice Crease, without a jury, and judgment was entered for the plaintiff. Upon appeal to the Supreme Court of British Columbia, (consisting of McCreight, Walkem, and Drake JJ.), the judgment of Mr. Justice Crease was unanimously set aside. This is an appeal from that judgment.\nIt was not contended at the argument that there was any lack of testamentary capacity on the part of the testator. The only ground upon which it was contended that the will in question was invalid was that it had been obtained by the sole beneficiary, the respondent upon this appeal, by exercise of undue influence upon the mind of the testator, and that the will in question did not represent his actual wishes in regard to the final distribution of his property; and the sole question at issue in this appeal is whether there was, as a matter of fact, any such undue influence.\nIn considering this question, the statement of a few obvious principles in regard to wills in general may not be out of place. In the first place, a document purporting to be a will executed in the manner prescribed by the statute, is prim\u00e2 facie a valid instrument. The onus of setting it aside is, in every case, upon him who asserts the contrary; but a will apparently valid upon its face may be invalid for many reasons. The testator may not have testamentary capacity to execute the will. That being established the will ceases to have any effect as a testamentary in- strument. Or the testator, although possessing sufficient testamentary capacity, may, in the expression of his wishes, be improperly influenced by outside parties to such an extent that the will in question does not represent his will or wishes, but the will and wishes of the party unduly influencing him.\nThat, as I have said, is the contention in the present case, and that the will therefore is bad. Lord Cranworth, in Boyse v. Rossborough[13], at page 49, says :\u2014\nOne point, however, is beyond dispute, and that is, that where once it has been proved that a will has been executed with due solemnities by a person of competent understanding, and apparently a free agent, the burden of proving that it was executed under undue influence is on the party who alleges it. Undue influence cannot be presumed.\nAnd again, at pp. 50, 51:\u2014\nThe most I can find, if indeed that can be found, is evidence to show that the act done was consistent with the hypothesis of undue influence; that the instrument, though apparently the expression of his genuine will, might in truth have been executed only in compliance with the threats or commands of his wife or that he had been led to execute it by unfounded prejudices artfully instilled into or cherished in his mind by his wife against those who would otherwise have been the probable objects of his bounty.\nBut in order to set aside the will of a person of sound mind, it is not sufficient to show that the circumstances attending its execution are consistent with the hypothesis of its having been obtained by undue influence. It must be shown that they are inconsistent with a contrary hypothesis.\nI am of opinion that this case can, and ought to be, determined upon the application of this principle laid down by Lord Cranworth. The evidence in the present case is, I admit, consistent with the contention that McBeath exercised an improper influence upon the mind of the testator, but the evidence is equally consistent with the hypothesis that he did not. I have been unable to find, apart from the fact that the testator left all his property to a person not a blood relative, a single scintilla of evidence to show that any improper influence was exercised upon him at all. The argument is :\u2014There must have been undue influence; there must have been fraud or artifice, or improper representations on the part of McBeath, otherwise the testator would not have made the will he did; and they argue that the evidence showed a settled determination on the part of the deceased for many years to leave the property to his nephew, the appellant, and that that resolution, broken as it was by the execution of the will, could only have been broken under the overmastering pressure of McBeath at a time when the testator was approaching death and was completely under the control of McBeath. A careful perusal of the evidence, and particularly of the letters which the testator wrote to the present appellant, has convinced me that the intention of the testator to devise his property to the plaintiff underwent a change a considerable time before his death. The plaintiff had become a life inmate of a mariners' home near Liverpool, England, and the deceased's later letters contain reiterated statements to the effect that he might consider himself as provided for for life. I admit that under ordinary circumstances where a person possessed of property wills it wholly to a stranger, having at the same time a wife or family, or near relatives, in respect to whom he stands under a certain kind of moral obligation, that fact alone would afford some evidence, though not conclusive, that some malign influence had been brought to bear upon the testator to perform what would naturally be considered an unnatural act, but I must confess that in the present case there does not appear to be any incongruity or anything to shock one's natural sense of justice or propriety. The testator was a bachelor; had been living alone for many years of his life at Victoria; had no friends or relatives living with him or taking care of him in his declining years. He happened for only a short time to see one of his nephews in London, England, a great many years ago, and that nephew had eventually become, what I understand to be, a pauper in an alms-house. There never had been any love or affection, or confidence, as far as I can see, between them, and to my mind there was nothing unreasonable or unnatural in his leaving his property to kind friends whom he had met and known for years in his home at Victoria. From his point of view, it would be more probable that his property would be more properly dealt with by his friends about him whom he had known for many years and who had always acted kindly towards him, than by distant relatives whom he had never seen, or whom having seen, were more likely to do more harm than good were he to bestow upon them his bounty.\nIt was urged at the argument that a letter which the respondent wrote to the plaintiff after the death of the testator was convincing evidence of undue influence on the part of the respondent. That letter, as I have said, was written after the death of the testator, and is not relevant except in so far as it may show that its writer was not a man of truth. It otherwise has no bearing upon the issue as to whether there was or was not undue influence. No doubt there would be a desire on the part of McBeath, when he had reason to believe that the will might be attacked by the plaintiff, to write to him. The letter in question may not be strictly accurate in its minute details if one examines every word of it in a critical way. It is, however, substantially accurate and does not, in my view, in any way affect the credit or veracity of the respondent. Stress was laid upon the fact that McBeath, the beneficiary, was the person who gave instructions to the solicitor who drew up the will, and it was contended that in consequence the full burden was placed upon the beneficiary to prove that that transaction was a proper one. I am not disposed to question that proposition. It has, in my view, however, been shown that the disposition that the testator made of his property was a reasonable and proper one, a disposition which might have been made, and which I believe was made, without any improper influence operating in favour of the beneficiary. The testator had a right to give his property to whom he pleased. It was, in my view, as reasonable that he should give it to a kind-hearted friend and companion whom he had known for years, and who, when he was unable to take care of himself, had kindly cared for him, as to give it to a comparatively unknown and distant relative whom he had never seen for many years, who had never shown him any evidence of affection or regard, and who had eventually become a ward of an eleemosynary institution.\nThe conduct of Mr Hall, the solicitor who drew the will, has been much criticised. All that is necessary for me to say is that there is nothing in the evidence to show that he departed from the line of professional duty. He was under no obligation, as has been contended, to explain in detail to his client the effect of the will. There could be no question as to what its effect would be. All the property of the testator would go to McBeath and none of his relatives would share in it. The solicitor was under no obligation to explain what the testator knew, or must have known, assuming testamentary capacity to exist. Whether he should have allowed McBeath to be in the room when the will was being executed is a question which must depend upon circumstances. I gather from the evidence that in the present case his presence in the room at the time of the execution of the will was in a certain sense a necessity, and nothing further need, I think, be said upon that point.\nI have not considered it necessary to go more elaborately into the details of the evidence. The learned judges of the court below have done this with great power, and I adopt what they have said with so much ability upon the subject.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of British Columbia reversing a judgment of Mr. Justice Crease upon the trial before him without a jury in an action instituted by the above appellant against the above respondent for the purpose of rescinding letters of probate of a will purporting to have been executed by an old man, the uncle of the appellant, in favour of the respondent which had been caused to be prepared by the respondent himself in terms dictated by him. The sole question involved in the action was whether or not the will in question can, under the circumstances appearing in evidence, be held to be in fact and in law the true last will and testament of the deceased. None of the relatives of the deceased resided in British Columbia. The will purports to have been executed on the 11th November, 1891, and letters probate thereof were granted on the 24th of that month.\nIt will be desirable to draw attention to the law relating to cases of wills prepared or procured to be prepared as this will was, by the respondent the sole beneficiary thereunder. Lord Cairns in the case of Fulton v. Andrew [14] uses the following language: It is said that it has been established by certain cases to which I will presently refer that in judging of the validity of a will or part of a will, if you find that the testator was of sound mind, memory and understanding, and if you find further that the will was read over to him, or read over by him there is an end of the case, that you must at once assume that he was aware of the contents of the will and that there is a positive and unyielding rule of law that no evidence against that presumption can be received. My Lords I should in this case as indeed in all other cases greatly deprecate the introduction or creation of fixed and unyielding rules of law which are not imposed by acts of parliament. I think it would be greatly to be deprecated that any positive rule as to dealing with a question of fact should be laid down, and laid down now for the first time, unless the legislature has, in the shape of an Act of parliament, distinctly imposed that rule.\nHe then lays down the rule which does apply as laid down in Barry v. Butlin [15] in the language of Baron Parke when delivering the judgment of the judicial committee of the Privy Council, thus:\u2014\nThe rules of law according to which cases of this nature are to be decided, do not admit of any doubt so far as they are necessary to the determination of the present appeal and they have been acquiesced in on both sides. These rules are two : the first that the onus proband lies in every case upon the party propounding a will and he must satisfy the conscience of the court that the instrument propounded is the last will of a free and capable testator. The second is that if a party writes or prepares a will under which he takes a benefit that is a circumstance that ought generally to excite the suspicion of the court and calls upon it to be vigilant and jealous in examining the evidence in support of the instrument in favour of which it ought not to pronounce unless the suspicion is removed and it is judicially satisfied that the paper propounded does express the true will of the deceased. These principles to the extent I have stated are well established; the former is undisputed, the latter is laid down by Sir John Nicholl in substance in Paske v. Ollat [16]; Ingram v. Wyatt [17]; and Billinghurst v. Vickers[18]; and is stated by that very learned and experienced judge to have been handed down to him by his predecessors and this tribunal has sanctioned it in a recent case namely Baker v. Batt[19].\nThen upon a question arising as to whether any fraud does or does not appear in procuring the execution of a will he says on p. 463. It is very difficult to define the various grades or shades of fraud, but it is a very important qualification to engraft upon the general state of things that the reading over of a will to a competent testator must be taken to have apprised him of the contents. If Your Lordships find a case in which persons who are strangers to the testator, who have no claim upon his bounty, have themselves prepared for their own benefit a will disposing in their favour of a large portion of the property of the testator, and if you submit that case to a jury it may well be that the jury may consider that there was a want on the part of those who propounded the will, of the execution of the duty which lay upon them to bring home to the mind of the testator the effect of his testamentary act, and that that failure in performing the duty which lay upon them amounted to a greater or less degree of fraud on their part.\nLord Hatherly in the same case p. 469 says :\u2014\nA matter which appears to me deserving of some remark and upon which the Lord Chancellor has already fully commented is the supposed existence of a rigid rule by which when you are once satisfied that a testator of a competent mind has had his will read over to him and has thereupon executed it, all further inquiry is shut out. No doubt these circumstances afford very grave and strong presumption that the will has been duly and properly executed by the testator. Still circumstances may exist which may require that something further shall be done in the matter than the mere establishment of the fact of the testator having been a person of sound mind and memory and also having read over to him that which had been prepared for him and which he executed as his will. It is impossible, as it appears to me, in the cases where the ingredient of fraud enters to lay down any clear and unyielding rule like this.\nAgain he says p. 471:\u2014\nThere is one rule which has always been laid down by the courts having to deal with wills and that is that a person who is instrumental in the framing of a will and who obtains a bounty by that will is placed in a different position from other ordinary legatees who are not called upon to substantiate the truth and honesty of the transaction as regards their legacies. It is enough in their case that the will was read over to the testator and that he was of sound mind and memory and capable of comprehending it. But there is a farther onus upon those who take for their own benefit after having been instrumental in preparing or obtaining a will. They have thrown upon them the onus of shewing the righteousness of the transaction.\nIn the introductory words of his judgment p. 468 Lord Hatherly had expressed his full concurrence in the observation which had been made by Lord Cairns. It is plain therefore, I think, that concurring as he did with Lord Cairns' observations as to fraud, his Lordship considered that the non-establishment, by a party who had been instrumental in procuring a will to be made in his favour, of the righteousness of the transaction to the complete satisfaction of the tribunal, whether a judge or a jury, before which the question was tried constituted fraud in procuring the will so as to avoid it, although it might be impossible to lay down with certainty the precise mode by which the fraud had been effected.\nWhere the will is an inofficious one, that is to say one in which, like the one now under consideration, natural affection and the claims of near relationship have been disregarded, the person propounding the will must make out a case of full and entire capacity in the testator at the time when the paper was framed, and it will not be sufficient in order to do this to make out that he was of capacity to answer a few common questions or to make a few casual remarks or even to concur and express some loose wishes and ideas as to altering his will and so on; he must satisfy the court that he was equal and alive to, and comprehended the full import of what he was doing at the time, seriously important as what he actually did must be admitted to be. This is the language of Sir John Nicholl in Montefiore v. Montefiore[20]. In Baker v. Batt [21], the language used is\nIf the person benefited by a will himself writes or procures it to be written the will is not void as it would have been by the civil law, but the circumstance forms a just ground of suspicion and calls upon the court to be vigilant and jealous and requires clear and satisfactory proof that the instrument contains the real intention of the testator.\nIn short the fact of the will being made in favour of the person who has prepared it or procured it to be written is prim\u00e2 facie evidence of fraud, which must be displaced to the satisfaction of the tribunal before which the case is tried by clear and satisfactory proof, and when the will is an inofficious one the evidence required must of necessity be of a much stronger and more conclusive character than that which might be sufficient where the party so claiming under the will was a relative of the testator.\nIn Parker v. Duncan[22] Sir James Hannen, following the rules as laid down by the House of Lords in Fulton v. Andrew,[23] adds the following:\nIt is the duty of any man who expects that a will is about to be made in his favour to see that the testator receives proper and independent advice and he should take care that the testimony called in support of the will should not be that of himself alone but that it should be independent and impartial. A person (that is a testator) is entitled to have his mind perfectly free and untramelled and when one is so very ill (referring to the testator in that case) he will do anything to get rid of importunity.\nAnd in Brown v. Fisher[24], after quoting at large the rules to govern courts in the case of a will prepared by and executed in favour of the person who prepared it, as laid down in Fulton v. Andrew [25], he concludes his judgment thus :\u2014\nOn the whole of the evidence I find that the doubt and suspicion with which I was bound to watch this case in accordance with the passage I have read (from Fulton v. Andrew [26] have not been removed, and it has not been affirmatively established, as the plaintiff was bound to establish it, that the deceased knew and approved of the contents of this document.\nThe testator at the time of the making of the will now in question was a very feeble old man. He had almost completed his 83rd year. He had been for the preceeding four years at least a great sufferer from rheumatism. He lived in a small house, wholly alone, doing himself all his household requirements. One George Barrett who lived near him and who saw him almost every day, and to whom the old man used always to apply for anything he wanted done about the house, as, to use Barrett's own language, \" picking the apples, trimming the trees or anything, \" and who had seen him last in his house on Friday, the 6th November, 1891, gives this account of the condition in which he found him on the following Monday the 9th November. He says :\u2014\nAbout noon on that day Mrs. Rivers came to my house, told me she had not seen Mr. Adams for the last two or three days\u2014she lived next door to him. I went with her to the house, got a ladder and climbed to his bedroom window, knocked at it, found he was inside by the groans and noises he made. After a time he got to the door and let me in ; he was standing in his shirt just inside the door. I closed the door immediately when I saw what state he was in. He had one eye blacked and he was in a very helpless condition, and of course I closed the door and shut the other people out and went inside and asked him what was the matter and he said he had a terrible time for the last three days and had not been able to get out of the house. He had knocked his little stove down, I suppose by falling around the room, and he had a black eye. I put him into bed and straightened up the stove, and fetched the doctor ; I knew he had to have one. I went for Dr. Milne, he came immediately\u2014felt his pulse, his heart, and sounded him around one way or another and made a remark that the clock was pretty well run down and instructed me to get some whiskey and eggs, flannel and other things and wrap him up and get him warm. His extremities were all cold. I went and got some flannel and wadding and bound him up as warm I could. I stayed with him that night, I was the only nurse that night. He could not feed himself, he was comparatively helpless. I would have to lift him out of bed and into bed and he would want to get out about every twenty minutes. * * * Mr. McBeath the defendant came there in the evening. He remained probably two hours. I think he went away about 9 or 9.30. On Tuesday morning Mr. McBeath came about 7 o'clock. I asked him if he would stay a little while I went home and got some breakfast. He said he would stay until noon-time. I went home and went to bed until noon-time and then I came back again. Mr. McBeath was there at the time. I asked him what we should do with the old gentleman, whether it would not be better to take him to the hospital. He said : \" No, he is going to my house with me. \" This was said in Mr. Adams' presence but I could hardly imagine he knew what we were talking about. I don't think he understood what was said ; I spoke to the old man about going to McBeath's house afterwards. I wanted him to go and asked him to go. He was not very willing to go at first. He did not like to leave the house. He thought I had made an excellent nurse but I persuaded him to go afterwards as I could not stay with him and nurse him, and so by the influence of Mr. Kirsop and two or three others we got him to go there * * * He did not want to leave the house. He would much rather I am sure have stayed there from what he said.\nAccordingly he was taken down in a carriage to Mr. McBeath's house. McBeath and Barrett went with him. When leaving him he bade good\u2014bye to Barrett, saying \" George I wont forget you \" or something to that effect, to which Barrett replied \" I will come down and see you again \" which he did on Thursday the 12th.\nGeorge Kirsop when he heard of Adams' illness went up to his house with one William McDonald on Tuesday the 10th November. Kirsop in his evidence says:\nWhen we got into Mr. Adams' house we saw Mr. McBeath there and Mr. Adams was supposed to be asleep in his bed. He was quiet. I never looked at him in fact. Mr. McBeath said he was asleep and I never made any inquiry any further. I had seen Mr. McBeath up to visit Adams occasionally when I lived there. Mr. McBeath said he would like the old man to come down to his house, that he and his wife would take care of him. I thought that was a very good thing if we could get him to go. Then I told Mr. McBeath that Adams had not got any will made yet, that he had been promising me for three or four years to make his will, and if we should get him to go down with him, McBeath, and if he was capable of making a will to get him to make his will. I told Mr. McBeath if he could get him to make a will if he was capable it would save the Government from eating part of it up. I told him there was $2,000 in the savings bank and this property, and that everything that he had had to go to his nephews in Liverpool : after I told Mr. McBeath this Mr. Macdonald and I left the house and at the corner met Mr. Barrett ; we had a conversation and Mr. Barrett thought it would be better to take him to the hospital. Mr. Barrett asked me to get the doctor to persuade Adams to go to McBeath's. McDonald and I went to the doctors and the doctor said he would and I went back to Mr. Adams' house and told him what I had done. I told him the doctor was coming up to persuade him to go down with Mr. McBeath. We thought it was best as he wanted nursing like a baby. I said : \" It is the best thing you can do. \" He said : \" George (meaning Barrett) is a good nurse and he will take care of me. \" I left, he would not consent to go, and I went home and got my dinner.\nThe doctor went up as he promised to use his influence to get Adams to go to McBeath's, but when he got there he found the matter had been arranged and that Adams had consented to go.\nMr. McDonald, the person referred to by Kirsop testified as follows :\u2014\nI remember before the death of Mr. Adams meeting Mr. Kirsop and going with him to Mr. Adams' house. When we got there Mr. Adams was lying in the bed asleep and Mr. McBeath was there. There was a conversation between Mr. Kirsop and Mr. McBeath in my presence. Mr. Kirsop told Mr. McBeath that if he was to take him over to his house, to get him to make a will if he was competent to. Mr. Kirsop told Mr. McBeath that he was trying to get the old man to make a will for some years; and he intended what money he had in the bank, something near $2000.00, and all the property to go to his nephews in Liverpool, that the old man had so said.\nCertain letters were produced written by the old man to his nephew the plaintiff in the action between the month of October 1878 and the month of July 1891, shewing the friendly and indeed affectionate relations existing between the old man and his nephews in England and especially between the old man and the plaintiff in the action and his children. A few extracts will suffice. In a letter of the 28th October 1878 after mentioning his rambles over the world since they had last met, 30 years previously, he tells him of his arrival in Victoria, and he says :\u2014\nI would like to hear from you and know how you and your brother William are getting on, what business you follow for a living and also what family you have. I hope you will not think I am too inquisitive in asking you these questions\u2014I have a particular reason for doing so.\nIn a letter dated 18th March, 1884, after telling him that he had been again rambling but had returned to British Columbia\u2014he says :\u2014\nDear nephew. I am very anxious to hear from you and to know how you are getting on ; it might be to you or your sons an advantage for me to have your address for I am now well up in years. I was 76 years old last January but my health is good. I am smart and active on my feet yet for a man of my age thanks to Almighty God for all his mercies towards me. I would be very glad to hear from you and how you are getting on, and also how your son is getting along and if he is still in business for himself and if he is married. You did not give me the christian names of your son and daughter in your letter. I have a little property here but no friend or relative to leave it to at my death ; it is worth looking after.\nIn a letter of July 25th, 1884, after acknowledging the receipt of a letter from the plaintiff of the 20th of June and telling him all about his property and his mode of life, he says :\u2014\nIf you should change your place of residence at any time you will be sure to let me know of it for it will be necessary for me to have it always and if anything should go wrong with me I will let you know it also, but if it should be the Lord's will that I should outlive you it will be necessary for me to know your son and daughter's place of residence. The place can be sold after my death if there is none of your family here before then and the money sent to you if you are living, and if not to your son and daughter. There will be no necessity for you to trouble yourself about writing to me after you receive this as I have your address now, unless you wish to do so.\nIn a letter dated August 22nd, 1884, after acknowledging the receipt of a letter from the plaintiff and also at the same time one from his son-in-law (Mr. Hatfield,) he says :\nPlease let Mr. Hatfield know when next you see him that I am too old now to become a regular correspondent with him but if he wants to know anything particular about this country I will give him all the information I can with pleasure. I have given you all the particulars about myself and this place in my last and you may be sure I will do what I promised you. There will be no necessity for you to write to me again as you know what my intentions are, unless you change your place of residence.\nThen in a letter of the 22nd of August, 1886, acknowledging another letter from the plaintiff, he says:\nI was very sorry when I read it to know of your son's death as he was quite a young man and also an only son. He is a great loss to his poor wife and family, but the will of God must be done but I think it would be a great loss to you if it was God's will to take your daughter Mrs. Hatfield away. Your son did not assist you in any way for the last four or five years of his life or at least since he was married but I believe it is not so with your daughter, for I think she has been a great comfort to you. I am glad to hear that her husband is so steady a man and doing so well * * * I hope you do not think I have forgotten you as I do not write occasionally to you but you may be sure I do not, for you are seldom out of my mind. I would like to know how your brother William is getting on and what he is doing for a living.\nThen he repeats his story of his lonely way of living and in a P.S. says:\nPlease give my respects to Mrs. Hatfield and tell her I am well pleased to hear she has got so good a husband.\nThen in a letter of the 7th January, 1887, after acknowledging the receipt of four portrait cards of his nephew the plaintiff and all his family, he adds:\nI am very thankful to Mr. and Mrs. Hatfield for their kindness in getting you to have their portraits taken and sent to me. I will not forget this to you or them. I thought there was no person now living that ever bestowed a thought upon me but yourself and my poor old sister Margaret but I see by this that I have been mistaken.\nIn a letter of the 24th August, 1887, he congratulates the plaintiff upon his having got into an institution, a mariners' or sailors' home, so as to be no longer depending on his son-in-law.\nThen in a letter of January 2nd, 1888, he commences thus:\nThis season of the year sets one thinking of old friends and old times and somehow I got thinking of you to-day and thought I would send you a few lines from the city of Victoria wishing you the compliments of the season.\nHe then again congratulates the plaintiff upon his having got into the institution. He then repeats the story of his lonely life and adds:\nI have not many visitors coming to see me, now that I am old their visits are few and far between. He then mentions his suffering much from the rheumatism and expresses his fear that he will never get rid of it and concludes:\nPlease give my respects to Mr. and Mrs. Hatfield when next you see them.\nThen in a letter dated October 18th, 1888, he says:\nI still continue to live in a small house by myself and do my own cooking, which is not much. I have not many visitors coming to see me but that does not trouble me much. I have suffered considerable the last two years with rheumatic pains in my head, hands and feet; I have tried a great many remedies for it but cannot find anything that will improve them for me. I have to remain in the house most part of the time. I am not able to walk about the town as I used to do two years ago. I am getting old now and also very deaf, since I got the rheumatic pains in my head.\nThen in a letter dated March 2nd, 1890, after giving a statement of his failing health and his still lonely life, he says:\nI would like to know how your brother William is getting on and also to have his address. Please give my respects to Mr. and Mrs. Hatfield when next you see them.\nIn a letter of March 5th, 1891, he inquires about the plaintiff's son-in-law in the following terms:\nI would like to know if it is your son-in-law's intention to continue on board the Liverpool and New York Packet. I think if he had a situation in some of the principal offices in New York he would do better ; the next time you see him please to let him know I was inquiring about him.\nThen in his last letter which is dated the 21st July, 1891, he says:\nI have received yours of the 2nd instant in due time. I am always well pleased to hear from you. I think I have no relation now living that ever bestowed a thought upon me but you. * * * I wish you would let me know how your brother William is getting on and what he is doing for a living, and also I wish you would send me his address. I would like to know if it is your son-in-law's intention to remain in the situation he has at present, I have a particular reason to know it. * * * Please to send me Hatfield's address when next you write. * * * I am still troubled with rheumatic pains in my hands and feet. I am now 83 years and six months old. The house I live in is a very comfortable one but very small. * * * I have not much furniture in it but just enough for my own use, as I have no visitors coming to see me. Please give my respects to Mr. and Mrs. Hatfield when next you see them.\nIn these letters the deceased never expressed a single sentence to warrant the conclusion that he had for a moment changed the intention expressed in some of them in the most explicit terms of leaving his property after his own death to his nephews and their children. It has been suggested that such an intention does appear in the congratulations which the letters contain upon the plaintiff's admission into the Sailors' Home. But the fact of the nephew having been admitted into that institution whereby his son-in-law was relieved from supporting him can surely afford no evidence of an intent to violate a voluntary, express declaration of intention as to the disposition by the uncle of his property after his death, or of his being no longer influenced by those strong sentiments of natural affection which pervade every letter to the last; however that no such conclusion can possibly be drawn from the congratulations is established beyond dispute by the evidence of the witnesses Kirsop, Williams, and Mrs. Noble, who, if those witnesses can be relied upon, prove that the deceased repeatedly expressed to them separately up to the time of his receiving the injury which he sustained on the 9th of November, 1891, such to be his intention. The learned judge appears therefore to have been perfectly justified in arriving at the conclusion as of a matter of fact that to the promises contained in those letters the deceased adhered without a single break or expression of change of intent. Yet, upon the day after he was carried in the wretched condition in which he was on the 10th of November to McBeath's house in utter disregard of all natural affection and of the sentiments to which he had always previously given expression verbally and in his letters he executed the will in question in favour of McBeath. It is admitted by McBeath that from the time of the deceased being carried to his house he never expected him to recover\u2014he thought he would die at any moment\u2014that the doctor had told him that he did not think he would get over it\u2014that it would only be a matter of time, that he would be called away any time\u2014in fact that he McBeath expected deceased's death at any moment and did not expect that he would ever get out of bed. Dr. Milne saw the deceased on the 11th November the day of the preparation and execution of the will\u2014in the afternoon\u2014he found the deceased still very feeble, in fact he was feeble all the time. The doctor could only make him hear by speaking very loud. He was very weak and suffering much pain; the doctor interrogated him as to his ailments and only as to them, and he answered him but only in monosyllables, yes, no; he was in such a weak condition and his pulse so weak and his heart so languid that on the 11th the doctor would not allow him to sit upright in bed. He directed that he should be allowed to lie down as much as possible. He was a man who in the doctor's opinion could not endure much pain. In the condition in which he was, although very weak and suffering much pain, the doctor thought him to be quite compos mentis; he could readily be persuaded to do what the doctor wanted. The doctor never heard that a will was contemplated to be made, or until after deceased's death that one had been made. About 5 o'clock upon this 11th of November, Mr. McBeath went to the office of a Mr. Hall, a young practitioner at law who was a stranger both to Mr. McBeath and to Adams, and he told Mr. Hall that the latter wished to make a will leaving all his property to him McBeath, and asked him to prepare it. Hall accordingly while McBeath waited prepared the will, and when he had finished drawing it they both went down together to McBeath's house. While on the way or in Mr. Hall's office McBeath told Mr. Hall that Adams was alone in the world, had no relatives. When they got to the house they went into the sick man's room and McBeath in a loud voice said to Adams, \" here is Mr. Hall a lawyer come with a will for you to sign.\" Mr. McBeath then, and his wife, went and lifted up Adams in his bed who during the process of being lifted up suffered much pain. With Mr. Hall's evidence as to what then took place the learned trial judge has so fully dealt in his very exhaustive judgment that I make no reference to it, further than to say that the will so prepared was signed before 7 o'clock and that during the whole time that Mr. Hall was in the sick room McBeath was also present, and assisting the deceased to sit up in his bed, to sign the will. Now from the cases already cited and others cited by the learned trial judge in his exhaustive judgment it is plain that the whole onus of removing by the most clear and satisfactory evidence, quite independently of McBeath himself, the doubt and suspicion as to the bona fides of the will and as to its not being the true and voluntary disposition of his property by the testator himself not only with full knowledge and appreciation of the contents of the will as appearing in it but uninfluenced in any way by McBeath, which doubt and suspicion the law attaches to the fact of the will having been prepared by and under the direction of McBeath, was cast upon him. The learned judge has found as a matter of fact in his most exhaustive judgment that the most material points relied upon by McBeath, namely the alleged promises by Adams to leave to him his property at his death and the instructions alleged to have been given to McBeath to get a lawyer to make a will in his McBeath's favour for Adams to sign depended wholly on McBeath's own evidence and that in the presence of the contradictory evidence to which the learned judge draws the fullest attention it was impossible to accept the evidence of McBeath as true. In fine he says, and it is to be remembered he is dealing with matters of fact and with credibility of witnesses examined before himself,\ninstead of removing the suspicion the necessary inferences from all the circumstances and facts before the court point rather to their increase than their dissipation. The doubtful and contradictory evidence of McBeath, the prevarication of his wife of a vital fact to Mr. Noble, the descrepancies in the evidence of the McBeath's and Modeland's ; the refusal of wife and sister-in-law thrice repeated to support McBeath in his statement of old Adams' instructions and promises in his favour in making the will; the absurd pretension of intimacy for years with a man who would tell him nothing of his age, nationality, relations, or of his property; the alleged promises to leave the property to McBeath in violation of the written promises of his life, to leave all to his nephews and their descendants * * * * * * have only increased rather than cleared away those doubts and suspicions with which the law insists upon regarding a will made under such circumstances as the present.\nThen in another place, drawing attention to a statement of McBeath's that (at a time when from deceased's letter to the plaintiff it appeared that he was in California) Adams had said to him,\nthat he had nobody to leave his property and he would just as soon leave it to me as to any one. Being asked upon this, did he say he had no one to leave his property to ? He replied, yes sir, he said he had no friend to leave it to and would as soon leave it to me as to any one he knew of and he had no one else to leave it to ?\nWhat confidence, says the learned judge, can one place in such a witness ?\nHe draws attention in another place to his statement of ignorance as to the property which the deceased possessed until after the will was made, and his contradiction of what Kirsop in Macdonald's pre- sence had told him when he was taking Adams down to his house, and to what Williams also had told him about the will in pencil which the deceased had showed Williams in September 1891, whose testimony in rejection of McBeath's the learned judge believed, and then to the letter of the 28th December, 1891, to the plaintiff after his uncle's death which the learned judge characterised upon the evidence before him as being full of suggestion and suppression i e, suggestio falsi and suppressio veri. But it is useless to go through all the points in which the learned judge has found McBeath's evidence as unworthy of belief, and if unworthy of belief it is difficult to understand how the evidence of any of the other witnesses can remove the doubt and suspicions as to the bona fides of the will and as to its righteousness, as said by Lord Hatherley in Fulton v. Andrew [27].\nAs to the evidence of the doctor, after showing the very imperfect material upon which he based the opinion which he gave that upon the 11th November, 1891, the deceased was of perfectly sound mind and understanding to dispose of his property by will, and after citing passages of the law relating to wills made by a person in extremis as the deceased in this case was, as follows:\nIn examining the capacity of a person under these circumstances we should avoid putting leading questions which suggest the answer \" yes or no. \" Thus a dying man may hear a document read over and affirm in answer to such a question that it is in accordance with his wishes but without understanding its purport. This is not satisfactory evidence of his having a disposing mind; we should see that he is able to dictate the provisions of the documents and to repeat them substantially from memory if required. If he can do this accurately there can be no doubt of his possessing complete testamentary capacity. But it may be objected that many dying men cannot be supposed capable of such an exertion of memory. The answer is then very simple; it is better that a person should die without a will, and his property be distributed according to the law of intestacy than that through any failing of his mind he should unknowingly cut off the rights of those who have the strongest claims upon him\nhe then shows that the doctor made no such, nor indeed any, examination of the deceased save of the most superficial character very far from establishing that an old man of the age of the deceased who had been for some years subject to the tortures of confirmed rheumatism in head, hands and feet, and who had been exposed to the frightful exposure, starvation and cold as the deceased had been exposed to for the three days preceding the 10th of November, could upon the 11th when in such a weakened condition of body, and in extremis, and dying as he then was, have had his mind quite unaffected by the physical tortures he had suffered and was still suffering, and in that perfectly sound condition required for the making of a will. The proper test to determine whether in the condition in which he was physically he had or not that mental capacity to make a will which in such a case ought to have been applied, never was applied.\nThen as to the conduct of Mr. Hall who appears to have acted as being the solicitor of McBeath and not of the deceased, he points out that he did not, as he should have done if acting as the solicitor of the deceased, insist upon having a private interview with him, in which he should have put to him suitable questions to elicit what was the real intent of the deceased as to the disposition of his property, and from instructions so taken from the deceased himself and not from McBeath he should have prepared the will\u2014and had he so done he would have been in a position to give evidence as to the capacity which he was not in, acting as he did.\nThe shortcoming of Mr. Hall was, he says, the want of experience in the ordinary practice of testing the capacity of a testator, ensuring the exercise of his free intelligence and bringing to his notice and memory any relatives he might have intended to benefit in the disposition of his property. It is very possible that the recollection he twice mentioned of the defendant's having told him when he came to his office or on his way to the house that old Adams was alone in the world\u2014that he had no relatives living\u2014put all thoughts of possible relations out of his head.\nThen as to the question testified to by Mr. Hall, \" can I alter this, \" and the remark when told he could, \" this ought to have been done long before, \" the learned judge asks what did the old man understand of it all in his feeble condition :\nTo my mind, says the learned judge \" can I alter this, \" in view of all the circumstances, tells the tale, and, this should have been done long before, points the same way\u2014what he wanted for years\u2014long before, the letters to his nephew tell us, and the promises which, very likely, he thought he was carrying out through the medium of McBeath in favour of his relations.\nThere is, he adds, only one other alternative view, that, surrounded as he was in McBeath's by his family and relations, in this weak and feeble state in McBeath's arms and the other influences around him, when the question was put to him: Are you willing to leave everything to McBeath? what other answer could he give than what to him was far beyond the nature of a request.\nAnd he concludes that the questions put by Mr. Hall to the deceased and his replies thereto were quite inadequate to remove the suspicion either of want of a clear understanding of the document or of that form of coercion to which the surrounding circumstances in his view of them clearly point.\nIn this judgment of the learned judge who tried the case, so far from finding anything which sitting in appeal I could pronounce to be clearly erroneous, I must say that I entirely concur. The question before the learned judge was one of fact depending upon the credibility of the witnesses and a due appreciation of the credible evidence given. The learned judge has, upon the most abundant evidence, found as fact that the deceased had for years and until the last moment preceding the frightful sufferings which he endured during the three days preceding the 10th November, 1891, entertained the fixed intention of leaving his property at his death to his own relations, in conformity with that natural affection for them which he appears to have had in an eminent degree. When then on the day after he was taken to McBeath's house we find him signing a will which leaves all his property to McBeath, who can be regarded in no other light than a perfect stranger, a mere acquaintance with whom the old man was less intimate than he was with Barrett or Kersop and Williams to whom he had often spoken of his relations and repeatedly stated his intention of leaving his property to them at his death; and when we find that the only instructions given for the will were given by McBeath himself, who also interfered in the manner described by Mr. Hall, by holding up the old man in his bed until the will was signed, it is but natural and reasonable that we should demand what in the case of a will so prepared and made the law requires to be given by a person in the position of McBeath in such a case, clear and intelligent and sufficient reasons for such a sudden and so extraordinary a change of intention and the most clear satisfactory and independent evidence to remove the doubts and suspicions which the law casts upon such a will so prepared, doubts and suspicions not only as to the perfect testamentary capacity of the testator in the miserably reduced physical condition in which he was, but also as to the bona fides of the will and of McBeath, and that the physical weakness of the testator was taken advantage of by McBeath in whose power he was and that the testator was in some manner influenced by McBeath to make the will in his favour. The circumstances as detailed in the evidence which the learned judge has accepted as true were well calcu- lated to give rise to the very gravest doubt and suspicions both as to the capacity of the testator and also as to the bona fides of McBeath.\nThe reasons suggested by him as to the testator's motives in leaving his property to him the learned judge who had the best opportunity of forming an opinion upon the evidence has pronounced to be incredible, and McBeath to be unworthy of belief; the learned judge has given most full and satisfactory reasons for his arriving at this conclusion.\nThe learned judges of the Supreme Court of British Columbia sitting in appeal have thought that the evidence of Dr. Milne and Mr. Hall supplies all that is wanting in McBeath's evidence and in fact all that is at all necessary, but the learned trial judge has in his very exhaustive judgment shewn that in a case like the present the facts upon which these gentlemen formed their opinions are wholly inadequate to support the opinions formed and it is with the facts upon which opinions are formed and not the opinions themselves that we have to do. Those facts are of the most superficial nature possible. The opinions formed upon them might be allowed to pass without observation in the case of an ordinary will in which no doubt or suspicion existed as to the will being the voluntary expression of the intention as to the disposition of his property by a person of competent capacity; but in a case like the present where the greatest doubts and suspicions are by the law attached to the will which doubts and suspicions must be removed by the most clear and satisfactory evidence, the learned judge has, I think, shewn very clearly that neither the doctor or Mr. Hall applied the tests which the law and common sense required to be applied in such a case; neither the doctor nor Mr. Hall appear to have at all regarded the case as one which called for any special inquiry. In the doctor's evidence there are some facts however which might have led the doctor to see that there did exist some good reason for the doubts and suspicions which the law attaches to a will prepared and executed as was the one under consideration. He says that upon the 11th in the afternoon, before the will was signed (and of any intention to make a will at all the doctor had not any intimation whatever), he found Adams still suffering much\u2014very feeble\u2014very deaf\u2014the doctor had to speak very loud to make him hear\u2014the doctor interrogated him as to his ailments but only as to them\u2014Adams answered intelligently\u2014but only in monosyllables\u2014Yes and no. He was a man, the doctor says, who could not bear much pain\u2014that seemed to be the character of the man, however brave he might be otherwise\u2014that is to say otherwise than in his then low suffering physical condition. In his then condition he could not stand much pain and the doctor could readily persuade him to do what he wanted. His pulse was very weak\u2014his heart languid so much so that he would not allow him to sit up in bed and gave directions that he should be allowed to remain lying down perfectly quiet. Now in Ingram v. Wyatt [28] we find among the marks of senile imbecility constituting testamentary incapacity\u2014 \"inertness of mind \"\u2014\" paucity of ideas\"\u2014\"timidity\"\u2014 \"submission to control\"\u2014\"acquiescence under influence\"\u2014and the like. Two of these marks the doctor admits having observed without however inducing him to make any more than a cursory observation of the physical condition of the patient whom he knew to be on his death bed. The doctor's excuse must be that he never heard of any intention to make a will; a closer examination would, it seems not unlikely from the extremely low and painful condition in which the old man was physically, very probably have shown some of the other marks of senile imbecility above mentioned. Now if the doctor found his patient in such a low condition that he could be easily influenced to do what was wanted, it is possible that Mr. McBeath had acquired the same knowledge, and the circumstances attending the signing of the will by Adams as detailed by Mr. Hall himself are open to the gravest suspicion ; they were well calculated to blind Mr. Hall, a perfect stranger both to McBeath and Adams, (and may be for that reason that he was the lawyer employed) to the true nature of the transaction in which he was taking part. That a man in the miserably low physical condition to which the old man was reduced by the sufferings which he had endured and was still enduring could, to avoid importunity, be easily influenced to do anything which the man in whose house he was dying, and in whose power he was and to whom he would be indebted for whatever ease of body and peace of mind he should enjoy in his dying moments, should ask or suggest, we can readily understand, and assuming any influence whatever of importunity or otherwise to have been exercised by McBeath certainly his conduct upon entering the sick man's room with Mr. Hall was well calculated to attain his object while concealing his intent. Upon entering the room he called in a loud voice to the old man lying down quietly in his bed apparently asleep \"here is Mr. Hall a lawyer with the will for you to sign ;\" then he proceeded directly to lift the old man up and with the assistance of Mrs. McBeath lifted him up and made him sit up straight in the bed, (which the doctor that day had forbidden) until the will was signed. While being lifted up Mr. Hall observed that the old man suffered much pain. Then the fact of the will having been made, having been not only sup- pressed but actually denied by McBeath's wife who was a party assisting in holding the old man up until it was signed, and never spoken of until after the old man's death were facts which, together with the statements in the letter of the 28th December to the plaintiff, were well calculated to increase rather than remove the doubts and suspicions attending the transaction. Upon the authority of Parker v. Duncan[29] referred to by the learned trial judge among the numerous cases upon which he proceeded in forming his judgment, it was the duty of McBeath upon his own showing to have taken very particular pains to have provided the old man under his care and roof, and whom he admits he knew to be dying, with proper and independent advice in the preparation of his will; none was provided, for Mr. Hall cannot be said to have been, or to have acted as if he was, solicitor for Adams. There cannot be a doubt that Mr. Hall is right when he said that McBeath, either in his office or on the way down to the house with the will, told him that Adams was alone in the world without any relations, and that McBeath knew such statement to be false we cannot doubt to be established by the evidence of Kersop and McDonald which the learned judge has accepted and believed to be true while he rejected that of McBeath as unworthy of belief. What object can McBeath be supposed to have had in making this false statement to Mr. Hall unless for some purpose to blind him? Had this case been tried by a jury and had they arrived at the same conclusions as has the learned judge and had they rendered their verdict accordingly, such verdict could not possibly in my opinion be set aside either as being contrary to, or against the weight of evidence. The finding of the learned judge whose professional training has made him more competent to weigh evidence and appreciate its value is surely entitled to equal weight with the verdict of a jury.\nIn fine I must say that I concur with the learned judge that the defendant in the action has wholly failed to remove the doubts and suspicions which the law attaches to the will by reason of its having been prepared under his direction ; nay more that the defendant's untruthfulness in the many particulars in which the learned judge has found him to be unworthy of belief, rather tends to increase instead of removing those doubts and suspicions. The appeal therefore, in my opinion, should be allowed with costs and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored and affirmed, which, in my opinion cannot be reversed consistently with due regard being paid to the authority of the many cases cited by the learned trial judge as enunciating the law applicable to the case.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Gordon Hunter.\nSolicitor for the respondent: H.

C),\u2014Municipal regulations\u201423 Vic. (Can.), c. 85.\nIn 1768 the Seigneur of Berthier granted an island called \" I'\u00eele du Milieu,\" lying adjacent to the \" Common of Berthier \" to M. his heirs and assigns, (ses hoirs et ayants cause,) in consideration of certain fixed annual payments and subject to the following stipu latinn;\u2014\" en outre \u00e0 condition qu'il fera \u00e0 ses frais, s'il le juge n\u00e9cessaire, une cl\u00f4ture bonne et valable, \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve des animaux de la Commune, sans aucun recours ni garantie \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard de Ia part de sieur seigneur, lesquelles conditions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9es du dit sieur preneur, pour suret\u00e9 de quoi il a hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9 tous ses biens pr\u00e9sents et \u00e0 venir, et sp\u00e9cialement la dite isle quiy demeure affect\u00e9e par privil\u00e9ge, une obligation ne d\u00e9rogeant \u00e0 l'autre.\"\nHeld, reversing the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench, Strong C. J., dissenting, that the clause quoted did not impose merely a personal obligation on the grantee, but created a real charge or servitude upon l'\u00eele du Milieu for the benefit of the \" Common of Berthier.\"\nThat the servitude consisted in suffering inroads from the cattle of the Common wherever did whenever the grantee did not exclude them from his island by the construction of a good and sufficient fence.\nThis servitude results not only from the terms of the seignorial grant, but also from the circumstances and the conduct of the parties from a time immemorial.\nThat the two lots of land alihough not contiguous were sufficiently close to permit the creation of a servitude by one in favour of the other. That the stipulation as contained in the original grant of 1768 was not merely facultative.\nThat the servitude in question is also sufficiently established by the laws in force in Canada at the time of the grant in 1768, respecting fencing and the maintenance of fences in front of habitations or settlements.\nAppeal from the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) affirming the judgment of the Superior Court by which the plain tiffs' action was dismssedd with costs.\nThe action was brought for the purpose of obtaining from the defendant the recognition of a real right and damages, (action confessoire). The plaintiffs claimed. the right as in the nature of a real servitude and dam ages for trouble and loss caused by failure to comply with it. A full statement of the facts appears in the judgments reported.\nGeoffrion Q. C. for the appellants. We claim that a servitude was established by the original deed of concession of the Ile du Milieu, respondent's pro perty, by Hon. James Cuthbert, seigneur de Berthier, to Zacharie Macaulay, bearing the date 17th February 1768, which provided as follows:\u2014\nCette concession ainsi faite \u00e0 la charge de payer * * * deux cents livres tournois, pour tout droit de cens et rente seigneuriale, en outre \u00e0 condition qu'il fera \u00e0 ses frais, s'il le juge n\u00e9cessaire, une cl\u00f4ture bonee et valable, a l'\u00e9preuve des animaux de la Commune, sans aucun recours ni garantie a cet \u00e9gard, de la part du Sieur Seigneur.\"\nThe \" Common \" or dominant land, is the property of appellants, which they administer in virtue of their act of incorporation, 23 Vict. ch. 85.\nWe have taken the confessory action (Pothier, Servi tudes, nos. 11, 12,) founded on art. 2257 Civil Code, for the judicial recognition of the servitude in the terms of the deed quoted and for a new title to be furnished by respondent according to law.\nAt the time of the deed one proprietor could force another to construct a division fence between their respective properties under the provisions of the Or dinance of Begon, dated 10th., June, 1724, respecting fences and ditches ([1]).\nThis constituted a reciprocal servitude which was modified by the agreement in the deed.\nThe deed made it a condition of the grant that Zacharie Macaulay should assume the sole respon sibility for a fence, if he considered one necessary, and if he built a fence he alone should pay for it. It is therefore a charge on the land granted that it alone shall be responsible for the cost of any division fence. And such charge is laid upon it for the purpose of freeing the grantor and his land from the charge of contributing his share, in other words from the servi tude due by his land. Thus on the one hand the ser vitude imposed by law on the land granted is aug mented, and that on the land of the grantor is abol ished by this condition of the grant. There can con sequently be no doubt that this condition created a conventional servitude in the place of that formerly existing by virtue of the ordinance. If he does not think such a fence necessary, or fails to build one, he cannot complain if the animals from the Common stray upon his land. Any uncertainty on this point is removed by the words sans aucun recours, ni garantie \u00e0 cet \u00e8gard de Ia part du Sieur Seigneur. He must build a fence or suffer the animals trespassing as he is charged by his title with one or other of these alternatives.\nBut in addition to the charge laid on respondent's land it must be remembered that the land of appel lants has been freed from the charge of contributing to the expense of a division fence. This is a real right charged on respondent's land, and the appellants have clearly a right to ask that the respondent give them a new title to prevent the prescription of this right, Monastesee v. Christie ([2]). Otherwise aiter the lapse often years, the respondent could force the appellants to construct with him at their joint expense a division fence. C. C. arts. 505, 2251. The appellants ask for a new title in the terms of the original deed and for damages occasioned by the respondent's conduct. Cases of similar servitudes are reported in Murray v. Mac pherson ([3]); Hamilton v. Wall ([4]); Dorion v. The Seminary of St. Sulpice ([5]); Mondelet v. Roy ([6]).\nRobidoux Q. C for the respondent. The case raises simply a questoin of servitude. To the action the re spondent has pleaded that the terms upon which the first purchaser obliged himself to fence said Isle du Milieu, if he thought fit, or if he deemed it necessary, did not create any servitude thereon to the benefit of the Common of Berthier; that the deed could only produce a personal obligation, if susceptible of creat ing any obligation at, all; but that even a personal obligation could not arise from such a stipulation, which left its execution or non-execution to mere wish or caprice. Art. 1081 C. C.; Larombi\u00e8re, Th\u00e8orie des Obligations (ed. 1885) vol. 2, p. 349 sur l'art. 1174 C. N. par. 2 & 3; 6 Touillier, no. 499; 11 Duranton, nos. 22 et 23; Dalloz v\u00b0. \" Servitude,\" art. 1001, r\u00e8gie 6.\nThe latter part of art. 1081 C. C. is elucidated by Pothier ([7]) who declares that where the act which constitutes the condition is done, or not done, accord ing to the case, the obligation may be enforced.\nNo servitude can be created by the renunciation of an action of damages, or of the right to compel others to make their share of fences between adjoining pro perties. Such a renunciation would create, by anticip ation, a discharge in favour of appellants, but it would not create a charge on l'lle du Milieu for the Common of Berthier, and the two essential elements of a servitude would still be wanting. The contract did not charge, but on the contrary actually discharged a duty, and even the Seignior could not complain if the fence was not built. The character and requisites of a servitude or easement are entirely wanting in this case. Goddard on Easements, 4 ed. ch. 1, s. 1; C. c. art. 499. There is no real property on which a charge has been imposed, nor is there any for the advantage of which a charge has been created.

A servitude cannot be in faciendo.\nThe demand for a renewal deed can be supported only in the cases particularized in arts. 2061, 2249 and 2257 of the Civil Code. None of these articles apply to fencing \" s'il le juge n\u00e8cessaire.\" Neither do articles 504 and 505 C. C. apply, because the lands in question are not contiguous. They are divided and bounded by a channel. The same objection excludes the application of the ordinance of the Intendant Begon of 10th., June, 1724. The parties used words in the original deed of concession corresponding with the provisions as to the \" cl\u00f4ture bonee et valable,\" required by the same Intendant's ordonnance of 19th June 1714. Cuthbert and Macaulay had this ordi nance in view, when they covenanted as they did in relation to the fence. The seignior wanted to release himself from the obligation of fencing and this is why we find in the deed the words: \" sans recours ni garan tie \u00e0 cet \u00e8gard de la part du dit seigneur,\" meaning that he will not be responsible should cattle pasturing on the Common trespass on Macaulay's land.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench ought to be affirmed.\nThis is an action confessoire to have it declar ed that a clause in a notarial deed passed on the 17th February, 1768, by which the Hon. James Cuth bert, then the Seigneur of Berthier, sold and conceded an island in a channel of the River St. Lawrence, known as l'Isle du Milieu to Zachary Macaulay, the predecessor in title of the respondent, constituted a servitude on the property so sold in favour of the com mon lands of the seigniory, situated on the main land retained by the vendor, and to have a renewal of title. If no servitude was established the action cannot be maintained. The clause in question is as follows:\nCette concession ainsi faite \u00e0 la charge de pavel, tous les ans, au jour de St.-Martin, onze de novembre, done le premier paiement se fera \u00e0 pareil jour de Ia prochaine, au Domaine de la Seigneurie de Berthier la somme de deux cents livres tournois, pour tout droit de cens et rentes seigneuriales, en outre \u00e0 condition qu'il fera \u00e0 ses frais, s'il le juse n\u00e8cessaire une cl\u00f4tuee bonne et valable, \u00e0 l'\u00e8preuve des animaux de la Commune, sans aucun recours, ni garantie \u00e0 cet \u00e8gard de la part du Sieur seigneur.\nThe appellants who are the successors in title of the vendor, Cuthbert, contended that this clause imposed a servitude. The respondent insists that if it was obli gatory at all, it constitueted a mere personal obligation upon Macaulay and his heirs.\nBoth the courts below have held that no servitude was created, and in this view I entirely concur.\nThe decision must of course depend on the old law as it stood at the date of the concession, and the Civil Code is only applicable indirectly and so far as it tends to show what was the ancient law, so far as it has been there reproduced and formulated. The law has always been as the articles 637 and 686 of the French Code, and more concisely the article 545 of the Quebec Code declare, viz., that a servitude is imposed upon an immovable in favour of an immovable, and not on a person nor in favour of a person ([8]); and this has always been the law as well under the codes as under the ancient r\u00e9gime.\nThe servitude, then must therefore consist either in the submission of the owner of the servient property to have something done on his land by the owner of the dominant property, or in the abstention of the former from doing something which he otherwise would have the right to do on his neighbour's land.\nThe definition given by Pothier in his introduction to the 13th title of the Custom of Orleans (which ap plied also to the Custom of Paris), is most clear and decisive to show that the servitude must (subiect to an exception not material, to be noticed hereafter) con sist in a mere negative submission on the part of the servient owner to some right conceded to the dominant owner. Pothier ([9]) says:\nLe droit de servitude est le droit de se servir de la chose d'autrui \u00e0 quelque, usage, ou d'en interdire quelque usage au propri\u00e8taire ou possesseur jus fociendi aut prohiendi aliquid in alieno.\u2014La servitude, de la part de celui qui la doit, ne consiste done \u00e0 autre chose qu'\u00e0 souffrir que celui \u00e0 qui est est due, se serve de la choee pour l'usage pour lequel il a droit de s'en servir, ou \u00e0 s'abstenir de ce que celui \u00e0 qui elle est due a droit d'emp\u00eacher qu'on y fasse. Au reste, les droits de servitude no obligent point le possesseur de l'h\u00e9ritage qui Ia doit, \u00e0 faire quelque chose ou \u00e0 donner quelque chose: en quoi ces droits different des droits de redevance fonci\u00e9re et des droits de corv\u00e9e Servitutum non ea nature es,. ut aliguid faciat quis * * * * sed ut aliquid patiatur, aut non fsaciat, L. 15, 1 Dig. de servitutibus,\nThat the principle of the Roman law, servitus in patiendo non in faciendo consistit, has always prevailed in the French law, as well before as since the codes, is also clearly and directly shown by the following' additional authorities:\nLalaure, Trait\u00e9 des Servitudes R\u00e9elles, p. 3. Merlin,. Rep. V\u00b0. Servitude ([10]); Giraud, L'ancien Droit Cou tumier ([11]). Demolombe, vol. 12, nos. 676-677-871 to 880, 881-883. Pandectes Francaises vol. 5 ([12]). Male ville, vol. 2, p. 128. Pardessus, Trait\u00e9 des Servitudes,. Pp. 48-49. Toullier, vol. 3, p. 427. Huc, Commen taire du Code Civil p. 403-406-432. Laurent, vol. 7, no. 147. Baudry-Lacantinerie and Chauveau, Trait\u00e9 de droit Civil Des Biens, no. 812. These authors all agree in stating that the rule of the Roman law in this respect is, and always was, that of the French law. If the service imposed consisted, as in the present case,. entirely in some active duty or obligation imposed on the owner of the pretended servient property, it was not a servitude, but a mere personal obligation which bound the owner and his heirs but did not form a charge upon the property itself accompanying it into the hands of purchasers and others to whom it might be subsequently conceded. No change in the law (if any there had been) by the Quebec Code could have made any difference in this respect, as the code had no retroactive effect. No change was, however, made. The definition of a servitude given in art. 545 of the Code is precisely the same definition which would_ have applied before its promulgation. Art. 686 of the Code Napoleon which defines a servitude is more full and precise than art. 545 of the Quebec Code,. but both have the same meaning, and the provision of the former\nque les services \u00e9tablis ne soient impos\u00e9s ni \u00e0 la personne ni en faveur de la personne mais seulement \u00e0 un fonds et pour un fonds is as much the rule under the Canadian law as under the French law. This proposition canntt and has not been disputed. The only question is as to the appli cation of this well established rule of the law of property to the Acte of 1768.\nThe only qualification of the rule which. requires that in order to constitute a servitude, the servcces imposed shall consist in patiendo and not in faciendo is that found in art. 554 of the Quebec Code which is verbally identical with 698 of the Code Napoleon, and which is thus expressed:\nCes ouvrages sont \u00e0 ses frais, et non \u00e0 ceux du proprietaire du fonds assujetti, a moins que le titre constitutif de la servitude ne dise le contraire.\nThis article is relied on as showing that the parties may by their conventions alter the rule referred to.\nIn the first place, as before observed, the present case does not depend upon the code, and the only pur pose which a referenee to it can serve is to show indi rectly that the codifiers having reproduced this provi sion as part of the ancient law, and not as new law, it is to be assumed that the same rule prevailed under the Custom. Grranting, however, that this was the rule of the ancient law, and that in this respect there has been no innovation by the new legislation I am still of opinion that there is nothing in the provision, con tained in the words, \u00e0 moins que le titre constitulif de la servitude ne dise le contraire which in any way qualifies the rule that the services imposed by a servi tude must be negative and not positive, and that this rule cannot be altered by the convention of the parties. For this the highest authorities may be quoted.\nThe proposiiion I advanee is that this provision ap plies only to subsidiary and incidental acts, to be per formed by the servient owner in the case of a servi tude properly constituted, and not to the constitution. of the servitude itself. This cannot be better ex plained than it is by Demolombe ([13]), who after having (in no. 676) laid down the principle that the servitude must be negative and cannot be active, proceeds in the next number (667) to discuss the exception, or supposed exception to it contained in art. 698 C. N. ([14]). This passage is so apposite that I extract it at length:\nNo. 677. Mais, dira-t-on, il r\u00e9sulte de i'article 698 que le propri\u00e9-taire du fonds assujetti petit \u00eatre charg\u00e9 par le titre de faire, \u00e0 ses frais les ouvrages n\u00e9cessaires pour l'usage on la conservation de laservitude, et m\u00eame l'article 699 ajoute que, dans ce cas, il peut toujours affran chir de Ia charge, en abandonnant le fonds assujetii au propri\u00e9taire du fonds, auquel la servitude est due. Voil\u00e0 done une charge qui peut etre impos\u00e9e \u00e0 la personne. c'est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 tout propri\u00e9taire, quel qu'il colt et sera, d'un fonds, en cette qualit\u00e9 pour Putilit\u00e9 d'un fonds appartenant \u00e0 un autre propri\u00e9taire ! N'y a-t-il pas d\u00e8s lors antinomie entre l'article 686 et les articles 698 et 699? Non sans doute: et il importe de bien distinguer ici le fait principal, qui constitue la servi tude elle-m\u00eame, d'avec les ouvrages accessoires qui sont n\u00e9cessaires pour en user on pour la conserver. La servitude elle-m\u00eame, le fait principal dans lequel elle consiste, ne peut jamais \u00eatre impos\u00e9 \u00e0 la personne. Voil\u00e0 l'article 686 dont la disposition absolue n'est aucune ment modifi\u00e8e, sous ce rapport par l'article 698. Ce que l'article 698 autorise seulement c'est de mettre \u00e0 la charge du fonds assujetti, les ouvrages accesooires et les moyens d'ex\u00e9cution n\u00e9cessaires pour l'exer cice de la servitude. Par cons\u00e9quent, pour que Particle 698 puisse \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9, il faut toujours\n(1). Qu'il y ait, independamment des ouvrages qui sont mis \u00e0 la charge du propri\u00e9taire du fonds assujetti, une servitude princrpale, . distincte de ces ouvrages eux-m\u00eames qui en doivent \u00e9tre que le moyen d'exercice (Comp. Vinnius Inst, de Servit. No. 1; Pardessus, tome 1, No. 19; Molitor de la Possession p. 303 in fine.)\n(2). Que les ouvrages aient en effet, v\u00e9ritablement pour but l'exer cice ou la conservation de la servitude; car il est clair que s'ils y \u00e9taient \u00e9trangers, ils constitueraient, par eux-m\u00eames, une autre servitude principale, qui serait impos\u00e9ed \u00e0 la personne, contrairement \u00e0 l'article 686.\nIn no. 873 of the same volume, demolombe further discusses 'the same questonn as to the effett of art. 698 0.N. ([15]) and shews that this exception of an incidental or secondary servitude of repair or maintenance, might, in the case of one single servitude, that of oneris ferendi, even by the Roman law, have been imposed by convention on the servient owner, and that this excelp tion prevailed without in any way infringing on the rule that such an active servitude could only be an accessory to some principal servitude which itself must have been constituted with due regard to the rule in patiendo non in faciendo servitus consistit. Next, the learned author points out that art. 698 was a general isation of the exception of the Roman law, which in that system was confined to the particular servitude mentioned.\nBaudry-Lacantinerie, et Chauveau, Trait\u00e9 de Droit Civil ([16]) no. 1,130, commenting on art. 698, say:\nPour que la stipulation mettant les ouvragss \u00e0 la charge du pro pri\u00e9taire du fonds assujetti soit valable il faut que ces ouvrages aient seulement pour but de faciliter l'exercice de la servitude sans consti tuer Ia servitude elle-m\u00eame. Ainsi en supposant que je stipule pour mon fonds le droit d'extraire de Ia marne du votre je puis bien convenir avcc vous que, vous ferez les travaux n\u00e9cessaires pour em p\u00eacher l'eau d'envahir Ia marni\u00e8re, mais non que voss extrairez Ia marne et que vous la r\u00e9andez tous les ans sur mon domaine en vue de lamender; du moins, je ne puis pas stipuler cela \u00e0 titre de servitude r\u00e9elle.\nHuc (Commentaire de Code Civil, Paris 1893) is to the same effect, and to these authorities might be added very many others, all establishing the same pro position.\nApart from all authority the very words of the art. 597 C. N., (533 Code, Quebec,) which, as I before said, is only applicable here as indicating the old law, which may indeed have been subject to the narrower restriction prevailing in the Roman law, indicate that it refers only to subsidiary works, necessary for the usage and conservation of the servitude and not to the constitution of the principal servitude itself. Those words as contained in art. 553 Quebcc and 5977 C.N. are tous les ouvrages n\u00e9cessaire pour en user et pour la conserver. I maintain therefore that there. is nothing either in the old law or in the new law contained in these articles in any way impugning the rule that the principal servitude must consist in patindoo non in faciendo.\nApplying that rule here it is clear that no servitude could have been created by the claim in question.\nThen, I also agree with Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9 that the construction of the fence here could not he a servitude for the reason that it was left optional with the pur chaser, Macaulay, to make it or not, as he might think fit.\nQu'il pourrait trouver ou juger n\u00e9cessaire entre les deux susdits heritages contigus.\nI also agree with the argument that the vendor, cuthbert, stipulated not for any heritage which he retained, but for himself personally, which alone would be fatal to the constitution of a servitude. Further as regards any bearing which the contiguity of the two heritages might have, I do not enter into any discussion on the questonn of mitoyennete for the reason that it is very plain that the property retained by Cuthbert was not adjoining to the island sold, but was separated from it by a channel of the River St. Lawrence.\nI am of opinion that the appeal must be dismsssed with costs.\nGWYNNE, Sedgewick and King JJ. concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Girouard.\nGIROUARD J.Cettte cauee souleve une s\u00e9rieuse diffi Cult\u00e9 de servitude rurale \u00e9tablie par le fait de l'homme; comme toujours, la question est de savoir s'il y a titre. En face de la ville de Berthiier dans le fleuve Saint Laurent, se trouve un groupe d'\u00eeles qui forment partie de la seigneurie de ce nom. L'exrrait suivatt du cadastre officiel, produit dans la cause, indique la situation des lieux:\nLa preme\u00e8re \u00eele est l'\u00eele Randin qui est la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 'de la Commune de Berthier et pour cetee raison est mieux connue sous ce dernier nom. Cette commune fut cr\u00e9\u00e9e, \u00e0 l'origine m\u00eame de Ia paroisse, par le. pre mier seigneur, le Sieur de Berthier, en vertu de deux contrats de concsssion du 25 janvier 1683 l'un \u00e0 Jac ques Chamart et l'autre \u00e0 Jean Piet \" par lesquels ii est dit que le sieur Berthier leur donne pour commune l'Isle Randin ([17]).\" Cette \u00eele n'est s\u00e9par\u00e9e de la Grande C\u00f4te de Berthier, sur la terre ferme, que par un chenal de deux \u00e0 trois arpents, appel\u00e9 le chenal du Nord. S'il est permis d'en juger par le plan, elle a environ quatre \u00e0 cinq milles de tour, bien que des t\u00e9moins disent six \u00e0 sept milles. Jusqu'\u00e0 ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, elle n'a servi que de p\u00e2turage \"Dour l'utilit\u00e9 de certains habitants de la Grande C\u00f4te de Berthier Elle n'a jamais eu de cloture soit autour ou en travers du moins jusqu'\u00e0 il y a huit ou dix ann\u00e9es. Apr\u00e8s cette \u00e9poque la Commune fut divis\u00e9e en deux champs l'un r\u00e9serv\u00e9 au pacage et l'autre aux grains et finalement \u00e0 une prairie. Alors, et comme cons\u0398quenee une cl\u00f4ture fut faite par la Commune \u00e0 travers l'\u00eele pour diviser les deux champs et prot\u00e9ger la moisson.\nL'\u00eele la plus rapproch\u00e9e de la Commune est celle du Milieu. Elle fut conc\u00e9d\u00e9e en 1768 \u00e0 Zacharee Macaulay et poss\u00e9d\u00e9e par lui et ses succssseurs \u00e0 titre particulier, Nouth, Wiliiam Morrison, ses enfanss et petitsenfanss, et enfin liintim\u00e9. Elle forme environ cinq cent vingt arpents de terre en superficie, et est d'une grande valeur, puisque le 9 d\u00e9cembre 1893, liintim\u00e9 l'achetait pour le prix de $14,000. C'est sur l'\u00eele m\u00eame qu'il fait sa residence ordinarre et exploite une grande ferme. Son titre d\u00e9clare que l'\u00eele est born\u00e9e \u00e0 l'ouest u par un marais qui la s\u00e9pare de la Commune de Berthier.\" C'est ce marais qui est indiqu\u00e9 sur le plan par une forte ligne noire, comme \u00e9tant la ligne de division entre les deux \u00eeles. Pius bas que ce marais, les deux \u00eeles sont s\u00e9par\u00e9es par i'eau. Ii est prouv\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 certaines saisons et particuli\u00e8rement le printemps et m\u00e9me i'automne, ii Y a assez d'eau dans le marais pour permettre Ie passage des canots des p\u00eacheurs ou chasseurs, et m\u00eame des chalands charg\u00e9s de sable et tires \u00e0 Ia cordelle par des chevaux. Le t\u00eamoin Magloire Olivier, \u00e2g\u00e9 de 66 ans, dit qu'ii a vu plus que cela. \" Il ya \" dit-il, \"un petit chenal qui coulait toujours assez \u00e9pais d'eau entre l'lle Morrison (c'est-\u00e0-dire l'\u00eele du Milieu) et la Com mune de Berthier et maintenant c'est combl\u00e9, \" Il est prouv\u00e9 que de tout temps, les propri\u00e9taires de l'\u00eele du Milieu ont fait et eutreteuu une cl\u00f4ture partie sur leur \u00eele, partie sur la gr\u00e9ve, et m\u00e9me \u00e0 l'eau pour emp\u00eacher les animaux de la Commune de passer \u00e0 l'\u00eele du Milieu et que quand ils passaient\u2014ce qui arrivatt assez fr\u00e9 quemment\u2014ils les renvoyaient sans aucune charge ou plainte. Cette cl\u00f4ture a \u00e9t\u00e9 plus on moins longue, renouvel\u00e9e chaque ann\u00e9e plus on moins, r\u00e9par\u00e9e, chan g\u00e9e et allong\u00e9e plus d'une fois la m\u00e9me ann\u00e9e suivant les saisons et les circonstances, et aussi selon que Ia Commune servait au p\u00e2turage seulement, on ensembee an p\u00e2turage et aux grains on foins. Du temps de M. Wiliiam Morrison, an dire de Magloire Olivier, et son t\u00e9moignage n'est pas contredit, \" il fallait une cl\u00f4ture sur tout le long de l'\u00eele du Milieu pour teuir les animaux, et ce sont les Morrison qui ont toujours fait la cl\u00f4ture,\" c'est-\u00e0-dire sur environ quatre-vingts arpenss de patrcours, ainsi que l'expliquent d'autres t\u00e9moins, distanee qui me para\u00eet exag\u00e9r\u00e9e Si l'on en juge par le plan. Apr\u00e8s Ia division de la commune, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 observ\u00e9, la longueur de la cl\u00f4ture fut r\u00e9duite de moiti\u00e9 \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s mais elle fut faite et entretenue chaque ann\u00e9e par le propri\u00e9taire de l'\u00eele du Milieu et \u00e0 ses propres frais. En 1884, dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par la loi, l'appelante fit enregistrer la dite servitude, all\u00e9guant dans l'avis an r\u00e9gistrateur que l'\u00eele du Milieu est bornee \u00e0 l'ouest par un marais qui la s\u00e9pare de Ia Commune de Berthier, et au nordest par un marais qui la s\u00e9pare de li\u00eele au Gas tor. En 1888 Paul Desmaray et autres h\u00e9ritiers Mor rison, all\u00e9guant que l'\u00eele du Milieu est contigu\u00eb \u00e0 l'\u00eele de Ia Commune, protest\u00e8rent contre l'enregistrement de la servitude et somm\u00e8rent l'appelante d'avoir \u00e0 faire Ia moiti\u00e9 de la dite cl\u00f4ture comme cl\u00f4ture de ligne. Mais ils n'ont pas donn\u00e9 de suite \u00e0 leur prot\u00eat, et ont continu\u00e9 de faire Ia cl\u00f4ture et de renvoyer les animaux de la Commune, Iorsqu'ils passaient an del\u00e0, et cela jusqu'\u00e0 leur vente \u00e0 liintim\u00e9 en d\u00e9cembre 1893.\nAu printemps de 1894, liintim\u00e9 fit la cl\u00f4ture comme ses pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseurs il est vrai sans pr\u00e9judice, et en atten dant la decision des tribunaux. Ce n'est que durant l'\u00e9t\u00e9, aprss avoir consult\u00e9 un avocat, qu'il s'est insurg\u00e9 contre la conduite de ses auteurs. Ii n'y a pas de ser vitude, dit-il, et non seulement il refusa de r\u00e9parer ia cl\u00f4ture, mais ii ne voulut pas permettre qu'elle fut r\u00e9par\u00e9e par des int\u00e9ress\u00e9s de la Commune; ii prit Ieurs animaux en fourri\u00e8re et provoqua toutes esp\u00e8ces d'en nuis, de troubles, pas et d\u00e9marchss et litiges, et fina lement le procss actuel qui est une demande en passa tion de titre-nouvel aux termes de l'article 2257 du Code Civil. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e le 20 ao\u00fbt 1894 et eat fon\u00e9e sur les faits ci-dessus et sur le titre de Conces sion de lllle du Milieu.\nLe 17 f\u00e9vrier 1768, par contrat de concsssion pass\u00e9 devant Faribault notaire \u00e0 Berthier l'honorable James Cuthbert, propri\u00e9taire de la seigneurie de Berthir. conc\u00e9da, \u00e0 titre de cens et rentes seigneuriales, au Sieur Zacharie Macanlay, marchand \u00e0 Quebec, l'Ile du Milieu d\u00e9crite comme suit au contrat: T'out l'Isee du Milieu, tenant d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 au en enal de l'Isle Du Pas et de l'autre \u00e0 I'Ile Randin, sans en rien excepter, r\u00e9server, ni retenir, et que le dit sieur preneur a dit bien conna\u00eetre pour l'avoir vu et visit\u00e9, dont il se tient content et satisfait, pour en jouir, faire et disposer par le dit sieur preneur, ses dit hoirs et ayant cause, en toute propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 commencer de ce jour. Cetle concession ainsi faite \u00e0 la charge de payer tous les ans, au jour de St.-Martin, onze de novembre, dont le premier paiement se fera \u00e0 pareil jour de la prochaine, au domaine de la seigneurie de Berthier, la somme de deux censs livres tournois, pour tout droit de cens et rentes seigneuriales en outre \u00e0 condition qu'il fera \u00e0 ses frais, s'il le juge n\u00e9cessaire une cl\u00f4tuee bonne et valable, \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve des animaux de la Commune, sans aucun recours ni garantie \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard de Ia part du sieur seigneur, lesquelles conditions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9es du dit sieur preneur, pour s\u00fbret\u00e9 de quoi ii a hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9 tous ses beens presents et \u00e0 venir, et sp\u00e9cialement Ia dite Isle qui y demeure affect\u00e9e par privilege, une obligation ne d\u00e9rogeant \u00e0 l'autre.\nLa difficult\u00e9 est de savoir ce que les parties ont voulu dire en stipulant: \" en outre \u00e0 condition qu'il fera \u00e0 ses frais, s'il le iuge n\u00e9cessaire, une cl\u00f4ture bonne et valable, \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve des animaux de la Com mune sans aucun recours, ni garantie \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard de la part du sieur seigneur.\"\nLa cour de premiere instance (Ouimet J.) a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que la stipulation de faire Ia cl\u00f4ture n'\u00e9tait pas claire ment exprim\u00e9e et que le fut-elle, elle n'\u00e9tablit qu'une obligation purement personnelle et m\u00eame facultative de la part du concessionnaire.\nLa majorit\u00e9 de la cour d'Appel a confirm\u00e9 le juge ment de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure, sans apporerr de nouveaux motifs l'honorable iuge Blanchet dissident. Nous avons cependant devant nous les notes de M. le juge Boss\u00e9; ii est d'opinion que, la clause ne contenant qu'une obligation personnelle de la part de Macaulay, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider si elle est simpiement facultative. Le savant juge observe en terminant:\nAjoutons que, dane le cas de doute, il faut toujours ineerpr\u00e9ter l'acte contre la charge impos\u00e9e au fonds en faveur d'un autre fonds et opter pour la lib\u00e9ration ([18]). Ces principes out ont appliqu\u00e9s par cetee cour dans une esp\u00e8ce plu favorable \u00e0 la servitude C'est Ia cause de Mondelet v Roy d\u00e9cid\u00e9e 20 novembre 1882, et rapport\u00e9e au 4i\u00e8me volume des Rapports de Doriob p. 7.\nLe principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 par Demolombe est incontestable. C'est celui de l'article 1162 du Code Napol\u00e9on et de. l'article 1019 de notre Cod\u00e9. \" Dans le doute, le con trat s'interpr\u00e8te contre celui qui a stipul\u00e9 et en faveur de celui qui a contract\u00e9 l'obligation.\" Ii ne s'applique cependant que quand toutes les mani\u00e8res de conna\u00eetre l'intention des parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9puis\u00e9es. \" C'est la der ni\u00e8re ressource de l'interpr\u00e9tation aux abois !\" dit Demo lombe ([19]),\nC'est l'interpr\u00e9tation s'avouant impuissante devant l'imp\u00e9n\u00e9trable obscurit\u00e9 du contrat ! D'o\u00f9 ii suit qu'on ne doit l'appliquer qu'au taut que toutes les autres r\u00e8glss d'interpr\u00e9tation font d\u00e9faut (1).\nDemolombe, an num\u00e9ro m\u00eame cit\u00e9 par le savant juge, observe:\u2014\nEn fait, avant tout, quel est le caract\u00e8re du droit que le disposant ou les parties contractantes out entendu cr\u00e9er?\nEst-ce un droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou de copropri\u00e9t\u00e9?\u2014ou de simple bail? \u2014ou une pure obligation d'e faire ou de ne pas faire?\u2014ou un usage irr\u00e9gulier, une servitude personnelle?\u2014ou enfin une vraie servitude r\u00e9elle?\nC'est d'\u00e2ur\u00e8s les titres et les circonstances du fait etsurtott d'anr\u00e8s la nature propre du droit lui-m\u00eame, que cetee premiere question doit ttre r\u00e9solue dans chaqee esp\u00e8ce (comp. Cass. 7 f\u00e9v. 1825, Tombette, D. 1825, 1. 84; Cass. 15 fev. 1842, Duvivier, Dev. 1842, 1, 344).\nLa qualification appliqu\u00e9e au droit par l'acte m\u00eame qui l'\u00e9tablit, et les autres termes au\u00ea cet acte peut renfermer encore, sont sans doute \u00e0 prendee en tr\u00e8s grande consid\u00earation S'il r\u00e9sulte en effet du titre que Ia concession n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite qu'en vue d'une personne individuelle ment d\u00e9sign\u00e9e, elle ne constituera qu'un droit personnel, lors m\u00eame que, par son caract\u00e8re propre, elle aurait Pu \u00eatre \u00e9tablie comme servi tude r\u00e9elle si tamen testator demonstravit cui servitutem pecorss prcestar\u00ed volutt, emptori vel h\u0153redi non eadem pr\u0153stabitur servitus (L. 8 ff. de servit. prced. rust.) t mais on devra, au contraire y reconna\u00eetre une servitude r\u00e9elle, si le droit est accord\u00e9 au propri\u00e9taire d'un fonds pour lui et ses successeurs; ou m\u00eame ind\u00e9pendamment de toute explication pareille, si le droit, \u00e9tant de Sa, nature une vraie servitude r\u00e9elle est conc\u00e9d\u00e9 purement et simplement au fonds (comp. Cass., 7 fey. 1852, Tombette, D., 1825, 1, 84; Bourges. 3 janv. 1829 Bourdiaux D., 1829, 2, 42; Proudhon, des Droits d'usufruit, d'usage, t. VI, nos. 3093 et suiv.; Duranton, t. V. no. 34).\nMais, d'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, il ne faut pas oublier non plus que le carac t\u00e8re v\u00e9ritable d'un droit se determine, avant tout, par lui-\u00eame par sa propre substance, plut\u00f4t que par la denomination plus ou moins exacte, que les parties lui ont donn\u00e9e; et que, par exemple, l'emploi du mot servitude ne suffit pus pour imprimer ce caract\u00e8re \u00e0 un droit, qui, d'apr\u00e8s l'acte m\u00eame d'o\u00f9 il r\u00e9sulte, n'en est pas susceptible; pas plus que ce mot n'est n\u00e9cessaire pour faire na\u00eetre une v\u00e9ritable servi tude, quand tel est effecvivement le drott qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9: in con tractibus rei veritas potins quam scriptum perspici debet; non quod scriptum, sed quod gestum est (L. 1 et 3, Cod. plus valere, art. 1156, C. Napol.)\nC'est d'ailleurs ce qu'enseignent thus les auteurs. Solon dit ([20]):\nMais remarquez qu'en parlant de titre douteux, noss n'avons en vue que celui dont l'imperfection est telle qu'il est impossible d'en expliquer l'objet et l'\u00e9tendue par les voies ordinaires de l'interpr\u00e9ta tion j si malgr\u00e9 ses imperfeciions, Ia volont\u00e9 des parties pouvait \u00eatre comprise, nul douee qu'elle ne d\u00fbt avoir une autorit\u00e9 compl\u00e8te\nLaurent, dit ([21]);\u2014\nMais il peut \u00eatre doueuxx si le droit est une cr\u00e9ance, une servitude r\u00e9elle ou une servitude personnelle. C'est moins aux termss dont les parties se sont servies qu'il faut s'attacher qu'\u00e0 la nature du droit et \u00e0 l'intention des contractants. Ii faut surtout tenir compte de Ta r\u00e8gle fondamentale \u00e9tablie par l'article 686; pour que le droit soit une servitude r\u00e9elle, il doit \u00eatre d\u00fb par un fonds et en faveur d'un fonds.\nCet article correspond \u00e0 l'article 545 de notre code:\nTout propriCtaire, usant de ses droits et capable de disposer de ses immeubles, peut etablir sur ou en faveur de ses immeubles telles ser vitudes que bon lui semble, pourvu qu'elles n'aient rien de contraire \u00e0 l'ordre public.\nDalloz, ([22]) pose la premi\u00e9re r\u00e8gle d'interpr\u00e9tation et obseree '.\nQuelque sage et absolue que soit Ia r\u00e8gle pos\u00e9e en t\u00eate du present num\u00e9ro, la constitutinn de servitude n'a pas besoin d'\u00eatre faite en termes en quelque sorte sacramentels (M. Pardessus, n\u00b0 268); elle peut r\u00e9sulter de la combinaison des clauses d'un ou de plusieurs actes.\nPuis, v\u00b0. \"Servitude\" au num\u00e9ro 1000, le m\u00e9me jurisconsulte ajoute '.\u2014\nLes actes constitutifs des servitudes sont, comme tous les autres actes, soumis \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle d'apr\u00e8s laquelle on doit, dans les conventions, plut\u00f4t rechercher la commune intention des parties que s'attacher au sens litt\u00e9ral des termes.\nEnfin au no. 1002, sous le titre \"Interpr\u00e9tation du titre,\" Dalloz, v\u00b0. \" Servitude \" ajoute:\u2014\nLes tribunaux out une grande latitude en mati\u00e8re d'interpr\u00e9tation. Il serait donc difficile de donnrr des r\u00e8gles rigoureusement exactes sur les principes qul les dirigent, et que l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 quelquefois domine plut\u00f4t que la rigueur du droit.\nLes annoaateurs des Pandectes Fran\u00e7aises obser vent \u00e0 la note ([23]):\u2014\nIl est hors de doute que les titres constitutifs de servitudes sont soumis aux r\u00e8gles ordinaires qui gouvernent 1 interpr\u00e9tation des con trats. Le juge doit, d\u00e8s lors, s'attacher \u00e0 determiner quelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 Ia commuee intention des parties et suppl\u00e9er par cetee recherche an silenee ou aux obscurit\u00e9s de laacte litigieux.\nIls citent dans ce sens \u2014-\nCessation, 26 janvier, 1875, S. 75, 1. 121; 19 juillet, 1887, Pand. Fr. 87 1. 329; 16 janvier 1889, Id. 89, 1; 451. Voir aussi Lalaure et Paillet, Servitudes, liv. 1, ch. 2, p. 53.\nLa decision de la Cour d'Appel dans la cause de T\u00eatu vs. Gibb ([24]) est aussi pr\u00e9cise. M. le juge Gasault avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en cour de premiere instance, que les servi tudes en cas de doute, doivent \u00eatre plut\u00f4t restreintes et ne jamais \u00eatre maintenues, \u00e0 moins de stipulations claires et pr\u00e9cises. Mais cetee doctrine fut rejet\u00e9e par la Cour d'Appel, compos\u00e9e de Dorion J. C., Monk, Ramsay et Tessier JJ. (Cross J. dissident):\u2014\nConsid\u00e9rant que quoique ces faits de jouissance ne suffiraient pas seuls pour \u00e9tablir une servitude de passage sur le terrain des inti m\u00e9s ils servent \u00e0 expliquer les droits de servitude et de passage contenus aux dits actes de vente et de promssse de vente et aux anciens titres pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents et \u00e0 l'intention des parties aux dits actes.\nOn cite la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'Appel dans la cause de Mondelet v. Roy ([25]). Mais c'est tout la contraire qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9\u00e9 propos d'une servitude cr\u00e9\u00e9e en 1811 dans un acte de partage, ainsi que nous le verrons plus loin. ' Ce n'est qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un acte de venee ordinarre pass\u00e9 en 1850 que la Cour d'Appel a jug\u00e9 dans la m\u00e9me cause, et avec raison qu'il n'avait pas cr\u00e9\u00e9 une servitude r\u00e9elle, atlendu qu'il niindique aucun heritage dominant, C'\u00e9tait le cas d'une obligation personnelle qui ne pou vait Ctre garantie que par hypoth\u00e9que.\nM. le juge Boss\u00e9 observe que si l'intim\u00e9 ne fait pas une cl\u00f4ture pour se prot\u00e9ger, \"cela donnerait bien ou verture \u00e0 une action en dommages pour d\u00e9tention des animaux ill\u00e9galement mis en fourri\u00e8re.\" Je ne puis comprendre ce recouss en dommages, s'il n'y a pas de servitude. S'il existe et je crois qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conc\u00e9d\u00e9 par l'avocat de liintim\u00e9, qui a admis \u00e0 l'audience devant nous que liintim\u00e9 n'a pas le droit de se plaindre si les animaux de la Commune vont chez lui \u00e7a ne peut \u00eatre qu'en vertu du contrat de concsssion et de la clause qui s'y trouee cr\u00e9ant une charge fonci\u00e8re, une servi tude en un mot, sur l'Ile du Milieu en faveur de l'Ile de la Commune. Be droit commun, un propri\u00e9taire n'est pas tenu de souffrir les animaux de son premier ou de son deuxi\u00e8me voisin. \u00c7a ne peut \u00eatre qu'en d\u00e9rogeant \u00e0 la r\u00e9gle ordinaire, par des stipulations particulirres, que le contraire peut avoir lieu; et \u00e0 moins dune convention grevant le fonds l'action en dommage que l'on concede \u00e0 la Commune ne peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e. Et puis, que deviendrait l'action en dommages apr\u00e9s que Denis en aurait acquis la prescription?\nAfin de mieux juger de l'intention des \"parties il est \u00e0 propos d'examiner les lois au sujet des clotures en force \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 le contrat de concession fut pass\u00e9 en 1768. Je crois que l'appelante fait erreur, lors-qu'elle consid\u00e8re la cloture en question comme une cl\u00f4ture de ligne. Elle cite l'ordonnance de liintendant B\u00e9gon du 10 juin 1724 ([26]) \"au sujet des clotures et foss\u00e9s de ligne.\" Ii suffit de lire le titre de cette loi, et \u00e0 plus forte raison le texte, pourvoir qu'elle ne s'ap plique qu'\u00e0 des immeubles qui sont contig\u00fcs.\nJe suis d'avis avec liintim\u00e9, que la cloture que les parties avaient en vue dans le contrat de concession \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t une cloture de la natuee de celle men tionn\u00e9e en l'ordonnance de Raudot du 12 mars 1709, ([27]) et ii aurait pu ajouter celle du m\u00eame intendant du 18 juin 1709 et celle de B\u00e9gon du 19 juiu 1714 ([28]). Toutes pes ordonnances contiennent les m\u00eames dispo sitions: 1\u00b0 Obliger\nchaque habitant de toutes les C\u00f4tes de co pays de faire une cl\u00f4ture bonne et valable le long du front de son habitation\u2026\u2026, soit que le front ou la profondeur soient le long du fleaee Saint-Laurent ([29]);\net 2\u00b0 Forcer les seigneuss de faire une cloture\nle long de leuss domaines on des terres non conc\u00e9d\u00e9es \" sauf aux dits seigneurs,\" ajoute l'ordonnance du 18 juin 1709, \" \u00e0 se faire rembourser des dits chemins et des cl\u00f4tures et foss\u00e9s, lorsqu'ils conc\u00e9 deront les dites terres.\"\nLe but de ces lois \u00e9tait d'emp\u00eacher\nque les bestiaux ne puissent aller dans les grains ([30]),\nc'est-\u00e0-dire, les grains de chaque habitant tenu de faire la cl\u00f4ture, ainsi que l'explique le jugement de Begon du 5 juin 1716:\nNous condamnos lee h\u00e9ritiers Gamache \u00e0 cloee la devanture de leurs habitations, en soree que les bestiaux de leurs voisins ne puissent alter dans leurs grains; et faute par eux d'avorr fait la dite cl\u00e0tuee dans la quinzaine du jour que la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance leur aura \u00e9t\u00e9 notifi\u00e9e leur faisons defenses de saisir et arr\u00e9ter les bestiaux qui pourraient aller sur leuss terres ([31]). Un pareil arr\u00e9t avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par le Conseil Sup\u00e9rieur le 7juillet 1670, ([32]).\nAinsi donc, \u00e0 la date du contrat de concession \u00e0 Macaulay, et liintim\u00e9 l'admet dans son factum, le sei gueur de Berthier etait tenude cloturer l'\u00eele du Milieu non encoee conc\u00e9d\u00e9e, \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve des animaux de l\u00eele de Ia Commune, et des qu'elle \u00e9tait conc\u00e9d\u00e9e, Macaulay devenait soumis \u00e0 la m\u00e9me obligation cetee cloture formant en effet le front de son habitation.\nCes r\u00e8glemenss ne s'appliquaient pas aux communes qui n'\u00e9taient pas des habitaiions, et o\u00f9 ii n'y avait pas de r\u00e9coltes \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger. C'est ce que disent assez clai rement les lois que nous venons de citer, auxquelles on peut en ajouter d'autres. L'ordonnance du 12 mars 1709 cit\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9, d\u00e9clare que les cl\u00f4tures de front \" partagent ordinairement les communes des terres labour\u00e9es ([33]).\" be 26 juin 1707 et le 11 juin 1709, pour des raisons particuli\u00e8res qui n'apparaissent pas, les Intendants Raudot, p\u00e8re et fils ordonnent aux habi tants de Boucherville de clore la commuee vis-\u00e0-vis la terre d'Adrien Lamoureux, ([34]) be 3juin 1714 le sei gneur des \u00eeles Bouchard, dans le voisinage des \u00eeles de Berthier, fait \u00e0 ses censitaires l'offre d'une commuee \" \u00e0 la condition que les dits habitants feront enclore de pieux la dite commune,\" offre qui fut refus\u00e9e, parce qu'ils ne pourraient la faire assez forte pour resister aux glaces et aux grandes eaux qui emporteraient la dite cloture, ce qui obligerait les dits habitants \u00e0 faire une d\u00e9pense consid\u00e9rable tous les ans pour l'entretenir ([35]). be 14 mars 1735, l'intendant Hocquart, dans le but de d\u00e9fricher et am\u00e9liorer la commune des Trois-Rivi\u00e8res ordonne \u00e0 tous les habitanss de la ville de faire cl\u00f4ture solide et \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve des bestiaux, autour de la dite commuee ([36]).\" Toutes ces exceptions \u00e9tablissent la r\u00e8gle. Ii n'y avait pas en effet de ioi gen\u00e9rale obli geant \u00e0 cl\u00f4turer les communes, tandis qu'il en existait. plusieuss au sujet des habitatinss et m\u00e9me des terres non conc\u00e9d\u00e9es et domaines seigneuriaux.\nA l'\u00e9gard de ia commuee de Berthier, on trouve plu sieurs jugemenss et une ordonnance de l'intendant pour en assurer la paisible jousssanee aux habitants de Berthier sans faire de cloture. D\u00e8s l'origine, cette commuee donna lieu \u00e0 des troubles et des querelles nombreuses, m\u00eame des voies de fait, entre les habitanss de Berthier et ceux des \u00eeles voisines. Le 21 juin 1707,. l'intendant Jacques Raudot, rend un premier juge ment en forme de r\u00e8glement, qui, sur les contestations mues entre les habitanss de Berthier et ceux de l'Isle aU\"Castor et le seigneur de Berthier, au sujet des comn munes de Berthier et de l'Isle-au-Castor, ordonne que le dit seigneur rentrera en possession d'icelles,. pour en disposer comme bon lui sembiera, \" \u00e0 la charge par les dits habitanss de faire garder leurs b\u00eatss dans leurs habitations et de cinq livres d'amende contre ceux qui les laisseront aller dans les dites communes ([37]).\"\nLe ler juillet de la m\u00eame ann\u00e8e, intervient un autre arrtt qui ordonne \"que le dit sieur Berthier ou son procureur, sera tenu de clore ou faire clore ies habita tions par lui conc\u00e9d\u00e9es dans l'Isle-au-Castor, en sorle que les haibitans de Berthier pusssent jouir de leur com mune et, jusqu'\u00e0 ce sursis au payement de ce qu'ils lui doivent pour le droit de commuee ([38]).\"\nEnfin, le 20juin 1708, Jacquss Raudot, aprss enqu\u00eate faite sur ies lieux par Denis Raudot, son conjoint, ren dit une ordonnance qui ordonne aux hahitans de l'Isle au-Castor de faire une cl\u00e0ture solide en travers de l'isle, moyennant quoi, ils seront d\u00e9charg\u00e9s de la rente qu'ils s'\u00e9taient oblig\u00e9s de payer par ieurs contrats de conces sion pour la Commune: \" Ordonnons,\" y esttil d\u00e9clar\u00e9, \"que le sieur Berthier sera tenu de faire clore les habi tations par lui conc\u00e9d\u00e9es dans l'Isle-au-Castor, en sorte que les habitans de Berthier puissent jouir de leur com mune , et que jusqu'\u00e0 ce, sursis au payement des rentes qu'ils doivent pour le droit diicelle ([39]).\"\nTons ces faits et r\u00e8glements se trouvent aux Edits et Ordonnanees, et ii ne faut pas oublier qu'ils sont au thentiques \" et font preuve de leur contenu,\" comme les Statuts de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. C. C. art. 1207.\nPar ces r\u00e8glemenss, qui font loi jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'ils soient abrog\u00e9s l'intendant introduisait dans les \u00eeles de Berthier \"pour la proteciion de la Commune des habitanss de Berthier, ia r\u00e8gle qu'il avait \u00e9tablie dans les C\u00f4tes pour la protection des grains et r\u00e9coltes. Il ne peut y avoir de doute que cette commuee est celle de l'\u00eele Randin, puisqu'elle est mentionn\u00e9e dans i'ordonnance m\u00eame ([40]). Il est vrai que l'lle du Milieu n'y figure pas, pour la bonne raison qu'elle f'avatt pas \u00e9t\u00e9 conc\u00e9d\u00e9e et qu'elle ne pouvait l'\u00eatre avant iongtemps, \u00e0 cause de sa proximit\u00e9 avec l'\u00eele Randin et des d\u00e9pen ses consid\u00e9rables que ia constuuction et l'entretien d'une cloture de front entralneraient Ce ne f\u00fbt qu'en 1768 que le seigneur put trouver un acqu\u00e9reur, et pour l'y decider, ii lui fallut se d\u00e9partir des r\u00e8gles ordinairs.\nLorsque le seigneur Cuthbert a accord\u00e9 le titre de concsssion \u00e0 Macaulay, ii ne l'a pas assujetti \u00e0 la rigueur des concsssions seigneuriales; il ne l'a pas soumis \u00e0 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de tenir feu et lieu on de faire des d\u00e9friche ments ou de moudre au moulin banal ou de fournir la journ\u00e9e de corv\u00e9e; ii n'a pas exig\u00e9 de lui une cloture le long ou sur le front de son \u00eele pour prot\u00e9ger la Com mune de Berthier. Cependant, il ne pouvait laisser ses censitaires communistes \u00e0 la merci du propri\u00e9taire de l'\u00eele du Milieu. Les sorties des animaux qui y paca geaient chaque \u00e9t\u00e9 seront in\u00e9vitables et elles causeront indubitablement des dommages aux grains de l'\u00eele du Milieu, lorsqu'elle sera mise en valeur, ce qui devra avoir lieu dans un avenrr plus ou moins rapproch\u00e9. Il ne pouvait songer \u00e0 cl\u00f4turer, ou faire cl\u00f4turer par les Com munistes, I'\u00eele de la Commune de quatre \u00e0 cinq mulles de tour; d'ailleurs les r\u00e8glements de l'intendant leur assuraient la jouissance de cette commuee sans aucune cloture. Pans ces circonstances difficiles, le seigneur et le concessionnaire adopt\u00e8rent ce quills consid\u00e9r\u00e8rent un accommodementt Le concessionnaire sera oblig\u00e9 de souffrir les animaux de la Commune mais ii ne sera pas tenu de faire la cloture que lorsqu'il le jugera .n\u00e9cessaire., c'est-a-dire, quand il aura une habitation et 'des grains \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger. Ii se passera probablement des ann\u00e9es avant que cetee n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 se fasse sentir. Son censitaire nouveau, Zacharie Maccaulys selon l'ortho graphe fran\u00e7aise du notaire, n'est pas un colon ordinaire on un habitant \u00e0 la rechecche d'une habitation. C'est Zachary Macaulay, un personnage important de 'Qu\u00e9bcc an commencement du r\u00e9gime britannique au Canada, que Watson ([41]), dit \u00eatre ni plus, ni moins que ae p\u00e8re de Lord Macaulay, mais que M. Douglas Brymner notre archivsste canadieu, pr\u00e9sente tout simplemeut comme un marchand de bois influent, ayant sa residenee d'abord \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bcc et ensuite vers 1776, \u00e0 Machiche, qui, comme on le sait, est \u00e0 quelques -lieues de l'\u00eele du Milieu ([42]). Quoi qu'il en soit, le contrat de concession du 17 f\u00e9vrier 1768 nous l'in trodpit comme \" mrrchand de Qu\u00e9bec,\" et le Seigneur de Berthier avait raison de supposer que c\u00e9tait moins une habitatinn que Maccauly cherchait, que du hois ou peut-\u00eatre m\u0152me une place de chasee et -de p\u00e9che. En consequenee, ii l'obiige \u00e0 souffrir les animaux de la commune et \u00e0 faire, lorsqu'il le jugera n\u00e9cessaire, une cl\u00f4ture \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve de ces animaux, \u00e0 l'endrott qu'il jugrra le plus convenable, mais \u00e9videm ment sur son \u00eele ou sa gr\u00e9ve, car Maccauly n'avait pas de titre pour la faire ailleurs. Cette concession ou plu tot cetee lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 de la part du seigneur lui canseaa des ennuis: la Couronee se plaindra peut.\u00eatre qu'il ait conc\u00e9d\u00e9 une terre en bois debout ([43]); ii est possible encoee que ses censitaires communistes, qui ont le domaine utile de Ia commune, protestent contre cette' exemption temporaire de la cloture de front; mais il se soumet d'avance \u00e0 ces inconv\u00e9nients et \u00e0 ces dangers et voil\u00e0 pourquii, il stipule qu'il n'aura pas de recouss contee le propri\u00e9taire de l'ile du Milieu. Ses censitai res communistes out aussi des droits; ils seront expo s\u00e9s \u00e0 aller chercher leurs animaux \u00e0 quinze ou vingt arpenss hors l'enceinte de la commune, ainsi que l'expliquent des t\u00e9moins; mais ii ne pent r\u00e9pondre, ni stipuler pour eux.\nLe propri\u00e9taire de lI\u00eele du Milieu pourra aussi souf frir quelques dommages provenant des animaux de la commune particuli\u00e8remtnt s'il a r\u00e9colte. De l\u00e0, la stipulation que le seigneur ne sera pas responsabee ou garant envers le censitaire: \" Sans aucun recouss ni garantie \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard de la part du Sieur Seigneur.\" Jusqu'\u00e0 ce que le concessionnaire ait une habitation et des grains Ia convention lui est \u00e9videmment favo rable et est d\u00e9favorabee an seigneur et \u00e0 ses commu nistes, except\u00e9 en ce que leur commuee se trouee pra fiquement agrandie. D'ailleurs, ii ne sera jamais dans une position plus on\u00e9reuee que les autres habitanss qui sont tenus d'avoir une cloture de front Voil\u00e0 com ment je compeends l'intention des parties, le sens de la clause du contrat de concession.\nMais, dit-on, ii n'y a pas de stipulation que Macaulay s'engageait pour lui et les d\u00e9tenteuss snccessifs c'est\u00e0-dire, \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9. Mais dans les circonstances \u00e0 quoi bon, une obligation personnelle, qui pourratt s'\u00e9teindre le lendemain ou dans un temps rapproch\u00e9? C'\u00e9tait surtout contee l'avenir contee l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 l'Ile du Milieu serait cultiv\u00e9e, que le Seigneur voulatt se garder. Evidemment, l'obiigaiion personnelle n'aurait pas atteint le but que le Seigneur et les r\u00e8glemenss en force se proposaient et la situation des lieux garantissait, savoir, celui d'assurer la paisible jouissance de la com mune de Berthier. Ii convient done d'appliquer les principes des articles 1014 et 1015 du Code Civil, aussi anciens que nos tribunaux: Art. 1014.\nLorsqu'une clauee est susceptible de deux sens, on doit plut\u00f4t l'en tendre dans celui avec lequel elle peut avoir quelqu'effet, que dans le sens avec lequel elle n'en pourrait avoir aucun.\nArt. 1015:\nLes termes susceptibles des deux sens doivent \u00eatre pris dans le sens qui convient le plus \u00e0 la mati\u00e8re du contrat,\nEt comment supposer que Macaulay ne stipulait pas pour lui et tous les propri\u00e9tarres subsequents? Remar 'Quons cu'il s'agtt du titreprimordial de l'Ile du Milieu o\u00f9 les parties n'ont en vue que des stipulations fon ci\u00e8res. Ce n'est pas une vente; c'est une concsssion seigneuriale, et en l'interpr\u00e9tant, il faut tenir compte de cette importante circonstance. Si dans les actes ordinaires (C.C. 1030), \" lui, ses hoirs, et ayants cause \" on m\u00eame \" lui et les siens\", en mati\u00e8re de servitude signifient non seulement les descendants, mais tous les propri\u00e9taires successifs, ainsi que l'affirment Dalloz et un arr\u00ea qu'il cite, Bourdiaux v. de Castries ([44]), \u00e0 plus forte raison doit-il en \u00eatre ainsi dans les contrats de concession, o\u00f9 les parties ne voient qu'un seigneur et un censitaire. Dorion v. Le S\u00e9sminarie de Montr\u00e9al ([45])\nMacaulay accepee la concession \" pour lui, ses hoirs et ayants cause\", et il ajoute que c'est pour enjouir et disposer en toute propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \" par le dit sieur preneur, ses dits hoirs et ayants cause.\" Ii declare bien conna\u00eetre \"toute l'\u00eele du Milieu.pour l'avoir vu et visit\u00e9\", et il connaissait pareillement l'\u00eele Randin et la Commune qui sont mentionn\u00e9es \u00e0 l'acte. Puis le titre ajoute que la concsssion est faite \" \u00e0 la charge de payer les cens et rentes seigneuriales, en outre \u00e0 la condition qu'il fera \u00e0 ses frais, s'il le juge n\u00e9ncessaire \" etc., lesquelles condi tions ont \u00e9te accept\u00e9es du dit sieur preneur.\nIci les mots s ses hoirs et ayanss cause \" ne sont pas r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s. Mais ils sont sousentendus, et d'ailleurs, le preneur avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il acceptatt Ia concession pour lui, ses hoirs et ayanss cause. Ii ne pent y avoir de doute que les acqu\u00e9reuss subs\u00e9quents \u00e9taient respon sables de la rente seigneuriale, malgr\u00e9 que l'acte ne d\u00e9clare pas par qui elle sera payable, le mot \" pre neur \", \u00e9tant m\u00eame omis. Il faut decider Ia m\u00e9me choee \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'autre stipulation, bien que les par ties se servent de lexpesssion \"\u00e0 condition \", mais il est \u00e9vident que dans leur esprit \"charge\" et c condi tion \" signifiaient Ia m\u00e9me chose car imm\u00e9diatement aprss Ia mention de la rente seigneuriale et de Ia cl\u00f4 ture, elles ajoutent \" lesquelles conditions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accep t\u00e9es du dit sieur preneur \" D'ailleurs, aux yeux de la loi, ces expressions ont la m\u00e9me signification en mati\u00e8re de contrats de concsssion et de servitudes ([46]).\nMacaulay, ses hoirs et ayanss cause, c'est-\u00e0-dire, tous les propri\u00e9taires successifs de l'\u00eele du Milieu, devront execuerr la stipulation concernant Ia cloture et les ani maux de la commune, comme ils sont tous egalement tenus au paiement des cens et rentes. Telle \u00e9tait \u00e9vi demment, l'intention des parties et invariablement depuism au moins en autant que la m\u00e9moire humaine et la tradition peuvent testifier, c'est cette intention qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ex\u00e9cu\u00e9ee et suivie par tons les propri\u00e9taires. Ii est vrai cine la Coutume de Paris, dit ([47]) i\nDroit de servitude ne s'acquiert par longue jouissance quelle quelee soit, sans titre, encore que l'on en alt joul par cent ans;\nr\u00e8gle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 reproduite dans l'article 549 du Code Civil:\nNulle servitude ne peut. s'\u00e9tablir sans titre; Ia possession, m\u00eame im m\u00e9moriale, ne suffit pas \u00e0 cet effet.\nMais la Coutume aussi hien que le Code ne disent pas que la possession imm\u00e9moriale ne peut servir \u00e0 interpreter le titre, et m\u00e9me le completer. Je ne puis done aceepter Ia doctrine des tribunaux de pre mi\u00e9re insaance que Ia conduite des parties ne signifie rieil elle est repouss\u00e9e par tous les auteuss de la junis prudence, tant fran\u00e7aise que canadienne. La decision de la cour d'Appel dans la cause de T\u00e9tu v. Gibb cit\u00e9e plus haut est formelle. Notre propre cour vient de decider la m\u00e9me chose daus la cauee de La cite de Qu\u00e9bec v. la Compagnee du chemin de fer du Nord ([48]). Deux arr\u00eats de la cour de Cassation, rapportss dans Dalloz ([49]), [Bourdiaux v. de Casiries, et Rebuffat v. Aubert) sont dans le m\u00e9me sens. Le second, \u00e0 la date du 8 novembre 1842, s'explique comme suit:\nAttendu que les dispositions de l'arr\u00eat se bornent a interpr\u00e9ter la convention intervenue entre les parties tant par les termss de lacte pass\u00e9 entre elles que par l'ex\u00e9cution prooong\u00e9e qu'elles lui avaient donn\u00e9e et qu'en usant d'un droit qui lui appartenait incontestable ment, la cour royale ne peut avoir contrevenu a aucune loi. Rejette le pourvoi contre l'arr\u00eat de la cour d'Aix, du 29 avril 1841.\nDemolombe ([50]) dit:\nIl faut encore mettre au rang des r\u00e8glss les meilleuees d'interpr\u00e9ta tion, quoique notre code ne Ia mentionne pas, celle que fournit l'ex\u00e9cution qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e par les parties de Ia clauee de leur con vention dont le sens est maintenant controvers\u00e9 entre elles. Lex\u00e9cu tion de la clause, c'est l'interpr\u00e9tation vivante et anim\u00e9e.\nPardessus ([51]): Dans l'embarras v\u00e9ritable que produit la force des arguments respectifs, on peut nous le croyons, presenter un guide assur\u00e9. C'est le principe que l'exercice d'un droit et surtout Ia souffrance volon\u00e9 taire d'une charge pendant un long temps forme une soree de contrat, contre lequel personee n'est recevabee \u00e0 r\u00e9clamer.\nSolon ([52]):\nRien ne peut mieux ajouter \u00e0 un titre et en former le complement, -que l'existence de faits multipli\u00e9s pour d\u00e9montrer que les parties n'ont. pu ignorer la servitude mentionn\u00e9e au titre recognitif. De pareils faits joints au titre, m\u00eame imparfait, suffisent pour prouver que la servitude ne s'exerce pas \u00e0 titre de familiarit\u00e9 et de simple tol\u00e9rance et lui impriment les caract\u00e8res les plus favorables.\nVoir aussi un arrtt de la cour de Cassation du 27 f\u00e9vrier 1882 ([53]).\nVoyons maintenant Si la loi, et c'est la principale question \u00e0 mon avis, autorisait une servitude comme celle que r\u00e9clame l'appelante en vertu du contrat de concession. Quelle est donc la nature de la stipulation qu'il contient? Est-ce une obligaiion personnelle on une servitude r\u00e9elle?\nSi nous n'avonss qu'\u00e0 consulter le Code Civil la r\u00e9ponse ne serait pas embarrassante. L'article 499 dit:\nLa servitude r\u00e9efle est une charge impos\u00e9e sur un h\u00e9ritage pour l'utilit\u00e9 d'un autre heritage appartenant \u00e0 un propri\u00e9taire different.\nPas de distinction entre l'obiigation de faire et celle de souffrir on laisser faire quelque chiose. Voir Dorion v. Le S\u00e9minaire de Montr\u00e9al ([54]). Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que les deux heritages soient contig\u00fcs; ils peuvent \u00eatre s\u00e9par\u00e9s par une rivi\u00e8re gueable et m\u00e9me par un cours d'eau qu'on ne pent traverser qu'en bateau; il suffit en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral qu'ils soi\u00e9nt assez rappoochss l'un de l'autre pour que l'exercice de la servitude ofire un avantage appr\u00e9ciable. Ces principes sont conformes an droit fran\u00e7ais ancien et au droit romain ([55]) Puis vient l'article 545:\nTout propri\u00e9taire usant de ses droits et capable de disposer de ses immeubles peut \u00e9tablir sur ou en faveur de ses immeubles telles servitudes que hon lui semble, pourvu qu'elees n'aient rien de contraire \u00e9 l'ordre public\nPas de distinction non plus entre la stipulation de faire et celle de souftrir et laisser faire. Enfin l'article 553 dit:\nCelui auqull est due une servitude a droit de faire tons les ouvrages n\u00e9cessaires pour en user et la conserver.\nArt. 554:\nCes ouvrages sont \u00e0 ses frais et non pas \u00e0 ceux de propri\u00e9taire du fonds assuietti \u00e0 moins Que le titre constitutif de Ia servitude ne dise le contraire.\nCes artccles de notre code ne sont pas indiqu\u00e9s de droit nouveau; et si nous n'avions qu'\u00e0 les appliquer \u00e0 cette cause, nous pourrions facilement decider que l'obiigation de faire la cloture \u00e9tait une charge impos\u00e9e sur l'\u00eele du Milieu au profit de l'\u00eele de la Commune.\nMais le titre que l'appelante invoque a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 en 1768 et \u00e9videmment les droits des parties ne peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9s par les articles du Code Civil qui pr\u00e9 tend l'intim\u00e9, out change l'ancien droit. Ii invoque le droit romain et cite plusieuss commentateurs fran \u00e7ais entre autres Pothier, Guyot, Toullier, Mourlon, Beaudry-Lacantinerie, pour d\u00e9montrer que, jusqu'\u00e0 la promulgation du Code Napol\u00e9on, une servitude ne pou vait consister qu'\u00e0 souffrir ct laisser faire jamais \u00e0 faire qxielque chose. Il a m\u00e9me sur ce point, lahaute auto rite du Consell Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Dorion v. Le S\u00e9minaire de Montr\u00e9al ([56])\nThe question in this caee is whether the obligation contained in the original deed of grant of this estate to Smith created a servitude. In considering this question, the provisions of the Civil Code of Canada which define and enumerate servitudes are to be regarddd. Article 499 of that code defines generally a servitude. '' A real servitude is a charge imposed on one real estate for the benefit of another belonging to a different proprietor\". The obligation to repair a road imposed on one estaee for the benefit of the owness of another would, prima facie seem to be a charge within the terms of this article. No doubt, by the old French law founded on the Roman law and by the law of Canada before the code a servitude was understodd to be that tfre owner of the servient tenement was only to suffer and not to do any act. It is unnecessary to cite the authorities on that subject, because the old law is clear, and may be taken to be correctly stated by Toullier (3rd volume) in Nos. 377 and 378, which are citdd by Mr. Justice B\u00e9langer in his judgment. Toullier's observations are an exposition of the maxim: Servitutum non ea natura est ut aliquid faciat quss sed xt aliqudd patiat ut ant non faciat.\nLe Consell Priv\u00e9 confirmant le jugement de la Cour d'Appel, a cependant jug\u00e9 dans cette esp\u00e8ce que l'obli gation contaact\u00e9e par un concessionnaire dans Un contrat de concsssion seigneuriale, pass\u00e9 en 1804, de fournir, faire et enfretenrr, \u00e0 ses propres frais, le chemin de front qui divisait sa concession du domaine du Seigneur \u00e9tatt une veritable servitude r\u00e9elle et non une obligation personnelle. Sir Montague Smith, en rendant le jugement, dit:\nIn the present case, their Lordships think that the effect of the deed is, that the estate was conveded to Smith subject to the obligation that part of it was to be used for a road which the grantee was to make and kepp in repair. The land to be so used was not excepted out of the grant to Smith, but on the contrary was granted to him as part of an entire estate, subject to the obligation that it should be used for the purpose of a road. The obligation to reparr was not an independent servitude separately created, but was part of the entire servitude imposed upon the land on the grant of it. In its inception there can Joe no doubt tnat this was so. and. tnat the obligation was for the benefit of the estate whcch the seminary retained, and which may be called the dominant tenement.\nPeut On signaler quelque diff\u00e9rence entre lobiigation de faire et entretenir une cloture sur le terrain conc\u00e9d\u00e9 et celle d'y faire et entretenir un chemin?\nIi n'y en a aucune en principe.\nIi n'y a pas de doute que dans l'ancien droit qui \u00e9tait suivi au Canada, le seigneur pouvait ins\u00e9rer dans les actes de concsssion plusieurs charges et conditions que l'\u00e9tat d'une colonie naissanee imposait; mais qui depuis longtemps n'avaient plus leur utilit\u00e9 dans un pays peupl\u00e9 et habit\u00e9 comme l'\u00e9tait l'ancienne France de puis des si\u00e8cles. Les clauses des contrats de concession faisaient partie du droit f\u00e9odal, \u00e0 moins d'\u00eatre contraires \u00e0 l'ordre public ou \u00e0 un texte formel de loi ([57]). C'est ainsi que longtemps avant l'arr\u00eat d'e Marly de 1711 ([58]). les seigneuss et particuli\u00e8rement celui de Berthier stipu laient invariablement que leurs conc\u00e9ssionnaires tien draient feu et lieu et feraient quelques arpenss de d\u00e9fri chement dans un certain d\u00e9lai ([59]). Egalement ils pouvaient les charger des cl\u00f4tures, chemins et foss\u00e9s, se faire indemniser quant au pass\u00e9 ([60]) et se prot\u00e9ger quant \u00e0 l'avenir, comme le fit le S\u00e9minaire de Montr\u00e9al avec l'auteur de Dorion et le Seigneur de Berthier avec celui de Denis. Ces stipulations et autres semblables n'ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des obligatinss per sonnelles, mais toujours comme des charges ou servi tudes r\u00e9elles s'attachant \u00e0 chaque d\u00e9tenteur subs\u00e9quent. La jurisprudence a m\u00e9me \u00e9t\u00e9 d'interpr\u00e9ter les contrats de concession g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement d'une mani\u00e8re lib\u00e9rale au seigneur, et contre le censitaire, parce qu'on Ies consider rait comme des gratuit\u00e9s et qu'il est contraire aux prin cipes de droit et d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 qu'un bienfait puisse tourner au d\u00e9triment de son auteur ([61]). Dans l'esp\u00e8ce actuelle, on voudrait que le seigneur se f\u00fbt charg\u00e9 de faire. quatre \u00e0 cinq mulles de cl\u00d4ture, tout le tour de l'\u00eele de la Commune, \u00e0 des frais consid\u00e9rables rp\u00e9t\u00e9s en partie annuellement en consid\u00e9ration des. deux cents livres tournois ou $33.33 de rente annuelle. Voil\u00e0 la cons\u00e9 quence rigoureuse d'un jugement qui lib\u00e9rerait le propri\u00e9taire de l\u2019ile du Milieu de se cl\u00f4turer. Ce r\u00e9sultat n'est ni raisonnable, ni \u00e9ouitable, pas m\u00e9me vraisem blable.\nLa jurisprudence de nos cours a admis le m\u00eame prin cipe chaque fois qu'il s'est agi d'une simple division ou d'un partage ordinaire diimmeubles entre particuliers. Je trouve pas moins de trois decisions de la Cour d'Appel, qui maintiennent que des stipulations de cette nature ont le caract\u00e8re de servitudes r\u00e9elles.\nLa premi\u00e9re est celle de Hamillon v. Wall ([62]) d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par la cour d'Appel, eompos\u00e9e de Dorion, J.c., Monk, Ramsay, Tessier et Cross, JJ. Il est vrai ciue la servi tude dont il s'agissait avait pris naissance sous l'empire du Code; mais \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard le Code n'a pas introduit un principe nouveau. L'ancien droit, comme l'utilitle 499, consid\u00e9rait comme de l'essence de la servitude qu'elle f\u00fbt une charge sur un h\u00e9ritage pour l'utilit\u00e9 d'un h\u00e9ritage voisin appartenant \u00e0 un propri\u00e9taire dif f\u00e9rent. Hamilton, propri\u00e9taire d'un grand terrain de ville, le divise et en vend un lot \u00e0 l'auteur de wall. L'acte de vente contenait Ia clause suivante: \" Il est express\u00e9ment convenu entre les dites parties qu'il ne sera construit sur le dit terrain aucune boucherie, tan nerie, manufacture etc.\" Puis suivait cette clause: \" Il est encore bien entendu que toute b\u00e2tisse, qu'\u00e9ri gera le dit acqu\u00e9reur sur le dit terrain, sera en ligne avec celle du dit vendeur.\" Comme on le voit l'acqu\u00e9reur ne dit pas qu'il s'engage \" pour lui, ses hoirs et ayants cause,\" ni que son engagement \u00e9tait une charge sur l'immeuble qu'il achetait, on m\u00e9me une condition de la vente. La cour Sup\u00e9rieure (Papineau J.) a con sid\u00e9r\u00e9 que la servitude n'\u00e9tait pas suffisamment \u00e9tablie. En appel, ce jugement fut infirm\u00e9, Monk J., dissident. M. le juge Tessier disait: \u2014\nLa question s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve clone: est-ce l\u00e0 une servitude ou une simple obligation personnelle. Vide art. 414 Code Civil. Les autorit\u00e9s sQnt nombreuses sur ce point, et pour n'en citer qu'une seule, je r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 Toullier, 3 volume, No. 588, o\u00f9 la question est clai rement discut\u00e9e.\nIi est donc important de distinguer quand le droit est impos\u00e9 pour un fonds ou seulement stipul\u00e9 en faveur de la personne. Si Ia concession \u00e9nonce qu'il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 conc\u00e9d\u00e9 pour l'utilit\u00e9 d'un autre fonds ii ne peuty avoir de doute, quand m\u00eame le droit ne serait pas qualifi\u00e9 de servitude. Cette qualification n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire, tout service impos\u00e9 sur un fonds en faveur d'un autre fonds est essentiellement une servitude. La nature d'un droit se d\u00e9termine par sa qualit\u00e9 plut\u00f4t que par la d\u00e9nomination qu'on lui a donn\u00e9e.\nIdem, vide No. 589.\nLa seconde question c'est de savoir si cette servitude est exprim\u00e9e d'une mani\u00e8re certaine, pr\u00e9cise et suffisante. N'est-elle pas trop vague? Je crois qu'elle est facile \u00e0 comprendre; cette stipulation est d'usage ordinaire dans les grandes villes. Si cette stipulation veut dire quel- nue chose o ne veut-elle dire? Ii faut lui donner le sens le llus raison nable.\nLe juge en chef Dorion, s'appuyant aussi sur 3 Toul lier Nck 588, dit:\nAccording to the Civil Code. art. 499, \" A servitude is a charge im posed upon one property for the beneftt of another.\"\nWhen the charge is designated in the deed as being a servitude, or when it is declared to be for the beneft of a property belonging to another, there can be no difficulty that it is a servitude.\nWhen, however, the character of the charge is not sufficienyly indic ated by the deed, it must be determined by the nature of the obligation, and if, from the circumstances, the obligation appears to have been stipulated for the personal advantage of the creditor, without-reference'to his property, it will be considered as a personal right, and will not follow his property, although it may follow that upon which it is imposed according to the conditions of the stipulation. If, on' the contrary, the charge is either necessary to the enjoyment of the property of the obligee, or confers upon it some substantial advantage -suffcient to indicate that it was for the property and not for the person of the creditor that it was imposed, then it will be considered aS a real servitude created on the property of the obligor in favour of that of the obligee and following the two properties in whatever hands that may pass.\nDans les deux autres causes, ii s'agissait de servitudes cr\u00e9\u00e9es avant le Code La premi\u00e9re est celle de Murray v. MacPherson ([63]), o\u00f9 1st cour d'Appel, compos\u00e9e de LaFontaine, J.C., et Aylwin, Duval et Caron JJ., jugea que l'obiigaiion par une partie en un partage de laisser un chemin sur sa portion de terre, et d'y faire et macadamiser une voie de trente pieds de largeur, est une servitude et charge r\u00e9elle. La cour Sup\u00e9rieure avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il n'y avait pas servitude. Sur appel de ce jugement, l'appe lant se fondait sur ce qu'aucune forme d'expression n'est requise pour constituer une servitude, et qu'il suffit d'une intention bien marqu\u00e9e de grever un fonds en faveur d'un autre. La Cour \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9 accueillit ce raisonnement et infirma le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure.\n3.Considering that the said actede partage cOntains a certain stipulation to the following effect, viz: \"That the said James Patterson shall also be bound, and doth hereby promise, bind and oblige himself to make, at his own costs and expense, in the course of the present summer, a road .whereof thirty feet in the centre shall he gravelled\n4. Considering that the right settled by the parties, by and in virtue of the aforesaid stipulation, is a droit r\u00e9el, in the nature of a servitude etc.\nIi faut bien remarquer que la clause de l'acte de partage ne disait pas que Patterson s'obligeait llui ses hoirs et ayants cause \", ni que liimmeuble \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 de cc chemin et de cet ouvrage ( qui devaient \u00e9tre faits une fois pour toutes), ou que les parties en faisaient une condition du partage. Ajoutons que la decision dans la cauee de Murray v. MacPherson (1) a re\u00e7u l'approbation du Conseil priv\u00e9 dans celle de Dorion v. Le S\u00e9minaire de Montr\u00e9al ([64]).\nL'autre d\u00e9cision, sur laquelle je desire attirer l'attention, est celle de mondelet v. Roy ([65]) d\u00e9cid\u00e9e encore par la Cour d'Appel en 1882, par Monk, Tessier, Cross et Baby JJ. La servitude en question avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e en 1811, dans un partage entre deux seigneurs. Les par tageants s'obligeaient mutueleement \" de ne b\u00e2tir aucun moulin \u00e0 farine ou \u00e0 scie pour leur compte particulier \u00e0 une lieu \u00e0 la ronde des dits moulins \u00e0 farine\" etc. Pas de mention de leurs successeurs, ni des heritages servant et dominant. Mais cela r\u00e9sultait des circon stances et de la nature du contrat. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure (Sicotee J ), jugea qu'il n'y avait pas servitude, mais simplement une obligaiion personnelle. En appel, la cour d\u00e9cida, au contraire, que l'acte de partage avait cr\u00e9\u00e9 une servitude r\u00e9ciproqee en faveur de chaque por tion de Ia seigneurie partag\u00e9e.\nIi ne me reste plus qu'\u00e0 examiner la pr\u00e9tentiou de l'intim\u00e9 que la servitude de se clore avait \u00e9t\u00e9 contract\u00e9e sous une condition purement facultative de la part de son auteur. Ii veut appliquer l'article 1081 du code civil correspondant \u00e0 l'article 1174 du Code Napol\u00e9on (qui, cependant, a omis le mot purement), conforme d'ailleurs au droit romain et l'ancien droit fran\u00e7ais. Tous les auteurs enseignent que l'obligaiion contaact\u00e9e sous la condition, si voluero, si je le veux, si \u00e7a me plaIt, on si je le juge \u00e0 propos, n'est pas valable. Pothier, ([66]), pense qu'il v a une vraie obligation lorsque je promets de vous donner quelque chose, si je le juge raisonnable, puisque, dit-il, je suis oblig\u00e9 au cas que cela soit raisonnable. Demolombe, Larombi\u00e8re et Du ranton disent que Pothier fait une fausse interpr\u00e9 tation d'un texte d'Ulpien, sur lequel ii s'appuie. Ils observent n\u00e9anmoins que la condition si cela est raison nable, n'est pas facultative. Larombi\u00e8re en dit autant de ces mots: Si je suis content; mais Demolombe le critique Duranton ec Marcad\u00e9 admettent l'obligation contaact\u00e9e en ces termes Quand je voudrai, Gum voluero en faisant la distinction du droit romain que Pothier et Delombe rejettent. Savigny est d'opinion que la convention de vendre \u00e0 Paul, sous Ia condition sil le vent dans un d\u00e9lai d\u00e9termin\u00e9, est nulle, tandis que Ducaurroy et Ortalan sont d'avis contraire. Demolombe et Fenet concluent que l'indication dun d\u00e9lai d\u00e9termin\u00e9 n'est pas m\u00eame essentiefle, tandis que Merlin-et son sentiment a \u00e9t\u00e9 conaacr\u00e9 par deuxar\u00eats\u2014enseigne tout l'oppos\u00e9. Tel est l'\u00e9tat de la doctrine en France, qui est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e an long dans Demolombe ([67]); et ii faut bien avouer qu'elle est loin d'\u00eatre satisfaisante, mar cad\u00e9 est peut-\u00eatre le commentateur qui soit arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion la plus juste et la plus pratique. Selon ce profond jurisconsulte ([68]), il faut distinguer trois classes de conditions potestatives, dont les deux premieres, mais non la derni\u00e8re, emportent la nullit\u00e9 dont parle l'article du Code.\nCe sont l celles dont l'objet consiste in ipsa voluntale, et qui signi fient nettement si voluero; 2\u00b0 Celles qui consistent bien in facto, mais llans lesquelles l'accomplissement ou l'absteniion, du fait d\u00e9pend telle ment de la fantaisie du d\u00e9biteur qu'elles sont exclusives de l'existence d'un lien et \u00e9quivalent an si voluero; 3 Enfin, celles dans lesquelles les circonstances sont telles que le dbiteur ne puisse faire accomplir ou d\u00e9faiilir le fait qu'en s'imposant un prejudice, une gene, qui for ment pour le cr\u00e9ancier une garantie contre le caprice de ce d\u00e9biteur ou en procurant \u00e0 ce cr\u00e9ancier un avantage qui lui offre une compensation \u00e0 l'incccomplissement de Ia promesse. Ces derni\u00e8res seules \u00e9chappent \u00e0 Ia disposition de notre article.\nLiintim\u00e9 est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment dans le cas de la troisi\u00e8me classe des conditions que distingue Marcad\u00e9. Ses auteurs ne pouvaient faire d\u00e9faillir le fait de la cloture qu'en s'imposant non seulement une g\u00eane, mais un veritable pr\u00e9judice, celui de laisser les moissons de l'\u00eele du Milieu aux d\u00e9g\u00e2ts des animaux de la Commune Ce pr\u00e9judice in\u00e9vitable \u00e9tait d\u00e9s l'origine une garantie pour le seigneur contre le caprice de son censitaire. Enfin, l'avantage de laisser les animaux de la Commune errer sur l'\u00eele du Milieu, tant que la cloture ne serait pas faite, procurait aux habitants de la Commune une \u00e9vidente compeisation \u00e0 l'inaccomplissement de la promesse.\nEnfin Grilbert sur Sirey, sur l'article 1174, dit que l'obligation qui d\u00e9pend non de la seule volont\u00e9 du d\u00e9biteur, mais d'un fait qu'il est toujours en son pouvoir d'ex\u00e9cuter, est valable et ii cite un grand nombre d'autorit\u00e9s \u00e0 l'appui de cette proposition. Si nous con sultons l'intention du Seigneur de Berthier et de Maccauly, il ne peut y avoir de doute que l'obiigation de clore l'\u00eele du Milieu \u00e0 l'\u00e9preuve des animaux de la Commune devait \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e, lorsqu'il y aurait une habitation et des grains \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger. C'est ce que voulaient dire ces mots, s'il te juge n\u00e9cessaire. Ce temps sera plus on moins \u00e9loign\u00e9, mais lorsqu'il arrivera, le propri\u00e9taire de l'\u00eele du Milieu devra ex\u00e9cuter son obligation; en attendant il devra souffrir les animaux de la Commune. Il y a simplement suspension de l'obligation par un \u00e9v\u00e9nement qui arrivera dans le cours naturel des choses. Cette n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 se fait sentir depuis cinquante \u00e0 soixante ans et m\u00eame au del\u00e0; c'est l'intim\u00e9 et ses auteurs qui en ont juge ainsi par leurs actes, en faisant la cl\u00f4ture sans interruption depuis un temps imm\u00e9morial, et je crois que l'intim\u00e9 a mauvaise gr\u00e2ce aujourd'hui de venir pr\u00e9tendre que ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, \u00e9tait purement facultatif. Il doit \u00eatre tenu de clore son \u00eele et de souffrir les animaux de la Commune si sa cl\u00f4ture n'est pas bonne et valable.\nEn d\u00e9cidant ainsi nous ne faisons que nous conformer aux jugement et ordonnances des ineendants du pays qui enjoignent aux propri\u00e9taires d'habitations d'en cl\u00d4turer la devanture et qui d\u00e9clarent que les habttant de Berthier jouiront pleinement et paisible ment de leur commune,sans se cl\u00d4turer. M\u00eame si le doute \u00e9tait permis\u2014ce que je ne concois pas-sur point de savoir si le titre de concesoion contient; une servitude conventionnelle, je crois qu'en facef de ces jugements et de ces ordonnances, qui font encoredla loi entre les parties, notre devoir serait de d\u00e9cider que lasp\u00efvitude de cl\u00d4turer l'\u00eele du Milieuen faveur de l'lle de ia Commune a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie par la loi. Finalement, je suis d'opinion d'accorder un titre-nouvel aux termes du contrat de concession, et de l'in terpr\u00e9ter dans le sens que je viens d'indiquer. Je serais encore d'avis de condamner l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 payer \u00e0 J'appelant $50 pour les dommages du pass\u00e9 et aux d\u00e9pens devant toutes les cours\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: J.

S. C. c, 135, s. 29 (b) j 56 V. c. 29, s. 1 (D)\nA by-law was passed for the widening of a portion of a street up to a certain homologated line, and for the necessary expropriations therefor. Assessments for the expropriations for certain years having been made whereby proprietors of a part of the street were relieved from contributing any proportion to the cost, thereby increasing the burden of assessment on the properties actually assessed, the owness of these properiies brought an action to set aside the assessments. The Court of Queen's Bench affirmed a judgment dismissing the action. On an application for leave to appeal :\nHeld, that as the effect of the judgment sought to be appealed from would be to increase the burden of assessment not only for the expropriations then made, but also for expropriations which would have to be made in the future, the judgment was one from which an appeal would lie, the matter in controversy coming within the meaning of the words \" and other matters or things where the rights in future might be bound,\" contained in subsec. (b) of sec. 29 Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, as amended by 56 Vict. ch. 29, sec. 1. Motion before a judge in chambers, pursuant to section 46 of \" The Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act,\" to have the security approved on an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), rendered on the 17th day of December, 1896.\nA sufficient statement of the facts as shown upon the application is given in the judgment of Mr. Justice Sedgewick now reported.\nWeir in support of the motion.\nJ. A. Ritchie, contra.\nSedgewick J.\u2014The facts out of which this case arose may be briefly stated as follows:\nStanley street, in the city of Montreal, runs in a northerly and southerly direction and extends from Osborne street to the confines of Mount Royal Park, being intersected at right angles by Osborne, Dorchester, St. Catherine and Sherbrooke streets. From Sherbrooke street to its northerly limit it extends for a distance of 585 feet. Prior to the proceedings which gave rise to this action it had been determined by the corporation of the city that that portion of this street between Sherbrooke and St. Catherine streets, which was then of the width of 30 feet, should be widened to an additional width of 20 feet, or to 50 feet in all, and a by-law was passed fixing a line 20 feet back from the original line of the street, up to which the properties upon said street should be expropriated for the purpose of carrying out the intended widening of the street. Thereupon a part of the property on this homologated line between Sherbrooke and St. Catherine streets was expropriated and an assessment roll \"prepared by which the cost of the widening, so far as the expropriation in question was concerned, was cast upon all the immoveable property situated, not only between St. Catherine and Sherbrooke streets but also to the north of Sherbrooke street; in other words, the burden of the cost was distributed over the properties on Stanley street from St. Catherine street to the extreme northerly limit of Stanley street. This assessment roll was attacked by Mr. Richard White, a proprietor of an immoveable on that part of Stanley street to the north of Sherbrooke street, who claimed that his property should not be assessed for the widening of Stanley street, because the upper part of Stanley street, as that part north of Sherbrooke street may be called, was; as he alleged, a private and not a public street. This contestation proceeded to judgment, and in June, 1894, the Superior Court maintained the contentions of Mr. \"White, and quashed the assessment roll.\nFurther expropriations to carry out the proposed widening of Stanley street, between St. Catherine and Sherbrooke streets, were then proceeded with in the years 1891, 1892 and 1893, and assessment rolls were prepared by which the whole cost of these expropriations was thrown upon the proprietors on Stanley street, between St. Catherine and Sherbrooke streets, and no part of the cost upon Mr. White or other proprietors on Stanley street north of Sherbrooke street.\nThereupon Messrs. Stevenson, Greene and Graham, who seek to appeal in this case, filed petitions asking to have these various assessment rolls set aside on the ground that their assessments were considerably augmented by the improper release of the property on Stanley street north of Sherbrooke street from any portion of the assessment. Mr. White was brought into the case to defend his interests. He contended, among other things, that that part of Stanley street north of Sherbrooke street could not be subjected to any part of the burden of the assessment, first, because the judgment of June, 1894, was res judicata, and binding on the petitioners, and settled this point; and secondly, because if not now a private street, it, by agreement with the corporation, was made a public street only on condition that the properties on that part of the street should not be liable to bear any part of the cost of widening the street.\nThe petitioners joined issue on these pleas, and the case came before the court below for judgment, and the Superior Court held, first, that the judgment of June, 1894, in the action between Mr. White and the city of Montreal, was res judicata, and established the fact that the portion of the street north of Sherbrooke was a private street, and therefore not liable to assessment, and secondly, even if that point had not been settled by the judgment, the petitioners had failed to prove that the street was not a private street. This judgment was up held by the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, and from this latter judgment the petitioners now seek to appeal.\nThe application in the first instance came before the registrar, who decided that in view of the importance of the case, and in view of the fact, which was mentioned to him by counsel, that several of the judges of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada had decided to refuse leave to appeal to this court, he ought to refer the application to the judge on the rota, and it therefore came before me in the ordinary course, and I heard counsel for the various parties interested. .. After giving the matter careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that the security should be allowed and the parties permitted to prosecute their appeal before this court. The only question to be determined on this application is as to whether the case is one coming within section 29 (b) of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, which now reads as follows :\nNo appeal shall lie under this Act from any judgment rendered in the province of Quebec in any action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding wherein the matter in controversy does not amount to the sum or value of $2,000, unless such matter, if less than that amount\n(b) Relates to any fee of office, duty, rent, revenue or any sum of money payable to Her Majesty, or to any title to lands or tenements, annual rents and other matters or things where the rights in future might be bound.\nAnd narrowing the question to be decided still further, it is, whether the appeal is one which comes within the words of this section \" and other matters or things where the rights in future might be bound.\"\nIt is true that Mr. Weir, for the appellants, contended that this matter was one which \" relates .. to title to lands or tenements, \" but I think no question of title within the meaning of this section is involved, and that the sole question is as to whether any future rights within the meaning of the last clause of the section, might be bound by this judgment.\nMany cases were cited to me bearing upon the construction of this statute, but there is one which is not easily to be distinguished from the present case, Les Eccl\u00e9siastiques de St. Sulpice v. The City of Montreal ([1]). I do not think that any of the later cases impair the effect of this case, which, moreover, was decided before the alteration in the statute which changed the words \"such like matters or things,\" as originally used in the section, to \" other matters or things.\" The effect of the change has been to widen and not restrict the scope of the section. The section as it now stands has been considered in several cases, particularly Chamber Iand v. Fortier ([2]); and O'Dell v. Gregory ([3]). In the latter case the only point decided was that the statute as amended does not apply to personal rights. The rights questioned in the \"present case are certainly not personal rights, but, if not real rights, are at least analogous to real rights, and therefore, in my opinion, within the contemplation of the statute. The question is whether certain properties on Stanley street shall bear a greater or lesser burden of taxation, not only as the result of the expropriations which have already been made, but as the result of expropriations to be hereafter made for the purpose of carrying out the widening of Stanley street to the full width of the homologated line. This appeal will settle the liability of the properties of these petitioners, not only as regards the assessments already made, but the liability of such properties for assessments to be made in the future as the result of further expropriations \"upon the basis of the homologation. That further expropriations are contemplated as necessary, and will be made, and further assessments imposed similar to those in question herein, is established beyond dispute by the papers which have been put in on the application before me.\nUpon consideration of all the cases bearing upon the subject, I have come to the conclusion that this appeal comes within the effect of s.s. (b) of s. 29, as it now stands, and that the application should be allowed. I therefore allow it with costs fixed at the sum of $25 to the appellants.\nThe order will go nunc pro tunc as of the 26th day of January last, when the application was first heard before the registrar.\nMotion allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Weir & Hibbard.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Roy & Ethier.\n[1] 16 Can.

The line thus run being disputed, M. brought an action to have this line declared the true boundary, and to revendicate a disputed strip of land lying upon his side of the line so run by the surveyor:\nHeld, that under R. S. C., c. 135 s. 29, s.s. (b), as amended by 56 V. c. 29, s. 1. (D), an appeal would lie to the Supreme Court of Canada, first, on the ground that the question involved was one relating to a title to lands, and second, on the ground that it involved matters or things where rights in future may be bound. Chamberland v. Fortier (23 Can. S. C. R., 371), referred to and approved.\nAppeal from the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), reversing the judgment of the Superior Court in the District of Ottawa, which maintained the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe circumstances giving rise to the action were as follows The plaintiff and defendant being owners of contiguous lands in the Township of Hull, in the County of Ottawa, between which no regular division line appears to have existed, entered into an agreement in writing before a notary public to have the line established by a provincial land surveyor therein named, and thereby bound themselves to abide by the survey and report to be made by him in conformity with such agreement as indicating the boundary line between their respective lands.\nThe survey was made accordingly, and a line reported as the true line of delimitation between the lands which was agreeable to the plaintiff, but the defendants refused to acquiesce in the line so determined, or to sign the proc\u00e8s-verbal of the survey, and continued to occupy a strip of land on the plaintiff's side of the line so defined, which appeared by affidavits filed to be valued at less than $2,000.\nThe plaintiff brought his action to have the said line declared to be the true boundary between such lands, to enjoin the defendant against trespassing beyond it, and to be declared the owner and put into possession of the disputed strip of land, and further, to have boundary marks placed, and so forth.\nThe Superior Court adopted the surveyor's report and granted the conclusions of the plaintiff's action. On appeal the Court of Queen's Bench reversed the judgment and held that the report and proc\u00e8s-verbal of the surveyor did not bind the parties.\nGeoffrion Q.C. and L. N. Champagne for the respondent moved to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction on the grounds that the matter in controversy did not amount in value to $2000; that the action was in the nature of an action merely to establish a boundary, and did not relate to a title to lands or tenements or otherwise come within the classes of actions appealable from the courts of the Province of Quebec under the provisions of the 29th section of The Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act as amended. Hood v. Sangster ([1]); Wineberg v. Hampson ([2]); and The Emerald Phosphate Company v. The Anglo-Continental Guano Works ([3]); were cited in support of the motion.\nForan Q.C. contra. This court has frequently entertained appeals in actions en bornage; McArthur v. Brown ([4]); The Bell's Asbestos Co. v. The Johnson's Co. ([5]); Mrcier v Barette ([6]); Grasett v. Carter ([7]); Cass. Dig. 2 ed. vo. Boundary;\" and even in possessory actions (en complainte); Pinsonnautt v. H\u00e8bert ([8]); Chamberland v. Fortier ([9]).\nThis action affects a title to lands, and by the decision rights in future may be bound within the meaning of the statute as amended. Actions enbornage may, and this action does, seek the revendication of lands; 6 Laurent, no. 167. It is a mixed action; Nouveau Denizart, Vo. \"Bornage;\" and the obligation to set boundaries strongly savours of the realty; 1 Mourlon, Code Civil, p. 835; 7 Laurent, no. 428; 8 Poullain du Parc, p. 12. We claim that the notarial agreement is to be read as including the surveyor's report, thus constituting a conveyance and part of a chain of title to the disputed strip of land. See 2 Aubry and Rau, section 199. We are a step in advance of the action under art. 971 C. C. P. and actually demand a declaration of our title, as \"well as to have boundary marks placed and fences constructed with the object of preventing troubles in the future. The judgment under appeal destroys our title and bars further action on our part. Hood v. Sangster ([10]) only affected personal rights of a value under $2,000, whilst in The Emerald Phosphate Company v. The Anglo-Continental Guano Company (1) no boundary line had been run and no real right to specific lands was affected. The judgment of the court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice (oral)\u2014The Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, as amended by the statutes of 1891 and 1893, extends the jurisdiction of this court to controversies involving questions of \"title to lands or tenements, annual rents, or other matters or things where rights in future may be bound,\" and it seems clear that this case comes within these provisions on two points.\nFirst, the question is one which relates to a title to lands.\nIf the parties had agreed to the line in the first instance between themselves the plaintiff would have been entitled to a piece of land in possession of the defendant.\nIt appears that the parties executed a notarial deed for the purpose of settling the boundary between contiguous lands of which they were respectively proprietors, and thereby constituted a provincial land surveyor, therein named, their referee to run the line, and it is upon his report made in conformity with the agreement that the action is based. So far as the pre sent motion is concerned the deed must be regarded as if it had in fact contained the report of the surveyor as subsequently made, and thus read it constitutes a title to lands and tenements.\nThe case of Wineberg v. Hampson ([11]) referred to on the motion depended on the jurisdiction as settled by the statute before the amendments mentioned, and is referred to and distinguished in Chamberland v. Forrier ([12]), as having been overruled by the amending Acts. This latter case determined that the court has jurisdiction in cases of servitude, and it must be followed in cases like the present. On the other point, although the action is not actually in the form of an action en bornage, the plaintiff seeks such relief as is usually granted in such cases, which is in effect to have the boundaries established for the purpose of quieting the titles to the contiguous lands, and under the present practice the form of action is immaterial. In such a case the rights in future of the parties would certainly be bound by the judgment. Therefore, on this ground also the court has jurisdiction to hear the appeal. The motion must therefore be refused with costs.\nMotion refused with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant T. P. Foran.\nSolicitors for the respondent Rochon & Champagne.\n[1] 16 Can. S. C.

The mill contained some 400 looms, and for every forty-six there was a man, called the \u201cloom fixer,\u201d whose duty it was to keep them in proper repair. The evidence showed that the accident was caused by a bolt breaking by the shuttle coming in contact with it, and as this bolt served as a guard to the shuttle the latter could not remain in the loom. The jury found that the breaking of the bolt caused the accident, and that the \u201cloom fixer\u201d was guilty of negligence in not having examined it within a reasonable time before it broke. T. obtained a verdict, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nHeld, Gwynne J. dissenting, that the \u201cloom fixer\u201d had not performed his duty properly; that the evidence as to negligence could not have been withdrawn from the jury; and that, as there was evidence to justify their finding, the verdict should stand.\nPer Gwynne J., that the finding of the jury that the negligence consisted in the omission to examine the bolt was not satisfactory, as there was nothing to show that such examination could have prevented the accident, and there should be a new trial. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, sustaining the verdict for the plaintiff at the trial.\nThe facts of the case are set out in the above head-note.\nMartin Q.C. for the appellants.\nTate for the respondent was stopped by the court.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (oral).\u2014The injury to the plaintiff was due to the breaking of the bolt, and the only question is whether or not there is proof of negligence on the part of the servants of the company sufficient to justify the verdict.\nI quite agree with the ruling of the court below that the plaintiff had no cause of action at common law, but I think she was entitled to recover under the Act of 1892.\nMr. Justice Osler was of opinion that the case could not have been withdrawn from the jury, and refers especially to the evidence of Bradley, whose duty it was to look after the looms. This witness states that although notified that something was wrong with the loom at which the accident occurred he did not examine it. I entirely agree with the view taken by Mr. Justice Osler that there was evidence for the consideration of the jury, and further, that there is no ground for a new trial.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and a new trial ordered. The answers of the jury to the questions submitted to them are not sufficient to maintain the plaintiff\u2019s action; that action can only be sustained by proof that the loom out of which the shuttle proceeded which caused injury to the plaintiff was defective in some particular which could and should have been discovered by the defendant or his servants, and repaired so as to prevent the occurrence of the accident by which the plaintiff was injured, but the jury have not found that there was any defect in the loom, or if any, in what it consisted, so that it has not been proved whether it was of such a nature that the non discovery of it by the defendants or their servants in charge of the factory, and the non repair of the defect, constituted negligence for which the defendants are responsible. For this reason I am of opinion that there should be a new trial.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Martin & Martin.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Carscallen & Cahill.\n",

It was then a sufficient certificate of the paper offered being a true copy of the list actually used at the election. Richelieu Election Case (21 Can. S. C. R. 168) followed.\nAPPEAL from decisions of Mr. Justice Dubuc in the Winnipeg case, and the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in the Macdonald case, overruling preliminary objections to the petitions filed against the return of the respective appellants.\nThe appeal was limited in each of these cases to two grounds. 1. That the petitions were not properly served. 2. That the status of the petitioners was not proved. The first ground was not strongly pressed on the argument, and is not dealt with by the judgment of the court on this appeal.\nThe evidence offered in each case to prove status was a copy of a list of voters containing the name of the petitioner, to which was annexed a certificate of the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery. In the Winnipeg case the certificate was as follows:\nI, Samuel E. St. O. Chapleau, the undersigned Clerk of the Crown in Chancery for Canada, do hereby certify that the foregoing list is a true copy of the list of voters of polling division number seven in the electoral district of the city of Winnipeg, Man., which remains of record in my office, and is also a true copy of the list of voters which was used at said polling division, at and in relation to an election of a member to the House of Commons of Canada, for the said electoral district, holden on the sixteenth and twenty-third days of June, A.D. 1896, held pursuant to a writ of election issued therefor and dated the twenty-fourth day of April, A.D. 1896, which original list of voters was returned to me by the returning officer for said electoral district in the same plight and condition as it now appears, and said original list of voters is now on record in my office.\nDated at Ottawa, this twenty-second day of August, A.D. 1896.\n[Sgd.] SAMUEL E. ST. O. CHAPLEAU,\nC.C.C.C. Seal. C.C.C.C.\nThe following was the certificate in the Macdonald case:\nI, Samuel \u0415. St. O. Chapleau, the undersigned Clerk of the Crown in Chancery for Canada, do hereby certify that the foregoing list, consisting of two pages, and containing 231 names, is a true copy of the list of voters for polling district number thirteen, in the electoral district of Macdonald as finally revised for the year 1894, under \u201c The Electoral Franchise Act,\u201d and as used at and in relation to an election of a member of the House of Commons of Canada for the said electoral district, holden in the sixteenth and twenty-third days of June, 1896, held pursuant to writ of election issued therefor and dated the twenty-fourth day of April, A.D. 1896, which original list of voters was returned to me by the returning officer for said electoral district in the same plight and condition as it now appears, and said original list of voters is now on record in my office.\nDated at Otttawa, this 8th day of August, A.D. 1896.\n[Sgd.] SAMUEL \u0415. ST. O. CHAPLEAU,\nC.C.C.C. Seal. C.C.C.C.\nIt was contended that these certificates were not sufficient; that the Richelieu Election Case ([1]) decided that it was necessary to prove that the petitioners name was on the list actually used at the election, and the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery could not certify to a copy of the list so used, as he could have no knowledge, except by information from others, that it was such a copy. The objections were dismissed by the court below in both cases.\nStewart TupperQ.C. for the appellants. The petitioner must prove his status. Stanstead Election Case (2); Bellechasse Election Case (3). The certificates of the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery are worthless as he professes to certify to a fact of which he can have no knowledge. See Richelieu Election Case ([2]).\nHowell Q.C. and Chrysler Q.C. for the respondents. Petitioners having voted in prima facie evidence of status. Rex. v. Gordon ([3]). In re Stormont ([4]).\nThe appellants have not made out the strong case required on preliminary objections. Shelburne Election Case ([5]).\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The grounds of appeal in these cases are identical. By the 21st section of the Electoral Franchise Act, 49 Vict. ch. 5, as amended by 53 Vict, ch. 8, it is enacted that after the lists for the several polling districts have been finally revised the revising officer shall prepare the final list of voters in the form prescribed in the Act and shall certify the original list as corrected and so finally settled in the form E set out in the schedule to the Act. Then in subsection 3 it is enacted that copies in duplicate of such revised lists shall be prepared by the revising officer who shall retain one copy and forward the other by registered letter, to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery at Ottawa. Then by subsection 7 it is enacted that the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery as such lists are received by him shall cause them to be printed by the Queen\u2019s Printer, and after the verification of the printed copy by the revising officer who has prepared such list he shall transmit a sufficient number of such printed copies to such revising officer. It is thus apparent that the duplicate copies of such finally revised list of which one is retained by the revising officer in each district, and the other transmitted by him to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, are duplicate originals of the finally revised lists in the several electoral divisions. So likewise the printed copy first prepared by the Queen\u2019s Printer from the list furnished to him by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery after verification by the revising officer who prepared the list as required by subsection 7 may also be said to be a duplicate original of the list as finally revised. It is in this view as it appears to me that the 32nd section of the said Electoral Franchise Act as amended by the said Act 53 Vict. ch. 8, enacts that the revising officer, the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery and the Queen\u2019s Printer shall supply certified copies of the said lists finally printed and verified as hereinbefore provided to any person applying for the same and paying therefore, &c., &c.\n2. Every copy of a list of voters supplied by the revising officer, the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, or the Queen\u2019s Printer, and certified by any one of such officers as correct in the form E in the schedule to the Act shall be deemed to be an authentic copy of such list.\nNow the form E is that prescribed for the certificate to be attached by the revising officer to the finally revised lists, duplicate originals of which he is, as above shown, required to prepare and to transmit one to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, and is as follows:\n\u201c I,\u2014 \u2014, the undersigned revising officer for the electoral district of do hereby certify that the foregoing list is a true copy of the list of voters for polling district number , in the said electoral district as finally revised (or, as finally revised and corrected on appeal as the case may be) for the year under the Electoral Franchise Act.\u201d Now it appears to me, I confess, to be free from doubt that the only document in the Queen\u2019s Printer\u2019s possession which would enable him to give a certificate in the above form is the copy printed by him from the list furnished to him by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, after verification thereof by the revising officer who had prepared the list as required by the above subsection 7 of section 21, and that therefore such verified printed copy may, as I have said, be well regarded also as a duplicate original of the list as finally revised, with which, upon the copy proposed to be certified by the Queen\u2019s Printer being compared he may give a certificate in the form prescribed, and that such certificate shall be sufficient evidence that the copy so certified is an authentic copy of the list as finally revised and of which it is certified to be a copy, so the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery can only certify a copy presented to him for his certificate in the form prescribed upon comparing it with the duplicate original of the list as finally revised transmitted to him by the revising officer under the subsections of the above 21st section, or possibly he might consider himself to be justified in giving his certificate upon satisfying himself that the list presented to him for his certificate was one of the copies printed by the Queen\u2019s Printer from the printed copy verified by the revising officer and furnished to the Queen\u2019s Printer. But this 32nd section does not appear to contemplate giving the character of authenticity in evidence to any document that is not certified (by whomsoever it may be certified whether by the revising officer, the Clerk of the Crown or the Queen\u2019s Printer) to be a true copy of the list as finally revised by the revising officer of the electoral district under consideration, that section does not give authenticity or validity to any other certificate. Then by the Dominion Elections Act 49 Vic. ch. 8, sec. 13, it is enacted that the returning officer for each electoral district shall forthwith upon the receipt of a writ of election, obtain from the revising officer of the electoral district for which he is returning officer, at least one copy of the list of voters as finally revised and certified by the revising officer and then in force for each of the polling districts in such electoral district, &c., &c.\nThen by section 30, subsection b, it is enacted that on a poll being granted the returning officer shall furnish each deputy returning officer with a copy of the list of voters in the polling district for which he is appointed, each copy being first certified by himself or by the revising officer for the electoral district in which such polling district is situate.\nThen by section 41 it is enacted that subject to the provisions thereinafter contained all persons whose names are registered on the list of voters, for polling districts in any electoral district, in force under the provisions of the Electoral Franchise Act on the day of the polling at any election for such electoral district, shall be entitled to vote at any such election, and no other person shall be entitled to vote thereat. Then in section 42 is inserted an enumeration of the persons who although registered as voters on the list as finally revised by the revising officer under the Electoral Franchise Act are by section 41 disqualified and rendered incompetent to vote, namely, judges, revising officers, returning officers and others. The persons here named are the only persons deprived of the qualification to vote conferred upon them by their names being registered on the lists as finally revised by the revising officers.\nThe Acts of the legislature, always dealing as they do with the list of voters actually used by a deputy returning officer at an election as a copy of the original list as finally revised by the revising officers, there is nothing in the Acts providing for the possible bat unlikely occurrence of an error or errors in the copy furnished to the deputy returning officers by reason of the names of one or more voters which are registered upon the finally revised list as voters being by mistake omitted in the copy furnished to a deputy returning officer. Such an omission could only take place by error, and although by the provisions of the Act as to the deputy returning officer furnishing ballot papers to all persons coming forward to vote, the deputy returning officer by reason of such name or names being so by error omitted from the copy of the list furnished to him might refuse to give to such party or parties, ballot papers, and so they might be unable to have their votes recorded, yet in such a case it would be more proper to say that those persons were by such neglect and error of some person deprived of the power to exercise their absolute inextinguishable right to vote by reason of their being registered on the list as finally revised under the provisions of the Dominion Franchise Act. They cannot with any propriety be said to be disfranchised or at all disqualified and deprived of their right to file a petition to set aside an election under 49 Vict. ch. 9, sec. 5. Their status as petitioner in such a petition would, in my judgment, be unaffected by such an error. But for the judgment of this court in the Richelieu Case ([6]) I should have no doubt that upon an issue calling in question the status and qualification of the petitioner in an election petition a copy of the finally revised list in force under the Electoral Franchise Act certified by the revising officer or by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery to be a true copy of such finally revised list upon which the name of the petitioner appeared to be registered as a qualified voter, was conclusive evidence of his status and qualification to file the petition. This court, however, in that case decided otherwise, and held that such a certified copy was of no use whatever, and that the only certificate which would be of any use was a certified copy of the copy actually used by the deputy returning officer at the election under consideration, which certificate the court held could be given by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery. In the present cases the petitioners respectively produced copies of a list of voters whereon their names respectively appeared. That in the Winnipeg case was intituled and headed: \u201c List of voters, 1894, for the polling district no. 7, in the city of Winnipeg, in the electoral district of Winnipeg,\u201d that being the polling district under consideration in that case. At the foot of this list is a certificate purporting to be a copy of a certificate of the revising officer of that electoral district in the words following:\nI, David M. Walker, the undersigned revising officer for the electoral district of Winnipeg, do hereby certify that the foregoing list consisting of three pages, and containing 507 \u043f\u0430mes, is a true copy of the list of voters for polling district number seven, in the electoral district of Winnipeg, as finally revised for the year 1894, under the Electoral Franchise Act.\nDated at Winnipeg, 20th March, 1896.\n(Sgd.) D. M. WALKER.\nImmediately under this is a certificate signed by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, in the words following:\nI, Samuel E. St. O. Chapleau, the undersigned Clerk of the Crown in Chancery for Canada, do hereby certify that the foregoing list is a true copy of the list of voters of polling division number seven in the electoral district of the city of Winnipeg, Man., which remains of record in my office, and is also a true copy of the list of voters which was used at said polling division at and in relation to an election of a member of the House of Commons of Canada for the said electoral district holden on the sixteenth and twenty-third days of June, A.D. 1896, held pursuant to a writ of election issued therefor, and dated the twenty-fourth day of April, A.D. 1896, which original list of voters was returned to me by the returning officer for said electoral district in the same plight and condition as it now appears, and said original list of voters is now on record in my office.\nDated at Ottawa, this twenty-second day of August, A.D. 1896.\nSAMUEL E. ST. O. CHAPLEAU,\nC.C.C.C.\nThe list of voters produced in the Macdonald case was intituled and headed: \u201c List of voters, 1894, for polling district no. 13 of Portage la Prairie, East Centre, in the electoral district of Macdonald,\u201d (that being the polling district under consideration in that case). At the foot of this list is a certificate signed by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery in the words following:\nI, Samuel E. St. O. Chapleau, the undersigned Clerk of the Crown in Chancery for Canada, do hereby certify that the foregoing list consisting of two pages and containing 231 names, is a true copy of the list of voters for polling district number thirteen in the electoral district of Macdonald, as finally revised for the year 1894, under the Electoral Franchise Act, and as used at and in relation to an election for a member of the House of Commons, holden on the sixteenth and twenty-third days of June, 1896, held pursuant to writ of election issued therefor and dated the twenty-fourth day of April, A.D. 1896, which original list of voters was returned to me by the returning officer for said electoral district in the same plight and condition as it now appears and said original list of voters is now on record in my office.\nDated at Ottawa this 8th day of August, A.D. 1896.\nSAMUEL E. ST. O. CHAPLEAU.\nThese certificates appear to have been framed in the above form under the erroneous impression that the decision of this court in the Richelieu case was that certified copies both of the list as finally revised by the revising officer and in force under the Electoral Franchise Act, and of the copy which was actually used by the deputy returning officer at an election brought into contestation by an election petition, must be produced in support of the status and qualification of the petitioner, and the learned counsel for the appellants in his argument before us contended that the certificates of the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery produced in these cases were defective in both characters, that is to say both as certificates that the copies produced were respectively true copies of the lists as finally revised by the revising officer under the Electoral Franchise Act as the lists applicable 10 the elections under consideration, and also as certificates that the copies produced are respectively true copies of the lists or copies of lists which were actually used by each of the deputy returning officers at the polling districts under consideration. His objection to the certificates in so far as related to the question whether the list produced in the Macdonald case was a true copy of the list as finally revised by the revising officer under the Electoral Franchise Act was that it is not in the form E prescribed by the statute inasmuch as it does not state the year to which the list relates as required by the form prescribed by the statute, so as to show that it was the list in force at the election in question. This objection does not appear to be open upon the certificate in the Macdonald case which is in the form E as prescribed in the statute in so far as relates to the lists as finally revised is concerned, but as the decision in the Richelieu case is, that certified copies of the list as finally revised under the Electoral Franchise Act cannot be received at all in evidence of a petitioner\u2019s status to file an election petition when such status is called in question it is unnecessary now to deal with that part of the certificates. The learned counsel\u2019s main argument, however, was that the certificates were wholly defective in so far as they purport to be certificates that the copies produced are true copies of lists or rather of the copies of lists which were actually used by the deputy returning officers at the respective polling districts under consideration. His argument was that the statute cannot be construed as contemplating the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery giving a certificate of the truth of a fact of which he has not in virtue of his office or of his duties as Clerk of the Crown in Chancery any direct knowledge whatever, of which he can know nothing except by hearsay or information from others, or as giving any statutory authenticity to such certificate if inadvertently or otherwise given; that the utmost that the statute can contemplate the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery certifying so that any effect should be given to his certificate is as to copies of documents coming under the provisions of the statute into his custody and care in the character of his office as Clerk of the Crown in Chancery; that by the express terms of section 32 of the Electoral Franchise Act the only certified copy there referred to as being given authenticity to when certified by him is a copy of the lists finally printed and verified under the Electoral Franchise Act, a duplicate original of which the 21st section provides shall be furnished to him by the revising officer, and that the only other section authorizing the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery to give any certificate which shall be received in evidence at all is the 114th sec. of 49 Vic. ch. 8, which enacts that: \u201cThe Clerk of the Crown in Chancery may deliver certified copies of any writ, list of voters, poll books, returns, reports, and other documents in his possession relating to an election except ballot papers, and such copies so certified shall be received as prim\u0103 facie evidence before any election judge or court, or before any court of justice in Canada.\u201d Now the argument of the appellant\u2019s counsel is that this section only authorizes, and cannot be construed as authorizing more, the Clerk of the Court in Chancery to certify copies of documents in his custody as such Clerk of the Crown as true copies of such documents in his possession, and that as the Clerk of the Crown has no knowledge and can have no knowledge of what list of voters was actually used by any deputy returning officer, the only certificate which he can give to which any effect is given by the 114th section must be a certificate that a paper signed by him is a true copy of a copy of a list of voters as returned to him by the returning officer as the list which was actually used by the deputy returning officer at a particular election, and which is in his possession, and such a certificate, the argument is, can only under the section be received as prim\u0103 facie evidence that the copy certified is a true copy of the paper returned to the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery by the returning officer as having been the one used by the deputy returning officer, and not as evidence of the fact that the paper so returned by the returning officer was in truth the list or copy which the deputy returning officer had actually used, and in support of his argument the learned counsel dwelt upon certain passages in the judgment in the Richelieu case which he relied upon as supporting his contention. The argument of the learned counsel appeared to me, I confess, a very able argument in support of a contention that, a list certified by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery to be a true copy of the list as finally revised by the revising officer having force at a particular election, was conclusive evidence of the status and qualification of a petitioner in an election petition upon its being made to appear that the petitioner was registered upon such list as a qualified voter, and not disqualified by sec. 42 of 49 Vict. ch. 8, if that question had not been concluded in the negative by the Richelieu case, but while that case remains unreversed we must give effect to it. To a point urged upon behalf of the petitioners that they had respectively voted at the election, and that this fact was sufficient proof of their status as persons having a right to vote, the learned counsel for the appellants argued that such evidence was quite insufficient, and in support of his argument he relied upon certain passages in the judgment in the Richelieu case, among which was the following: \u201c In dealing with a question of evidence, courts do not permit facts susceptible of proof to be established by mere influence from other facts from which they are not necessary consequences,\u201d and he contended that the fact of a person voting in the name of a person upon the list of voters qualified to vote at an election was no evidence presumptive or otherwise that the person so voting was the person entitled to vote in that name.\nUpon the whole, I think that as the Richelieu case decides, as I understand the judgment, that the best evidence of the status of a petitioner in an election petition to file the petition is a certified copy of the copy which was actually used by the deputy returning officer at the polling division in question, and that such certificate can be given under the provisions of the statute by the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery from the papers in his possession, I think we must construe that case as holding that such a certificate as the Clerk of the. Crown in Chancery can truthfully give, viz: that the copy certified by him is a true copy of a paper returned to him by the returning officer as the very list used by the deputy returning officer at the polling district in question, and that such list remains of record in possession of the Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, is sufficient within the decision of the Richelieu case. The certificates given are, I think, to this effect, and so are admissible as prim\u00e2 facie evidence of their truth; and construing the decision in the Richelieu case as above, I think the status of the petitioners prim\u00e2 facie established, and that the appeals in these cases must be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nWinnipeg Case:\nSolicitors for the appellant: Macdonald, Tupper, Phippin & Tupper.\nSolicitor for the respondents: F.

JUSTICE RICHARDSON.\nAppeal\u2014Election petition\u2014Preliminary objection\u2014Delay in filing\u2014Objections struck out\u2014Order in chambers\u2014R. S. G. c. 8, s. 50.\nThe Supreme Court refused to entertain an appeal from the decision of a judge in chambers granting a motion to have preliminary objections to an election petition struck out for not being filed in time. Such decision was not one on preliminary objections with s. 50 of the Controverted Elections Act, and if it were no judgment on the motion could put an end to the petition. APPEAL from a decision of Mr. Justice Richardson, in chambers, granting a motion by the petitioner to have preliminary objections to the petition struck out.\nAn election petition was filed against the return of the appellant in the general election for the House of Commons on June 22nd, 1896. Preliminary objections to the petition were filed with the clerk of the court on August 3rd, the fifth day after service of the petition, at 2.30 p.m. An ordinance of the North-West Territories, Judicature Ordinance no. 6 of 1893, sec. 17, subsec. 1, provides that during the summer vacation, which comprises the months of July and August, the office of the clerk shall be closed at 1 p.m.\nA summons was taken out by the petitioner, returnable before Mr. Justice Richardson in chambers, calling upon the appellant to show cause why the objection should not be struck out as not having been filed within five days after service of the petition as required by sec. 12 of the Controverted Elections Act, R. S. C, ch. 9. On return of the summons the learned judge held that the five days had expired at 1 p.m. on August 3rd, and that the objections were not properly filed and that the petition was at issue. An appeal was taken to the Supreme Court from that decision.\nMcIntyre Q.C. for the appellant, referred on the merits to Rolker v. Fuller ([1]); Bothwell Election Case ([2]).\nHowell Q.C. and Chrysler Q.C. for the respondent. The court has no jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. It is not an appeal from a decision on preliminary objections and no decision on the matter can put an end to the petition. See Salaman v. Warner ([3]).\nMclntyre in reply cited Powell on Appellate Jurisdiction ([4]). SEDGEWICK J.\u2014A petition in this case was duly presented under the Dominion Controverted Elections Act, and was served on the appellant on the 29th of July, 1896. Preliminary objections were presented and filed on Monday the 3rd of August following, but at half past two o'clock in the afternoon. Section 12 of the Act provides that such objections must be pre-sented within five days after service of the petition, and the Judicature Ordinance, no. 6 of 1893, sec. 17, subsec. 1, enacts that the office of the clerk of the court shall on Saturdays and during vacation be closed at one o'clock in the afternoon.\nOn the 2nd of September the respondent took out a summons calling upon the appellant to show cause why the preliminary objections should not be struck out or otherwise disposed of, subsequently giving notice that on the hearing of the motion he intended to take the ground that the preliminary objections had not been filed within the five days prescribed by the Act, inasmuch as they had been filed after one o'clock on the Monday referred to. Upon the hearing of this motion\u2014a motion to strike from the files, or otherwise dispose of the objections\u2014the learned judge, Mr. Justice Richardson, gave judgment sustaining the contention that the respondent was too late in filing his objections, and that the petition was therefore at issue. In other words, he held that he could not hear the objections upon their merits, and up to the present time there has been no judgment passed in respect to the validity of any of them. It is from this decision that this ap\u00adpeal is taken, and a motion has been made before us to quash on the ground that this court has no jurisdiction to entertain it.\nWe are all of opinion that this motion must prevail. Section 50 of the Act is as follows: 50. An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court of Canada under this Act by any party to an election petition who is dissatisfied with the decision of the court or a judge:\n(a) From the judgment, rule, order or decision of any court or judge on any preliminary objection to an election petition, the allowance of which objection has been final and conclusive, and has put an end to such petition, or which objection if it had been allowed would have been final and conclusive, and have put an end to such petition; Provided always that, unless the court or judge appealed from otherwise orders, an appeal in the last mentioned case shall not operate as a stay of proceedings, nor shall it delay the trial of the petition:\n(b) From the judgment or decision on any question of law or of fact of the judge who has tried such petition.\nIt is only then in two cases that an appeal to this court is provided for, first, from the judgment on a preliminary objection, and secondly, from a judgment of the trial judges upon the trial. But it is not from a judgment upon all preliminary objections that an appeal lies. The objection must be of such a character as, if allowed, would put an end to the petition.\nFor two reasons the objection to our jurisdiction must prevail. First, the judgment appealed from was not a judgment upon a preliminary objection. It was only a judgment upon a motion to set aside a preliminary objection. As I have said, there has as yet been no judgment upon these objections. They may have been well or ill founded. There has been no decision on that, and it is only from such a decision that an appeal lies. I need not elaborate this point further, as much that the learned Chief Justice has just said in dealing with the Marquette case ([5]) applies equally here.\nAnd secondly, even if this were a judgment upon a preliminary objection, it is not that kind of objection that the statute covers. The judgment upon the motion before the court below did not put an end to the petition. Had the judgment been the other way, and he had decided that the objections were filed in time, that likewise would not have put an end to the petition.\nFor these reasons we think the appeal should be quashed with costs.\nWe deliberately refrain from expressing an opinion upon the merits of the judgment appealed from. As we have no jurisdiction the merits are not before us.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Hamilton & Jones.\nSolicitor for the respondent: H. A. Robson.\n[1] 10 U. C. Q.

S. C., c. 9, ss. 12 and 50\u2014Order dismissing petition\u2014Affidavit of petitioner.\nThe appeal given to the Supreme Court of Canada by The Controverted Elections Act (R. S. C., c. 9, s. 50), from a decision on preliminary objections to an \u2018election petition can only be taken in respect to objections filed under sec. 12 of the Act.\nNo appeal lies from a judgment granting a motion to dismiss a petition on the ground that the affidavit of the petitioner was untrue.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench for Manitoba, reversing the judgment of a Judge in Chambers, and granting a motion to dismiss the petition filed against the return of the respondent.\nThe petition was filed on the 29th, and served on respondent on the 31st, of July, 1896. Nothing further was done until September 80th, when the petitioner, King, was examined under section 14 of the Controverted Elections Act, and on October 3rd notice was given to petitioner of a motion to strike the petition off the files of the court on the ground that the affidavit presented with the petition was false, and not that required by the Act. It seemed that on the examination the petitioner had admitted that he had no knowledge of the truth or otherwise of the facts sworn to in his affidavit.\nThe motion was heard before Mr. Justice Killam, who held that the matter should have come up on preliminary objections filed within five days from the date of service of the petition, and he dismissed it. On appeal to the full court his judgment was reversed and the order to strike the petition off the files made. The petitioner then took an appeal to the Supreme Court.\nTupper Q.C. for the respondent, moved to quash the appeal as not coming within section 50 of the Act which is the only section conferring jurisdiction, citing The Glengarry Election Case ([1]); King\u2019s Election Case ([2]); Gloucester Election Case ([3]).\nHowell Q.C. and Chrysler Q.C. for the appellant, contra. This was really a preliminary objection, and an order could be made under section 64 of the Act extending the time for filing. See Cunningham on Elections ([4]); In re Dufferin ([5]); In re Palmer ([6]). Judgment was reserved on the motion and the hearing on the merits postponed.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an appeal from an order of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of the Province of Manitoba, made on the 28th of December, 1896, whereby the court allowed an appeal from an order of Mr. Justice Killam, and ordered that the petition presented by the present appellant in the matter of this election, controverting the return of the respondent and also proceedings therein, be stayed. The petition was filed on the 29th of July, 1896, and was served on the respondent on the 31st of July. No preliminary objections were filed under section 12 of the Controverted Elections Act, R. S. C., ch. 9, and the petition, therefore, under section 13 of the same Act was at issue on the 6th of August. On the 30th of September, 1896, pursuant to an order made by the learned Chief Justice of Manitoba, under the provisions of section 14 of the Act, the appellant was examined before a special examiner. On the 3rd of October the respondent served on the appellant a notice of motion to \u201cstrike\u201d the petition off the files of the court, on the ground that the affidavit presented with the petition pursuant to the requirements of section three of 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 20, \u201c was false and was not such an affidavit as was required by the statute, and that the presentation of the petition was an abuse of the process of the court.\u201d\nThis motion having been heard before Mr. Justice Killam, was by him dismissed with costs, and an order to that effect dated the 20th of October was drawn up which was reversed by the order of the full court, which is the subject of this appeal.\nMr. Justice Killam held that the objection to further proceedings on the petition based on the disclosures contained in the examination of the petitioner 5 was one which could only be taken by preliminary objections under section 12, filed within five days after the service of the petition, and could not be taken by motion. The three learned judges who heard the appeal in banc were of opinion that the deposition of the petitioner shewed that his affidavit accompanying the petition was untrue, and that the presentation of the petition was an abuse of the process of the court.\nOn the appeal coming on to be heard before this court, the learned counsel for, the respondent took the preliminary objection, which was also insisted on in the respondent\u2019s factum, that this court had no jurisdiction to entertain this appeal, inasmuch as it was not authorized by section 50 of R. S. C., ch. 9.\nThis section 50, which exclusively confers jurisdiction on this court in the matter of election appeals, is as follows:\nAn appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court of Canada under this Act by any party to an election petition who is dissatisfied with the decision of the court or a judge.\n(a) From the judgment, rule, order or decision of any court or judge on any preliminary objection to an election petition, the allowance of which objection has been final and conclusive, and has put an end to such petition, or which objection, if it had been allowed, would have been final or conclusive and have put an end to such petition. Provided always that unless the court or judge appealed from otherwise orders, an appeal in the last mentioned case shall not operate as a stay of proceedings, nor shall it delay the trial of the petition.\n(b) From the judgment, or decision, on any question of law or of fact of the judge who has tried such petition.\nSubsection (b) was originally introduced by the first Supreme and Exchequer Court Act, of which it formed the 48th section. In the Charlevoix Election Case ([7]), it was determined that subsection (b) conferred no jurisdiction on this court to entertain an appeal from the decision of the court to which the petition had been filed, or a judge, on a preliminary objection. Subsequently to this decision, subsection (a) was passed as an amendment or addition to the Controverted Elections Act.\nThe determination of the question now before us on the motion made by the respondent to quash this appeal, must therefore depend on the jurisdiction conferred on this court by subsection (a) of section 50.\nCan we, having regard to the language of this provision, and to that of subsections 12 and 13, and to former decisions of this court, hold that the order of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench was \u201ca judgment, rule, order or decision\u201d on a preliminary objection, within the meaning of subsection (a) ?\nWe are all of opinion that the \u201cpreliminary objection \u201d referred to in this section, means a preliminary objection under section 12. The preliminary objection there defined must within five days after the service of the petition be \u201cpresented in writing,\u201d and a copy of it must be filed for the petitioner within the same limited period of five days. In the present case none of these requisites were complied with. No preliminary objections were presented in writing within the prescribed time, nor was any copy filed for the petitioner. The petition having been filed on the 29th and served on the 31st of July, it was not until the 3rd of October, some nine weeks after the service that notice of the motion to remove the petition from the files was served. In the meantime the petition was at issue under section 13, and was ripe for trial on the merits. It was therefore manifestly then too late to present preliminary objections under section 12, and the notice of the motion made before Mr. Justice Killam cannot be regarded as such a proceeding.\nIn the Gloucester Case ([8]) our late brother Fournier I am also of opinion that an appeal will only lie from a decision on a preliminary objection which must be filed within the time prescribed by the statute, and if not filed within the specified time it cannot be treated as a preliminary objection.\nIn the same case Mr. Justice Henry said:\nI think the preliminary objections referred to are those which are to be filed by the respondent. The question is whether we have jurisdiction in an appeal when those objections have not been adjudicated. Now I take it it must be limited to such preliminary objections.\nIn the same case I find in my reported judgment the following passage:\nI think it is quite clear that under the Controverted Elections Act of 1874, and under the statute of 1879 (Supreme Court Amendment Act) we have only jurisdiction provided the preliminary objection is one of the kind which originally, and before this jurisdiction on appeal was conferred, was authorized by the statute to be filed.\nIn the Quebec County Case ([9]) Mr. Justice Gwynne said:\nThe cause and matter of the petition was at issue upon the merits at the expiration of five days from such dismissal of the preliminary objections, and no other preliminary objection in the sense in which that term is used in the statute, or so as to make any decision thereon appealable to this court, could therefore be taken.\nIn the same case Mr. Justice Henry ([10]) thus stated his view of the practice:\nPreliminary objections are provided by the statute to be tried before a judge, and they are, in my opinion, such as are taken within the prescribed five days.\nIt therefore appears from the decisions quoted from, as well as from the plain construction of the statute, that the jurisdiction of this court (which in the case of election petitions, as in all other cases, is a limited statutory jurisdiction) is confined to appeals from the decision of the judge who tries the petition, and from the, decision of the court or judge upon preliminary objections presented and filed within five days after the service of the petition, pursuant to section 12. It follows that in the present case we have no jurisdiction and cannot interfere with the decision appealed against.\nIn the Lunenburg case (1), which will be decided presently, we have come to a conclusion adverse to that of the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench of Manitoba, upon what may be called the merits of the motion to take the petition off the files, and one which also differs from that of Mr. Justice Killam, but in that case we were able to entertain the appeal, for the reason that the objection was raised in due form and within the prescribed time as a preliminary objection.\nAny anomaly resulting from the different conclusions in the two cases is the necessary result of the legislation which regulates the jurisdiction of this court.\nThe appeal must be quashed with costs.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: H.

The said petitioner had not any reasonable grounds to believe that the several allegations in the said petition were true and the said affidavit was irrelevant and scandalous and made without any sufficient information or reasonable grounds for belief within the meaning of the statute, and was and is an abuse of the practice and proceedings of this honourable court and an evasion of the said statute and a fraud on the court.\"\nCounsel for the appellant wished to examine the petitioner as to his affidavit which was refused by the judge who heard the preliminary objections, all of which were dismissed, the following judgment being pronounced on objection no. 18:\n\"The principal contention before me was that the affidavit of the petitioner presented at the time of the presentation of the petition should have had the petition annexed to it and should have referred to the petition as so annexed, or should have had it identified as an exhibit and referred to it as such. The practice books and some decisions were referred to, to show that exhibits to affidavits must be verified in either of these ways.\n\"I am of the opinion that the practice referred to does not govern the present question. According to that practice an exhibit must be proved in a certain way. In order to be proved by an affidavit an exhibit must be so marked and so referred to as to be distinctly identified. The one must be proved, made evidence, by the other, without the aid of anything extrinsic.\n\"In the present case the affidavit was not used for the purpose of making the petition evidence. It was used for the purpose of complying with the statute which provided that at the time of the presentation of the petition there should be presented therewith a certain affidavit by the petitioner. The references to the petition in the affidavit are ample, if the case is not governed by the practice referred to, to show what petition is referred to. I think it is sufficient that it has been proved that the statute was complied with.\"\nThis appeal was then brought from the judgment dismissing the preliminary objections.\nW. A. B. Ritchie Q.C. for the appellant referred to Reg. v. Hulme[1]; Reg. v. Holt[2].\nRussell Q.C. and Congdon for the respondent. The judgment of the court was delivered by:\nKING J.\u2014This is an appeal from an order of Henry J., dismissing preliminary objections to an election petition. The main point in the appeal arises from the provisions of the Act 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 20, sec. 3, providing for the presentation of an affidavit at the time of the presentation of the petition, and is raised by the 26th and 27th of the preliminary objections.\n26. The said John Drew Sperry had not at the time he swore to the said affidavit any reasonable grounds to believe, and he did not believe, that the material allegations in the said petition were true.\n27. The said petitioner had not any reasonable grounds to believe that the several allegations in said petition were true, and the said affidavit was irrelevant and scandalous and made without any sufficient information or reasonable grounds for belief within the meaning of the statute, and was and is an abuse of the practice and proceeding of this honourable court, and an evasion of the said statute, and a fraud on the court.\nThe matter came on for hearing in a summary way before Mr. Justice Henry, and the following extract from the minutes of the learned judge shows what took place respecting the matter of the above recited objections:\nMr. Borden wishes to call or cross-examine petitioner as to his affidavit for the purpose of showing that there were no reasonable grounds for the allegations therein contained. I reserve my decision as to this.\nAt a later stage of the hearing the learned judge noted his refusal to allow the petitioner to be examined, which of course is to be taken as relating to cross-examination as well.\nSubsequently judgment was delivered dealing with the remaining questions, and on the 11th December the order appealed from was made.\nSection 3 of 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 20, is in amendment of the legislation relating to the qualification of petitioners, and is as follows:\nSection 5 of the Dominion Controverted Elections Act is hereby amended by adding the following paragraph at the end thereof:\nAt the time of the presentation of the petition there shall also be presented therewith an affidavit by the petitioner that he has good reason to believe and verily does believe that the several allegations contained in the said petition are true, and thereafter, should any elector be substituted for the petitioner, then, and in every such case, such elector, before being so substituted, shall make and file an affidavit to the same effect.\nWhat was presented by the petitioner has the formal requisites and the substantial requisites of an affidavit, and no question arises as to its properly expressing the mind and intention of the deponent. What is deposed to is also in conformity with the requirements of the Act:\nI have good reason to believe, and verily do believe, that the several allegations contained in the said petition are true.\nWhat the respondent in the proceedings sought to do, according to the minutes of the learned judge, was to show by the examination or cross-examination of the petitioner that there was no reasonable grounds for the allegations; in other words, that there were no reasonable grounds for the petitioner's belief. But the Act has made the deponent the judge as to the reasonableness of the grounds of his belief, and the affidavit does not form any part of the body of proof to be passed upon by the court on the trial of the petition.\nIt is said that the existing belief to which he is required to depose must be an honest belief. Granted. But the question back of that is as to how the honest belief is to be proved, and whether the election court can inquire into it. The Act treats the petitioner as a person fit to form an opinion on the subject of his beliefs, and as a credible person who will declare his honest belief under oath subject to the responsibilities of such a proceeding, and adopts his act as a qualification inter alia for his becoming petitioner.\nFor wilful and corrupt swearing to what he knows to be untrue he is liable in a court of proper criminal jurisdiction, but his credibility is not to be impeached in the election court in respect of this statutory affidavit. It may be that many vexatious and unfounded election petitions might be brought in this view of the law. This, however, presupposes a laxity of legal and moral restraint, and in any view may be for the consideration of the legislature.\nCases where the intention of the deponent is shown not to have gone with the apparent affidavit are not now in mind, but there is no suggestion of that here. For example, a petitioner might be insane, or an illiterate petitioner might make oath to a form of affidavit supposing it to be an affidavit in another proceeding. In such case there would be no real affidavit. In the circumstances of this case the proposed examination and the cross-examination seem to have been irrelevant.\nAnother preliminary objection was that the petition was not in proper form. The objection apparently was that it was too general. But the factum of the appellant admits that it was in a form which had been used in the province of Nova Scotia prior to the passing of the statute 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 20, the 3rd section of which requires the petition to be accompanied by an affidavit of the petitioner.\nBut that Act effected no change in the form of the petition, which still depends upon R. S. C. ch. 9, sec. 9, to the effect that the petition may be in any prescribed form, but if or in so far as no form is prescribed it need not be in any particular form, etc. The admission of the factum indicates that if any form was prescribed in Nova Scotia such was substantially followed. At all events no variance from prescribed form is alleged, or shown. Inconvenience from the generality of the petition is always practically obviated by the particulars.\nThe remaining objection raised before us is that the affidavit referred to did not sufficiently identify the petition. This point has been adequately and satisfactorily dealt with by the learned judge who heard the objections and his judgment on the point is adopted.\nThe result is that the appeal is to be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Borden, Ritchie & Chisholm.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Henry T. Ross.\n[1] L. E. 5 Q. B. 377.\n[2] 7 Q. B. D. 575.\n",

Arts. 56 and 78, C.C.\nCounsel for the person served will not be allowed to cross-examine the bailiff as to the contents of the copies served without producing them or laying a foundation for secondary evidence.\nAppeal from a decision of Mr. Justice Belanger dismissing preliminary objections to the petition against the return of the appellant at the election for the House of Commons held on June 23rd, 1896.\nThe objection filed was that the petition was not properly served, and on the hearing counsel for the appellant was not allowed to cross-examine the bailiff as to the contents of the copy served without producing the document. The facts are fully set out in the judgment.\nForan Q.C. and Ferguson Q.C. for the appellant.\nChoquet for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice and Sedgewick and King JJ. concurred in the judgment of Mr. Justice Girouard.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014With great deference I must say that it appears to me to be much to be regretted that this court has by its judgment in The Montmagny Case ([1]), and in other cases, held that a question as to the regularity of the service of an election petition can be raised by a preliminary objection taken under the 12th section of the Controverted Elections Act, R.S.C. ch. 9. That Act in its fifth section, which is the section authorizing an election petition to be filed and pre scribing the persons by whom it may be filed, has in it this enactment:\nProceed always that nothing herein contained shall prevent the sitting member from objecting under section twelve of this Act to any further proceedings on the petition by reason of the ineligibility or disqualification of the petitioner or from proving under section 42 that the petitioner was not duly elected.\nThen the twelfth section here referred to enacts that within five days after the service of the petition and the accompanying notice the respondent may present in writing any preliminary objections or grounds of insufficiency which he has to urge against the petition or the petitioner or against any further proceedings thereon, and shall in such case at the same time file a copy thereof for the petitioner, and the court or judge shall hear the parties upon such objections and grounds, and shall decide the same in a summary manner.\nThen by the 50th section an appeal is given to this court from the decision of the judge upon such preliminary objections. It has always appeared to me that to make such a point of mere practice and procedure a ground of preliminary objection under the 12th section, is to impute to the legislature an intent not warranted by the language and general purview of the Act. By so doing a totally different character is given to the irregularity, if there be irregularity, in the service of an election petition from what attaches to the like objection in the case of the service of a summons in an ordinary action. In the latter case if the objection is successful the only consequence is the setting aside of the service; the action still remains, while being entertained as a preliminary objection under the statute in the case of an election petition the consequence, as decided in The Montmagny Case ([2]), is the absolute dismissal of the petition and the utter impossibility of its being ever tried upon the merits. Now, the 11th section of the Act prescribes that the election petition shall be served as nearly as possible in the manner in which a writ of summons is served in civil matters, but the second section of the Act enacts that the several provincial courts in which election petitions may be filed, shall respectively have the same powers, jurisdiction and authority with reference to an election petition, and the proceedings thereon, as if such petition were an ordinary cause within its jurisdiction. It cannot, I think, admit of doubt that this enactment invests the provincial courts with complete jurisdiction to adjudicate upon objections calling in question the sufficiency and regularity of the service of an election petition by the mode of proceeding in use in the respective courts in the case of a like objection being taken in an ordinary action pending in such court and to the same extent fully as in an ordinary suit, and as the judgment upon such a question in an ordinary action would not be appealable to this court I can see no reason whatever why such a point of practice in an election petition should be made appealable to this court as it has become by being filed by way of plea in the form of a preliminary objection to an election petition. In an ordinary action after a plea to the merits of the action no objection can be taken calling in question the regularity of the service of a summons, but in an election petition, although by the statute preliminary objections are only presentable after service of the election petition upon the respondent, still he is allowed to plead in writing, filed in court, such an objection, together with others which attack the substance of the petition and the status of the petitioner, and when the objections are brought down to a hearing he may abandon all objections of a substantial character and rest upon the one as to the regularity of the service, as was done in The Montmagny Case ([3]), and in the present. It is difficult, it appears to me, to support this difference in the treatment of a mere point of regularity or irregularity of the service of the document by which proceedings in court are instituted upon any sound principle. In the present case a point of practice which according to the procedure applicable to an ordinary action might have been decided in a week, has already by reason of the delay incident to the appeal given to this court taken seven months to decide. To me I must say it appears to be free from doubt that the legislature never contemplated such a result, and that what may be presented by way of preliminary objections under the Act are only matters of substance calling in question the sufficiency of the petition or the status of the petitioner which are matters of such a nature that being decided in favour of the respondent pleading them rightfully put an end to all further proceedings upon the petition.\nHowever consistently with cases decided in this court we must treat this objection as a good ground of preliminary objection.\nUpon the 6th of August, 1896, the respondent in the election petition, the now appellant, filed the objection now under consideration, together with others, and at the hearing of the objections rested upon the one now under consideration alone. The objection taken is in the form following:\nFourth, that the said petition was never regularly served upon him, the defendant, as required by law.\nNow a pleading in this form in any proceeding other than in an election petition and read according to the plain acceptation of the terms used, would be construed to be an admission of service of the petition, but calling in question the regularity of such service, and so construed the burthen of showing the irregularity relied on would be cast upon the party averring it. It is different, however, in an election petition in which case the petitioner is called upon to prove the service to have been regular. The law having been so decided the petitioner produced the return of the bailiff who served the petition which return appeared to be in the form in use in the courts of the province of Quebec in the case of an ordinary action; and the bailiff himself was called who testified that before service he had compared the copy he served on the now appellant with the original petition in the office of the prothonotary. It was objected that the bailiff did not say by whom the accuracy of the copy was certified, and questions put to him upon that point were objected to, the contention being that the defendant who had objected to the regularity of the service should first produce the paper served. Of this opinion was the learned judge, and as the defendant did not produce that paper he dismissed the preliminary objections. In taking this course the learned judge, in my\nopinion, acted rightly beyond all question. The evidence of the bailiff was clearly prim\u00fb facie evidence of the sufficiency of the service, and thereupon it became the duty of the defendant who objected to the service upon the ground of irregularity to show the irregularity upon which he relied, and if that consisted in the absence of a proper certificate to the copy served he could only succeed by producing the copy served. The appeal must, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014This appeal, as limited at the hearing before us, raises only a question of service of an election petition and other usual papers attached to the same under \" The Dominion Controverted Elections Act.\"\nSection 11 of that statute says:\nAn election petition under this Act and notice of the date of the presentation thereof, and a copy of the deposit receipt shall be served as nearly as possible in the manner in which a writ of summons is served in civil matters, or in such other manner as is prescribed.\nThere was no special order as to service in this case, and therefore we must follow the rules of practice in the province of Quebec for the service of a writ of summons in civil matters.\nThe election petition and other papers were served by a bailiff of the Superior Court for Lower Canada:\nEn laissant de vraies copies duement certifi\u00e9es des documents originaux ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9s, lesquels sont produits en cour, en laissant les dites pi\u00e8ces \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame, le dit Joseph G\u00e9d\u00e9on Horace Bergeron, dans la ville de Beauharnois susdite, en parlant \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame en personne dans la dite ville.\nThe appellant complains that this service was not sufficient as no duly certified copies were ever served upon him. By article 79 of the Code of Procedure the truth of a bailiff's return can only be contested by improbation, or inscription en faux, unless the court orders otherwise; but by article 159 the return of a bailiff, as regards simple service of summons or of notice, may be contested on motion, and without an inscription en faux, unless the court otherwise orders. This motion was duly presented to the court by the appellant, and I am willing to admit \" granted,\" although the word accord\u00e9 on the indorsation of it is not certified either by the judge or the prothonotary of the court, and there is nothing in the transcript of the proceedings to show that any order was passed upon the motion.\nThe appellant was allowed to proceed with the adduction of oral evidence. At the outset, when the bailiff was under examination, he was met by an objection made by the respondent, the nature of which will appear by the following extract from the minutes of the evidence:\nQ. La copie de la p\u00e9tition d'\u00e9lection avec l'affidavit y annex\u00e9, que vous dites dans votre rapport avoir laiss\u00e9e au d\u00e9fendeur le premier d'ao\u00fbt dernier, \u00e9tait-elle d\u00fbment certifi\u00e9e comme vraie copie\nObject\u00e9 comme ill\u00e9gale en autant que la question tend \u00e0 prouver le contenu d'un document et le certificat d'icelui par t\u00e9moin et que cette preuve ne peut \u00eatre faite sans la production des copies.\nObjection maintenue.\nLe d\u00e9fendeur excipe respectueusement de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour.\nThe question was repeated in several forms with the same objection and the same ruling of the trial judge.\nIn his final judgment on the preliminary objections, the learned judge (B\u00e9langer J.), held that the return of the bailiff was sufficient.\nIt is contended by the appellant that the service was insufficient, and that the court having refused the question there was no evidence of service.\nArticle 56 of the Code of procedure says: Service is affected by leaving with the defendant a copy of the writ of summons, and of the declaration if there is one. The copy must be certified either by the prothonotary or by the attorney for the plaintiff, or by the sheriff, when the service is' to be made by him.\nIt is contended by the appellant that the bailiff had no authority to certify that the copies were \"duly certified\" and that he should have shown in his return by whom they were actually certified, either by the prothonotary, or by the attorney for the petitioner. However, article 78, which specifies what the return by a bailiff must state, merely requires that he should certify that he has served u a copy.\" Therefore, the respondent argues that the words \" duly certified \" were superfluous, and that the bailiff's return was perfect. We have no difficulty in arriving at this conclusion, especially as it was admitted by the appellant's counsel, at the hearing before us that the bailiff\u2019s return in this case was in accordance with the usual practice prevailing in the province of Quebec. The well settled jurisprudence of this court has been not to interfere with matters of mere local practice.\nIt was still open to the appellant to show that the copies left with him were not ''copies.\" He did not, however, produce the documents served upon him, and without examining as to whether oral evidence was admissible without an express order of the court permitting the same without an inscription en faux, and without pronouncing upon the point as to whether such order was given or not, we have come to the conclusion of the trial judge that supposing such order was given, verbal evidence could not be permitted until the documents actually served were produced. These documents are presumed to be in the possession of the appellant, and until it is established that they are either destroyed or lost, no other evidence can be allowed, especially on behalf of the party presumably in possession of the same. Article 1204 of the Civil Code of Quebec leaves no doubt on this point.\nThe proof produced must be the best of which the case in its nature is susceptible. Secondary or inferior proof cannot be received, unless it is first shown that the best or primary proof cannot be produced.\nWe are unanimously of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed and it is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J. K. Elliott.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F. X. Choquet.\n[1] 15 Can. S. C. R. 1.\n[2] 15 Can. S. C. R. 1.\n[3] 15 Can. S. C. R. 1.\n",

I.\nControverted Election\u2014Corrupt treating\u2014Agent of candidate\u2014Limited agency\u2014Trivial or un important corrupt act 54 & 55 V.c.20, s. 19 (D)\u2014Benefit of.\nDuring an election liquor was given to an elector who at the same time was asked to vote for a particular candidate.\nHeld, that this was corrupt treating under section 86 of the Dominion Elections Act, R.

The petition against the return of the appellant contained a number of charges, on all of which he was acquitted except one, which was as follows:\n\"That William P. Callaghan, of Miminigash, farmer, an agent of the respondent, on the twenty-second day of June last, treated Patrick O'Brien, of Miminigash, in the barn on the premises of the said Patrick O'Brien, to intoxicating liquor for the purpose of corruptly influencing the vote of the said Patrick O'Brien, and in order to secure the return of the said respondent at said election. That the said respondent had a knowledge thereof, and consented and was accessory thereto, and paid, or promised to pay or repay, the said William Callaghan therefore.\"\nThe evidence in support of this charge was that appellant took Callaghan with him when he went to canvass a particular locality. They stopped at O'Brien's, and Callaghan took a bottle of whisky out of the waggon, and after going into the woods with two of the O'Briens and remaining some five minutes, he took Patrick into his barn and gave him two or three drinks out of the bottle, at the same time asking him to vote for appellant. It did not appear that the latter saw Callaghan take the bottle out of the waggon, or knew it was there.\nThe appellant contended that this was not a corrupt treating under the Election Act. He also claimed that the agency of Callaghan was not proved. It appeared that he was a member of the Conservative Association for DeBlois, a place within the electoral district, but it was not shown that the members of the association were restricted, in their work at the election, to the limits of DeBlois, and appellant admitted at the trial that he expected them to do all they could for him.\nIt was also claimed on behalf of the appellant that if the charge was proved he was entitled to the benefit of 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 20, sec. 19, amending the Controverted Elections Act, and providing that:\n\"Where, upon the trial of an election petition, the court decides that a candidate at such election was guilty, by his agent or agents, of any offence that would render his election void, and the court further finds\u2014\n\"(a) That no corrupt practice was committed at such election by the candidate personally, and that the offences mentioned were committed contrary to the order and without the sanction or connivance of such candidate; and\u2014\n\u201c(b) That such candidate took all reasonable means for preventing the commission of corrupt practices at such election; and-\n\u201c(c) That the offences mentioned were of a trivial, unimportant, and limited character; and\u2014\n\u201c(d) That in all other respects, so far as disclosed by the evidence, the election was free from any corrupt practice on the part of such candidate and of his agents; then the election of such candidate shall not, by reason of the offences mentioned, be void, nor shall the candidate be subject to any incapacity therefor.\nThe election judges decided against the appellant on all these points and gave judgment voiding the election from which judgment he brought this appeal.\nMcCarthy Q.C. and Stewart Q.C. for the appellant. In holding the act of Callaghan, under charge 8, a corrupt treating sufficient to avoid the election, the judges have strained the law beyond what has ever been done before. See The Westbury Case ([1]); The Wallingford Case ([2]); The Montcalm Case ([3]); The South Ontario Case ([4]). Callaghan was not proved to be an agent outside of DeBlois. Agency may be limited both as to person and locality. London Election Case ([5]); The Berthier Case ([6]).\nAt all events the appellant is entitled to the benefit of 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 20, sec. 19.\nPeters Q.C., attorney-general of Prince Edward Island, for the respondent. It has been found as a fact that Callaghan was guilty of corrupt treating, and this court will not disturb such finding unless satisfied that it was clearly wrong. The Berthier Case ([7]); The North Perth Case ([8]); The Wetland Case ([9])\nAs to agency, see Leigh & LeMarchant on Election Law ([10]).\nThe appellant is not entitled to the benefit of 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 20, sec. 19, unless he has brought himself strictly within its terms. The Rochester Case ([11]).\nThe judgment of the court was pronounced by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (oral).\u2014This is an appeal upon the merits from the decision of two judges of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island, the Chief Justice and Fitzgerald J., appointed under the Controverted Elections Act to try the petition filed against the return of the appellant for the House of Commons at the election in June last. The learned judges held that the corrupt act alleged in the eighth charge of the bill of particulars was established, and the appellant was unseated. The decision of the appeal depends almostentirely on matters of fact, and we have thought it unnecessary to prepare a written judgment in disposing of it. I will therefore state, orally, the grounds upon which the judgment of the court is based. Charge no. 8 in the petitioner's bill of particulars is as follows:\nThat William P. Callaghan of Miminigash, farmer, an agent of the respondent, on the twenty-second day of June last, treated Patrick O'Brien of Miminigash, in the barn on the premises of the said Patrick O'Brien, to intoxicating liquor for the purpose of corruptly influencing the vote of the said Patrick O'Brien, and in order to secure the return of the said respondent at said election. That the said respondent had a knowledge thereof and consented and was accessory thereto, and paid or promised to pay or repay the said William Callaghan therefor.\nThere was no dispute as to the fact that Callaghan, who accompanied the appellant on the 22nd of June, had treated O'Brien, an elector, and at the same time had asked him to vote for the appellant. The questions which were raised, then, for our decision were: 1. Was the treating a corrupt act? 2 Was Callaghan an agent of the appellant? 3. Was the offence for which the appellant was unseated of a trivial or unimportant character and so within the provisions of 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 20, sec. 19, amending the Controverted Elections Act?\nAs regards the first question, whether or not there was a corrupt treating, I have no doubt whatever. Callaghan took the voter secretly into a barn and gave him drink out of a bottle of whiskey which he had brought with him. This was not treating of a kind which may very well take place without offence against the Election Act, namely, where an agent, in the course of ordinary hospitality, furnishes liquor or accommodation to an elector. In my opinion, the only object Callaghan could have had was to influence O'Brien's vote and induce him to promise his support to the appellant.\nCorrupt treating having been established, it becomes material to consider the second question, namely, that as to agency. It appears that the treating did not take place in the district of DeBlois where there was a political association, of which Callaghan was a member (and where consequently, under the authority of The Haldimand Case ([12]) he would be an agent of the appellant) but in an adjoining district, and a very powerful argument, which made a great impression on myself, was addressed to the court by Mr. McCarthy, based on the contention that the agency of Callaghan was limited to the district of DeBlois, for which district only the association of which he was a member, and therefore an agent of the candidate, was constituted.\nI quite agree with the principle laid down by Chancellor Spragge in The London Case ([13]) that agency may be limited both as to persons and as to locality, and if it had been proved that the association was confined to election work in the district of DeBlois it might well have been argued that Callaghan was not an agent except within that district. But when we come to look at the evidence we find nothing to show that the work of the association was so restricted. On the contrary, it appears from the distinct admission of the appellant himself, that the members were to work for him wherever they could. He says, on cross-examination by the Attorney General, that the associations organized for him were doing all they could. I take it, therefore, that as it was not shown that there was any restriction on the members of the association to work within the limits of DeBlois, they were agents of the appellants throughout the whole electoral district.\nThere remains to be considered the only question which raises any difficulty on this appeal, namely, whether or not section 19 of the Act of 1891 applies. I will read the section:\nWhere upon the trial of an election petition, the court decides that a candidate at such election was guilty, by his agent or agents, of any offence that would render his election void, and the court further finds\u2014\n(a) That no corrupt practice was committed at such election by the candidate personally, and that the offences mentioned were committed contrary to the order and. without the sanction or connivance of such candidate; and\n(b) That such candidate took all reasonable means for preventing the commission of corrupt practices at such election; and\n(c) That the offences mentioned were of a trivial, unimportant and limited character; and\n(d) That in all other respects so far as disclosed by the evidence, the election was free from any corrupt practice on the part of such candidate and of his agents; then the election of such candidate shall not, by reason of the offences mentioned, be void, nor shall the candidate be subject to any incapacity therefor.\nThis is not an exact transcript of the corresponding clause of the Imperial Act (46 & 47 Vict. ch. 51, sec. 22), but it is to the same effect, the object of both being to relieve candidates from the consequences of corrupt acts, trivial or unimportant in character, of their agents. But, as Mr. Justice Vaughan Williams held in The Rochester Case ([14]), in order to obtain the benefit of this section a candidate must bring himself strictly within its terms. Now I admit that the offence proved in the present case was of a trivial and unimportant character, and the appellant was acquitted of all the other charges of which the particulars contained a great number. But, it appears to me, that he has failed to prove, in the first place, that Callaghan's corrupt act was contrary to his orders, and in the next place that he took all reasonable means to prevent the commission of corrupt practices at the election. He fails, I think, in this respect; although it is shown that he did announce at public meetings that he wished the election to be carried on properly, and warned his supporters against the commission of illegal acts, yet in my opinion he should have done more than he did in respect to this particular agent Callaghan whom he took with him to canvass a particular locality. He knew Callaghan was an agent, he knew that he talked with electors, and it must have been obvious to him that he was, to a certain extent, in his (Callaghan's) hands, but it does not appear that he administered any caution. The bottle of whisky was in the buggy, but it was not shown that appellant was aware of the fact. There were circumstances, however, that should have aroused his suspicion. On meeting certain persons who are proved to have been electors, Callaghan went with them into the woods and remained for some minutes, and O'Brien, the treating of whom constituted the corrupt act which unseated the appellant, was taken into his own barn. So without going further than the judges who tried the petition went I think we must say that the appellant must have known that something more than mere canvassing was going on, and should have cautioned Callaghan against the use of any unlawful means of influencing the electors. It is true he says he did not authorize him to canvass, but he knew that he was a member of the association which he expected to work for him, and that implies that he expected Callaghan to do the same. Under these circumstances, and following the English authorities, I do not consider the appellant entitled to the benefit of section 19 of the Act of 1891. The judgment appealed from is, I think, entirely free from error and must be affirmed.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: William S.

Jones (Plaintiff)\nAppellant\nAnd\nGeorge McKean (Defendant)\nRespondent\n1896: Nov. 3, 4; 1897: Mar. 24.\nPresent:\u2014Gwynne, Sedgewick, King and Girouard JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW BRUNSWICK.\nTrustee\u2014Account of trust funds\u2014Abandonment by cestui que trust\u2014evidence.\nThe holder of two insurance policies, one in the Providence Washington Ins. Co., and the other in the Delaware Mutual, on which actions were pending, assigned the same to M. as security for advances and authorized him to proceed with the said actions and collect the moneys paid by the insurance companies therein. By a subsequent assignment J. became entitled to the balance of said insurance moneys after M's claim was paid. The actions resulted in the policy of the Providence Washington being paid in full to the solicitor of M., and for a defect in the other policy the plaintiff in the action thereon was non-suited.\nIn 1886 M. wrote to J. informing him that a suit in equity had been instituted against the Delaware Mutual Ins. Co. and its agent for reformation of the policy and payment of the sum insured and requesting him to give security for costs in said suit, pursuant to a judge's order therefor. J. replied that as he had not been consulted in the matter and considered the success of the suit problematical he would not give security, and forbade M. employing the trust funds in its prosecution. M. wrote again saying \"as I understand it, as far as you are concerned you are satisfied to abide by the judgment in the suit at law, and decline any responsibility and abandon any interest in the equity proceedings,\" to which J. made no reply. The solicitor of M. provided the security and proceeded with the suit which was eventually compromised by the company paying somewhat less than half the amount of the policy.\nBefore the above letters were written J. had brought suit against M. for an account of the funds received under the assignment and in 1887 more than a year after they were written, a decree was made in said suit referring it to a referee to take an account of trust funds received, by M. or which might have been received with reasonable diligence, and of all claims and charges thereon prior to the assignment to J., and the acceptance thereof, which decree was affirmed by the full court and by the Supreme Court of Canada. On the taking of said account M. contended that all claim on the Delaware policy had been abandoned by the above correspondence, and objected to any evidence relating thereto. The referee took the evidence and charged M. with the amount received, but on exceptions by M. to his report the same was disallowed.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, that the sum paid by the Delaware Company was properly allowed by the referee; that the alleged abandonment took place before the making of the decree which it would have affected and should have been so urged; that M. not having taken steps to have it dealt with by the decree could not raise it on the taking of the account; and that, if open to him, the abandonment was not established as the proceedings against the Delaware Company were carried on after it exactly as before, and the money paid by the company must be held to have been received by the solicitor as solicitor of M. and not of the original holder.\nHeld further, that the referee, in charging M. with interest on money received from the date of receipt of each sum to a fixed date before the suit began, and allowing him the like interest on each disbursement from date of payment to same fixed date had not proceeded upon a wrong principle.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick affirming the judgment of the Judge in Equity who allowed defendant's exceptions to a referee's report on taking accounts.\nThe facts of the case are fully set out in the above head-note and the judgment of the court.\nThe appeal was, by consent, argued before four judges.\nEarle Q.C. and McLean for the appellant.\nPalmer Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nGWYNNE J.\u2014One Joseph H. Chapman by a deed duly executed under his hand and seal made upon and bearing date the 28th day of February, 1880, after reciting therein that he was indebted to the above defendant for various sums advanced by him for Chapman, at the latter's request, and that he was possessed of certain shares of the barque \"Pretty Jemima\" which was lost at sea on the 6th day of March, 1878, which said shares were at the time of such loss partly insured in the Providence Washington Insurance Company of Providence, and the Deleware Mutual Safety Insurance Company, by policies issued by them to the amount of five thousand dollars each, and that actions were then pending in the Supreme Court of the province of New Brunswick at the suit of him, the said Chapman, against the said respective companies upon the said policies, and further that it was right and proper that the said George McKean should be secured against any loss which he might sustain by reason of his having become or procured bail for the said Chapman in certain suits therein mentioned, or by reason of any advance then already made or thereafter to be made by him for the said Chapman, did in consideration of the premises assign, transfer and set over the said policies of insurance, and all his, the said Chapman's, right, title and interest therein and thereto, and to the moneys thereby secured, and in and to the said suits instituted upon the said policies in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, unto the above defendant, George McKean, his executors, administrators and assigns, to his and their sole use for ever, and he thereby authorized the said George McKean to continue the said suits in his, the said Chapman's name, to final judgment and execution, and to use his, the said Chapman's, name in any legal proceedings which the said George McKean might be obliged to take in reference to the said policies of insurance, or the moneys insured thereby or for collecting the same or any part thereof, and he, the said Chapman, thereby made, constituted and appointed the said George McKean and his representatives, his true and lawful attorney and attorneys, irrevocable in his, the said Chapman's, name, to continue the said suits and to sue for and recover the said sums of money insured by the said policies and due acquaintances and discharges in his name to give, make, sign and deliver, and the said Chapman did thereby covenant with said George McKean not to release the said suits or either of them, or the said sums of money insured by the said policies or any or either of them. On the 28th April, 1882, the said Chapman in consideration of money due and owing by him to certain persons trading under the name of Belyea and Company, delivered to them an order upon the said George McKean, in the words following:\nPlease hold to the order of Messrs. Belyea and Company to whom I have assigned it any balance that remains of insurance money per \"Pretty Jemima,\" over and above the amount I owe or may owe to you or to your firm of Carville, McKean & Co., or Francis Carville & Son, without making any further advances to me or on my account.\n(Signed) J. H. CHAPMAN.\nThis order shortly after the making of the same and the delivery thereof to the said Belyea and Company was, by or on behalf of the said company communicated and presented to the above defendant, and to one James Straton who was then acting by the authority of the said George McKean as attorney on the record for the plaintiff in the said suits upon the said policies instituted by the said Chapman, and so as aforesaid assigned by him to the said George McKean, the plaintiff's attorney on the records in said suits when the same were first instituted being then dead, and the said George McKean upon the said order being communicated and presented to him wrote his name across the same, by way of acceptance thereof. Afterwards the said firm of Belyea and Company indorsed and delivered the said order so accepted by the above defendant to the above plaintiff with the intention of transferring the same and the moneys therein mentioned to the plaintiff, and subsequently upon the 3rd. October, 1882, gave to the plaintiff the assignment or transfer addressed to him in the words following:\n29 Red Cross Street, Liverpool, 3rd October, 1882.\nHon. Thos. R. Jones.\nDear Sir,\u2014Having indorsed to you the order drawn by J. H. Chapman upon George McKean, Esq., for any balance of insurance moneys in his hands when collected in our favour, we are informed the instrument is not negotiable by indorsement, not being a bill of exchange, and therefore in order to protect your title and to enable you to obtain the amount that may be in Mr. McKean's hands we hereby assign and transfer our interest therein both legal and equitable, and appoint you our attorney in our names, for your own use and benefit to collect the same.\nWe are, dear sir, yours truly,\n(Sgd.) BELYEA & CO.\nCopies of the assignment from Chapman to Belyea & Co., and by the latter to the plaintiff, were served upon the defendant McKean and his attorney the said James Straton, but both the said defendant and his said attorney refused to recognize the plaintiff's right to, and to give him, any account of the moneys that had came to their hands from the said policies, or any statement of what amount the defendant claimed to be payable out of the funds assigned to him, prior to any amount being paid to the plaintiff, in consequence whereof the latter commenced an action against the defendant in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick alleging therein his claim upon the said funds in virtue of the said assignment by Chapman to Belyea & Co., and by the latter to the plaintiff, and praying that an account might be taken of the said trust funds and of the charges thereon prior to the plaintiff, and that such amount as might be found in the hands of the defendant after payment of such prior claims might be ordered to be paid to the plaintiff and for further relief.\nIn his answer to this suit the defendant answered among divers other things by way of defence, as follows:\nI say further that I have been notified by said Joseph H. Chapman that said order which has been so transferred to said plaintiff was not an absolute assignment, but merely given to secure a sum of money at that time due or to become due from him to said Belyea & Co. That since that time such claim of Belyea & Co., has been satisfied, and that there is now nothing due by him in respect of said order, or any debt to secure which said order was given, but that on the contrary a large sum of money is due by the said Belyea & Co. to the said Joseph H. Chapman and said Joseph H. Chapman has repeatedly told me not to pay any money to the plaintiff, and that he wishes to be made a party to this suit, in order that he may contest the plaintiff's claim, and I say further that being only a trustee for certain purposes, with the notices I have received from the said Joseph H. Chapman I cannot pay over any money on account to said plaintiff except under the order of this honourable court, and I am desirous that the said Joseph H. Chapman may be made a party to this suit in order that he and the plaintiff may between themselves settle what rights the plaintiff has under the said order, and who is entitled to any residue which may remain after the trusts under the said assignment to me have been fulfilled.\nIt thus appears that the defendant was resisting the plaintiff's claim to have an account taken, or to have any interest in the trust funds assigned to the defendant in the absence of Chapman as a party to the suit. While the defendant was thus resisting the plaintiffs claim in the interest of, and upon the allegations of, Chapman as to the nature of his assignment to Belyea & Co., it does not appear that Chapman himself has ever taken any steps to establish against the plaintiff and Belyea & Co., the contestation so set up by the defendant on his behalf.\nNow, whether this contestation of the defendant in the suit instituted against him by the plaintiff was well or ill founded we are not now concerned, for in so far at least as this suit is concerned it has been absolutely concluded in the negative by the decree which was made in this suit on the 21st., November, 1887, which was appealed to this court and affirmed by the judgment of this court in November, 1891, this court holding that the assignment from Chapman to Belyea & Co. was an absolute assignment, as was also that from Belyea & Co. to the plaintiff, and that Chapman was not a necessary party to the suit.\nNow, by the decree of the 21st November, 1887, so affirmed by this court in November, 1891, it was finally adjudged and determined that the plaintiff, Jones, is entitled to an account of the claims and charges on the trust funds received by the defendant prior to the claim of the plaintiff, and the court declared and did order and decree that such amount of the said fund as might be found in the hands of the defendant after payment of such prior claims be paid by the defendant to the plaintiff, and it was decreed further that it be referred to the referee in equity to inquire and take an account of the following matters.\nFirst. When the trust funds, if received, were received, and if not, or any part \"thereof not received, when the same were due and payable and might have been received by the defendant, had he used reasonable diligence in collecting the same.\nSecond. The amount of the said trust funds received by the defendant, or which but for his neglect or default ought to have been received by him under the trust deed of the 28th, February, 1880.\nThird. If the defendant had received any trust funds, where the same have been deposited, and what interest has been received for the same, or if used by the defendant, or with his consent, what interest should be allowed for the same.\nFourth. An account of the claims and charges on the said trust funds prior to the claim of the plaintiff arising at the date of the acceptance by the defendant, some time in May, 1882, of the order of the 28th of February, 1882, set out in the second paragraph of the plaintiff's bill, and for the better taking of the said account, and discovery, all parties are to produce before the said referee on oath all deeds, papers and writings in their or either of their custody and power relating thereto, and are to be examined on oath as the said referee shall direct, who in taking the said account is to make to all parties all just allowances.\nAnd the court reserved the consideration of all further directions and the question of costs until after the referee should have made his report.\nNow upon the rendering of the judgment of this court 'in November, 1891, affirming the decree of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick of November, 1887, that decree became a conclusive adjudication in the suit between the plaintiff and the defendant that the plaintiff was entitled to an account from the defendant of all monies received by him, or which but for his wilful default and neglect might have been received by him, from or in respect of both of the policies of insurance assigned by Chapman to the defendant, and to be paid the balance of all monies accruing from the said policies in excess of the prior amounts mentioned in the assignment of the 28th April, 1882, from Chapman to Belyea, whether upon the taking of the account the sums so received should appear to have been received, or the wilful default and neglect by which, if any, any of such should be lost should appear to have been committed, before or after the date of the decree. Both the referee and the defendant were conclusively bound by the decree and the defendant could not be permitted upon the taking of the account directed, to question the plaintiff's right to the full account directed by the decree and to be paid the sums to which he was thereby declared to be entitled. Yet upon the taking of the account the persistent effort of the defendant, or of his solicitor to whom, as the defendant admits, he had wholly confided both the conduct of the suit in which the decree was made, the rendering of the account thereby directed, and the management of the trust funds, was to establish the contention that the plaintiff so far back as in the month of August, 1886, upwards of 12 months before the decree was made in the suit, had by his conduct surrendered, released or abandoned all interest in the said Delaware policy, and that whatever had subsequently taken place in respect of that policy had been conducted by the defendant's solicitor in the interest of Chapman and for Chapman, who by the judgment of this court in 1891 was held to have no interest in the moneys secured by either of the policies. It was, in fact, with the utmost difficulty that any account could be extracted from the defendant's solicitor, and what was extracted does not appear to be complete, in relation to his and the defendant's dealings with that Delaware policy and the moneys thereby secured. As already observed such contention urged on the defendant's behalf was not open upon the decree under which the referee was acting, and no evidence in support of such contention should have been received by him, but having been received he does not appear to have acted upon it, in which we think he acted quite rightly. If the matter relied upon for the purpose of establishing that the plaintiff had surrendered, released or abandoned, as was contended, all interest in the Delaware policy and the moneys secured thereby was sufficient to establish the truth of the contention, it was matter which, if it had been established in the suit, would have affected the decree and should have been so urged. It was competent for the defendant, as the alleged abandonment took place after the defendant's answer had been filed, to have applied to the court for leave to set up this additional matter by way of defence and to give evidence upon it, and having omitted to do so, whether from neglect or design, and having rested his defence upon the matter set up in his answer and having suffered the decree to be made as it has been made and having upon the grounds alleged in his answer contested the plaintiff's right to the benefit of that decree by appeal to this court he must abide by the decree, and render to the plaintiff the full benefit of the rights to which he is thereby declared to be entitled.\nThe material which the defendant's solicitor relied upon in support of his contention before the referee was of this nature; in the spring of 1885 final judgment was upon appeal pronounced in this court in favour of the plaintiff in the action of Chapman v. The Providence Insurance Co. for the full amount secured by the policy, and in the case of Chapman v. The Delaware Mutual Insurance Co. judgment of non-suit was ordered to be entered upon the grounds that the policy on its face required that to be valid it should have been, but was not, countersigned by one Ranney, the company's agent in New Brunswick who, however, had delivered the policy to Chapman as valid. At this time Mr. Straton, the defendant's solicitor in the present suit, was conducting the suits of Chapman against The Insurance Companies as attorney for the plaintiff on the records, but upon behalf of, and in the interest of, and as the solicitor of McKean, the now defendant. In the month of August, 1886, McKean, through Straton as his solicitor, commenced a suit in equity in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, in the name of Chapman as plaintiff against the Delaware Insurance Company, and their agent Ranney, to compel the latter to countersign the policy, and for consequential relief. Chapman, the nominal plaintiff on the records, having left the province of New Brunswick the Insurance Company applied for and obtained an order for security for costs in that suit, and thereupon McKean, while the suit of the present plaintiff against him was still pending, wherein he was resisting the plaintiff's claim and denying his right to the account claimed by him or to any interest in the said policies and the moneys secured thereby upon the grounds already stated, signed his name to a letter prepared by his solicitor Straton for his signature, addressed to the plaintiff in the words following:\nSt. John, 16th August, 1886.\nTo Hon. T. K. Jones:\nSir,\u2014As assignee and attorney of J. H. Chapman, I have commenced proceedings in equity to compel Henry R. Ranney, as agent of the Delaware Mutual Safety Insurance Company to countersign the policy on the \"Pretty Jemima,\" in the suit in which at law the plaintiff was nonsuited, and for a decree that the company shall pay the amount. In this suit the defendants have appeared and applied for security for costs, and I enclose copy of order of Judge King, which has been served on me, by which proceedings are stayed. As you claim an interest in the subject matter of the suit I deem it my duty to send you the notice, and to apply to you to give the security.\nYour truly,\n(Sgd.) GEORGE MCKEAN.\nNow, it is to be borne in mind that at this time the plaintiff had not only asserted a claim to and an interest in the moneys secured by the Delaware policy, as well as in the moneys secured by the Providence Washington insurance policy, which claim and interest the defendant, acting as now appears wholly upon the advice of his solicitor, Mr. Straton, to whom he had confided the whole management of the trust funds, and of the suits instituted for the purpose of recovering the moneys secured by the policies, refused to recognize, but that he, the plaintiff, to enforce his claim so refused to be recognized by the defendant, had commenced a suit in equity against the defendant which was then still pending, and not brought to a hearing until four months later, in which suit the defendant was persisting in resisting the plaintiff's claim to an interest in the said trust funds; it is not therefore at all surprising that the plaintiff should consider the application so made to him to give security for costs in the suit in equity commenced by the defendant as a very singular proceeding, or that he should express his surprise in the terms contained in the letter following which he sent to the defendant in reply to his:\nSt. John, 25th August, 1886.\nGeorge McKean, Esq:\nI am in receipt of yours of the 16th instant, in which you state as assignee and attorney of J. H. Chapman, etc., etc. (copying the letter verbatim). In reply, I beg to state that I have not been consulted as to these proceedings being commenced, or my assent asked thereto, and as I am advised that the success of this suit is highly problematical, I do not consider that you are in a position to call upon me to give security. I further desire you to take notice that I consider your taking these proceedings are at your own risk and expense, and that under the circumstances, and the course you have adopted I shall object to any of the trust funds in your hands being; appropriated to the prosecution of the suit.\nI remain, yours truly,\nTHOS. E. JONES.\nUpon receipt of this letter by the defendant, his solicitor, Mr. Straton, prepared for the defendant to sign, which he did sign and sent to the plaintiff, a letter in the terms following:\n27th August 1886.\nThe Hon. T. R. Jones\u2014\nChapman against the delaware Co.:\nDear Sir,\u2014Yours of the 25th instant received. As I understand, it as far as you are concerned you are satisfied to abide by the judgment in the suit at law, and decline any responsibility and abandon any interest in the equity proceedings.\nYours truly,\nGEORGE MCKEAN.\nThe plaintiff took no notice of this letter, and made no reply to it. What however the defendant's solicitor Mr. Straton, to whom the defendant had confided; the whole management of the trust funds, and of the suits instituted to recover them, did was this: he himself and another person procured by him gave the security for costs required in the equity suit instituted against the Delaware Insurance Company by Straton as the solicitor of McKean in the name of Chapman as the nominal plaintiff, and thereupon he entered into negotiations with the insurance company and their solicitor for a settlement of the suit which terminated in an agreement made in December, 1886, whereby the insurance company agreed to pay $2,250 in full settlement of the suit and of the policy. In the course of the negotiations it appeared that the solicitor of the insurance company had an old claim against Chapman to the amount of $500 arising out of another vessel called the \"J. T. Smith,\" and he insisted that this sum should be paid out of the $2,250, and for this purpose required that Chapman should be sent for to consent to this payment and to be present at the settlement. Accordingly Mr. Straton sent for Chapman, and procured his attendance, when upon the 24th December, 1886, the settlement was concluded by the solicitor of the insurance company handing Straton his draft upon the insurance company for $2,250, which upon its being indorsed was handed back to the solicitor, who gave his two cheques, the one for $750 and the other for $1,000, payable to Straton or his order, which sums Straton received. It thus appears that Mr. Straton, who ever since his first appointment as solicitor of the plaintiff upon the record in the suits of Chapman against the Insurance Companies in the place of the former solicitor, Mr. Thompson, deceased, has had the sole conduct of these suits, and the exclusive administration of the funds thereby secured and assigned to the defendant upon trust, as the latter's solicitor and confidential agent, and who as such is still responsible to the defendant for the manner in which he has administered the trust so confided in him, and who as solicitor of the defendant instituted the suit in equity in the name of Chapman as plaintiff in the record against the Delaware Insurance Company, which suit was settled as aforesaid in December, 1886, received into his own hands out of the $2,250 paid by the insurance company in settlement of that suit the said sum of $1,750, just as he had received all moneys arising from the Providence Washington Insurance Company's policy; and it appeared further in evidence that he also took from Chapman a release of all claim upon such sum, and under the Delaware policy. This instrument was not received in evidence, as nothing contained in it could have any operation as against the plaintiff's right to have the account taken as directed by the decree, but the fact that such a release was taken remains, and it is significant in view of the contention set up and persistently pressed by the defendant's solicitor, who had on the defendant's behalf exclusive administration of the trust fund assigned to the defendant, namely, that the plaintiff by reason of the terms of his said letter of the 25th August, 1886, and by reason of his not answering the defendant's letter of the 27th August, 1886, must be held to have abandoned, surrendered or released all claim to the moneys secured by the Delaware insurance policy, which claim he was insisting upon in his suit in equity then pending against the defendant, which resulted in the decree in his favour in November, 1887, affirmed by this court on appeal in 1891, under which the account was being taken. Now the referee by his report made on the 31st October, 1894, has found that so far back as the month of March, Mr. Straton, the defendant's solicitor, received on account of the moneys secured by the Providence Washington Insurance Company's policy the sum of $1,765.35, and he has charged the defendant with this sum and with interest thereon, at 6 per cent, from the 1st of April, 1885 until the 1st of November, 1894. He also found that Mr. Straton upon the 9th of November, 1885, received on account of the same policy the further sum of $5,579.91, and he has charged the defendant with this sum with the like interest thereon from the 9th November, 1885, until the same 1st November, 1894. As against these sums he has allowed by way of credit the sum of $6,905.13 as paid in March, 1885, less the sum of $473.80, making the sum of $6,431.83, together with interest thereon at 6 per cent from the 1st of April, 1885, to the said 1st November, 1894, for the reason following: the $6,905.63 included certain bills of costs of Mr. Thompson, the original solicitor of the plaintiff in the suits of Chapman against The Insurance Companies, in which were included the following items constituting the $473.80, which had already been paid, and were therefore not chargeable against the trust funds, viz.:\nRetainer to Mr. Thompson paid by Chapman, in 1878\n$ 25 00\nCash also paid to Mr. Thompson by Chapman\n100 00\nWitnesses' fees\n74 40\nCosts of the day\n74 40\nThese two sums were paid to Mr. Thompson in his lifetime (as costs of the day) by the insurance companies, or one of them, upon postponement of a trial, Finally cash per Chapman\n200 00\n$ 473 80\nThis latter sum was paid by Chapman as counsel fees on the argument of the case in the Supreme Court, that is to say on the appeal of the companies in the case of Chapman against them; these sums the referee deducted from the $6,905.63, and he allowed the balance with the said interest thereon from 1st April, 1885, to 1st November, 1894, making together $10,130.13. He also found that the defendant was not entitled to charge the trust fund as against the plaintiff with the sum of $384.34 claimed as due by Chapman to Carville McKean & Co., and \u00a3396 18s. 6d. sterling claimed as having been due by Chapman to Francis Carville & Sons, which sums had not been paid by the defendant, and which it had been proved before the referee had been purchased by and were assigned to certain trustees to whom the plaintiff had made an assignment of his effects for the benefit of his creditors, upon whose behalf also, and for whose benefit, the account in this suit was being taken, and as the above sums were, if due, no longer payable to Carville McKean & Co., or to Francis Carville & Sons, but were now payable to the same parties as were interested in the amount which upon the taking of the account should be found to be coming to the plaintiff, these sums could not now be suffered to remain in the hands of the defendant or his solicitor, to the prejudice of the plaintiff whose trustees are entitled to receive them; and in fine, the referee charged the defendant with the said sums of $7,336.26 with interest thereon, as aforesaid, and with the said sum of $1,750, with interest as aforesaid, amounting in the whole to the sum of $13,925 19\nLess the said sum of\n$ 6,431 83\nWith interest as aforesaid\n3,698 30\nAmounting to\n$10,130 13\nSo charging the defendant with the balance, or $3,795.06.\nThe defendant filed exceptions to the referee's report, which have been upheld by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, as regards the items following, that is to say: 1st. For charging the said sum of $1,750 paid to Straton in 1886 as the proceeds of the Delaware Insurance Company's policy.\n2nd. As to the interest allowed.\n3rd. For the disallowance by the referee of the several items constituting the $473.80, and\n4th. For not allowing to the defendant the said sums of $384.34 and \u00a3396, 18s. 6d., so as aforesaid assigned to and now vested in the plaintiff's assignees in trust for his creditors.\nAs to the $1,750, we are of opinion that upon the evidence the referee has acted rightly and in conformity with the decree in charging the defendant with that sum, and that indeed conformably with the decree he could not have done otherwise. We are also of opinion that the solicitor of the defendant, who according to the evidence of the latter had the exclusive administration of the funds assigned to the defendant in trust in the dealing with which the defendant himself never interfered, cannot be regarded as having received that sum in any other character than as the solicitor of the defendant entrusted by the defendant with the duty of recovering and administering the trust funds assigned to him. The setting up by the solicitor of the obstructive objections to the taking of the account which were persistently pressed by him, were, we think, vexatious and inconsistent with his duty as a solicitor to whom the recovery and administration of the trust funds was confided by the defendant, and should not have been entertained. As to the interest allowed upon the sums received by the solicitor, the court has held that it has been allowed upon an incorrect principle; that the interest should have been charged upon the receipts until payments therefrom had been made, and that then the payments as made being deducted, the interest should be charged on the balance, but the same result, or one equally beneficial to the defendant, was adopted by the referee, namely, by allowing interest upon the receipts from the time of their having been respectively received unto the fixed date of the 1st November, 1894, and interest at the same rate upon the disbursements from the time of their having been respectively disbursed unto the same 1st November, 1894, and then deducting the disbursements with such interest thereon from the receipts with the interest thereon, thus charging the defendant only with interest upon the balance or excess of the receipts over the disbursements. As therefore no good purpose could be served by the suggested alteration in the mode of calculating the interest we think that this exception should not have been allowed. As to the moneys already paid to Mr. Thompson in his lifetime, we are of opinion that they could not properly have been charged against the trust funds; so charging them could only operate for the benefit of Chapman, who had no interest reserved to him in the trust funds, an account of which was directed by the decree, so neither for the same reason could the money paid by Chapman in payment of counsel fees, on the appeal to this court of the insurance companies in the suits of Chapman against them. The exception to the referee's report in respect of those items should therefore have been disallowed.\nFor the reasons already given, we are also of opinion that the referee's not charging the trust fund, as against the plaintiff, with the sums of $384.34 and \u00a3396,18s. 6d. now vested in the plaintiffs assignees in trust, for whose benefit also, as appears, the account was being taken, is free from all just objection. It never was suggested that the plaintiff's assignees in trust for the benefit of his creditors to whom the above claims were assigned, hold those claims so assigned to them in any other right or character than as the plaintiff's assignees in trust for the benefit of his creditors, nor that they are not the parties also who as such assignees are interested in the result of the account. The plaintiff has sworn that they are, and the fact was not disputed. If it had been, the fact could no doubt have been settled by calling the assignees, or one of them, but as no such suggestion was ever made it cannot now be entertained for the purpose of enabling the defendant or rather his solicitor still to retain the money. The assignees as owners of the claims assigned to them are no doubt capable of looking after and protecting their own interests, and it is not suggested that they have made any claim on these moneys adverse to the plaintiff, or that they have ever made any objection to the manner in which they have been dealt with by the referee in his report. In fine we are of opinion that all of the defendant's said exceptions to the referee's report should have been disallowed with costs, and that in so far as those exceptions are concerned the referee's report should have been confirmed.\nThere remains still one point to be considered.\nIt was argued before us, first that the referee should have charged the defendant with the whole amount of the Delaware Insurance Company's policy upon the contention that there was no evidence of the reasonableness of the compromise, or second that at least he should have charged the defendant with the $500 paid to the solicitor of the insurance company out of the $2,250 paid by the company in settlement of the suit in equity. As to the $2,750 difference between the $2,250 paid by the company and the $5,000 amount of the policy, it can not be said that this sum was lost by the wilful default or neglect of the defendant, nor indeed can it judicially be now said that the compromise was at all improvident. It appears that the non-countersigning of the policy which occasioned the non-suit in the suit at law was not the only defence offered by the company to that suit; they offered a defence upon the merits which was also open to them in the suit in equity, and if they should have succeeded therein nothing could have been recovered in respect of the policy, and we are not in a position to say that they could not have succeeded in such defence. Moreover the defendants being a foreign insurance company no longer, as appears, doing business in the Province of New Brunswick it is impossible to say what difficulty by dilatory obstruction might have been occasioned to the recovery even if the suit had been decided in the plaintiff's favour in the courts of this country, so that it certainly cannot be said that the compromise was improvident or lost by wilful default and neglect of the now defendant. As to the $500 part of the $2,250 paid by the company it must be admitted that the evidence failed to establish what was the consideration for that payment or why it should have been deducted out of the moneys paid by the company in settlement of the suit. It was suggested certainly that unless it should have been agreed to be paid out of that amount the $1,750 which Mr. Straton received would not have been received by him, but there was no evidence that the company imposed any such condition. The plaintiff could have himself removed all difficulty upon this point by calling the solicitor of the company who received the $500 to explain the consideration of its being paid to him. But the main objection to the contention of the plaintiff in respect of this item being entertained on this appeal is that it appears that the referee's report was made on the 31st October, 1894, that the defendant filed his exceptions on the 3rd December, 1894. The plaintiff filed no exceptions but on the contrary made a motion for confirmation of the referee's report which came on for hearing in the month of March, 1895, together with the defendant's exceptions to the report, and also, as appears, together with the hearing of the cause on the further directions reserved by the decree of 1887. During the argument on this motion the plaintiff asked leave to withdraw his motion to confirm the report and to file exceptions to it. Leave was granted to him to withdraw his motion to confirm the report but the application for leave to except to it was refused, and an order was made to that effect, from which order the plaintiff did not appeal, and we have not before us the material upon which the application so refused was made. The appeal before us is against a decree of the judge in equity made on the 6th May, 1895, which, after reciting the plaintiff's motion to confirm the report, and the defendant's exceptions thereto, and that the plaintiff's counsel had asked and was granted leave to withdraw his motion to confirm the report (saying nothing as to his application to file exceptions) adjudged and decreed that certain of the defendant's exceptions should be allowed, namely those relating to the Delaware policy being those above mentioned, and that others be disallowed, and further in pursuance of the 166th section of the Act passed by the legislature of the Province of New Brunswick, in the 53rd year of Her Majesty's reign entituled \"An Act respecting the practice and proceedings of the Supreme Court in equity,\" that the referee's report be amended as therein stated, whereby it was adjudged as follows, namely:\nThat the charges on the fund prior to the plaintiff's amount to the sum of 19,677.34, and that the total amount that the defendant received or should have received amounts to the sum of $7,336.25, and that the defendant is not indebted to the plaintiff in any amount whatever, and that the report as amended be absolutely ratified and confirmed by the order, authority and decree of this court to be observed and performed by all parties according to the tenor, effect and true meaning thereof.\nAnd it is further added that there be no costs to either party on the reference to take accounts before the referee, that the defendant's costs of the objections and exceptions to the referee's report be taxed by the clerk and paid by the plaintiff to the defendant or his solicitor. Provided, however, that the said defendant shall not proceed to demand or collect the said costs so awarded to him or any part thereof until the further order of this court or a judge thereof.\nThis is the judgment and decree which having been confirmed by the Supreme Court of New Brunswick is now before us, and for the reasons already given we are of opinion that the plaintiff's appeal must be allowed with costs in this court and in the appeal to the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, and that the judgment and decree of the judge in equity in New Brunswick in this cause in May,'1895, be reversed, and in substitution therefor that it be adjudged and decreed that the defendant's exceptions to the referee's report be disallowed and the master's report confirmed with costs to the plaintiff, and (assuming as we do the cause as is alleged by the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick on appeal to have been before the judge in equity as upon further directions also) that the defendant be adjudged and decreed to pay to the plaintiff all costs of suit the consideration of which was reserved for further directions by the original decree made in this suit in 1887, and also all costs attending the taking of the account under the decree before the referee. There was a cross-appeal but it was for costs only. It is however disposed of by the above disposition of the case. There can not be a doubt we think that, in view of the persistent denial by the defendant of the plaintiff's right to any account and to any interest in the fund assigned to the defendant in trust, and of the unwarranted obstructions offered to the account being taken as directed by the decree, the plaintiff is entitled to have all these costs adjudged to him.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: H. H. McLean.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C. A. Palmer.\n",

III., c. 38, (Imp.)\u2014R. S. C. c. 94 & c. 95.\nWhere fish had been enclosed in a seine more than three marine miles from the coast of Nova Scotia, and the seine pursed up and secured to a foreign vessel, and the vessel was afterwards seized with the seine still so attached within the three mile limit, her crew being then engaged in the act of baling the fish out of the seine.\nHeld, (the Chief Justice and Gwynne J. dissenting) affirming the decision of the court below, that the vessel when so seized was \"fishing\" in violation of the convention of 1818 between Great Britain and the United States of America and of the Imperial Act 59 Geo. III., ch. 38, and the Revised Statutes of Canada, ch. 94, and consequently liable with the cargo, tackle, rigging, apparel, furniture and stores to be condemned and forfeited. Appeal from the decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Admiralty District of Nova Scotia[1], which decreed that the ship, her cargo, &c., should be forfeited with costs.\nThe action was brought against the American fishing schooner \"Frederick Gerring Jr.,\" her cargo, tackle, rigging, apparel, furniture and stores for the condemnation and forfeiture of the same, the ship having been arrested for the violation of the treaty or convention of 1818 between Great Britain and the United States of America, and of the statutes 59 Greo. III. (Imp.) ch. 38, intituled \"An Act to enable His Majesty to make regulations with respect to the taking and curing of fish on certain parts of the coast of Newfoundland, Labrador, and His Majesty's other possessions in North America, according to a convention made between His Majesty and the United States of America;\" and R. S. C. ch. 94, intituled \"An Act respecting Fishing by Foreign Vessels, and the Acts in amendment thereof\"; upon the hearing before the local judge of the Admiralty District of Nova Scotia a decree was made declaring the forfeiture with costs, and from this decree the owners have taken the present appeal.\nThe substance of the treaty and of the above mentioned Acts are set out in the report of the decision of the Exchequer Court.\nThe vessel was seen fishing off Gull Ledge and Liscomb Light on the coast of Nova Scotia on the 25th May, 1896, about half a mile outside of the prohibited line by the captain of the Canadian Fisheries cruiser \"Vigilant,\" her seine had been thrown and was then pursed up and she was going up to her boat which was attached to the seine in which a quantity of fish was enclosed. The \"Vigilant\" passed on without disturbing her operations as her captain had decided from the bearing he then took that the \"Gerring\" was beyond the three mile limit. A couple of hours afterwards the \"Gerring\" was seized by the Canadian steam cruiser \"Aberdeen\" at a point within three marine miles of the Nova Scotia coast for the offence of fishing within the proscribed limits. At the time of the seizure the crew of the \"Gerring\" were engaged in baling fish out of the seine and claimed that these fish had been caught when the seine was cast outside of the prohibited line, and that if they were at the time of seizure within the three mile limit, (which they denied), they had drifted across the line after the fish had been taken in the seine, and further, that even if they were within the three mile zone, it was no offence against the treaty or the statutes to continue to bale the fish from the seine into the vessel after she had thus drifted across the prohibited boundary, for the \"fishing \"and \"catching of the fish\" had been completed when the seine was successfully thrown, outside.\nThe trial judge found that the bearing taken showed that the vessel was within the prohibited line when seized, and that the operation of \"fishing\" or \"taking fish\" was then still being carried on, the process being incomplete until the fish had been baled into the vessel and saved from the sea, thus being reduced into useful possession.\nMacCoy Q.C. for the appellant.\nNewcombe Q.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014For the reasons given by Mr. Justice Gwynne I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed. G WYNNE J.\u2014This appeal must, in my opinion, be allowed with costs. The evidence is conclusive, and indeed it is not disputed, that the ship \"Frederick gerring, jr.,\" on the day upon which she was seized, had laid her seine for the purpose of catching fish in the sea well outside of the line constituting the limit of three marine miles from the coast of Nova Scotia, and that while outside of such limit she had caught a quantity of fish in the seine, and had secured them there by hauling up the seine and tying the ends so as to enclose the fish, pursing the net as it is called, and attaching it with the fish so secured in it to the vessel. All this was done outside of the three mile limit, and while inside of it the persons in charge of the vessel proceeded to bale the fish out of the seine into the hold of the vessel. While engaged in this operation she was seized. There was a question raised as to whether the place where she was seized was in point of fact inside of the three mile limit, but assuming it to have been, there was no doubt that the vessel had drifted to that position while the persons in charge of her were engaged in baling the fish out of the seine into the hold, and unless the being engaged in that operation constitutes \"fishing or taking fish within the three marine miles of the coast of Nova Scotia\" there is not a particle of evidence that the vessel had been, or was then, \"fishing for fish\" in Canadian waters within the three marine miles of the coast, or that she was then preparing to fish in such waters. To construe the act of baling fish out of a seine in which they had been caught and secured outside of the three mile limit, into the hold of a vessel, which after the fish had been so caught, and while the parties employed on her were so securing the fish by transferring from the seine to the hold of the vessel, had drifted by force of currents inside of the three mile limit, as a violation of the treaty rights of the citizens of the United States, or of the Acts of Parliament passed in relation thereto, would be altogether too hypercritical a construction to put upon the treaty securing such rights and the said Acts of Parliament, and can not, in my opinion, have the sanction of this court, and is not warranted by any of the cases referred to on the argument.\nThe case of Young v. Hichens[2] has no bearing upon the present case. The plaintiff there complained in trespass for that the defendant had seized and disturbed a fishing seine and net of the plaintiff thrown into the sea for fish, wherein, as alleged in the declaration, the plaintiff had taken and enclosed, and then held enclosed in his own possession, a large number of fish, and the defendant threw another fishing seine and net within and upon plaintiff's seine, and prevented plaintiff from taking the fish so taken and enclosed out of his seine, as he otherwise could have done. It appeared in evidence that the plaintiff had only thrown his net partially round the fish in question, leaving a space of about seven fathoms open which the plaintiff was about to close up when the disturbance complained of took place. Until this open space should be closed the fish round which the net was only partially drawn were at large in the sea, and so could not be held to have been taken and enclosed and then held enclosed in the plaintiffs possession, as averred in the declaration. As to the fish, therefore, it was held that the plaintiff had them not in his possession, and could not therefore maintain trespass as regarded them, but for the trespass to the seine he recovered twenty shillings.\nNow in that case it was not held that if the fish had been secured in the seine the action of trespass would not have lain; much less can that case be an authority for holding that the fish taken in the seine set by the \"Gerring,\" which with the fish secured in it was hauled up and pursed, as it is called, and attached to the vessel, were not so in possession of the owners of the \"Gerring\" as to give them an action of trespass against any one who should bring a vessel alongside of the seine and either put the fish therein into such vessel, or cut the seine and let the fish fall into the sea. But the question with which we have to deal is whether or not the officers of the Dominion Government had any right to seize the \"Gerring,\" with or without the fish so secured in the net so hauled up and pursed and attached to the vessel as aforesaid. And this they had no right to do unless the fact of a vessel which had been engaged in fishing in the open sea, and in the seine laid by which in the open sea fish had been caught, which fish while the vessel was still in the open sea were secured by the net being hauled up, the ends tied so as to secure the fish, and so pursed as it is called, had been attached to the vessel, which afterwards by force of the winds or currents was driven or drifted into Canadian waters within the three mile limits, can by the terms of the laws of the Dominion of Canada be held to have subjected the vessel to seizure as a vessel then engaged in fishing for fish in Canadian waters, and in my opinion the laws of the Dominion are open to no such construction.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014There can be no question as to whether the vessel, at the moment she was seized by the S.S. \"Aberdeen,\" was within three marine miles of the coast of Nova Scotia. The learned Local Judge in Admiralty for the Nova Scotia Admiralty District, before whom the case was tried, and who had before him a number of witnesses as well for the Crown as for the defence, came to that conclusion, and we must not disturb his finding unless it is manifest that he is wrong. In my view it is manifest that he is right. The direct evidence, the evidence of every witness who made any examination, and who was in a position to testify as to the result of his own actual observation, was in favour of the Crown. The three officers of the seized steamer testified that the \"Gerring,\" when seized, was within the three mile limit. None of the witnesses who formed part of the crew of the seized vessel ventured to assert, except as a matter of opinion unsupported by actual observation, anything to the contrary. Expert evidence, however, was called on behalf of the defence for the purpose of showing that if at three o'clock in the afternoon the seized vessel was outside the three mile limit, it would be impossible for her to be within that limit at the time of the seizure. This evidence was based upon a number of hypotheses which may or may not have been accurate, but its legal effect or tendency was, in my view, to prove, not that the \"Gerring\" was outside the three mile limit at the time of the seizure, but that she was continuously within it from the time the seine was set down to the time that the seizure was made, and that Captain Mackenzie was mistaken in his opinion as to the exact position, both of his ship and the \"Gerring\" in the early part of the day. We must, however, take for granted that at the time when the seine was set out the \"Gerring\" was outside the three mile limit, and for the purpose of this opinion I will assume that to have been the fact.\nThe main question, therefore, is: Assuming the seine to have been set out and the mackerel encompassed by it outside the territorial limit, and that the vessel with the seine subsequently drifted, or came, no matter how, to a point within the three mile limit, and that at such point her crew were found baling the fish from the seine into the vessel, was the \"Gerring,\" or those controlling her, doing an act which would justify her seizure and condemnation?\nBy the convention of 1818 the United States renounced forever\nany liberty heretofore enjoyed or claimed by the inhabitants thereof, to take, dry or cure fish on or within three marine miles of any of the coasts, bays, creeks, or harbours of His said (Britannic) Majesty's Dominions in America.\nBy the Imperial statute[3] it was enacted that if any foreign vessel should be found fishing, or to have been fishing, or preparing to fish, within three marine miles of such coasts, bays, creeks or harbours, she should be forfeited, etc. And by our own Act[4] it is enacted that if a foreign ship (unlicensed) has been found fishing, or preparing to fish, or to have been fishing in British waters within three marine miles, etc., she shall be forfeited. The question, therefore, is not strictly whether under the treaty the \"Gerring,\" at the time of the seizure, was \"taking\" fish, but whether under the Imperial as well as the Canadian statute, she was \"fishing.\" In my view there is not, and it never was intended that there should be, any difference between the two, but strictly speaking it is the statute which governs; and the vital question, therefore, is: Was she \"fishing\" at the time of the seizure, or was she not?\nIt is, I think, desirable that we should have a clear understanding as to what the crew of the vessel were actually doing at the time of the seizure. It is, I suppose, a matter of common knowledge what constitutes purse seine fishing, but a brief description of it, as I understand it, may not be out of place. As to the kind of seine used in this case the evidence is not clear, but it would probably be from 150 to 175 fathoms in length and from 10 to 12 fathoms in depth. It is rectangular in shape. When a school of mackerel has been described the captain, accompanied by most of the crew, proceeds as quickly as possible in the seine-boat to encircle the school with the seine, while the cook is left to look after the vessel. The seine is paid out by two of the men in the seine-boat. As soon as the first end of it has been thrown overboard two of the crew, who did not get into the seine-boat, row up to the spot in a dory, and seize the buoy attached to the cork-line at the end, which they hold until the seine-boat has made a circle. The seine is kept in proper position by means of sinkers attached to the bottom and of floats attached to the top. When the two ends of the seine are come together it is more or less cylindrical in shape, the fish being surrounded by the cylinder. At the bottom, and running all round it, is a rope, called the purse line, both ends of which are secured by the men in the seine-boat. After both ends of the seine have been brought together, one end of this line is taken by one portion of the crew in the boat and the other end by the remainder. By pulling this rope in opposite directions, the net, which until now is cylindrical in shape, is closed at the bottom, such closing constituting what is known as the \"pursing\" of the seine, the result being to make it assume the form of a bag or purse, while the school of mackerel, or such portion of it as has been entrapped, are enclosed within it. The fishing vessel is then brought alongside the seine, and the latter still floating in the water, with the fish therein enclosed, is attached to the vessel fore and aft. The area of the enclosure is circumscribed as may be necessary by gathering in the ends of the seine, and thus confining the fish to a more limited space in order to render easier the operation of baling them out. In nautical language this process of circumscribing the area of the enclosure is known as \"drying up\" the seine. The fish are then baled out of the seine on board the vessel. The operation of setting the seine and of pursing it up is over in about ten or twelve minutes. Hours, in the present case at least two, are occupied in the operation of taking the fish from the seine, the time being dependent upon various causes, but mainly, I suppose, upon the quantity of fish in the seine. At no time during any of these operations is the vessel or seine at anchor; the vessel lays to, and the whole drifts at will with the tide or current.\nAs I understand the argument of the appellant, it is contended that, the fish having been surrounded by the seine, and enclosed therein outside the three mile limit, the act of \"fishing\" was then complete, and that anything done by the crew of the vessel after the pursing up process could not be called \"taking fish,\" or \"fishing\" within the meaning of the convention or of the statutes referred to. I do not think it necessary to refer at length to the canons of construction which govern in a case like the present. Penal statutes, of course, must be construed strictly. When one is accused of having violated a statute it is clear that he must unmistakably be brought within its provisions; there must be no doubt about it. But we must not do violence to ordinary language; we must not take from plain words their ordinary and universal meaning for this purpose. The question is whether this vessel was \"fishing,\" when, for two hours or more, her crew were baling, or scooping out, by means of a dip-net, from the area of water surrounded by the seine, the one hundred and thirty barrels (more or less) of mackerel which they finally secured.. The act of fishing is a pursuit consisting, not of a single but of many acts according to the nature of the fishing. It is not the isolated act alone either of surrounding the fish by the net, or by taking them out of the water and obtaining manual custody of them. It is a continuous process beginning from the time when the preliminary preparations are being made for the taking of the fish and extending down to the moment when they are finally reduced to actual and certain possession. That, at least, is the idea of what \"fishing,\" according to the ordinary acceptation of the word, means, and that, I think, is the meaning which we must give to the word in the statutes and treaty. There is here, as I conceive, no need for interpretation, and the fundamental canon is: \"Do not interpret where there is no need of interpretation.\" If when the S.S. \"Aberdeen,\" moving eastward saw the \"Gerring,\" a mile and three-quarters from shore, engaged as I have described, some of her crew baling fish from the water, others assisting to confine the fish into smaller and smaller compass, so as to be more easily secured: others driving the fish within the ambit of the dip-net by splashing with their oars in the water; others sorting and dressing and otherwise treating the fish, [the question were asked: \"What is the vessel doing?\" Would not the inevitable answer be: \"She is fishing?\" and if any one on board could be found bold enough to affirm that she was not \"fishing,\" that that operation was completed hours before, when the seine was pursed up and the mackerel therein enclosed, would he not be set down as either ignorant of language or as bereft of reason?\nEven if the question depended upon the \"taking\" of the fish, I do not understand that fish are \"taken\" when they are enclosed in a seine, or encompassed about by it. They are still alive in their native element, possibly with few but still with some chances of escape. As I understand, they are never all taken; numbers escape. There is the contingency of the seine breaking, or the fish falling from the dip-net between the seine and the vessel, or of a storm arising and the vessel breaking away from the seine altogether. And there are, doubtless, many other chances of escape. The \"fishing\" is not over\u2014although there may be a moral certainty that the fish will eventually be secured\u2014until as a fact they are secured. If the other view is the sound one, then the hardy fishermen along our multitudinous coast waters and tidal rivers are \"fishing\" when at even-tide they set their nets, but they are not \"fishing\" when in the morning, with nets full to overflowing, the fish not only enmeshed but dead, they bring them on board and stow away their fare. I am \"fishing\" while I am whipping the water with my line, \"fishing\" also when the salmon rises and takes the fly, but, having hooked him, I am not \"fishing\" when for minutes, or perhaps hours, I play him in the water, weaken him before the final tragedy, and at last land him dead upon the sward. The Negro boys referred to by Fronde in his \"English in the West Indies \"(p. 137), were \"fishing\" when they were placing the net in the water and surrounding the fish with their improvised contrivance, but when the cord was drawn and the net closed, they were not \"fishing\" while they were hoisting them into the boat and carrying them ashore. And when more than eighteen and a half centuries ago seven men stood out in their little craft from the shores, on the waters of the Gallilean Sea, they went a fishing. They were \"fishing,\" though all night they caught nothing; \"fishing\" too, when in the morning at the behest of their Master they cast their net at the right side of the ship; but they were not \"fishing\" when with help from friends they dragged their net all unbroken ashore, filled with a \"multitude of fishes.\"\nNeither in my view, as I have already suggested, can it be said that these fish were \"taken,\" if anything depended upon that, until they were actually on board the ship. True, they were encompassed by the net; true, there was, I admit, almost a certainty that they would ultimately be secured, but they were not yet \"taken.\" A city may be besieged, even beleagured, by an invincible host, there may be a strong probability, nay, even an absolute certainty that the siege will be successful, but the city is not yet \"taken.\" Storm and stratagem may yet be necessary before the final overthrow, and not until that catastrophe is the \"taking\" consummated. It was only after Troy had been besieged for ten weary years that the Greeks succeeded, and then by wile, in taking her. It was only then that \"Ilium fuit\" became an historic fact.\nThe treaty itself affords, I think, strong evidence against the position contended for. The United States thereby renounced the liberty to \"take, dry or cure\" within Canadian waters. The framers of the treaty at least seemed to have thought that taking and drying, or taking and curing, were consecutive acts embracing all the natural operations of the fishing avocation. Were there a number of acts after the taking, and before the curing or the drying\u2014intercalary or intermediate processes, acts that were not \"fishing\" but that had a relation to fishing, such as the acts of baling, etc., to which I have referred\u2014that might legally be done in domestic waters? They evidently intended (whether or not that intention has been sufficiently expressed) to prohibit in British waters the doing of anything in connection with fish that would make it an article of commerce, while the word \"taking\" was intended to include all operations between the throwing of the line or the casting of the net, and the processes directly necessary to prepare or preserve the fish for human food.\nThe question as to whether this vessel was \"fishing\" at the time of the seizure must, I submit, be determined altogether irrespective of the position of the vessel at the time of the seizure; for, wherever she was, she was \"fishing\" or she was not \"fishing\" within the meaning of the statute. The quality of the act cannot be determined by any consideration of position or location. She was \"fishing\" or not \"fishing.\" in that spot, whether it was three or three hundred miles from land, its relative position quoad the shore being immaterial.\nNor is the question to be determined upon any consideration as to legal property or legal possession. It is not necessary to determine at what particular point of time, or at the conclusion of what particular operation, did the fish become the property of the catchers. I may have an exclusive right of fishery, a property right to the fish of a particular stream, but whether I am or am not \"fishing\" does not and cannot depend upon any question as to my ownership. The statute has no regard to ownership or possession; it is the act of fishing without reference to the ownership of the thing fished for that it prohibits.\nNor does the fact that the master and crew of the \"Gerring\" may have been ignorant of their whereabouts, may have had no desire or intention of trespassing upon Canadian territory or of violating Canadian law, affect the legal question. We are not dealing here with the master or crew. Neither the treaty nor the statute purports to punish them for violating the treaty's provisions. In the eye of the statute the vessel itself is the offender. The statute gives to it a moral consciousness a personality\u2014a capacity to act within or without the law, and imposes upon it the liability of forfeiture in the event of transgression. In the enforcement of fiscal law, of statutes passed for the protection of the revenue or of public property, such provisions are as necessary as they are universal, and neither ignorance of law, nor, as a general rule, ignorance of fact, will prevent a forfeiture when the proceeding is against the thing offending, whether it be the smuggled goods or the purloined fish, or the vehicle or vessel, the instrument or abettor of the offence. If I bring dutiable goods into Canada without paying duty, I am liable to penalty although ignorant of the tariff. The goods themselves, endowed by law as they are with faculty and right of speech, cannot plead my ignorance either of law or fact as a bar to forfeiture.\nAccording to my understanding of my own language, according to my idea as to what is the universal meaning of the term \"fishing,\" no one, it seems to me, would describe the acts being done by the \"Gerring\" at the time of seizure by any other term than that of \"fishing;\" nor do I feel called upon out of deference to any supposed canon of strict construction\u2014a rule as often honoured in the breach as the observance\u2014to emasculate language, to filch from that word\u2014a word which, with recognized variations, appears to be common to all the Aryan races\u2014all but a fraction of its meaning, confining it to a petty segment of that wide circumference of idea that has belonged to it for centuries.\nAn additional consideration is not without weight. In order to the success of the appellant, a modified, secondary or circumscribed meaning must be given to that word \"fishing.\" To excuse, much more to justify, a deviation from its primary meaning, there must be overwhelming and absolutely conclusive considerations. But no considerations at all\u2014not even unwarrantable ones\u2014are forthcoming. Why do violence to the mother tongue and shock the intelligence of the ordinary English student, why give aid and comfort to those profane babblers who reiterate the fiction that judicial tribunals are accustomed deliberately to defeat the legislative intent by constructive canons of their own devising, in order to give immunity to a vessel engaged in a business that, according to present light and present scientific knowledge, may be characterized as nefarious, a business, the tendency of which is to annihilate for all time the fish-food supply of this continent, a business, too, which, so far as Canadian waters are concerned has been prohibited and criminalized[5]. We Canadians are in a sense the world's trustees. The North American fisheries have been committed to our guardianship, not for ourselves alone, but for posterity, not for Canada alone, but for humanity. They are the most prolific in the world. One can only imagine, he cannot measure, their potentiality of blessing to mankind, and the Canadian Parliament has recognized its obligation to conserve them for the benefit of future generations. That is the declared policy of the Canadian people, and that too is the desire and the proposed policy (so far as I am informed) of the United States Government. Purse seining is inimical to that policy. It means, not a reasonable use of, or participation in, the deep sea fisheries or their natural annual increment, not their preservation, but their annihilation, their absolute destruction for all time; in familiar words, \"the killing of the goose that lays the golden egg.\" The history of the United States fisheries on the Atlantic seaboard proves this, and it was the conviction of it that induced our Parliament, as a partial remedy, to pass the Act of 1891, above referred to. To allow this vessel to escape would be to that extent to defeat the beneficent preservative policy of the Canadian Parliament as evidenced by the statute, as well as to point out a way by which in many cases its penal consequences might be avoided. Nothing but overmastering considerations would justify that.\nThere is another ground upon which the judgment appealed from may be supported. Neither the Imperial statute, nor the Canadian statutes up to 1886 appear to cover by way of penalty all the acts prohibited by the convention of 1818. Although they penalize other acts with a view to its enforcement they appear to have dealt only with \"fishing\" or \"preparing to fish.\" The treaty forbade the drying or curing of fish, and contained a proviso that an American fishing vessel might enter bays and harbours for the purpose of shelter and repairing damages, of purchasing wood and of obtaining water, but for no other purpose whatever. The question had arisen as to whether the purchase of bait was a \"preparing to fish\" within the meaning of the statutes. It had been decided in the affirmative in Nova Scotia in the case of the \"J. H. Nickerson,\" and in the negative in New Brunswick in the case of the \"White Fawn,\" the first decision having been subsequently followed in the Nova Scotia case of the \"David J. Adams.\" In order to set at rest this question the statute law in force in that year was changed by the Act 49 Vict. ch. 114, (1886,) which expressly provided in addition that if a foreign vessel (unlicensed) has entered within three marine miles of any of the coasts, bays, creeks or harbours of Canada for any purpose not provided by treaty or convention, or of any law of the United Kingdom, or of Canada for the time being in force, such vessel should be forfeited. It is worth noting that this statute is in a special sense an enactment of Her Majesty, carrying with it all the dignity and prestige of Imperial law. It was an Act, not assented to by the Governor General, but reserved for the signification of Her Majesty's pleasure, and it was subsequently, by Imperial order in council, solemnly and after due consideration approved by Her Majesty.\nIf, therefore, the \"Gerring,\" at the time of the seizure, was \"unlawfully\" where she was, she became liable to forfeiture. The Canadian Act, it will be noted, does not in this relation apply to bays and harbours only, but to coasts as well. The convention specifies the circumstances and all the circumstances under which a foreign fishing vessel may enter into our territorial waters, viz., for wood, water, shelter or repairs, and for no other purpose whatever. For what purpose was the \"Gerring\" where she was when seized? Certainly for none of these purposes, but for the sole purpose of securing the fish inclosed by her seine. She was there, therefore, clearly in contravention of the terms of the convention. Is there any law either in the United Kingdom or in Canada which authorized her presence there? There is certainly no Canadian statute law on the subject, and there is now no commercial treaty, other than the convention of 1818, between Great Britain and the United States which gives to American vessels the right to enter Canadian territorial waters for any purpose whatever. According to international usage the only purpose for which the ships of one nation may enter the territorial waters of another nation, at all events during war, is for refuge or asylum. If there is any right beyond this it must be a right secured either by statute or treaty. Up to 1830 the United States had no commercial, as distinguished from fishing, privileges for any of its vessels in the ports of the British North American possessions. In a letter from Mr. Daniel Manning, the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, to the Hon. Perry Belmont, dated February 5th, he says:\nI am advised and concede that up to President Jackson's proclamation of October 5th, 1830, set forth on page 817 of the 4th volume of the United States Statutes at large, this Government had not even commercial privileges for its vessels in Canadian ports. We had such privileges as colonists, we lost them as colonists, we regained them in 1830 by an arrangement of legislation finally concerted with Great Britain, which was the result of an international understanding that was in effect a treaty, although not technically a treaty negotiated by the President, ratified by the Senate, signed by the parties, and the ratification formally exchanged by them[6].\nHe says in the same letter:\nThe treaty of 1818 secured to our fishermen what, up to that time, they did not have as a treaty right, which was, admission to Canadian bays or harbours for the purpose of shelter, and of repairing damages therein, of purchasing wood and of obtaining water, \"and for no other purpose whatever.\" As colonists we had those rights, but as colonists we lost them by just rebellion[7].\nBy reference to the provisions of the treaties of 1794 and 1815, it will appear that while the subject of commercial intercourse between the United States and the British possessions in Europe is expressly dealt with, the British possessions in America are not provided for. The treaty of 1794, as to commercial privileges, provided that it should\nnot extend to the admission of vessels of the United States into the seaports, harbours, bays or creeks of His Majesty's said territories in America.\nWhen the convention of 1818 was framed an attempt was made to place the commercial intercourse between the two countries upon a permanent basis, but that attempt proved abortive. It was not until 1830 that the negotiations carried on by President Jackson, through Mr. McLane on the part of the United States, and Lord Aberdeen on the part of Great Britain, resulted in an arrangement which, up to the present, governs the commercial intercourse between the United States and His Majesty's British North American possessions. This is embodied in a proclamation of the President, and in an order in council of the British Government.\nThe proclamation, after recital, directs that:\nBritish vessels and their cargoes are admitted to an entry in the ports of the United States, from the islands, provinces and colonies of Great Britain, on or near the North American continent, and north or east of the United States[8].\nThe order in council is in the following terms:\nAnd His Majesty doth further, by the advice aforesaid, and in the pursuance of the powers aforesaid, declare that the ships of and belonging to the United States of America may import from the United States aforesaid, into the British possessions abroad, goods, the produce of those states, and may export goods from the British possessions abroad, to be carried to any foreign country whatever[9].\nThis latter order in council of 1830 was passed under the authority of the Imperial Act of 1825, ch. 114, but a perusal of that Act, as well as of the order in council, will show, I think, without doubt, that there was no intention on the part of Parliament in passing the Act, or of His Majesty in making the order in council, to in any way repeal or modify the treaty of 1818, or the Imperial Act providing for the enforcement of its provisions, and the Imperial Act last referred to, and the order in council above quoted, is the only basis upon which any claim of right on the part of the \"Gerring\" to do what she did in the territorial waters of Canada can stand. The \"Gerring,\" therefore, was found in British waters for a purpose not authorized by law, and consequently, under the express provisions of our own statute became liable to forfeiture.\nThere is another ground, already incidentally referred to, justifying the forfeiture of this vessel, though not of her cargo, and as this is par excellence a case of purse seining, it is just as well to deal with and settle the, question now. Section 1 of the statute of 1891, above referred to, is as follows:\n1. Section fourteen of \"The Fisheries Act\" is hereby amended by adding thereto the following subsection:\n15. The use of purse seines for the catching of fish in any of the waters of Canada is prohibited, under a penalty for each offence of not less than fifty dollars, and not exceeding five hundred dollars, together with the confiscation of the vessel, boat and apparatus used in connection with such catching.\nOf course the same controversy may arise as to the meaning of the word \"catching\" here as has arisen in respect to the words \"fishing\" and \"taking fish,\" but if I am right as to these latter words, it follows that \"catching\" includes \"baling,\" and that as this \"baling\" was done within the territorial waters by the use of the seine the case is within the statute. But the words \"in any of the waters of Canada\" qualify, according to proper grammatical construction, not the word \"catching,\" but the word \"use,\" and it is the using in Canadian waters of a purse seine that is prohibited. There was such a \"user\" here, and forfeiture is the consequence.\nIn my judgment the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nKING J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment in the Admiralty Court condemning the American fishing schooner \"Frederick Gerring, Jr.\", for violation of the fishery laws.\nAccording to the testimony of the seizing officer the vessel when seized was about a mile and a half outside of Gull Ledge, on the coast of Nova Scotia. Her crew at the time were engaged in taking mackerel from a purse or bag seine made fast to the vessel.\nA couple of hours previously she had been observed by Capt. Mackenzie, of the fishery protection cruiser \"Vigilant,\" in the act of going up to her seine boat after the seine had been thrown and drawn together, or pursed. The vessel and her seine boat were then, in Capt. Mackenzie's opinion, about a half mile outside of the three mile limit. The interval appears to have been wholly spent in taking the fish from the seine. In this operation the sheets are eased off, and headway taken off the vessel to prevent her fouling the seine, or destroying it by too rapid movement through the water; and it was contended for the appellant that it was not possible, in the existing conditions of wind and current, that the vessel could have got inside the limit. This contention assumed the correctness of Capt. Mackenzie's observation respecting the position of the \"Gerring\" when he saw her, as already stated, and was supported by a substantial body of expert evidence as to the effects of currents, etc. There was, however, evidence of like character the other way, and (what was more material) direct testimony as to cross bearings taken on board the seizing vessel just before the seizure, of certain objects on the land, which, if correct, would show the \"Gerring\" to have been then, within the limits. It appears, also, that the commander of the \"Aberdeen,\" the seizing vessel, took the reasonable course of endeavouring to show to the master of the \"Gerring\" the position of his vessel upon his own chart, by bearings taken with his own compass. It is admitted that the seizing officer asked for the compass and chart in order to take the bearings of certain points and indicate them on the chart. There is, however, a difference between the parties as to what took place when the chart was produced. The commander of the \"Aberdeen\" says that it was in a condition that rendered it useless for the purpose. The master of the \"Gerring\" took no bearings, and his opinion as to his vessel's position rests entirely upon the general appearance of the coast to the eye. Capt. Mackenzie's testimony is important, as he places the vessel outside the limits when the seine was thrown. He was not concerned in the seizure, and his observation of the subsequent position of the \"Gerring\" is entitled to much consideration. During the two hours his vessel appears to have drifted considerably inshore, and he observed the \"Aberdeen\" steaming up to the \"Gerring,\" and, at that time, noticed that the latter vessel was then inside the three miles limit. It further appears that there is an in draught amongst the islands along the coast, and we all know that amongst things not fully understood is the cause of the variation in strength of coast currents at different seasons.\nThe direct testimony in the case was quite sufficient to warrant the conclusions of the learned judge as to the position of the vessel.\nThe remaining question is whether what the vessel did within the three miles limit was a violation of any of the provisions of the fishery laws. It is to be taken as the fact that when she entered Canadian waters the purse seine had been drawn together inclosing the fish in it. The appellant's contention is that, upon this, the act of fishing or taking fish was completed, and that the \"Gerring\" was afterwards merely taking on board her own property.\nUpon this point MacDonald C. J., says:\nI must not omit to notice the contention of Mr. MacCoy, that, admitting the seine to have been thrown, and the fish in closed in it, outside of the three mile limit, it is not an offence against the Act to continue to bale the fish from the seine into the vessel after permitting her to drift across the prohibited boundary. I cannot accept his contention that the \"fishing\" and the \"catching of the fish,\" are completed when the seine is successfully thrown. Further labour is required to save the fish from the sea and reduce the property to useful possession, and until that be completed the act of \"fishing\" and \"catching fish\" is not in my opinion completed.\nThe evidence is somewhat meagre respecting the operation of taking fish by purse seines It appears that the seine is about twenty-eight fathoms in depth, and, when drawn together, about twelve or fourteen fathoms. It is set from a boat rowed rapidly around the school of fish, and then drawn together from below in such a way as to enclose the fish in a kind of bag, the mouth of which is then made fast to the vessel forward and aft, and drawn above the level of the water, and the live fish taken from it by baling. The setting and drawing of the seine is the work of a short time, but the proper handling of the seine afterwards and getting the fish from it is an operation taking considerable time, in this case two hours.\nIt is a recognized principle of maritime and international law that every nation has jurisdiction over the waters adjacent to its shores to the distance of a marine league. There is, however, in every other nation, the right to navigate such waters for harmless purposes subject to such supervision as may be deemed necessary to prevent abuse. \"It seems to me,\" says the present Master of the Rolls, in The Queen v. Keyn[10]\nthat this is in reality a fair representation of the accord or agreement of substantially all the foreign writers on international law, and that they all agree in asserting that, by the consent of all nations, each which is bounded by the open sea has a right over such adjacent sea as a territorial sea, that is to say, as a part of its territory, and that they all mean thereby to assert that it follows, as a consequence of such sea being part of its territory, that each such nation has in general the same right to legislate and enforce its legislation over that part of the sea as it has over its land territory. With its own consent, given to all other nations in the same way as they have consented to its right of territory, consent from which neither it nor they can rightly depart without the consent of all, there is for all nations a free right of way to pass over such sea with harmless intent, but such a right does not derogate from the exercise of all its sovereign rights in other respects.\nThis, it is true, is from a dissentient opinion, but by a declaratory Act 41 & 42 Vic. ch. 73, the territorial rights thus asserted were declared to have always existed. See also The Queen v. Dudley[11].\nUpon the close of the war of 1812, and in consequence of a difference of opinion between the governments of Great Britain and the United States as to the effect of the war upon the continuance of former treaty rights of American fishermen in the waters of His Majesty's Dominion in British North America, the convention of 1818 was concluded, whereby it was (inter alia) agreed that within certain limits (chiefly in and about Newfoundland, Labrador, Magdalen Islands, etc.), the inhabitants of the United States were to have for ever in common with the subjects of His Majesty the liberty to take fish of every kind, and also the limited right to dry and cure fish in certain bays, harbours and creeks. It was then agreed by the United States as follows:\nAnd the United States hereby renounces for ever any liberty heretofore enjoyed or claimed by the inhabitants thereof to take, dry or cure fish on or within three marine miles of any of the coasts, bays, creeks or harbours of His said Majesty's Dominions in America, not included within the above mentioned limits, provided, however, that the American fisherman shall be admitted to enter such bays or harbours for the purpose of shelter or of repairing damages therein, of purchasing wood and of obtaining water, and for no other purpose whatever. But they shall be under such restrictions as may be necessary to prevent them taking, drying or curing fish therein or in any other manner whatever abusing the privileges hereby reserved to them. Then, as to domestic legislation. The Imperial Act, 59 Geo. 3, c. 88, declared it to be unlawful for any person other than a natural born subject of His Majesty in any foreign ship, etc., to fish for, or to take, dry, or cure any fish of any kind whatsoever within three, marine miles of any coasts, bays, creeks or harbours whatever in any part of His Majesty's Dominions in America, not included within the limits specified and described in the first article of such convention, and it is enacted that, if any such foreign ship, etc., or any person on board thereof should be found fishing or to have been fishing or preparing to fish within such prohibited limits, such vessels, etc., should be forfeited, etc., provided, however, (as in terms of the treaty) that it should be lawful for any fishermen of the United States to enter into any such bays or harbours for the purpose of shelter and repairing damages therein, and of purchasing wood or obtaining water and for no other purpose whatever.\nThe subject has also been dealt with by the Parliament of Canada, and it is enacted by ch. 94 R. S. C. that any fishery officer concerned in the protection of the fishery (amongst other officers) \"may go on board of any vessel within any harbour of Canada, or hovering in British waters within three marine miles of any of the coasts, bays, creeks or harbours in Canada, and may bring such vessel into port * * * And if such vessel is foreign, and (a) has been found fishing or preparing to fish, or to have been fishing in British waters within the three marine miles of any of the coasts, bays, creeks or harbours of Canada, not included within the above mentioned limits, without a license * * or (b), has entered such waters for any purpose not permitted by treaty, or convention, or by any law of the United Kingdom or Canada for the time being in force, such ship, etc., shall be forfeited,\" The convention of 1818 deals not merely with the catching of fish, but with the entire subject of the rights of American fishermen to the use of territorial waters and adjacent coasts in the prosecution of their enterprise.\nThe rights and privileges of American fishermen therein are stated affirmatively and negatively. There is the right to take fish in common with British subjects in certain waters, and to dry and cure fish (wheresoever taken) on certain coasts; and, with regard to the remaining waters and coasts, a renunciation of all claim or liberty to take, dry or cure fish; but, along with this, a certain saving, viz.: to enter bays and harbours for the specified purpose of shelter, repairs, purchasing wood and obtaining water, but for no other purpose whatever.\nThis seems not only not to permit, but, by necessary implication to exclude, the using of territorial waters (other than those in which the right of fishing is recognized) for a purpose so material to and connected with the actual taking of the fish, as that of making good and effectual the capture of fish brought under certain dominion and control outside of such waters; that is to say, of acquiring absolute property in that which previously may have been the subject of a qualified property, liable to be defeated in various contingencies as, for instance, by the state of the weather, or by the fouling of the seine, or the breaking of it with the weight and pressure of the fish, or by a variety of causes. To enter territorial waters for such a purpose is a substantial use of them for a purpose directly connected with the taking of fish, and not being permitted by treaty or by any statute, Imperial or Canadian, is within the terms of clause (b) of ch. 94 Revised Statutes of Canada. It is immaterial, so far as the question of right is concerned, that the vessel may have drifted within the limit, for, if appellant's contention is correct, it avails equally where the act is deliberate. The remedy for cases of hardship lies in the pardoning power of the Crown.\nFurther, as to the meaning of the words \"taking fish\" and \"fishing,\" in the treaty and statutes; \"to fish\" is defined in Webster's dictionary as \"to be employed in taking fish as by angling or drawing a net.\" It covers the attempt although the fish may not be present in the waters, and a fortiori, it covers all that is involved in the continuous act of acquiring complete and absolute dominion over fish, subject to certain possession and control. It may well be that the \"Gerring\" people had sufficient control and dominion to have acquired a qualified property in the fish; Young v. Hichens[12]; Pollock & Wright on Possession 37; 2 Kent's Com. 348; but an operation at sea of taking several hundred, or one hundred barrels (as here) of loose and live fish from a bag net, is attended with such obvious chances of some of them at least regaining their natural liberty, that the act of fishing cannot be said to be entirely at an end in a useful sense until the fish are reduced into actual possession. The whole is a continuous act requiring for its successful carrying out that the fish should without delay be taken from the water, and the whole operation may properly have applied to it the terms \"fishing\" and \"taking fish.\nI have not arrived at this conclusion without hesitation and doubt, enhanced by the knowledge that the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Gwynne are of a different opinion.\nThe result, according to my view, is that the appeal should be dismissed. GIROUARD J.\u2014It is not claimed by the appellants that foreign vessels have the right to fish within the territorial jurisdiction of Canada. They admit that both by the principles of international law and the articles of the Fishery Convention of 1818, American vessels have no right to fish or take fish within the three mile limit of the coasts of Nova Scotia. Their main contention, at the hearing before us, was that when the \"Gerring\" was seized, the fishing or taking fish had been completed in the open sea, and that the mere baling of fish after they had been caught, and lifting them on the deck of the vessel, is not fishing and was no offence.\nThey quote no authority in support of this proposition, except Webster's definition of the word fishing: \"An attempt to catch fish, to be employed in taking fish by any means.\" I have before me the latest edition of Webster, the \"International\" of 1896, where the word \"fishing\" is perhaps more definitely defined: \"The act, practice, or art, of one who fishes.\" But neither this nor the other definition decides the point at issue. Was the act of baling the fish out of the seine, into the vessel an operation of fishing or taking fish? That is the question which must be decided according to the principles of law. And to do so, we are brought to examine this other question: Is the fish in closed in the seine the property and in the possession of the fishermen before it is actually transferred to the vessel? Chief Justice Macdonald, who tried this case in the court below, answered this question in the negative. He said:\nI must not omit to notice the contention of Mr. MacCoy, that admitting the seine to have been thrown and the fish enclosed in it outside of the three mile limit, it is not an offence against the Act to continue to bale the fish from the seine into the vessel after permitting her to drift across the prohibited boundary. I cannot accept his contention that the \"fishing\" and the \"catching of the fish\" was complete when the seine was successfully thrown. Farther labour is required to save the fish from the sea, and reduce the property to useful possession, and until that be completed the act of fishing and \"catching\" fish is not in my opinion completed, and in the case before us the crew were in the act of baling the fish from the seine into the vessel when the seizure was made[13].\nAfter a careful research in the text books and digests, both English and American, I have been able to find only one English case in point, but it fully supports the views of the learned Chief Justice. I refer to the case of Young v. Hichens[14], decided in 1844 by the Court of Queen's Bench. The facts are thus summarized in the report of the case:\nOn the day in question a very large shoal of mackerel came into the bay of St. Ives. The plaintiff's boat, the \"Wesley,\" put out, and shot her seine, not conducting herself at that time, as the defendant alleged, according to the regulations of the fishery. The seine, nearly 140 fathoms long, was drawn in a semicircle completely round the shoal with the exception of a space of seven fathoms according to the plaintiff's witnesses, ten fathoms according to the defendant's, which was not filled up by it. In this opening, according to the plaintiff's witnesses, the fishermen in the plaintiff's boat were splashing with their oars and disturbing the water in such a manner that, as they affirmed, the mackerel within would have been effectually prevented from escaping. At this conjuncture, before the plaintiff could draw his net closer, the \"Ellen,\" the defendant's boat, rowed in through the opening thus made, shot her seine, enclosed the fish, and captured the whole of them.\nIt was held that the first person could not maintain trespass for taking his fish, his possession not having been complete. Lord Denman C. J. said:\nIt certainly results from the evidence in this case, that the fish were reduced to a condition in which it was in the highest degree probable that the plaintiff would become possessed of them. But it is equally certain that he had not become possessed. Whether the necessary possession be rightly described by the word \"custodia\" or \"occupatio,\" I think it is not attained until the plaintiff has brought the animals into his actual power. It may be indeed that the defendant has committed a tortious act in preventing the plaintiff from completing his possession. Patterson J.:\nI do not see how we can say this action is maintainable, unless by holding that a person on the point of taking possession of a thing is actually in possession of it.\nIt is said that this decision does not apply to the present case, as the seine was pursed up, but it cannot be pretended that a seine can be so closed up that no escape is possible for the fish; an open space must be left for the dip-net used in the baling out of the fish. The whole process of pursing and baling is thus described by the owner of the \"Gerring.\"\nQ. Have you had experience in pursing seines? A. Yes, for 7 or 8 years.\nQ. Describe how it is done? A. You take the seine and set it out of the boat, and when you get a shoal of fish you go alongside the seine with the vessel and make it fast to the vessel forward and aft. You make the jibs fast and guy out the booms and bale out the fish with a long handled dip-net right on the deck of the vessel. * * *\nQ. Is it usual for a fishing vessel to lie with her sheets off and her jibs down, when she is taking fish out of the net? A. Yes, that is the way they have to do.\nQ. What is the object of it? A. It is on account of the seine. If the jibs were kept up it would tear the seine all to pieces.\nQ. Why do you let the sheets off? A. They have to do it. If the sheets were kept in she would go stern foremost if the jibs were down.\nQ. The object is to keep her in about the same position? A. Yes.\nIt is not difficult to understand that owing to various causes\u2014mismanagement, mishaps or mere accidents\u2014the fish may and do in fact escape from the seine after it is pursed up. The seine may break, the fastenings at either end of the vessel may give way, the jibs and sheets may become unmanageable, the fish may jump into the sea over the floating sides of the seine, or from the dip-net, and many other things may happen which would prevent the fishermen from capturing the fish enclosed in the seine. In the eyes of the law, the possibility of such accidents, mishaps and mismanagement renders the property and possession of the fish not complete till it is in the vessel. But admitting that the fish enclosed in a seine pursed up is in the possession of the fisherman, upon what ground can it be pretended that the baling of the fish is not an operation of fishing? As remarked by Chief Justice Macdonald, the baling was necessary to reduce the property to useful possession.\nThe soundness of the decision in Young v. Hichens[15] has never been questioned either in England or in the United States; it is quoted with approbation in American text books and digests, and more particularly in the American and English Encyclopaedia of Law, v \"Fish and Fisheries,\" p. 27; Addison on Torts[16]; Gould on Waters[17].\nAngell, Tide Waters[18], observes:\nAs the right of fishing in the sea, and in all inland and navigable waters, is prim\u00e2 facie common to all, it follows that an actual appropriation or manucaption must be made of the fish to complete the right of property; and that when the fish are taken they become the exclusive property of the taker, unless voluntarily restored to their native element. Bracton and Fleta both lay it down as the common law that fishes are animalia qu\u0153 in mari nascunter qu\u0153 cvm capiuntur captoria fiunt. But the possession of the fish must be complete.\nThe learned writer then quotes Young v. Hichens (1).\nI have no hesitation in following the decision in Young v. Hichens (1), as I find it based upon the Roman law, which everywhere is considered as written reason, and in the absence of other regulations has been accepted as law by all modern civilized nations. The Institutes of Justinian de rerum divisione[19], (translation of Sandars) say:\n12. Wild beasts, birds, fish, that is, all animals which live either in the sea, the air or on the earth, so soon as they are taken by any one, immediately become by the law of nations the property of the captor for natural reason gives to the first occupant that which had no previous owner. And it is immaterial whether a man takes wild beasts or birds upon his own ground, or on that of another. Of course any one who enters the ground of another for the sake of hunting or fowling, may be prohibited by the proprietor, if he perceives his intention of entering. Whatever of this kind you take is regarded as your property, so long as it remains in your keeping, but when it has escaped and recovered its natural liberty, it ceases to be yours, and again becomes the property of him who captures it. It is considered to have recovered its natural liberty if it has either escaped out of your sight, or if, although not out of sight, it yet could not be pursued without great difficulty.\n13. It has been asked, whether, if you have wounded a wild beast, so that it could be easily taken, it immediately becomes your property. Some have thought that it does become yours directly you wound it, and that it continues to be yours while you continue to pursue it, but that if you cease to pursue it, it then ceases to be yours, and again becomes the property of the first person who captures it. Others have thought that it does not become your property until you have captured it. We confirm this latter opinion because many accidents may happen to prevent your capturing it. D. xli., tit. 1.\nGaius in this passage of the Digest informs us that the former opinion was that of Trebatius.\nIt cannot be denied that these Roman rules never prevailed in England or on the continent of Europe to their full extent, at least as to wild animals taken or caught on private grounds by a trespasser or a wrongdoer. As Lord Chelmsford, referring to the passage from the Institutes, points out in Blades v. Higgs in 1865[20].\nWith respect only to live animals in a wild and unreclaimed state, there seems to be no difference between the Roman and the common law.\nJurists agree that the word \"occupation,\" \"capture,\" or \"custody,\" used in the Institutes, means bodily possession, corpore et animo, although it is contended by some that the fisherman who has secured fish in his seine, or the hunter who has wounded a wild animal, has acquired some qualified rights of ownership over the same, provided the fishing or hunting be continued, but if abandoned he loses every claim or right to the animal. In such cases, therefore, fishing or hunting is not terminated till the animal is actually captured.\nThe best interpreters of the Roman law hold that wild animals are not possessed till they are actually and beyond peradventure in our power.\nDomat, says[21]:\nWild beasts, fowls, fishes, and everything that is taken, either in hunting, fowling or fishing, by those who have a right thereto, belong to them as their property by virtue of the seizure which they make of them.\nThe original text says more:\nLes b\u00eates sauvages, les oiseaux, les poissons et tout ce que peuvent prendre, ou \u00e0 la chasse on \u00e0 la p\u00eache, ceux qui en ont le droit, leur sont acquis en propre par la prise qui les met en leurs mains.\nSavigny, Jus Possessionis, says[22]:\nWild animals are only possessed so long as some special disposition (custodia) exists, which enables us actually to get them into our power. It is not every custodia, therefore, which is sufficient; whoever, for instance, keeps wild animals in a park, or fish in a lake, has undoubtedly done something to secure them, but it does not depend on his mere will, but on a variety of accidents, whether he can actually catch them when he wishes; consequently, possession is not here retained quite otherwise with fish kept in a stew, or animals in a yard, because then they may be caught at any moment.\nPuffendorf, says[23]:\nWith regard to things movable, every one agrees that, in order to appropriate the same by right of first occupation, the possession must be bodily, and that it is necessary that they should be removed from the place where they were found to the place of domicile of the finder, or the place were they are intended to be kept.\nAnd he then explains that it is not essential that this possession should at first be manual:\nThat possession may also be acquired with instruments, such as suares, nets, traps, weirs, hooks and the like; * * * provided that these instruments are entirely under our control * * and also that the animal is so well caught that it cannot possibly escape, at least during the length of time required to put the hand on it.\nHeinneccius[24], lays down the same rule, and so far both he and Puffendorf merely repeat what Grotius[25], says on the same subject. Puffendorf finally makes the distinction at sec. 10:\nThat if I have mortally wounded or at least seriously disabled an animal, no one can lay any claim to it so long as I pursue it on grounds where I have the right to hunt; but if the wound be not mortal, and the animal can well escape, it still goes to the first occupant.\nBarbeyrac criticises Puffendorf, and holds that it is not always necessary that the animal should be wounded or removed from its natural element, and that its mere discovery and pursuit, with the intention to capture it, are sufficient. Pothier[26], observes that in France the latter opinion prevails in practice, dans l'usage; but Laurent[27], says that the jurisprudence has been to the contrary. A decision of the Superior Court of Quebec holds that it is sufficient that the animal be wounded and pursued, and quotes the authority of Cujas. Charlebois v. Raymond[28].\nFor the purposes of this case, it may be asserted that all the authorities agree in holding that a wild animal caught in a net or trap is not in the full possession or the absolute property of its owner unless finally seized. This feat, therefore, cannot be accomplished till the hunting or fishing is successfully completed.\nThese principles were recognized in two American cases quoted with approbation by Chancellor Kent. In Pierson v. Post[29], the Supreme Court of the State of New York held in 1805 that:\nPursuit alone gives no right of property in animals fer\u0153 natur\u0153; therefore an action will not lie against a man for killing and taking one pursued by, and in view of, the person who originally found, started, chased it, and was on the point of seizing it. Occupancy in wild animals can be acquired only by possession, but such possession does not signify manucaption, though it must be of such a kind as by nets, snares or other means, to so circumvent the creature that he cannot escape.\nTompkins j., delivering the opinion of the court, said:\nIf we have recourse to the ancient writers upon general principles of law, the judgment below is obviously erroneous. Justinian's Institutes[30], and Fleta[31], adopt the principle, that pursuit alone vests no property or right in the huntsman; and that even pursuit, accompanied with wounding, is equally ineffectual for that purpose, unless the animal be actually taken. The same principle is recognized by Bracton[32].\nPuffendorf[33] defines occupancy of beasts fer\u0153 natur\u0153, to be the actual corporal possession of them, and Bynkershock is cited as coinciding in this definition. It is indeed with hesitation that Puffendorf affirms that a wild beast mortally wounded, or greatly maimed, cannot be fairly intercepted by another, whilst the pursuit of the person inflicting the wound continues. The foregoing authorities are decisive to show that mere pursuit gave Post no legal right to the fox, but that he became the property of Pierson, who intercepted and killed him.\nIt therefore only remains to inquire whether there are any contrary principles; or authorities, to be found in other books, which ought to induce a different decision. Most of the cases which have occurred in England, relating to property in wild animals, have either been discussed and decided upon the principles of their positive statute regulations, or have arisen between the huntsman and the owner of the land upon which beasts fer\u0153 natur\u0153 have been apprehended, the former claiming them by title of occupancy, and the latter ratione soli. Little satisfactory aid can, therefore, be derived from the English reporters.\nBarbeyrac, in his notes on Puffendorf, does not accede to the definition of occupancy by the latter, but, on the contrary, affirms that actual bodily seizure is not, in all cases, necessary to constitute possession of wild animals. He does not, however, describe the acts which, according to his ideas, will amount to an appropriation of such animals to private use, so as to exclude the claims of all other persons, by title of occupancy, to the same animals; and he is far from averring that pursuit alone is sufficient for that purpose. To a certain extent, and as far as Barbeyrac appears to me to go, bis objections to Puffendorf's definition of occupancy are reasonable and correct. That is to say, that actual bodily seizure is not indispensable to acquire right to, or possession of, wild beasts; but that, on the contrary, the mortal C wounding of such beasts, by one not abandoning his pursuit, may, with the utmost propriety, be deemed possession of him since, thereby, the pursuer manifests an unequivocal intention of appropriating the animal to his individual use, has deprived him of his natural liberty, and brought him within his certain control. So also, encompassing and securing such animals with nets and toils, or otherwise intercepting them in such a manner as to deprive them of their natural liberty, and render escape impossible, may justly be deemed to give possession of them to those persons who, by their industry and labour, have used such means of apprehending them. Barbeyrac seems to have adopted, and had in view in his notes, the more accurate opinion of Grotius[34], with respect to occupancy. That celebrated author[35], speaking of occupancy, proceeds thus: \"Requiritur autem corporalis qu\u0153dam possessio ad dominium adipiscendum; atque ideo vulnerasse non sufficit.\" But in the following section he explains and qualifies this definition of occupancy: \"Sed possessio ilia potest non solis manibus, sed instrumentis, ut decipulis, ratibus, laqueis dum duo adsint; primum ut ipsa instrumenta sint in nostra poiestate, deinde ut fera, ita inclusa sit, ut exire inde nequeat,\" This qualification embraces the full extent of Barbeyrac's objection to Puffendorf's definition, and allows as great a latitude to acquiring property by occupancy, as can reasonably be inferred from the words or ideas expressed by. Barbeyrac in his notes. The case now under consideration is one of mere pursuit, and presents no circumstances or acts which can bring it within the definition of occupancy by Puffendorf, or Grotius, or the ideas of Barbeyrac upon that subject.\nPierson v. Post[36] was reaffirmed in 1822 by the same court in Buster v. New Kirk[37].\nPer Curiam. The principles decided in the case of Pierson v. Post (3) are applicable here. The authorities cited in that case establish the position that property can be acquired in animals fer\u0153 natur\u0153, by occupancy only; and that, in order to constitute such an occupancy, it is sufficient if the animal is deprived of his natural liberty, by wounding, or otherwise, so that he is brought within the power and control of the pursuer. In the present case, the deer, though wounded, ran six miles; and the defendant in error had abandoned the pursuit that day, and the deer was not deprived of his natural liberty, so as to be in the power or under the control of N. He, therefore, cannot be said to have had a property in the animal, so as to maintain the action. The judgment must be reversed.\nHaving arrived at the conclusion that the baling of the fish is an operation of fishing, or taking fish, it is not necessary for me to express any opinion upon two important questions which were raised by the Crown, namely, whether the recent Dominion statute prohibiting purse seining, applies to this case, and whether the convention of 1818 prohibits American fishermen from entering within three miles of the coasts of the Dominion\u2014others than bays and harbours\u2014for any purpose not authorized by the convention, and particularly for the purpose of baling fish caught in the open sea, if such an act cannot be considered as fishing, or taking fish.\nFinally, I am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: MacCoy, MacCoy & Grant.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.

On appeal, the Court of Queen's Bench reversed the order on the ground that it directed a resale of property which had not been sold and further because an apparently regular sheriffs deed of the lands actually sold had been duly registered, and had not been annulled by the order for re-sale, or prior to the proceedings for folle ench\u00e8re.\nHeld, that the Court of Queen's Bench should not have set aside the order, but should have reformed it by rectifying the error.\nHeld, further, that the sheriff's deed having been issued improperly and without authority should be treated as an absolute nullity notwithstanding that it had been registered and appeared upon its face to have been regularly issued, and it was not necessary to have it annulled before taking proceedings for folle ench\u00e8re.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, which had granted the appellant's motion for a folle ench\u00e8re, and ordered a resale of the property seized by the sheriff\nA. statement of the facts and questions at issue on this appeal appear in the judgment reported.\nMacmaster Q.C. and Stephens Q.C. for the appellant. The issue raised upon this appeal seems at first to involve mere questions of local procedure, which may be objected to as proper grounds for consideration by this court. Appellate courts have constantly allowed appeals based upon questions of practice when parties might thereby be deprived of remedy or made to suffer great injustice. This is a case of that nature.\nIt is clear that the slip in drafting the order for re sale was excusable and occurred through the absence from the record in the office of the court of the notice to the sheriff withdrawing a very insignificant portion of the road-bed of the railway seized. The order was for a resale, which could only include what had actually been sold before by the same sheriff under the same process. The maxim de minims non cut at lex applies with striking force, but the Court of Queen's Bench reversed the order on technicalities where there was no mistake either of law or of practice sufficient to vitiate it. The proper course was simply to have reformed the order by the rectification of a mere lapses claim of an officer of the court. The objection taken could not be of interest to the respondent, but on the contrary might have the effect of giving him an actual benefit by making title to the uninterrupted right of way.\nThe sheriff's deed was illegally issued without authority, because the judges' order did not dispense with the necessity of taking the security imperatively required by art. 688, C. C. P. as amended by R. S. Q. art. 5941. It was based upon proceedings which had been all set aside as irregular and was wholly unwarranted and an absolute nullity. The registration could have no effect but to cloud the title until rectified by suit in the usual way\nPrecise description of the lands to be resold is not required in any event. Vincent v. Roy ([1]); D\u00e9lisle v. Sauche ([2]). A suggestion to the sheriff sufficiently indicating that he was to sell again what he had sold before is all that is necessary; the order was suffi client for all practical purposes.\nMorgan for the respondent. The appellant is merely acting in an official capacity and makes the excuse of being an opposant afin de conserver to force himself into the record as if he were a creditor and not simple a third party. (Arts. 511, 691 C. C. P.) His course is premature and irregular and he is not qualified to demand the resale. Fraser v. Garant ([3]). As a condition precedent to the present proceedings the sheriff's deed should have been annulled and its registration set aside. (Arts 2148, 2154 C. C.) Until such declaration of nullity the deed is a complete answer to the motion for folle ench\u00e8re.\nThis appeal being only to settle matters of procedure and questions arising in most unique circum stances of practice, ought not to be entertained by this court. The appellant having disregarded the universal practice of describing in particular terms all lands to be sold, must abide the consequences of his departure from well settled rules of practice and procedure.\nThe order is full of irregularities. Besides ordering the resale of the lot withdrawn and which never had been sold and could not possibly be resold under such an order, it fails to mention that over $1,200 were actually paid in cash to the sheriff and that the adjudicataire deposited first mortgage bonds for the balance of the price. It is invalid for its many omissions and irregularities; (art. 690 C. C. P.); and it is absurd that the respondent should be held contraignable par corps under an order so very informal and incomplete. The judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGIROUARD J.\u2014This appeal raises only a question of procedure in the court below, and consequently the respondent contended that we should not interfere with the judgment appealed from. But questions of practice cannot be ignored by this court when their decision involves the substantial rights of the litigants, or sanctions a grave injustice. We believe that this is one of those cases.\nOn the 2nd of June, 1894, the property of The Great Eastern Railway Company, consisting of the line of railway and all its appurtenances, was sold by the sheriff at the suit of Mr. Raymond Pr\u00e9fontenie for $20,000. The line comprised a large number of lots of land situate in several parishes of the district of Richelieu, and among others part of lot 1217 of the Parish of St. Thomas de Pierreville.\nBefore the sale the plaintiff ordered the sheriff in writing to withdraw said lot from the sale. The balance of the property seized was duly adjudicated to the respondent. He did not, however, pay the amount of his adjudication, but deposited an amount sufficient to satisfy the school taxes and the expenses of the sheriff. The latter, therefore, returned to the court that the sum of $19,1168.85 was still unpaid and in the hands of the respondent. Under the pretence that he was the sole hypothecary or privileged creditor of the company he adopted, with the consent of the plaintiff and defendant and other then apparent interested parties, various proceedings for the purpose of obtaining a judgment of distribution in his favour, and in fact did obtain that judgment. It is not necessary to take any further notice of those proceedings, as they were subsequently set aside at the suit of the appellant by a judgment of the Superior court, which was confirmed in review and the sheriff was ordered\nto return the moneys arising from the said sale in to court, and that the same be distributed according to law,\nand so far that judgment is chose jug\u00e9e between the parties, as no appeal was taken from it. Thereupon, the sheriff made a supplementary report that the money was still in the hands of the respondent, as hypothecary creditor of the railway company, and that he held no security from him for the amount. Neither the certificate of the registry office, nor any other paper, shows that the respondent was even an ordinary creditor. His counsel alleges in several papers that he is\nopposant afin de conserver * * et le seul cr\u00e9ancier privilegi\u00e9 de Ia compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse, tel qu'll appert aux documents produits,\nbut these documents were never produced, at least they are not to be found in the printed case; the op position afin de conserver, if ever filed, is not before us.\nNo mention was made by the sheriff that he had previously delivered a deed of sale to the respondent, which acknowledges that the respondent had paid the full amount of his adjudication, first by paying him $1,102.37 in cash, and $18,897.63, as representing so much of the mortgage debentures of the company.\nThe appellant, being opposant afin de conserver, in his quality of collector of provincial revenue for the province of Quebec, alleged that he was a creditor for $2,250 and claimed a privillege for $900 of that sum, and finally moved for folle ench\u00e8re against the respondent under art. 690, and following of the Code of Procedure. The respondent did not contest the claim of the appellant, but allowed the motion for folle ench\u00e8re to go by default, although duly served upon him, and con tented himself with filing of record a copy of the sheriff's deed of sale, accompanied by a list or inventaire des productions de l'adjudicataire, which mentions only the said deed. It may be stated here that the said deed does not comprise lot no. 1217.\nThe Superior Court (Doherty J), after having heard the appellant only, no mention being made of the respondent, granted the motion for folle ench\u00e8re,\nand doth order the issue of a writ of venditioni exponas in order that the property described in the proc\u00e8s verbal of seizure herein may be resold at the folle ench\u00e8re of said Armstrong, adjudicataire, and that the said adjudicataire may be, held by contrainte par corps to the payment of any loss resulting from the resale and the costs of these presents.\nThe Court of Appeal reversed the judgment for the following reasons:\nAttendu que le jugement rendu en cette cause par Ia Cour Sup\u00e9 rieure, le 26 septembre 1895, ordonne la vente \u00e0 la folle ench\u00e8re de l'appelant de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crite au proc\u00e9s verbal de la saisie qui en a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite et qu'il appert que l'un des immeubles d\u00e9sign\u00e9 an dit proc\u00e9s verbal, savoir: le num\u00e9ro 1217 du cadastre de la paroisse de St. Thomas de Pierreville, a \u00e9t\u00e9 distrait de la dite saisie et n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu ni achet\u00e9 par l'appelant:\nConsid\u00e9rant de plus que l'appelant oppose \u00e0 la demande de l'intim\u00e9 le titre en apparence r\u00e9gulier que le sh\u00e9rif lui a donn\u00e9 comme adjudi cataire de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 par lui acquise, lequel, para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment enregistr\u00e9 et que l'intime qui a fait annuler les proc\u00e9dures adopt\u00e9es pour l'obtenir n'a pas demand\u00e9 ni obtenu l'annulation pr\u00e9alable du dit acte:\nConsid\u00e9rant qu'il y a erreur dans le jugement rendu par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, etc.\nWe have no hesitation in holding that the judgment of the Superior Court was right and should be restored: but it should be corrected so as to exclude lot 1217. It was clearly a mistake easily explained, as the paper withdrawing that lot from the seizure and sale was only left with the sheriff, and was not filed of record in the court, at least at the time it was signed; in fact it is hard to know when it was filed, as even the sheriff's return makes no mention of the same. The respondent has no interest to raise this point, for if this lot be sold it will benefit himself and diminish his liability as adjudicataire, without being in any manner responsible for the validity of the proceeding.\nAs to the sheriff's deed of sale, which has been registered, I look upon it as a mere waste paper, which should be entirely ignored as it was not filed in support of any pleading or proceeding, and as having been issued improperly, illegally or without authority. It was an easy matter for the respondent to obtain, or at least to move for, leave to contest in writing the application for a resale under art. 692 of the Code. This leave seems to have been granted as he was allowed five days to answer, but failed to do so, and even to appear at the hearing before the court.\nThe respondent has admitted before us the nullity of the sheriff's sale, but he contended that, at least by his motion for folle ench\u00e8re, the appellant should also have prayed that it be annulled. It is too late for him to urge this ground in appeal. We believe, moreover, that in view of the fact that the sheriff's deed was merely thrown into the case and that the appellant had no notice of it, the court should ignore the same. To permit litigants in default, as this respondent certainly is, thus to take advantage of the irregularities and misdoings of the officers of the court, would be simply to hinder the administration of justice and destroy the usefulness of courses of law. We have, therefore, no hesitation in reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeals and restoring the judgment of the Superior Court, with the rectification of the mistake above mentioned, with costs against the respondent before all the courts.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.

Q. art. 2311.\nIn appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada from the Court of Review (which, by 54 & 55 Vict. ch. 25, s. 3, s.s. 3, must be appealable to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council,) the amount by which the right of appeal is to be determined is that demanded, and not that recovered, if they are different. Dufresne v. Gu\u00e9vremont (26 Can. S. C. R. 216) followed.\nMOTION to quash an appeal from the decision of the Superior Court, sitting in review at Montreal, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, district of Montreal, which condemned the appellants to pay $2,000, with interest and costs to the respondent.\nThe respondent sued for $5,000 damages for the death of her late husband which, it was alleged, was caused through the appellant's negligence, but recovered only $2,000 with interest and costs by the judgment in the Superior Court. On an appeal taken by the appellant, the Court of Review affirmed the decision of the trial court with costs. The appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench having been taken away by the amendment to article 1155 of the Code of Civil Procedure (54 Vict. (Q.) ch. 48, sec. 2), the defendant appealed directly to the Supreme Court of Canada, under the provisions of 54 & 55 Vict. (D.) ch. 25, s. 3 s.s. 3. Charbonneau for the respondent, moved to quash the appeal on the ground of want of jurisdiction, and cited Couture v. Bouchard ([1]); Turrotte v. Dansereau\n([2]); Laberge v. The Equitable Life Assurance Society\n([3]); Allan v. Pratt ([4]).\nR. C. Smith for the appellant contra. The decision in Dufresne v. Gu\u00e9vremont ([5]) applies here. The amount of the demande rules where the appeal is dependent upon the amount in dispute.\nTaschereau J.- This is an appeal from the Court of Review, which, it is conceded, lies to this court, under 54 & 55 Vict., ch. 25 (D), only where an appeal lies in the case from the Court of Review to the Privy Council. The amount claimed by the declaration is $5,000, and the judgment of the Superior Court, confirmed in review, is for $2,000. The appeal is by the defendant.\nThe respondent moves to quash the appeal on the ground that the judgment being only for $2,000, (and not \u00a3500 sterling), the case is not appealable to the Privy Council. That contention cannot prevail. It is settled by this court in Dufresne v. Gu\u00e9vremont (5), that whenever the right to appeal to the Privy Council is dependent upon the amount in dispute, such amount must be understood to be that demanded, and not that recovered, if they are different. In that case the amount given by the judgment appealed from and in controversy on the appeal was sufficient to make the case appealable, but the amount demanded by the declaration was not, and we held that as it is the amount demanded that ruled there was no appeal. Here, the amount given by the judgment appealed from and in controversy on the appeal is not sufficient to make it appealable, but the amount demanded is, and it being the amount demanded that rules the case is appealable. Now here, the amount demanded is over \u00a3500 sterling. The case is therefore appealable. We are bound by our previous decision on the point. The motion must be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J. The point raised upon the motion to\nquash the appeal in this case having been expressly decided by the unanimous judgment of the learned judges of this court who heard the case of Dufresne v. Gu\u00e9vremont ([6]) it is not necessary that I should state the reasons upon which, but for that judgment, I should feel obliged to arrive at a contrary conclusion in the present case further than this, that I should be of opinion that the legislature of the late Province of Canada never contemplated by sec. 25 of ch. 77 of the Consolidated Statutes of Lower Canada which is intituled \"An Act respecting the Court of Queen's Bench,'' and was passed for the purpose of defining the jurisdiction original and appellate of that court, assuming to prescribe any mode by which it should be determined in any case whether the amount in dispute was sufficient to give such jurisdiction to Her Majesty in Her Privy Council to entertain an appeal from the judgment of a court in Lower Canada. So likewise I should have been of opinion that we are not justified in ignoring the judgment rendered in the case of Allan v. Pratt ([7]) upon the suggestion that that judgment was rendered without due consideration of the sec. 25 of said ch. 77, or without the atttention of the Privy Council having been drawn to it or that we are justified in entertaining the opinion that the judgment in that case would have been different from what it is if due consideration had been given by Her Majesty in Her Privy Council to the limitation which it is assumed that section imposed upon the jurisdiction of the Privy Council.\nDufresne v. Gu\u00e9vremont (1) must be conclusive upon the point in this court, and in cases like the present parties who may not be satisfied with that judgment must be remitted to raise the question as they may be advised before Her Majesty in Her Privy Council.\nSEDGEWICK, KING AND GIROUARD JJ. concurred in the reasons given by Mr. Justice Taschereau.\nMotion refused with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant Smith & MacKay.\nSolicitors for the respondent Charbonneau & Pelletier.\n[1] 21 Can.

Aylen Q.C. contra.\nTHE REGISTRAR.\u2014The late James Maclaren, by his will, clause 16 thereof, bequeathed to his sons David and Alexander Maclaren, $30,000,\u2014\nto be held and invested by them in trust, and in such manner as they may deem advisable, for the benefit of my daughter, Louisa Maclaren (who, some few years ago, married one Thomas Raphael against my will and advice, and who does not find the necessary means to support his family), and the interest or revenue thereof to be paid by them to her half yearly on her own receipt, for her support and maintenance, and free from all marital or other control or liability whatsoever, and exempt from all seizure or attachment. The said capital to be paid, by my executors and trustees, to my two sons David and Alexander Maclaren, after the expiry of three years after my decease unless my executors and trustees think it to the advantage of my estate to pay the amount over sooner, but until the expiry of three years my executors and trustees shall pay to the said Louisa Maclaren the sum of fifteen hundred dollars per annum in half yearly payments as interest on the said principal sum of thirty thousand dollars, and such said capital sum, upon the decease of my said daughter, shall go and belong to her lawful children surviving her, share and share alike, but none of the principal to be paid to the said children until they are of the age of thirty years. They may, however, after the death of their mother, receive the interest of the same until they are thirty years of age, share and share alike.\nI also release and discharge my said daughter, Louisa Maclaren, from all her liability to me, a statement of which may be seen in my books.\nBy a codicil the testator modified this clause of his will, as follows:\nI increase the legacy of thirty thousand dollars, made by me in paragraph sixteen of my said will, to be held by my sons, David and Alexander, in trust for my daughter, Louisa, to the sum of seventy thousand dollars, and the annual interest of fifteen hundred dollars to her therein, to three thousand five hundred dollars, and I ordain that my said two sons shall have the right and power, in their discretion, not to pay the said interest to my said daughter, but may apply the same for her benefit and support, and the benefit, support and education of her children, as they may deem best, * * it being my desire and will, that the husband of my said daughter, Thomas Raphael, shall not, either directly or indirectly, have any power or control over the benefits and legacies made by me to my said daughter Louisa, or any benefit, directly or indirectly, therefrom. I also ordain that my said two sons may pay the share of the capital of the said legacy to my daughter Louisa, to her lawful children, before they respectively attain the age of thirty years, as provided by my said will. I also ordain that the survivor of my said two sons may alone act as trustee in the matter of said legacy, to my daughter Louisa, or in any other legacies in which they are constituted trustees by my said will.\nThe testatcr died on the 10th of February, 1892.\nFor the following three years interest was paid by the executors on the $70,000 at the rate of 5 p. c. to Mrs. Raphael. On the 10th of February, 1895, the executors paid over the $70,000 to the trustees who replaced the money in the hands of the executors as a temporary investment at 5 p. c.\nOn the 8th April, 1895, Mrs. Raphael died leaving three minor children.\nOn the 21st May, 1895, the sum of $70,000 together with $949.32 for accrued interest, was repaid by the executors to the trustees, who deposited it in the Savings Department of the Bank of Ottawa at three and a half per cent. On the 20th December, 1895, the trustees invested the $70,000 with accrued interest amounting to $402,07 in trust debentures of the City of Ottawa of the face value of $69,493, paying 3.87 per cent. These debentures bring in 4 per cent.\nIn the meantime, on the 13th June, 1895, the plaintiff, Raphael, was appointed tutor to his three minor children, and on the 4th January, 1896, accepted their mother's succession on their behalf. On the 9th December, 1895, Raphael, as tutor to his children, sued the trustees for $1,750, being for one half yearly payment due 10th August, 1895, of the yearly interest on the $70,000, and also for interest on said sum of $1,750 from the said last mentioned day.\nThe conclusion of his declaration is as follows:\nWherefore the plaintiff, in his quality of tutor to the said three minor children, issue of his marriage with Dame Louisa Maclaren aforesaid, prays that defendants he jointly and severally condemned to pay and satisfy unto him the sum of seventeen hundred and fifty dollars, current money of Canada, with interest since the tenth day of August last past, and costs distraits to the undersigned.\nThe defendants pleaded in substance as follows: (a) That plaintiff could not claim from them the interest accrued upon the said trust funds, save what might be necessary for the maintenance, support and education of his said children.\nThat they invested the trust funds as best they could, and could not obtain better than a fraction under four per cent thereon, which in any event would be the only amount plaintiff would be entitled to claim\nThat out of such interest sums, they should only be held to pay to plaintiff such amount as might be deemed sufficient for the support and education of the children, upon monthly or other statements of the moneys required furnished by the tutor plaintiff.\nThe Superior Court sitting in the District of Ottawa rendered judgment on the 5th day of June, 1896, declaring that the trustees were bound by the terms of the will and codicil to procure five per cent a year on the sum bequeathed to them in trust; that, however, they were not bound to pay over the whole of the revenue but only as much as was sufficient to support and educate the children according to their position in life; and that an annual sum of $1,800 was sufficient for that purpose, and condemning the trustees to pay to the tutor the sum of $900 for the half year which had ended on the 10th August, 1895.\nBoth parties inscribed in review and the Court of Review rendered judgment on the 27th day of November, 1896, declaring that on the death of their mother, the minor children, issue of the marriage of the late Louisa Maclaren with Thomas Raphael, became the proprietors of the capital sum of $70,000; that their father as tutor was entitled to receive from the trustees the sum of $1,750 for a half yearly payment of the interest, virtually deciding that the trustees were bound to procure five per cent a year, and condemning them to pay such sum of $1,750 to the tutor for the half yearly instalment due on the 10th day of August, 1895.\nThe defendants thereupon appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench, which court, on the 24th February, 1897, rendered judgment as follows, after reciting the facts above set forth:\nConsidering that by the terms of the will and codicil the executors of the late James Maclaren were bound to pay interest at the rate of five per cent a year on the sum of $70,000 bequeathed by him for his daughter Louisa Maclaren and her children, during the three years that the amount of such bequest was to remain in their hands, but that no obligation was imposed on the trustees to pay such a rate of interest to the beneficiaries whether they could find or not an investment which would yield it, and that they were only subject to the ordinary rules respecting the investment of trust funds, and are only responsible to the beneficiaries for the income derived from the investments and received by them;\nConsidering that the provision contained in the codicil authorizing the trustees not to pay the interest to the testator's daughter, but to apply it for her benefit and support, and the benefit, support and education of her children, only applied to his daughter and not to her children, who are the absolute owners of the capital; and that the condition that the testator's son-in-law, Thomas Raphael, should not derive any benefit, either directly or indirectly, from the bequest applies to him personally, and not to him in his quality of tutor to his children; Considering that although the acceptance of their mother's succession by the minor children was only made by their tutor on the 4th day of January, 1896, between the date of the service of the action and the date of its return, it has a retroactive effect to the day of her death and that no exception was taken by the trustees in their pleas to the circumstance of the acceptance having been made after the institution of the action;\nConsidering that the tutor, the respondent in this cause, was entitled to demand and had a right to receive the income. derived from the principal of the trust for the half year which ended on the 10th day of August, 1896, from the trustees, the appellants in this cause;\nConsidering that the appellants received on the 21st day of May, 1895, from the executors of the late James Maclaren the sum of $949.32 for interest on the principal sum of $70,000, and that the interest at the rate of three and a half per cent a year on the deposit made by them in the Savings Department of the Bank of Ottawa amounted on the 10th day of August, 1895, to the sum of $551.07, forming together $1,500.39, and that such amount on that day became payable to the beneficiaries;\nConsidering that the appellants could and should only have invested the principal of the trust and that they had no right to invest the income which was payable to the beneficiaries, and notab'y the above mentioned sum of $1500.39, and that the fact of their having invested it does not relieve them from their liability to account for and to pay the same to the tutor of the minor beneficiaries;\nConsidering on the one hand that the appellants are not bound to procure a revenue equal to five per cent a year on the principal of the trust, and that the amount for which they are accountable is $1,500.39 and not $1,750, and on the other hand that the respondent is entitled to receive the whole of the revenue and not such portion only thereof as may be necessary for the maintenance, support and education of the minors, and that there is therefore error in both judgments;\nDoth maintain the appeal with costs, and doth set aside and annul the judgment appealed from of the Court of Review rendered at Montreal on the 27th day of November, 1896, and proceeding to pronounce the judgment which should have been rendered, doth set aside and annul the judgment of the Superior Court, rendered at Hull, in the District of Ottawa, on the 5th day of June, 1896, and doth condemn the appellants in their capacity of trustees to pay to the respondent, in his capacity of tutor, the sum of $1,500.39 for the income accrued from the 10th day of February, 1895, to the 10th day of August, 1895, on the trust funds, with interest thereon from the 2nd day of January, 1896, date of the service of process, and his costs in the Superior Court, and on his inscription in review, of which costs distraction is granted to Mtre. J. M. MacDougall, his attorney, but doth condemn the respondent to pay to the appellants the costs of their inscription in review, and the court on motion of Mtre. Henry Aylen, attorney for appellants, doth grant him distraction of costs.\nThe plaintiff has now applied for the approval of a bond which he proposes to give as security for the costs of an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, pursuant to sec. 46 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act.\nIt was agreed between counsel that the bond offered should be considered satisfactory, if jurisdiction to entertain the appeal were held to exist.\nIt was also admitted by counsel that the amount claimed by the declaration was under $2,000. Indeed, by a successful appeal to this court, it is apparent that the plaintiff would recover only the difference between $1,500.09, and $1,750. But the plaintiff contends that the controversy comes within the words of subsec. (b) of sec. 29 of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, as amended by sec. 1 of 56 Vict ch. 29, passed on the 1st April, 1893, and relates \" to a matter where the rights in future might be bound,\" a matter within the meaning of the words \" other matters or things \" in that subsection.\nIf apparent that the direct result of granting the plaintiffs' contentions would be to enable him to recover, in this action, the comparatively small sum of $250, it is equally apparent that the effect of the judg ment on the rights of the children acting through their tutor, is, or at any rate may be, very serious. It should be noted that the word used in subsec. (b) is \" might,\" not \" are,\" or \" will be,\" \" where the rights in future might be bound.\"\nNow the controversy in this action does seem to relate to a matter where the rights in future might be bound. The judgment rendered on the controversy appears to settle the point that the trustees are bound by the terms of the trust to pay over to the tutor, during a long minority, only the actual income received from the investment of the fund, which is now, and may be for the whole period, less than $3,500 per annum.\nOn this application there is no question raised as to the correctness of the judgment sought to be appealed from. The question is: What is the nature of the controversy between the parties, and does such controversy come within the words of sec. 29?\nThen, admitting that future rights might be affected, are they future rights within the meaning of sub section (b)?\nCan this case be distinguished from Gilbert v. Gil man ([1]); Dominion Salvage & Wrecking Co. v. Brown ([2]); and more particularly from Rodier v. Lapierre ([3]).\nIt is contended that there is an important difference between Rodier v. Lapierre (3), and this case, inasmuch as Rodier v. Lapierre (3), dealt with the right to recover a fixed and undisputed amount; if entitled to recover at all, there was no question as to the amount which the plaintiff was and would in the future be entitled to. In this case, the dispute is as to the extent of the amount the trustees are liable for, and the judgment will fix not only the amount directly in controversy in the immediate action, but the rights of the parties inter se, during the continuance of the whole trust.\nIn that case the plaintiff alleged that she was entitled to receive $100 monthly out of the revenues of the estate of her father under his will, which monthly allowance had been increased to $300 by an Act of the Legislature of Quebec, and she claimed from the respondent, as testamentary executrix, the additional $200 for the month of February, 1891. The appellant argued, [I quote from the judgment of the court delivered by Mr. Justice Taschereau,] that her appeal could be entertained on the ground that as the judgment dismissing her action, if allowed to stand, would be res judicata between her and the respondent, and a bar for ever of her claim, her appeal came within the words \"where the rights in future might be bound\" of sec. 29 of the Supreme Court Act.\nIs not this exactly the contention of the plaintiff in this case? If the judgment stands it will be res judicata as to the amount which the tutor will be entitled to receive from the trustees.\nThe learned judge then proceeds as follows:\nBut that contention cannot prevail. We have in numerous cases determined that these words of the statute are governed by the pre ceding words of the clause \" fee of office, duty, rent, revenue or any sum of money payable to Her Majesty, or any title to lands or tenements, annual rents, or such like matters or things. \"\nThe words \" annual rents \" cannot support the appeal. They mean ground rents (rentes fonci\u00e8res), and not an annuity or any other like charges or obligations.\nNeither can the appeal be entertained on the ground that the appellant's claim, being for a monthly allowance of $200, should be considered as being for an amount exceeding $2,000. The only amount actually in controversy in the present case is $200. The consequences of the judgment and its effect on the appellant's future rights in the matter cannot render the case appealable as being a case of $2,000.\nThis judgment seems to me to dispose of the case under consideration, unless the alteration in the sub section made by 56 Vict. ch. 29, in changing the words \"or such like matters or things, \" into \"and other matters or things,\" would lead us to conclude that Rodier v. Lapierre ([4]), would have been differently decided under the amendment.\nPrior to the amendment, subsection (b) of section 29 was construed as applying to real rights, or rights at least analogous to real rights and having some connection with the ownership or enjoyment of land.\nNow no case decided since the amendment has gone so far as to say that future rights which are pecuniary in their nature, rights to money as distinguished from rights to or in land, or analogous to such rights, come within the subsection. Two cases, Chamberland v. Fortier ([5]) and Stevenson v City of Montreal ([6]), have, it is true held that the effect of the amendment was to widen the scope of the enactment, but in both these cases the rights in question were, if not real rights, analogous to real rights.\nIn O'Dell v. Gregory ([7]), the effect of the amendment was considered, and it appears to me that the judgment of the Right Honourable the Chief Justice in that case, must be deemed conclusive against the appellant here. He says:\nThe first part of the subsection relates to appeals in the case of claims by the Crown. It is out of the question to say that this appeal involves any title to land, or to any annual rent. There only remains the words \"and other matters or things where the rights in the future might be bound.\" I cannot hold that this confers jurisdiction. The other matters or things referred to must, on the ordinary rule of construction noscitur a sociis, be construed to mean matters and things ejusdem generis with those specifically mentioned Then these are \" title to lands and tenements and annual rents.\" We must therefore interpret the words, \" other matters and things \" as meaning rights of property analogous to title to lands and annual rents, and not personal rights however important.\n* * * * * * * * *\nIt is sufficient, however, for the present purpose to say that the appeal does not come within any of the provisions of section 29, inasmuch as the action does not involve an amount equal to $2,000, nor does it relate to any matters or things in the nature of vested property rights which alone and not personal rights are intended by section 29, subsection (b) to be made the test of the right to appeal.\nThe application must be refused with costs.\nKing J. on appeal from the Registrar, confirmed his decision.\nMotion refused with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.

S. Q. art. 4485 Art. 1033a C. C. P.\nBy a resolution of the Council of the Town of Chicoutimi on 9th October, 1890, based upon an application previously made by him, L. obtained permission to construct waterworks in the town and to lay the necessary pipes in the streets wherever he thought proper, taking his water supply from the river Chicoutimi at whatever point might be convenient for his purposes, upon condition that the works should be commenced within a certain time and completed in the year 1892. He constructed a system of waterworks and had it in operation within the time pre. scribed, but the system proving insufficient a company was formed in 1895 under the provisions of R. S. Q., art. 4485, and given authority by by-law to furnish a proper water supply to the town, whereupon L. attempted to perfect his system, to alter the position of the pipes, to construct a reservoir and to make new excavations in the streets for these purposes without receiving any further authority from the council.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, (Gwynne J. dissenting), that these were not merely necessary repairs but new works, actually part of the system required to be completed during the year 1892 and which after that date could not be proceeded with except upon further permission obtained in the usual manner from the council of the town.\nHeld further, that the resolution and the application upon which it was founded constituted a \" contract in writing\" and a \" written agreement\" within the meaning of article 1033a of the Code of Civil Procedure of Lower Canada, and violation of its conditions was a sufficient ground for injunction to restrain the construction of the new works.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Chicoutimi, and dissolving the injunction which restrained the defendant from carrying on certain works on the streets of the Town of Chicoutimi and which had been made absolute by such judgment below.\nA sufficient statement of the case appears from the head note and from the judgments reported.\nGeoffrion Q.C. and Belleau Q.C. for the appellant. The appellants did not enter into any contract with the respondent; they only gave him permission to use the streets of the town for the construction of his aqueduct, not for any benefit that the corporation could derive from such construction. The respondent\nassumed no obligation towards the corporation or the public, nor did he receive any privilege or franchise. His was a purely private enterprise, under no control from municipal authority. He owes no duty to the corporation and the corporation owes none to him.\nIn any case, if the corporation is bound by the resolution of 9th October, 1890, the respondent cannot claim more than was given him by that resolution. The works were to be finished in 1892. The council did not pledge the future but restricted respondent to whatever works would be executed at the end of 1892 as a condition of the permission given, and he could execute, after 1892, no other works but necessary repairs. No completions or extensions could be constructed without new authority; he was to be satisfied with the works as completed in 1892. Stuart Q.C. for the respondent. The resolution authorizing the respondent to construct his aqueduct in the streets of Chicoutimi was intra vires and binding. The works complained of were not additions but were repairs necessary for the preservation of the aqueduct and caused no obstruction or nuisance.\nWith respect to the point taken that power of laying an aqueduct can only be exercised by by-law and not by resolution, the answer seems to be that the town has not purported either to itself establish an aqueduct, with the incidents of taxation, tariffs, etc., nor to transfer such powers to the respondent, but has simply authorized the use of the streets. See 42 & 43 Vict., (Q.) ch. 51 sec. 22. There is in law no essential difference between by-laws and resolutions, except in respect of the publication and notices. The public have had full notice by the performance of the works authorized, and the written application and resolution taken together constitute a valid contract binding on the parties. Lequin v. Meigs ([2]); In re Day and The Town Council of Guelph ([3]); Tylee v. Municipality of Waterloo ([4]); Fisher v. Municipality of Vaughan ([5]).; Angell on Highways 2 ed. \u00a7 25.\nThe appellant has no interest in the lands upon which the respondent was constructing the works complained of as they had never been dedicated to public uses. Mingerand v. L\u00e9gar\u00e9 ([6]); Guy v. The City; of Montreal ([7]); Fortin v. Truchon ([8]); St. Martin v Cantin ([9]).\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is an action instituted in the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec, in the district of Chicoutimi, by the appellants as petitioners on a petition for a writ of injunction to be issued under the provisions of sections 1033 et seq. C. C. P.\nThe petitioners alleged in their petition that there were in the town of Chicoutimi divers streets of which the petitioners were in legal possession for the use of the public, especially a street extending from Tach\u00e9 street to a place situate between numbers 736, 737 and 738 of the official cadastre of the town and extending to the bank of the River Chicoutimi, passing over numbers 772 and 774;\nThat for several days the respondent had caused and was still causing and intended still further to cause divers excavations and other works to be made in the streets of the said town, especially in the aforesaid street and in the streets called \" Caron,\" \" Belleau ' and \"Tach\u00e9\" of such a nature as to obstruct and damage the said streets to the great injury and nuisance of the public in general without the permission of the petitioners;\nThat it was urgently necessary that a writ of in junction should be instantly ordered to issue before more considerable works should be executed, and that if not instantly issued the town and the public would suffer great injury. The conclusions of the petition were for a writ of injunction to issue enjoining the defendant to cease and to suspend all works, excavations etc., in the said streets, and that by final judgment to be rendered upon the said petition the injunction should be made perpetual.\nThe Superior Court in the District of Chicoutimi granted an interim injunction in accordance with the prayer of the petition, whereupon the defendant pleaded to the merits by peremptory exception among other pleas as follows: That at an ordinary session of the council of the petitioners held upon the 9th day of October, 1890, a resolution was adopted by the said council granting permission to the defendant to construct an aqueduct in the town of Chicoutimi, and to place pipes in the streets of the said town at such places as he should judge to be most beneficial according to certain conditions which appear in the said resolution; that conformably to this resolution the defendant constructed an aqueduct in the town in the year 1891, and in every respect in so doing complied with the said resolution, which the council of the petitioners has never revoked nor annulled;\nThat in executing repairs to his aqueduct which the petitioners wish to prevent the defendant making, he does not exceed the powers granted to him by the said resolution, and that in executing the works aforesaid he does not cause any injury whatever to the petitioners;\nThat the petition is filed maliciously and for the purpose of ruining the defendant by depriving him of the. enjoyment of his aqueduct;\nThat the council of the petitioners, knowing that it had given permission to the defendant to construct an aqueduct in the town, and that the said aqueduct was in operation in the said town, subsequently, that is to say, in the year 1895, granted to a rival company the privilege of supplying water to the ratepayers of the town in whose interest the petitioners wish now to take away the rights granted to the defendant; and finally that the defendant does not cause any damage to the streets of the petitioners.\nTo this defence the plaintiff replied among other things as follows:\n1. That no valid permission was granted by the council of the town to the defendant. 2. That the defendant constructed his aqueduct without right and without any permission from the town.\n3. That the council had no right to grant such permission by resolution as it did, and that the said resolution is void and ultra vires. .\n4. That the resolution granting such pretended per mission is null on its face. (There are stated objections to the resolution founded upon alleged non compliance by the council itself with sections 4295 and 4304, R. S. Q.)\n5. That the defendant has not fulfilled any of the obligations that he had agreed to fulfil by his petition to the council, and especially that he has not finished his works in the year 1892 as he had undertaken to do, and that they are not yet completed.\nThat his aqueduct works badly and does not work in all the wards of the town that he had agreed upon; and finally,\nThat the aqueduct is really a nuisance and an obstruction to the town of Chicoutimi.\nIssue having been joined on the above pleadings, the Superior Court rendered judgment in favour of the petitioners and thereby made permanent the interim injunction which had been granted.\nThis judgment has been reversed by the Court of Queen's Bench in the district of Quebec in appeal, whereby rendering the judgment which the Superior Court should have rendered, the Court of Appeal has maintained the pleadings of the then appellant, the now respondent, and rejects the petitioners' demand for an injunction for the considerants following:\n1.That the resolution authorizing the appellant (the now respondent) to use the streets of the town of Chicoutimi to construct there an aqueduct, was intra vires of the town council.\n2. Considering that the works authorized by the said resolution have been done during the years 1891 and 1892, in the sight of and with the knowledge of the municipal councilors and of the ratepayers of the town without any objection in fact made, and considering that the appellant (the now respondent), has ever since distributed water the town.\n3. Considering that the works of which complaint is made do not constitute an addition to the aqueduct of the appellant (the now respondent), but were necessary to its preservation and to the exercise of the rights acquired in virtue of the said resolution and of its execution.\n4.Considering that the appellant (the now respondent) has not done any injury to the respondent (the now appellant), and has done no damage in executing the works which are the subject of the litigation, but on the contrary the works benefit a portion of the ratepayers.\n5. Considering that it has not been established that the appellant (the now respondent), has employed any unlawful means or com mitted any nuisance; and\n6. Considering that in the circumstances of the case the petitioners had not the right to demand the suppression of the works by injunction.\nWithout adopting all of the reasons for the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench in appeal, but those only which are given in the 4th and 6th of the above considerants, and for another reason not specified in the judgment, but which I think sufficiently appears in the case, the appeal must, in my opinion, be dismissed upon the authority of the Attorney General v. The Sheffield Gas Consumers Co. ([10]) and the principles upon which the judgment in that case proceeded\nThe case presented on the record by the petitioners in the present case is plainly one in which the Municipal Corporation of the Town of Chicoutimi seek redress by writ of injunction wholly upon the ground that the acts of the defendant which are sought to be restrained constitute a public nuisance, an obstruction to the detriment of the general public in certain of the streets in the town which are in the possession of and under the control of the municipal corporation.\nIt might be and I think would be a question calling for further inquiry whether some of the places where the nuisances and obstructions are alleged to have been committed are really, in point of fact, in streets in possession of and under the control of the corporation if the determination of that question was essential to the determination of the present case, but as I think. it is not I assume for the purpose of this appeal that all the places where the nuisances and obstructions complained of as having been, or being, or being in tended to be, committed were in streets under the control of the municipality.\nIn the City of Vancouver v. Canadian Pacific Rail way Co. ([11]) where the complaint was in respect of acts charged as instituting a public nuisance, we held, in a case where the soil and freehold in the streets were by statute vested in the municipal corporation, that the corporation, that is to, say, the inhabitants of the city in their corporate capacity, had no greater or other right of action to complain of a public nuisance committed in the streets than any individual member of the public having occasion to use the streets, and that in such a case of nuisance the public right must be maintained, defended and protected by the Attorney General for the Crown. Now in the Attorney General v. Tue Sheffield Gas Consumers Co. ([12]), the proceeding was by information and bill, at the suit of the Attorney General representing the public interests and of a company called \" The Sheffield United. Gas Light Company' who complained that their private rights were prejudiced by the acts of the defendants which were complained of.\nIt was there held that an application for an injunction founded upon a trivial or temporary injury whether in the nature of a public nuisance or of a private trespass could not be entertained by the courts. Here we have to deal only with the interest of the public in a case of alleged public nuisance. Dealing with this part of the case in the Attorney General v. The Sheffield Ges Co. ([13]), Lord Justice Turner says:\nLooking at the principles on which this court interferes there cannot be any sound distinction between the case of a private and the case of a public nuisance. It is not on the ground of any criminal offence committed or for the purpose of giving a better remedy in such cases that this court is} or can be called upon to interfere, but it is on the ground of injury to property that the jurisdiction of this court may rest, and taking it to be on the ground of injury to property the only distinction which seems to me to exist between a public and a private nuisance is this, that in the case of the one it is injury to individual property, and in the other to the property of the public at large. The same principle therefore must guide the interference of the court in both cases, and that principle is this\u2014whether the extent of the damage and of the injury be such as that the law will not afford an adequate and sufficient remedy, and that principle applies to the present case.\nThe learned judge then taking up the alleged injury to the public, represented in that case by the Attorney General, proceeds thus:\nThe injury to the public arises from their interest in the streets of Sheffield, and it is said that these streets will be materially impeded by the laying down of the pipes of this company, and by the continual taking up of those pipes which will be necessary for repairing them when once they have been laid down. As to the laying down of the pipes that is a case of mere temporary inconvenience, for when the pipes are laid down the work which has been done is entirely completed, it is done once for all, and if this court is to interfere on the ground that it will be an inconvenience arising from the laying down of those pipes which will occasion a temporary obstruction for two or three days, I am a loss to see how the interference of this court could be withheld in the case (which has been put in the course of the argument) of boards erected in the public streets where houses are under repair, or in the case of making cellars in the public streets, or in the case of obstructing the pavement of the public streets by de positing goods on them. All these are nuisances in a greater or less degree, and if the court is to interfere on the ground that the pavement of the streets of Sheffield will be taken up for two days for the purpose of laying down pipes, the court, it seems to me, will be equally bound to interfere in the cases to which I have referred. And with reference to what has been said as to the continual taking up of the pavement which would be consequent on these pipes being laid down, it is true that there may be and probably will be, some inconvenience resulting from that, but it is an inconvenience which will not affect the general body of the inhabitants of Sheffield; it is an inconvenience which occurs. from time to time to a much less degree than is anticipated by the parties, and which will be temporary, applying only to a particular part of the town, not affecting the general body of the inhabitants to any extent which will render it inconvenient.\nAgain he says:\nIt is evident, from the defendants, that there are many of the parties inhabitants of Sheffield who would be and are no doubt willing and desirous that these pipes should be laid down before their houses, although others might be desirous that it should not be done. It cannot therefore be brought in as a common injury to all. Now some thing has been said of the danger of the public peace which may arise from the non-interference of this court, but I think that this court cannot suppose that there is an inadequacy of the civil power to pre serve the public peace.\nAnd the learned Lord Justice concludes by pronouncing that in his judgment the case failed in so far as the public was concerned, and being of the same opinion as to the private demand of the Sheffield united Gras Light Company, he came to the conclusion that both the information and the bill should be dismissed. Lord Chancellor Cranworth entirely concurred in the judgment of Lord Justice Turner upon the question whether or not such a probability of substantial injury to the rights of the public passing along the streets of Sheffield, or the inhabitants using those streets, had been made out as to make it a reasonable exercise of jurisdiction for the court to interfere to restrain them, he was of opinion that no such case had been made out. \"Is,\" he says,\n\u201cthe evil of such a nature as to justify the court in interfering? What is the evil? It is said that the defendants are about to tear up the streets to an extent one representing seventy, the other one hundred miles. It may be that before they complete their works they will have taken up the paving over seventy miles, but they will nevar have up above twenty yards at the same time, and they will never have that up, they say, for above two days.\nThen again he says:\nOne must look at the quantum of evil at each particular place and each particular moment of time to see if this injunction could be sustained on the ground that there is continuity in the sense of going from one place to another to extend over one or the next two years. I do not see that that is a ground for interfering.\nThen upon the question whether the act of the defendants which was the subject of complaint, namely, taking up the pavement, was lawful or unlawful, he says:\nIf it is unlawful I think it is too small a degree of unlawfulness to war rant this court's interference by injunction,\nand in conclusion he says that if he thought the question of the right to an injunction turned upon the question of the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the acts of the defendants in taking up the pavement in the streets he would probably have wished the matter to stand over until the trial of the indictment, but adds:\nnot thinking so but thinking the evil, if any, which does exit is of such a very transient nature that in no one spot, or to no one individual can it be said to be more than a passing and almost imaginary evil, I am of opinion that no case is made out for restraining these parties,\nand he concluded by concurring with Lord Justice Turner that both bill and information ought to be dismissed. Every word in this judgment is applicable to the present case which in so far as the rights of the public in the case of an alleged public nuisance are concerned, is identical with the Attorney General v. The Sheffield Gas Co. ([14]), save only in this, that in that case the public were represented by the Attorney General, the proper officer of the Crown in that behalf, while in the present case they are not. The jurisdiction of the courts in the Province of Quebec proceeding by writ of injunction was introduced into that province by R. S. Q., art. 1033a, et seq., and there is nothing in these sections which would justify a different judgment from that warranted by the law of England in a like case. The second paragraph of that section has no bearing whatever upon the case of a public nuisance of the nature of the obstruction of a public highway to the prejudice of the rights of the public to the use and enjoyment thereof. It relates wholly to private property and corresponds with the law of England from which no doubt it is taken, and which for the protection of such property interferes when, and only when, absolutely necessary by reason of there being, if there be, no adequate remedy open in law to give relief. The petitioners in the present case make no claim whatever for relief founded upon this subsection. They make no pretension to any right to interfere except upon the contention that the streets in the town are placed for the public benefit and for the public use under the control of the municipality subject to the obligation to keep them in repair. Their contention is expressly that art. 4458 and the following articles of R. S. Q. confer no more extensive powers than were originally conferred by the Imperial statutes 36 and 39 Geo. Ill, upon the Quarter Sessions and Justices of the Peace, and they appeal to the art. 4616 whereby\nthe right to use as public highways all roads, streets and public high ways within the limits of any city or town in this province\nis vested in the respective municipal corporations subject to the obligation to keep them in proper repair, as the article which defines the right of the corporation as affects the streets in the municipality.\nNow we have seen by the judgment in the Attorney General v. The Sheffield Gas Co. ([15]) that by the law of England the writ of injunction cannot he used for the purpose of abating or preventing the commission of a criminal offence of the nature of a public nuisance by the obstruction of a public highway. In so far as relates to the pipes which had been already laid down by the respondent when the appellants filed their petition for an injunction the language of Lord Justice Turner above quoted is peculiarly applicable wherein he says\nas to laying down the pipes that is a case of temporary inconvenience, for when the pipes are laid down, the work which has been done is entirely completed.\nMoreover, it is apparent in the present case that no injury to the public has arisen, nor is it suggested that any such could arise by reason merely of the fact of those pipes being suffered to remain in the ground without more. What the true grievance complained of is, that if the work contemplated by the defendant should be completed it would enable water to be conveyed through the pipes to the prejudice, not of the general public interference with whose rights is alleged in the record to be the sole foundation of the application for an injunction, but to the prejudice merely of the private interests of the waterworks company to whom the municipal corporation have by by law granted recently the privilege of laying pipes in the streets for the purpose of supplying the ratepayers of the town with water, in which company, as is alleged, the mayor and other members of the municipal council which has instituted the present proceeding are the principal shareholders, in whose interests and not in the public interest, the application is said to be made. Now whether this interest of the mayor and others of the council be so or be not, there is sufficient evidence upon the record to warrant the conclusion that this proceeding was instituted, not in the interest of the general public, or for the abatement of any real public nuisance by way of obstruction in the use of the streets by the public by reason of the works complained of, but in reality in the private interest of the said waterworks company, and by reason of the detriment which might accrue to that company in the event of the respondent completing his contemplated works so as to enable water to be passed through his pipes when laid. Now if the respondent should be indicted as for a public nuisance in respect of the respondent's works so far as executed by the pipes already laid down, and if the jury trying such indictment should be of opinion that this was the motive for the institution of the prose caution, and if they should be of opinion that no real inconvenience to the general public had been caused by the pipes so laid down, or if they should be of opinion (notwithstanding that the corporation may be right in their contention that the resolution of October, 1890, was and is absolutely void and ultra vires by reason as is contended of the municipal council not having complied, as they ought to have done with the clause of the Act, (the non-compliance with which made the resolution void and ultra vires) that the respondent in doing what is now complained of was acting upon the assumption that the municipal council had complied with all the requirements necessary to make their resolution valid, I cannot say that the jury might not in any of such cases reason ably and very probably acquit the respondent of the offence charged in the indictment; and certainly there is nothing alleged on the record, or adduced in evidence which would justify a court of justice in de priving the respondent of his constitutional right of having the question of his guilt or innocence of such offence, if an indictment should be found, tried by a jury of his country.\nIndependently of this remedy by indictment for a public nuisance committed in the public streets, it cannot be doubted that the municipal corporation have ample power, if they think fit, to take up the pipes already laid down in the streets if the act of the defendant in placing them there be, as is alleged by the petitioners, absolutely without any right or authority whatever, and that they have such possession of the streets by force of the sections of the statute which places them under the control of the municipal corporation as gives to the municipal authorities most ample power to avail themselves of the provisions of section 53 of the Criminal Code, 55 & 56 Vict. ch 29, and so to prevent the committal of any trespass whatever by any person in the public streets, and so to compel the respondent to take what steps he should be advised to assert title to do the acts under the resolution of 1890, as to which, however, I express no opinion, as I think it unnecessary for the determination of the present case. Now, the case of the petitioners being that everything already done by the respondent has been done, and everything still being done and intended to be done by him in the premises is without the license and permission of the municipality, and without any right, power or authority in law whatever, it is apparent upon the case as presented by the petitioners themselves that they have most ample powers without any intervention by the court by way of injunction to obtain all that is necessary to redress a nuisance already committed in the public streets under their control, and to prevent any being committed.\nThe application for a writ of injunction in a case such as the present is alleged by the petitioners to be, is not only without precedent, but wholly unnecessary, and vexatious, as instituted professedly in the interest of the general public, but in reality in the interest of a private company who alone could be prejudiced by the acts of the respondent. For these reasons, which include those mentioned in the 4th and 6th consid\u00e9rants of the Court of Queen's Bench in Appeal, I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nGIROUARD J.__Le 9 octobre 1890, le Conseil de la ville de Chicoutimi adoptait la r\u00e9solution suivante en r\u00e9sponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9 pour permission de construire un aqueduc dans la ville de Chicoutimi:\nPropos\u00e9 par F.

Il manquait d'eau durant les mois de s\u00e9cheresse; faute d'une pression suffisante, il n'\u00e9tait d'aucune utilit\u00e9 dans les cas d'incendie, et enfin ii ne servait que deux quartiers de Ia ville, l'ouest et le centre, laissant sans eau le quartier est, le plus important de la ville.\nAussi, d\u00e9s l'ann\u00e9e 1895, une compagnie fut form\u00e9e par les citoyens, au capital de $50,000, dans le but de fournir sous le contr\u00f4le de l'autorit\u00e9 municipale, toute l'eau dont la ville avait besoin. Le plan soumis par cette compagnie, qui s'appela \" La Cie municipale des eaux de Chicoutimi \", fut approuv\u00e9 le 14 mai 1895 par le conseil de ville, qui passa un r\u00e8glement \u00e0 cet effet, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de l'article 4485 et suivants des Statuts R\u00e9vis\u00e9s de Qu\u00e9bec.\nL\u00e9gar\u00e9, se voyant en pr\u00e9sence d'une compagnie rivale puissante, ne tarda pas \u00e0 se mettre en frais de perfectionner son aqueduc; mais ii se vit de suite en face d'embarrss nouveaux, vu que les cessionnaires de certains propri\u00e9taires qui lui avaient permis verbalement de mettre son principal conduit de Ia rivi\u00e8re Chicoutimi sur leurs terrains lui refus\u00e9rent la continuation de la servitude et coup\u00e8rent m\u00e9me son conduit. Il fallut le placer ailleurs, et faire un nouveau trac\u00e9, et en m\u00e9me temps ii se pr\u00e9para \u00e0 perfectionner son aqueduc en cons truisant un r\u00e9servoir pr\u00e9s de la rue Tach\u00e9. Des nou velles excavations sur les rues de la ville, entr'autres sur cette rue et une autre voie publique, appel\u00e9e \" Cran Chaud,\" devinrent n\u00e9cessaires, et ii les commen\u00e7a, sans demander de permission nouvelle.\nLa ville de Chicoutimi demanda contre Legar\u00e9 un bref d'injonction, qui fut accord\u00e9 et maintenu par la cour Sup\u00e9rieure du district, pour trois raisons. i L'assembl\u00e9e du Conseil du 9 octobre 1890 a \u00e9t\u00e9 irr\u00e9gu li\u00e8rement convoqu\u00e9e; 2 Le Conseil ne pouvait accorder \u00e0 L\u00e9gar\u00e9 le privil\u00e8ge qu'il demandait que par r\u00e9glement conform\u00e9ment aux articles 4485 et suivants des Statuts Revis\u00e9s et non par une simple resolution; 3 Enfin les nouveaux travaux n'\u00e9taient pas de simples r\u00e9parations, mais de nouveaux travaux et m\u00e9me une extension et une v\u00e9ritable addition, qui auraient d\u00fb \u00e9tre faits en 1892. Ce dernier moyen est motiv\u00e9 comme suit:__\n\"Consid\u00e9rant, d'ailleurs, qu'en supposant que Ia resolution susdite et le dit consentement tacite eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 valables et l\u00e9gaux cette r\u00e9solution qui imposait comme condition que l'aqueduc f\u00fbt termin\u00e9 en mil huit cent quatre-vingt-douze et ce consentement tacite qui ne .s'appliquait, qu'aux travaux alors faits auraient bien autoris\u00e9 le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e0 faire \u00e0 son aqueduc les reparations ordinaires et n\u00e9cessaires, mais ne l'auraient certainement pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 changer, comme il l'a fait, le point de depart et le trac\u00e9 de son aqueduc et \u00e0 enlever ses travaux d'une rue pour les poser dans une autre rue, ou m\u00eame dans un autre endroit de la m\u00eame rue sans le consentement et l'autorisation du conseil. \"\nLa cour d'Appel a renvers\u00e9 ce jugement. Je crois qu'elle a fait erreur. Sans me prononcer sur les deux premiers moyens, les nouveaux travaux, m\u00eame s'ils n'\u00e9taient pas une extension, n'\u00e9taient certainement pas de simples reparations; ils faisaient partie des travaux que la resolution du 9 octobre 1890 avaient en vue et ils auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre faits et termines en 1892. Il falIait une nouvelle permission du Conseil pour les faire apr\u00e8s cette date. Il me semble enfin que les nouveaux travaux dans la ville de Chicoutimi, et en particulier ceux sur la rue Tach\u00e9 et le \"Cran-Chaud\", \u00e9taient une extension et une addition \u00e0 l'aqueduc. Il ne s'agit pas-de savoir Si l'intim\u00e9 a commis une nuisance sur les rues de la ville, mais simplement s'il s'est conform\u00e9 en tous points aux termes de la resolution du Conseil qui forme la convention entre les parties. Par la section 5991, par. 1033a, il y a lieu \u00e0 l'\u00e9mission du bref d'injonction enjoignant de suspendre toute construction,. \"lorsqu'une personne fait une chose en violation d'un contrat \u00e9crit ou d'une convention \u00e9crite.\u201d\nJe suis donc d'avis d'infirmer le jugement de la cour d'Appel avec d\u00e9pens et de r\u00e9tabllr celui de la cour Sup\u00e9rieure, mais uniquement pour le motif signal\u00e9 plus haut.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: L.

By a codicil in 1890 he appointed a nephew as his testamentary executor in the place of the uncle, who had died, and declared:\u2014\"II sera de plus l'administrateur de mes dits biens jusqu'au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de mes deux s\u0153urs usufruiti\u00e8res, nomm\u00e9es dans mon dit testament, et jusqu'au partage d\u00e9finitif de mes biens entre mes h\u00e9ritiers propri\u00e9taires, et il aura les pouvoirs qu'avait le dit Pierre Dupras dans mon dit testamentt.\"\nHeld, Gwynne J. dissenting, that the testamentary dispositions thus made did not create a substitution, but constituted merely a devise of the usufruct by the testator to his two sisters and of the estate, (subject to the usufruct), to their children, which took effect at the death of the testator.\nHeld also, that the charge of preserving the estate\u2014\"conserver le fonds\" imposed upon the testamentary executor could not be construed as imposing the same obligation upon the sisters who were excluded from the administration, or as having, by that term, given them the property subject to the charge that they should hand it over to the children at their decease, or as being a modification of the preceding clause of the will by which the property was devised to the children directly, subject to the usufruct. Held further, that the property thus devised was subject to partition between the children per capita and not per stirpes.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]) reversing the decision of the Superior Court which had maintained the plaintiff's action.\nThe facts and questions at issue sufficiently appear from the head note and judgments reported. It may be added, however, that when the usufruct became extinct one of testator's sisters left nine children, one of whom is the respondent, and the other sister left but one child, the appellant.\nRobidoux Q.C. for the appellant. A fiduciary substitution was created by the will in favour of both the sisters' children. (Arts. 925, 928 C. C.) The succession must be divided per stirpes and not per capita. Even if, instead of a substitution, a usufruct had been created, the result would be the same. Des\u00e8ve v. Des\u00e8ve ([2]); Chester v. Galt ([3]); Roy v. Gauvin ([4]); Thevenot-Dessaule, 63. The charge to deliver the property bequeathed to the children of the two sisters, joint legatees, is expressed plainly in the will, by the term \"conserver\" in the sentence \" et conserver le fonds pour leurs enfants.\"\nThree conditions are required for the existence of a substitution: 10. two donations; 20. tractus temporis; 30. ordo successionis. The two donations exist, first to his sisters, secondly, to their children. The tractus temporis is also found, for the will charges his sisters to deliver over to their children the property bequeathed. The children were not seized at the testator's death. The ordo successionis is equally evident; the children received from their mothers and are legatees, in virtue of a second gratification. The testator charges his sisters to deliver over the property to their children generally, not merely to children born at the time of his death.\nNo accretion took place, because none of the legatees died before the testator. There can be no accretion once the succession is opened.\nThe property bequeathed is to serve as an alimentary allowance. There is no accretion, in cases of legacies made to serve as alimentary allowance. 1 Pothier, p. 455, par. 149, art. 868 C. C.\nAccording to the terms of the will, no reciprocal substitution was intended. Th\u00e9venot-d'Essaulle, nos. 408 et 409. The requisites of reciprocal substitution are wanting, and we cannot presume reciprocal substitutions. Th\u00e9venot-d'Essaulle ([5]). Phillips v. Bain ([6]). The words \" partage definitif\" imply two partages, i. e., a provisional partage first and then a final one.\nThe word \" leurs \" in cases of substitutions, applied to the children, substitutes of several legatees, is to be construed as determining amongst the substitutes, a partition per stirpes and not per capita. See Th\u00e9venot d'Essaulle nos. 1003 & 1004, and Dumont v. Dumont ([7]).\nThe theory of partition, per stirpes prevails, unless the contrary intention is clear. It must be presumed that the testator wished the order of successions to be followed, as nothing appears to the contrary. In any case, whether the will created a substitution or a usufruct, the appellant as sole representative of her deceased mother (one of the testator's sisters) is entitled to the ownership of one-half of all the property bequeathed and enjoyed by her mother during her life time. See art. 433 C. C.\nA. Geoffrion for the respondent. The will creates merely a usufruct, and not a substitution, and even if it did create a substitution, the partition must, nevertheless, be made per capita, not per stirpes. In both his will and codicil, the testator used the words \"usufruct,\" \" usufructuary \" which creates this presumption, and it is supported by the fact that there is no tractus temporis.\nThe gift is not of the usufruct to his sisters, and, after their death, the ownership to their children, but the children take the ownership together, and consequently by equal shares at the same time as their mothers take the usufruct. See art. 868 C. C. Again, the word \" conserver \" is not at all characteristic of a substitution. On the contrary, it is the very word used by the Civil Code ([8]), in defining usufruct. Moreover, the obligation to keep the property for the children is not imposed upon the usufructuaries but upon the executor. Hence it is not a substitution but a trust imposed upon the latter in favour of the children who are the owners.\nThere is reciprocal substitution between the sisters of the testator; (art. 868 C. C.); and the testator has treated his two sisters and their children equally and as one mass (not as two independent roots), making one legacy and not two independent ones. This affords further presumption that the partition should be per capita. Moreover, the legacy to the children is made jointly There is therefore also accretion between them. (Art. 868 C. C.) There could not be accretion between them if the partition was per stirpes; but only accretion between the members of each stirpes. Finally the testator bequeathes his property to the children as \" incessible \" and \" insaisissable a titre d'aliments.\" He considers that he is giving them the necessaries of life. It must therefore be presumed that as the legacy was not to enrich them but only to give them what they needed, the property is intended to be divided among them equally. Joseph v. Castonguay([9]).\nGwynne J. (dissenting).\u2014This case turns wholly upon the construction of a clause in the will of one Joseph Rochon whereby he gave and bequeathed to his two sisters Exulp\u00e8re and Rosalie Rochon, the usufruct of all his property and the ownership thereof to their children. He then appointed Pierre Dupras his executor whom he authorized to realize the whole of his estate, and to invest the clear capital at interest in such a manner as he should think most advantageous and to give the revenue thereof to his said sisters, and to keep the capital for their children. He added that the above legacies were given. The executor named in the will having died the testator appointed another in his place by a codicil wherein he declared and directed that such person\nshall be moreover the administrator of my aforesaid property until the death of my two sisters the usufructuaries named in my said will, and until the final partition of my said property between my heirs in ownership, and he shall have the powers which the said Pierre Dupras had in my said will.\nThe sole question upon this will is whether the children of the testator's sisters took the ownership of the property devised to them per stirpes or per capita. If per stirpes the appellant is entitled to prevail, if per capita the respondent. I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed\nThe true construction of the will appears to me clearly to be that the executor held the property devised in trust for the testator's two sisters and their children respectively in equal moieties for their respective children as to the ownership in the capital, and for the sisters during their respective lives as to the revenues. Upon the death of one of testator's sisters, in the lifetime of the other, the children of the one so dying became entitled in possession to one moiety of the capital out of which their mother's life income issued the devise to the testator's sisters and \" their children,\" the former for life as to the income, and the latter as to the capital must be construed \" their respective children \" upon the authority of Arrow v. Mellish ([10]); Wills v. Wills ([11]); and in re Hutchinson's Trusts ([12]).\nI think there can be no doubt that this is the construction which should be put upon the will, and I am therefore of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment of the Superior Court restored.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nGirouard J.\u2014Cette cause soul\u00e8ve une question de substitution. Le 12 octobre 1852, Joseph Rochon fit son testament par lequel il dispose de la masse de sa succession comme suit:\u2014\nJe donne et l\u00e8gue \u00e0 mes deux s\u0153urs germaines, Exulp\u00e8re et Rosalie Rochon, l'usufruit de tous mes biens g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement quelconques, et la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d'iceux \u00e0 leurs enfants.\nJe nomme Pierre Dupras, mon oncle, mon ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire, lequel j'autorise \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser mes biens retirer mes cr\u00e9dits, payer mes dettes, vendre mes biens \u00e0 termes, le tout comme il le jugera a propos; enfin placer la masse liquide de ma succcession \u00e0 int\u00e9r\u00eat ou au trement, de la mani\u00e8re qu'il croira le plus avantageux, pour en fournir les revenus a mes dites s\u0153urs usufruiti\u00e8res et conserver les fonds pour leurs enfants.\nJ'assigne les legs ci-dessus \u00e0 mes l\u00e9gataires, \u00e0 titre d'aliments, ainsi les biens l\u00e9gu\u00e9s seront incessibles et insaisissabes.\nPar un codicile en date du 12 avril 1890, le testateur d\u00e9clara:\u2014\n4 Je nomme pour ex\u00e9cuter mon testament, au lieu et place de Pierre Dupras qui P\u00e9tait dans mon dit testament et qui est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, la personne de Maxime Dupras, mon neveu, cultivateur, de St-Henri de Mascouche. Il sera de plus l'administrateur de mes dits biens jus qu'au d\u00e9c\u00e8s de mes deux s\u0153urs usufruiti\u00e8res nomm\u00e9es dans mon dit testament et jusqu'au partage d\u00e9finitif de mes h\u00e9ritiers propri\u00e9taires, et ii aura les pouvoirs qu'avait le dit Pierre Dupras dans mon dit testament.\nLe testateur et ses deux s\u0153urs, Exulp\u00e8re et Rosalie \u00e9tant d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s, il s'agit de savoir si le partage des biens l\u00e9gu\u00e9s doit se faire entre les enfants par souches ou par t\u00eates; en d'autres termes, si le testament contient une substitution ou tout simplement donation d'usufruit \u00e0 ses deux s\u0153urs et de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 leurs enfants La cour Sup\u00e9rieure a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il y avait substitution, et que le partage devait se faire par souches et non par t\u00eates. La majorit\u00e9 de la cour d'Appel, compos\u00e9e de Boss\u00e9, Blanchet, Hall et W\u00fcrtele JJ. a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le con traire, le juge en chef, Lacosle, dissident. Le jugement de la cour est ainsi motiv\u00e9:\u2014 ([13])\nConsid\u00e9rant que cette disposition ne comporte pas une substitution, ou deux lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9s successives prenant effet l'une apr\u00e9s l'autre, mais constitue seulement un legs d'usufruit par le testateur \u00e0 ses s\u0153urs et un legs de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 (sujet \u00e0 cet usufruit) \u00e0 leurs enfants, qui tous deux ont pris effet \u00e0 son d\u00e9c\u00e8s, et qu'en chargeant son ex\u00e9cuteur testamentaire de conserver le fonds pour les enfants, devoir qui lui \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 prescrit par la loi, le testateur ne peut pas \u00eatre pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 avoir impos\u00e9 la m\u00eame obligation \u00e0 ses s\u0153urs exclues de l'administration des dits biens et leur en avoir ainsi remis et donn\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 a la charge do la rendre elles-m\u00eames \u00e0 leurs enfants, \u00e0 leur d\u00e9c\u00e8s, et ne peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant une modification de Ia clause pr\u00e9c\u00e9 dente de son testament, par laquelle il l\u00e8gue directement aux enfants la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des dits biens, etc.\nCe motif est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 par M. le juge Blanchet dans une opinion claire et concise, \u00e0 laquelle je n'h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 donner mon adh\u00e9sion.

S. N. S. 5 ser. c. 7\u201452 V. c. 23 (N.S.)\nBy R. S. N. S. 5 ser. ch. 7, the lessee of mining areas in Nova Scotia was obliged to perform a certain amount of work thereon each year on pain of forfeiture of his lease which, however, could only be effected through certain formalities. By an amendment in 1889 (52 Vic. ch. 23), the lessee is permitted to pay in advance an annual rental in lieu of work, and by subsec. (c) the owner of any leased area may, by duplicate agreement in writing with the Commissioner of Mines, avail himself of the provisions of such annual payment and \"such advance payments shall be construed to commence from the nearest recurring anniversary of the date of the lease.\" By sec. 7 all leases are to contain the provisions of the Act respecting payment of rental and its refund in certain cases, and by sec. 8 said sec. 7 was to come into force in two months after the passing of the Act.\nBefore the Act of 1889 was passed a lease was issued to E. dated June 10th, 1889, for twenty-one years from May 21st, 1889. On June 1st, 1891, a rental agreement under the amending Act was executed under which E. paid the rent for his mining areas for three years, the last payment being in May, 1893. On May 22nd, 1894, the commissioner declared the lease forfeited for non-payment of rent for the following year and issued a prospecting license to T. for the same areas. E. tendered the year's rent on June 9th, 1894, and an action was afterwards taken by the Attorney General, on relation of E., to set aside said license as having been illegally and improvidently granted.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in such action, that the phrase \"nearest recurring anniversary of the date of the lease\" in subsec. (c) of sec. 1, Act of 1889, is equivalent to \"next or next ensuing anniversary,\" and the lease being dated on June 10th no rent for 1894 was due on May 22nd of that year at which date the lease was declared forfeited, and E.'s tender on June 9th was in time. Attorney General v. Sheraton (28 N. S. Rep. 492) approved and followed.\nHeld, further, that though the amending Act provided for forfeiture without prior formalities of a lease in case of non-payment of rent, such provision did not apply to leases existing when the Act was passed in cases where the holders executed the agreement to pay rent thereunder in lieu of work. The forfeiture of E.'s lease was, therefore, void for want of the formalities prescribed by the original Act.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the Crown.\nThe facts of the case and statutes governing it are sufficiently set out in the above head-note, and in the judgment of Mr. Justice Sedgewick.\nW. B. A. Ritchie Q.C. and Congdon for the appellants referred to Oilman v. Crowly[1]; Attorney General v. The Ironmongers Co.[2]; and Farnsworth v. Minnesota and Pacific Railroad Co.[3].\nRussell Q.C. and Covert for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion, concurring in that respect in the judgment of Mr. Justice Townshend, that the words \"date of the lease,\" in subsection c are to have their primary meaning, namely, the date of the instrument by which the demise or grant was made; this being so, the 10th of June is to be taken as the date referred to by the statute, and therefore the tender on the 9th of June, 1894, was a good tender in due time which prevented forfeiture.\nFor this reason the appeal should be dismissed, and the first judgment upheld. GWYNNE J.\u2014I concur in the judgment of Mr. Justice Sedgewick.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014On the 21st of May, 1889, the relator, Robert D. Evans, applied to the Commissioner of Public Works and Mines for the province of Nova Scotia for a lease of twenty-six gold mining areas at Montague, county of Halifax. A lease in the form prescribed by chapter 7 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 5th series, was subsequently drawn up and was executed by the Commissioner of Mines on the 10th day of June, on which day the instrument was dated. On June 1st, 1891, the instrument, called by all the parties a rental agreement, was executed between the lessee Evans and the Commissioner of Works and Mines purporting to be in pursuance of the statute which had been passed on the 17th of April, 1889. Under this instrument the lessee paid rent for three years. On May 22nd, 1894, the Commissioner of Mines declared the lease forfeited for non-payment of rent under the rental agreement, and on the same day issued a prospecting license to the appellant Temple, of the same areas. In July, 1894, the prospecting license was transferred to the appellant Annand, who in the following month obtained a lease from the mines office of a portion of the areas and subsequently sold it to the appellant Logan.\nPrevious to the passing of chapter 23 of the Acts of 1889, the administration of the mines of the province was governed by chapter 7 of the Revised Statutes, 5th series. When a person desired to obtain a lease of mining areas he applied to the Commissioner of Public Works and Mines therefor, paying at the same time the statutory price. In the event of there being no dispute as to the person entitled, a lease in the form prescribed by the statute was issued in the usual course. Neither the statute nor the lease required that any money should be paid by way of rental for the leased premises after the first payment, but the lessee, in order to prevent a forfeiture, was obliged to do a certain amount of work each year upon the areas leased. In the event of failure to perform this work, and to make due returns, the lease was liable to be forfeited, but the forfeiture could take place only after certain provisions by way of notice and investigation were complied with. There had to be at least 30 days notice of a hearing before the commissioner who was required to investigate and decide as to whether or not, as a matter of fact, the lease had been forfeited by reason of non-performance of work on the part of the lessee. The object of the amending Act of 1889 was mainly twofold. 1st. To give to the lessee the option of paying an annual rental for the areas leased instead of compelling him to do work upon the ground; and secondly, to enable the Commissioner of Mines to declare as forfeited without notice, preliminary proceedings, or an investigation of any kind, any areas in respect of which the annual rental had not been paid.\nThe lease in question was issued after the passing of this Act, but it did not contain these new provisions in regard to rental and forfeiture, section 7 having provided that \"all leases of mines of gold and of gold and silver, and of mines other than mines of gold and gold and silver, shall contain the provisions respecting the payment of rental and its refund under certain conditions, as provided herein;\" and section 8 providing that \"the preceding section of this Act (section 7) shall come in force two months after the date of the passage of this Act.\" It is, I think, admitted by all parties that by reason of these two sections the lease in question herein must be dealt with as if it had been issued prior to the passing of the amending Act; and the principal question, although there are others, is as to the last subsection of section 1, which is as follows:\nIt shall he lawful for the owner of any leased area, by duplicate agreement in writing with the commissioner, to avail himself of the provisions of this Act so far as relates to the annual payment in advance and the refund thereof, and such advance payments shall be construed to commence from the nearest recurring anniversary of the date of the lease.\nAs I have said, on the 1st of June, 1891, the rental agreement was entered into by which it was provided that the lease in question should become subject to the provisions of section 1, of ch. 23 of the Acts of 1889, including the subsection just set out, the lessee agreeing to pay the annual rental of 50 cents per area payable as therein provided.\nThe action to set aside the lease under which the appellants claim as having been illegally and improvidently granted, was brought by the Attorney General upon the relation of the original lessee. At the trial, Mr. Justice Townshend, the trial judge, decided in favour of the Crown. Upon appeal this judgment was unanimously sustained. We are of opinion that the judgment of the court below should be affirmed, upon several grounds.\n(1.) We are of opinion that the phrase \"nearest recurring anniversary of the date of the lease\" in subsection (c), is equivalent to the phrase \"next, or next ensuing anniversary,\" as was unanimously held by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in the case of The Attorney General v. Sheraton,[4] and in our view the judgment of Mr. Justice Graham in that case is unanswerable, and it would be useless to repeat what he has so well said in regard to the proper construction of that phrase. If that judgment be right then at the time of the declaration of the forfeiture on the 21st of May, 1894, no rent was due, there having been three payments of rent, the first on the 21st of May, 1891, which under the construction as above would be applicable as rent from the 21st of May, 1892, the next ensuing anniversary of the date of the lease, so that the declaration of forfeiture and the issue thereunder of licenses or leases by reason of such alleged forfeiture would be altogether invalid.\n(2.) But there is, in my view, an equally strong reason why the alleged declaration of forfeiture was invalid. I do not think that subsection (c) imposes any additional burden in the matter of forfeiture upon a lessee who desires to avail himself of its benefits. It is clear under subsection (a) that in the case of a lease issued after the Act came into force forfeiture accrues without any further proceedings in the event of the annual rental not being paid, but it seems to me equally clear that that result does not happen in the case of then existing lease-holders who subsequently might enter into an agreement for the payment of an annual rental in order to escape the obligation of performing a specified amount of work upon the ground. Nowhere is it provided that in that case mere nonpayment of the annual rental ipso facto works a forfeiture. It seems equally clear to me that the provision prescribed by the above Act in regard to forfeiture must in such a case be complied with. No such proceedings having been taken in this case the forfeiture is void.\n(3.) There is yet another ground upon which, in my view, the judgment of the court below may be supported. I have above set out sections 7 and 8 of the amending Act. Section 1 of the Act had authorized a change in the tenure on the part of lessees of mines. Section 7 had provided that these provisions should be especially incorporated in the leases subsequently issued, and then section 8 prescribes that that provision should not come into force for two months. Bearing in mind that we must give, where we possibly can, some meaning to every expression of legislative intent, and that it is only in case of absolute need where we are permitted to treat statutory expressions as absolutely meaningless, we must endeavour to give a meaning, if possible, to section 8. The appellants contend that section 1 of the Act took effect upon the passing of the Act, and that all leases issued within the two months shall have the same effect as if they contained in terms the provisions of subsection (a), (b) and (c). In other words, as to leases issued within the two months those not containing these provisions should have the same effect as if they had been issued after the two months with such provisions. If that is the proper construction of section 8, it is, so far as I can see, without meaning. I think it has a meaning. There were at the time, doubtless, numbers ef unexecuted instruments in different parts of the country, some in England, others, many of them, in the United States, and the object of the legislature was, I think, to give a reasonable time for all of these inchoate instruments to be completed and brought back to the commissioners office for registry, and the intent, although perhaps inartificially expressed, was to provide that the Act should not at all apply to these leases, two months being sufficient time to notify the world of the change in the law.\nI do not think it necessary to discuss the question raised during the argument as to the date of the lease. In the view that we have taken it is not necessary to decide that point, not to refer to the question incidental to it as to the rights of the Attorney General as the dominus litis of these proceedings.\nIn my view the judgment below should be affirmed with costs.\nKING and GIROUARD J.L concurred.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant Temple: Fred.

C. Arts.221-225 C. C. P.\nA will, in favour of the husband of the testatrix, was set aside in an action by the heir at law and declared by the judgment to be un acte faux, and therefore to be null and of no effect. In a subsequent petitory action between the same parties:\nHeld, Girouard J. dissenting, that the judgment declaring the will faux was not evidence of admission of the title of the heir at law by reason of anything the devisee had done in respect of the will, first, because, the will having been annulled was for all purposes unavailable, and, secondly, because the declaration of faux, contained in the judgment, did not show any such admission.\nThe constructive admission of a fact resulting from a default to answer interrogatories upon articulated facts recorded under art. 225 C. C. P., cannot be invoked as a judicial admission in a subsequent action of a different nature between the same parties.\nStatements entered upon cadastral plans and official books of reference made by public officials and filed in the lands registration offices, in virtue of the provisions of the Civil Code of Lower Canada, do not in any way bind persons who were not cognizant thereof at the time the entries were made.\nWhere a deed entered into by the parties to a suit in order to effect a compromise of family disputes and prevent litigation failed to attain its end, and was annulled and set aside by order of the court as being in contravention of Article 311 of the Civil Code-of Lower Canada, no allegation contained in the deed so annulled could subsist even as an admission. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]) reversing the judgment of the Court of Review at Montreal ([2]), and restoring the decision of the Superior Court, district of Montreal (2), which dismissed the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe plaintiff brought a petitory action against his father and former tutor, the present respondent, to recover from him his share, as an heir at law of his mother, in certain real property in Montreal alleged to have formed part of her estate. The evidence shewed that there was apparently no existing title to the land, and no title deeds on file in the registry office. The plaintiff's mother was entered. as proprietor of the lots in question on the official plan and book of reference deposited in the registry office, under the provisions of the Civil Code in 1871, the only other entries affecting the property being two notices of renewal of registration of judgments against a supposed former owner. The defendant denied that his deceased wife, plaintiff's mother, ever had any title and claimed that the lots had been purchased by him thirty years previously with his own money and had ever since then remained in his possession as owner, that he was assessed for the property on the city valuation rolls and had paid the taxes on them ever since 1868.\nThe mother died on 24th November, 1874, and shortly afterwards the respondent caused to be pro bated an alleged will said to have been made by the deceased, very irregular in form and bearing upon its face evidence of having been made by the respondent himself. By this will all the property of the testatrix, including the lands in question in this cause, were devised to her husband, the respondent. On 19th May, 1875, respondent was appointed tutor to his three children.\nOn 28th February, 1889, the appellant and respond ent became parties to a deed in which it was declared that the appellant had a right as heir of his deceased mother to certain properties, including that now in dispute, which were then clear of all incumbrances and that his father, the respondent, had rendered full and satisfactory accounts of his administration as tutor. The deed then recited that the parties desired to put an end to all trouble, preserve amicable relations within the family and avoid litigation and, in consideration of the premises and a payment of $800 by the respondent, the appellant sold, granted and transferred all his rights and claims in and to the property as heir or otherwise to the respondent.\nIn an action brought by appellant in 1893 to set aside this deed defendant failed to appear, and it was annulled by the Superior Court as being a settlement between a minor, become of age, and his tutor, relating to his administration, without the rendering of ac counts in detail and delivery of vouchers as required by art. 311 C C.\nIn January, 1894, an action was brought by appellant in the Superior Court, at Montreal, in which it was alleged that the pretended will was made by respondent himself; that the alleged testatrix could not write; and praying that said will should be declared to be a forged or simulated document which had never been either dictated or signed by the pre tended testatrix, and the respondent again made default.\nInterrogatories on articulated facts were served upon the respondent in the latter case, amongst which were the following:\n\"Interrogatoire 4i\u00e8me\u2014N'est-il pas vrai que le pr\u00e9 tendu testament de la dite Dame Alphonsine Brunet, portant la date du onzi\u00e8me jour de novembre, mil huit cent soixante-quatorze et relat\u00e9 en la d\u00e9claration en cette cause, n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 ni dict\u00e9 ni sign\u00e9 par la dite Dame Alphonsine Brunet qui ne savait pas signer?\n\"Interrogatoire 5i\u00e8me \u2014N'est-il pas vrai que le dit testament a \u00e9t\u00e9 dict\u00e9 par le d\u00e9fendeur?\n\"Interrogatoire 6i\u00e8me\u2014N'est-il pas vrai qu'apr\u00e8s la mort de la dite Dame Alphonsine Brunet, le d\u00e9fendeur a tent\u00e9 de faire faire par un notaire, \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, un autre testament que celui-ci dont ii s'agit en cette cause?\"\nThe respondent did not answer these interrogatories and they were declared in consequence pro confessis, as provided by the Code of Civil Procedure ([3]), and a judgment was entered in the case which declared:\u2014\n\"Queue le dit pr\u00e9tendu testament du onze mai, mil huit cent soixante et quatorze, est un acte faux et est en cons\u00e9quence nul et de nul effet.\"\nThese facts were set forth in the declaration in the present case and the instruments above referred to were produced and relied upon by the plaintiff as evidence of admissions made by the respondent of the validity of the plaintiff's claims and as creating strong presumptions in his favour and against the title of respondent.\nRobidoux Q.C. for the appellant. There is no record of title. Neither party can produce title deeds. The possession of respondent has not been exclusively for himself, but is of uncertain and doubtful character. See Beaudry-Lacantinerie Trait\u00e9 des Biens, no. 251, 252.\nWe find the proof of appellant's part ownership in the fact that the respondent, by means of a forged will, .attempted to have the property bequeathed to him by his wife. Why should he have recourse to this forgery if he had already been owner? The forged will also clearly admits the wife's ownership. Proof of ownership by Alphonsine Brunet is also found in the deed of sale of the 27th February, 1889. Of the three immoveable properties which belonged to Alphonsine Brunet's children, lot 22 is the only one claimed by respondent. He admits that they are co-proprietors of the two other properties mentioned in the will. We have there the appellant's declaration, made in presence of the respondent, and signed by him, that the appellant has a title as an heir of his deceased mother, and that he sells all his rights to respondent in the property she died possessed of amongst which is the property in question. And further on in the same deed of sale we find words permitting the respondent, his heirs and representatives, to enter upon and possess the lot in question.\nIn the judgment which annulled the deed of sale we find the equivalent of a title in favour of appellant. By the rescission of the deed of sale they were both replaced, as to the property sold, in the same position as they were before the sale, the appellant, by the effect of that rescission, again becoming owner, and from the day of the judgment annulling the sale he could have made a valid sale to a purchaser in good faith.\nThe entry of the lot 22 on the book of reference, in the name of Alphonsine Brunet, constituted in her favour the presumption that she was the owner of the lot. Dal. Jurisp. Gen. Sup. Rep. \" Propri\u00e9t\u00e9,\" no. 326. Presumptions must follow from such mention on the cadastre. Martel v. Bory ([4]); Auclair v. Jamet ([5]); Ragon v. Beaujard ([6]). A deed may be cancelled, the obligation itself may be set aside, and still the recital in the deed makes complete proof of the facts mentioned therein, if the recital have a direct reference to the obligation itself. (Art. 1210 C. C.) Judicial admissions preserve their effect even after the instrument has been annulled. Admissions made in a compromise are effective, although the compromise may be a nullity ([7]). See Sewell, C.J. in Valli\u00e8res v. Roy ([8]), \" what is formally and distinctly admitted by an exception is evidence, though the exception be dismissed;\" and also Fuzier-Herman ([9]). See also Duc de Poix., p. 44, 2, 227. 2 Solon, Nullit\u00e9s, p. 8, no. 11 and following. 1 Aubry et Rau. p. 123. 1 Rolland de Villargues, \" Acte\" no. 148. In re, de Grandval ([10]); Beauveau v. Landanges ([11]); 5 Larombi\u00e8re, art. 1319, no. 9.\nThe admissions made in the deed of sale that the appellant is entitled to inherit from his mother; that he sells his interests in the lot no. 22, in his quality of heir; that he is in possession of the lot; that the respondent will take possession from the day of the sale, are clearly admissions which have a direct reference to the sale, and the dispositions of art. 1210 must be applied. The only appearance of \"transaction\" in the deed of sale would apply to the account to be rendered by the respondent as tutor to the appellant. There is no doubt expressed as to his rights. This sale is made avec garanties;\u2014warranty is only given by a party who is a proprietor, and who has a title.\nThis court cannot come to the help of respondent. His record leaves him charged with forging the will of his wife, procuring two witnesses who perjured themselves when the will was proved, and with having entrapped his son in a deed, in which he had him to falsely declare that he had been rendered an account and by this means to spoilate him of all he owned.\nA. Geoffrion for the respondent. The deed set up against the respondent was an agreement to quiet differences and claims disputed and doubtful, it was a \" transaction,\" and respondent had no interest to object to or deny what was entered there by those who drafted it. Now that it has failed to quiet these disputes, it cannot be contended that anything was then judicially admitted. Respondent is not estopped from contradicting what it alleges now that he has an interest in doing so; he had no such object at the time. Moreover this deed when annulled ceased to exist for all purposes and has, since it became a nullity, no effect as an admission or as creating a presumption in any manner. See Fuzier-Herman ([12]).\nAs to the will, the admissions are to the effect that respondent was actually owner of the disputed lots before the death of the testatrix and she only bequeaths other property belonging to her. It was an instrument declaratory of their individual rights executed between the husband and wife contrary to the provisions of the code forbidding contracts between con sorts. The constructive confession of facts by default to answer interrogatories, is not a direct admission; it is merely an incident in the suit and available in the particular suit only in which the default is recorded. The will was a nullity ab initio and was never relied upon in respect to the title now in question. It was set aside only on grounds of informality, at any rate, and is now a nullity and of no more effect than the annulled deed\nThe cadastral entry is evidently a mistake made by the officer who prepared it: it is not an instrument to which respondent was a party in any manner and he cannot be bound by anything entered either on the plan or book of reference in his absence and without his consent or approbation. The cadastre spoken of in the French cases cited is an entirely different affair from that in use in Quebec, consequently those decisions have no application in the present case.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014In my opinion this appeal fails, and that for the reasons given in the notes of Sir Alexandre Lacoste to which I adhere in every respect. The action is a petitory one brought by a son against his father. It was for the plaintiff to prove his title, which in my judgment he has failed to do. I cannot see that any constructive admission by reason of default in answering faits et articles in the action to set aside the will makes proof as an admission in the present action. Nor can I agree with Mr. Justice Boss\u00e9 that the judgment in that action declaring the will faux proves that the respondent admitted the plaintiff's title by reason of anything he did in respect of the will, first, because the will having been annulled is for all purposes unavailable, and secondly, because the declaration of faux contained in the judgment does not show any admission on the part of the respondent.\nAs regards the notarial deed of the 27th February, 1889, this was set aside as being in contravention of article 311 C. C., which declares null every agreement relating to the question of a tutorship which is not preceded by the rendering of an account by the tutor accompanied with the vouchers.\nMr. Justice Boss\u00e9 places much reliance on this deed as containing an admission on the part of the respond ent by reason of his having signed this \" acte,\" by which the appellant assumes to cede to the respondent tous ses droits d'h\u00e9r\u00e9dit\u00e9 qu'il a et peut avoir en sa dite qualit\u00e9 d'h\u00e9ritier de la dite Alphonsine Brunet sa mere dans et sur les lots de terre dont elle avait la posesssion lors de son d\u00e9c\u00e9s.\nOn the other hand, the learned Chief Justice Sir Alexandre Lacoste, from the enunciations of the deed contained in the following words,\nen cons\u00e9quence, pour mettre fin \u00e0 tous troubles, \u00e9viter des proc\u00e8s qui sont toujours ruineux dans ces cas, et pour l'h\u00e9ritier et pour le rendant compte, pour conserver l'amiti\u00e9 paternelle, et sa protection et les bons conseils comme homme probe,\nholds that the deed was not a veritable sale but a mere transaction, and that having been annulled by the judgment, nothing contained in it can subsist even as an admission.\nIn the first place I do not consider that the mere signing the deed even if it had not been set aside would have constituted an admission by the respondent of the truth of allegations introduced into it, not as made by the respondent himself, but by the notary whose acte it was, of statements made by the appellant exclusively. There is no such technical doctrine as that which prevails in the law of England as estoppel by deed to be found in the French law, and it is to be hoped that no such doctrine will ever be admitted into it. I agree, however, with Chief Justice Lacoste that the deed having been annulled has become a nullity, void, and inexisting for all purposes, just as much as if there had never been such a deed. Then the object of the deed was, as the Chief Justice holds, merely to effectuate a compromise of family disputes and to prevent litigation, and it would be unjust, now that it has failed to attain its end, for that purpose to twist its recitals into an admission by the respondent of the very claim which he had always denied and disputed, and which it was the. object of the parties\nby the deed itself to settle amicably. I see no admission in the deed. As to the cadastre, that in no way bound the respondent, inasmuch as it was the act of a third party of which he is not shown to have been cognizant. The cadastre here is, I find, a very different thing from a cadastre in France. The appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nGwynne J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed, for the reasons given by the learned Chief Justice Sir Alexander Lacoste, in the Court of Appeal, and for the reasons given in the judgment of the Superior Court of the province of Quebec. The now appellant, who was plaintiff in that court, gave no evidence sufficient in law to establish his contention that his mother was seized of the property which is the subject of the action and which the plaintiff claimed as her heir.\nSedgewick and King JJ. agreed that the appeal. should be dismissed.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014Il s'agit ici d'une action p\u00e9titoire intent\u00e9e par le fils, comme h\u00e9ritier de sa m\u00e8re s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens, contre son p\u00e8re.

Acc. Ins. Co. in favour of P. contained a provision that it might be renewed from year to year on payment of the annual premium. One condition of the policy was that it was not to take effect unless the premium was paid prior to any accident on account of which a claim should be made and another that a renewal receipt, to be valid, must be printed in office form, signed by the managing director and countersigned by the agent. p. having been killed in a railway accident payment on the policy was refused on the ground that it had expired and not been renewed. In an action by the widow for the insurance it was shown that the local agent of the city had requested p. to renew and had received from him a promissory note for $15 (the premium being $16) which the father of the assured swore the agent agreed to take for the balance of the premium after being paid the remainder in cash. He also swore that the agent gave p. a paper purporting to be a receipt and gave secondary evidence of its contents. The agent's evidence was that while the note was taken for a portion of the premium it was agreed between him and p. that there was to be no insurance until it was paid, and that he gave no renewal receipt and was paid no cash. Some four years before this the said agent and all agents of the company had received instructions from the head office not to take notes for premiums as had been the practice theretofore.\nThe note was never paid but remained in possession of the agent the company knowing nothing of it. The jury gave no general verdict but found in answer to questions that a sum was paid in cash and the note given and accepted as payment of the balance of the premium, and that the paper given to P. by the agent, as sworn to by P.'s father, was the ordinary renewal receipt of the company. Upon these findings judgment was entered against the company.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, Gwynne J. dissenting, that the fair conclusion from the evidence was, that as the agent had been employed to complete the contract and had been entrusted with the renewal receipt P. might fairly expect that he was authorized to take a premium note having no knowledge of any limitation of his authority and the policy not forbidding it; and that notwithstanding there was no general verdict, and the specific question had not been passed upon by the jury, such inference could be drawn by the court according to the practice in Nova Scotia.\nHeld further, that there was evidence upon which reasonable men might find as the jury did; that an inference might fairly be drawn from the facts that the transaction amounted to payment of the premium and it was to be assumed that the act was within the scope of the agent's employment; the fact that the agent was disobeying instructions did not prevent the inference though it might be considered in determining whether or not such inference should be drawn; and that a new trial should not be granted to enable the company to corroborate the testimony of the agent that he had no renewal receipt in his possession except one produced at the trial as the company might have supposed that the plaintiff would seek to show that such receipt had been obtained and were not taken by surprise.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia affirming the judgment for the plaintiff at the trial.\nThe material facts are sufficiently set out in the above head-note and more fully in the judgment of the majority of the court delivered by Mr. Justice King.\nWallace Nesbitt for the appellant.\nThe policy had expired and no contract for insurance existed when the insured was killed. See Acey v. Fernie[1]; British Industry Life Assur. Co. v. Ward[2]; Tiernan v. The People's Ins. Co.[3]. The agent had no authority to take a note for the premium. Western Assur. Co. v. Provincial Ins. Co,[4].\nW. B. A. Ritchie Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nKING J.\u2014This is an action on a policy claimed to have been effected by Obadiah Pudsey, deceased, and the question in controversy is whether the insurance was in fact effected.\nPudsey had been insured in the appellant company for the twelve months ending on 24th September, 1893. The policy provided that it might be renewed for like periods from year to year by payment of the annual premium of sixteen dollars.\nOne of the conditions indorsed on the policy was that it was not to take effect unless the premium was paid prior to any accident on account of which the claim should be made.\nAnother was that no renewal receipt should be valid unless printed in office form and signed by the managing director and countersigned by the agent.\nNothing was stated in the policy or conditions respecting the payment of premiums, whether in cash or by premium notes, and of course, therefore, nothing as to the effect of non-payment of premium notes at maturity.\nPrior to November, 1889, the company was in the habit of taking premium notes, but at that time they informed their agents by circular that they had resolved to discontinue the practice, and directed them to conduct the business thereafter on the cash system, and refused to accept notes for premiums for accident insurance. One Paton was at the period in question agent and manager of the company for the Maritime Provinces. He was also agent for the Manufacturers Life Insurance Company, a company having, as it is stated, substantially the same management. In the business of this latter company premium notes were continued to be taken, and the circular referred to seems to point to a distinction intended to be made in the mode of conducting the accident and life business.\nThe insurance effected as above expired on the 24th September, 1893. On the 26th Mr. Paton sought out Pudsey, who was a locomotive engineer on the Windsor and Annapolis Railway, to get him to renew his insurance.\nWhat took place is differently stated by the different witnesses. It is proved, however, and not disputed, that Pudsey signed and delivered to Paton a promissory note for fifteen dollars payable on October 10th. This note was on one of the printed forms supplied by the Manufacturers Life Insurance Company to Paton, and in accordance with its form was made payable to that company, or order. It does not' appear that the attention of Pudsey was drawn to the difference in the companies.\nPaton, who was called as a witness on behalf of each party, says that the note was taken as a portion of the renewal premium, but that it was agreed between him and Pudsey that there was to be no insurance till the note was paid, and he says he gave no renewal receipt and received no payment of cash in addition to the note.\nOn the other hand the father of Pudsey, who was present at the time, although not, it appears, within hearing of all that took place, says that his son gave Mr. Paton a bank note, and that the latter said he would take his note for the balance. He also says that Paton gave to Obadiah Pudsey a paper purporting to be a receipt of some kind, which the jury have found to be the ordinary renewal receipt of the company.\nThe jury have also found that a sum of money was paid in cash, and that the note was given and taken as payment of the balance of the premium.\nThe note never was paid, nor was it delivered up to Pudsey, but remained in possession of Mr. Paton. The company knew nothing of it.\nIn January, 1894, Pudsey was killed in a railway accident.\nUpon the findings as above, judgment was entered for the plaintiff by the learned Chief Justice of Nova Scotia, before whom the case was tried, and the judgment was afterwards sustained by the other judges with exception of Meagher J. who dissented.\nThe contention of the appellants is that Paton did not purport to bind the company (or in other words to renew the insurance), and that, if he did, he acted without authority; and further that if there was any proper evidence of such authority, it should have been passed upon by the jury.\nThe most material question for us is that as to Paton's authority to do what the jury found that he did, viz., to take the note in payment of the premium and deliver the company's renewal receipt to Pudsey.\nThe express instructions of November, 1889, to accept only cash for accident premiums were in force at the time in question, for Paton says that these instructions had never been varied. It is not alleged that Pudsey knew anything of them.\nThe question therefore is whether it was within the scope of Paton's employment to take a premium note as in payment. His authority to receive premiums and to give renewal receipts, and so to complete the contract, is clear. He says that every renewal receipt comes to him from the head office at Toronto, and that he renews policies after they have lapsed by giving renewal receipts.\nHe further says:\nI personally may take part of the money and a note for the rest. I charge myself with the full amount of the premium and the note becomes my personal property. When I take part cash I take a note for the balance of the premium.\nThis shews at least that he was accustomed to complete the transaction.\nThe possession of blank policies and renewal receipts signed by the president and other principal officers is some evidence of a general agency to complete the contract. Carroll v. Charter Oak Ins. Co.[5]. May on Insurance 2 ed. p. 139.\nThe authority of a general agent is, however, restricted to the range of his employment and to the acts and representations which a prudent and ordinarily sagacious and experienced person (with no reason to suspect otherwise) might expect him to do or to be authorized to make in respect of the particular business entrusted to him.\nIt would not be expected that an insurance agent would be authorized to receive a chattel in payment of a premium, or to discharge his own indebtedness to the assured through it, for this would be travelling out of the usual course of business.\nBut there is nothing in the course of business (or in the nature of the contract) to make it unreasonable to take a premium note.\nIn marine insurance it is very common. In the case of the Manufacturers Life it is shown to be the practice; and the evidence further shows that it was the practice of the appellant company to take premium notes up to November, 1889.\nIn the United States it has been held that where the agent is authorized to accept the payment of premiums he may, in his discretion, accept a note or cheque instead of the money, where the policy is silent in the matter. Taylor v. Merchants Fire Ins. Co.[6].\nThe fair conclusion would therefore seem to be that as this agent had been employed to complete the contract and had been entrusted with the renewal receipts, a prudent and ordinarily sagacious and experienced person might fairly expect that he was authorized to take a premium note, there being nothing in the policy to the contrary, and the assured having no knowledge of any limitation of the agent's authority. If this is so, the result would be that Mr. Paton was a person held out by the company as having authority to take a note for the premium and complete the contract by delivering the renewal receipt.\nThen as to the objection that, there being no general verdict, the specific question should have been passed upon by the jury, the observations of Mr. Justice Graham upon the practice acts of Nova Scotia seem to be conclusive.\nThe remaining questions are as to the findings of fact by the jury. Is there evidence upon which reasonable men might find as they did? First, as to whether the note was taken in payment of the premium. The agent's account, it will be remembered, is that it was taken upon condition that, if paid at maturity, a renewal receipt would then issue, but that in the meantime, there was to be no insurance. The jury have not adopted this account of the transaction and of course credibility is particularly a question for them. What remains? Payment of a sum of money, and the giving of a negotiable note for the balance of the premium, and the retention of the note by the agent after its non-payment at maturity.\nSuppose there were no question of the agent's authority to take a premium note, might not an inference fairly be drawn from the above facts that the transaction amounted to payment? And, in the consideration of this part of the case, it is to be assumed, in accordance with what has been already said, that the act was within the scope of the agent's employment. The mere fact that the agent was going contrary to instructions does not prevent the inference, although it is a circumstance fairly to be considered in determining whether such inference ought in fact to be drawn.\nIf there had been no accident during the twelve months of the alleged continuance of the insurance, and the company as the real payees had acquired title by indorsement, and brought action to recover the amount of the note, it would seem as if there was nothing in the facts as proved (apart of course from the account by Paton discredited by the jury) which would prevent recovery.\nThe remaining point is a more doubtful one, viz., as to the receipt. All that is proved with regard to it is that it was a receipt for sixteen dollars, and that it was signed by the president and acting manager of the company, and countersigned by the agent in the same way that ordinary renewal receipts are so signed and countersigned. It is also proved that the agent had such renewal receipts in his possession, and it does not appear that there was anything else to which it might correspond.\nThere are not wanting circumstances which make against giving full weight (not to say credit), to the elder Pudsey's testimony, but this frequently happens in jury and all other trials, while upon the whole the evidence is accredited.\nHaving regard to the finding already commented upon, viz., that the note was taken as in payment of premium, perhaps no serious fault can be found with the further finding that the receipt was an acknowledgment of such fact of payment. And the receipt being upon the company's form, and formally signed by the principal officers of the company, and it not appearing that there was any other kind of form in use by the agent, it was a not unreasonable conclusion that it was the ordinary renewal receipt.\nAll that has been said rests, of course, upon the assumption, which we are not bound to make, that the account given by the witnesses relied on by the plaintiff is substantially correct. It is sought to get a new trial in order, by the testimony of witnesses from the head office, to corroborate the testimony of Mr. Paton as to his having no renewal receipts for this policy in his possession except the one produced by him at the trial. This is put upon the ground of surprise, and it is said that it was not alleged formally by the plaintiff that a renewal receipt had been obtained. But it seems as though the defendant in the action might well have supposed that the plaintiff would seek to show that a renewal receipt had been obtained, because without such receipt the plaintiff could not very well get on with his action.\nUpon the whole, therefore, there is no good reason for disturbing the judgment, and the appeal should be dismissed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The plaintiff in her statement of claim alleges that on the 24th September, 1892, her husband Obadiah Pudsey, since deceased, effected a policy of insurance with the defendant company whereby they agreed with him that in case by reason of external violent and accidental means occurring during the continuance of the said policy, the said Obadiah should die within three months after the occurring of such accident the defendant company would pay to Minnie Pudsey, the present plaintiff, the sum of one thousand dollars; that the policy was by its terms in force for the period of twelve months ending at noon on the 24th September, 1893, subject to renewal for like periods from year to year by payment of the annual premium, and that at the expiration of the said twelve months the said policy was renewed for the further period of twelve months by the defendants accepting the promissory note of the said Obadiah Pudsey for fifteen dollars and one dollar in cash in payment of the renewal premium for the period of twelve months from the 24th September, 1893. That on the 14th May, 1894, and during the continuance of the said policy the said Obadiah Pudsey was killed by violent external and accidental means within the terms of the policy. To this statement of claim the defendants pleaded twenty-three pleas setting up in varying forms the one substantial defence, namely, that the defendants never did accept or receive the promissory note and cash referred to in the said statement of claim, or any note or cash in payment of premium on renewal of said policy, or at all, and that in point of fact the said policy was never renewed by the said defendant company, but became and was cancelled on the 24th September, 1893, before the happening of the accident. The plaintiff joined issue on the defendant's pleas, and thereupon proceeded to trial. At the trial the plaintiff produced the policy pleaded in the statement of claim. It contained in the body of it the following clause: This policy is in force for twelve months ending at noon on the 24th day of September, 1893, and may be renewed for like periods from year to year by payment of the annual premium.\nAnd upon the back of the policy, among certain conditions and stipulations indorsed thereon, and which are by the policy declared to be read and taken as part of the policy, and not alterable or waive able by agents, is the following:\nThe directors shall not be bound to send any notice of the renewal premium becoming due, and shall be at liberty should they see fit at any time to decline to renew the policy, and also may at any time cancel the \"policy by repaying to the insured the premium less the fro rata share thereof due to the company for the time it has been in force.\nNo renewal receipt is valid unless it is printed in office form and signed by the managing director and countersigned by the agent.\nThe plaintiff thereupon called as witness on her behalf J. B. Paton, who testified that he was agent in Halifax of the defendant company, and also of another company called the Manufacturers Life Insurance Company, and the policy declared on in the plaintiff's statement of claim having been put in his hands, he stated that it had passed through his office at Halifax. He produced a promissory note which he stated he had gotten from Obadiah Pudsey, deceased. This note was dated Kentville, N.S., September 28th, 1893, and was in a printed form, not of the defendant company but of the Manufacturers Life Insurance Company, as follows:\nOn Oct\u2019r 10th after date I promise to pay to the Manufacturers Life Insurance Company or order at the sum of fifteen dollars.\n(Signed) O. B. PUDSEY.\nHe said that this note was signed by Pudsey in the waiting room of the station at Kentville, he said further that he did not receive any money from Pudsey at the time of his signing the note. He said that on the day of the date of the note, viz., the 28th September, 1893, he was at the station and made inquiry for Pudsey, and subsequently saw him and took the note. At this time he said the policy had lapsed and that he so informed Pudsey, who said that he would like to renew but had not the cash, but said that he could pay the cash in a short time, that thereupon Paton told him that if he would pay the note at the time stated he, Paton, would hold the renewal receipt until it was paid, and upon the strength of that he took the note and that Pudsey had told him that if the note were placed in the bank at Kentville that it would be paid on presentation. He produced the form of a renewal receipt which he said was in his possession at the time he took the note from Pudsey; it is in the company's printed form which was apparently transmitted from the head office of the company at Toronto to the agent for the purpose of being countersigned by the agent and handed to the insured in the event of his renewing the policy within the year while it was in force by payment of the premium on renewal and which, the policy not having been renewed, remained in the hands of Paton after the expiration of the policy on the 24th September, 1893. The receipt is filed as exhibit C and is as follows:\nRENEWAL RECEIPT.\nMANUFACTURERS ACCIDENT INSURANCE COMPANY.\nHead Office, Toronto.\n$1,000. Full deposit with the Dominion Government.\nAuthorized Capital, $1,000,000.\nReceived from O. Pudsey, Esq., of Kentville, the sum of sixteen dollars being the amount due for renewal of Policy No. 8653, up to noon of the 24th September, 1894.\nCountersigned on (Sgd.) Geo. Gooderham, President.\nthis day of 189 Jno. F. Ellis,\nAgent. Managing Director.\nN.B.\u2014Premium receipts are not valid except they are signed by the President and Managing Director of the company and countersigned by an agent of the company. The witness said that neither this nor any other renewal receipt was ever delivered to Pudsey, he added that Pudsey never paid the note. Witness produced a letter of instructions to agents which he received from the head office on the 16th November, 1889, these instructions he said have never since been varied. This letter bore date the 1st November, 1889, and informed him that at a meeting of the executive committee of the company the following resolution was passed, viz.: \"that thereafter no notes be taken for accident premiums.\" The letter was addressed to the agents of the company who were directed to conduct the business of the company on the cash system only, and to refuse to accept notes for accident premiums. He added that when he took the note from Pudsey he told him that the policy had expired and that there was no insurance then in force, and that there would be none until the renewal receipt should be delivered, that he made no entry of the note in the books of the company, and never informed them of its having been made, and that they knew nothing whatever about the note.\nThis is the whole substance of the evidence given on the examination in chief, the cross-examination and re-examination of this witness who produced the note and knew all the circumstances attending the making of it, and was the most competent person to testify in respect thereof, and who was produced by the plaintiff as a credible and reliable witness upon the matters in issue. Upon this evidence having been given accepting it as credible and reliable, and it was not disputed by the defendants in any particular, it must, I think, be admitted that it was not only utterly insufficient to support, but that it absolutely disproved, the material allegation in the plaintiff's statement of claim, and which was denied by the defendants, namely, that the policy sued upon had ever been renewed by the defendant company by the payment to them by Pudsey of the renewal premium necessary to be paid to them for that purpose. The plaintiff herself went into the box and testified that the policy when it was effected was given to her by her husband, and that it had thenceforth remained in her possession until it was handed by her to her solicitor for the purposes of this action. She said further that her husband generally carried his receipts in his vest pocket; that she had made search for a renewal receipt the night before the day on which she was giving her evidence, in all his clothes, in all his pockets, and also in a trunk where he kept papers, and in fact in every other place where she thought it likely such a paper would be, but that she had found none.\nNow here it may be observed that the fact of her not having found any such renewal receipt was in perfect accord with the evidence which had been given by the previous witness who had sworn that none such had ever been given to the deceased.\nThe next witness called was John Pudsey, the father of the deceased. Before referring to the matter deposed to by him, it is to be observed that he was called for the sole purpose of contradicting the evidence given by the plaintiff's first witness Paton upon a matter peculiarly within that witness's knowledge, and of thus establishing, contrary to the evidence of Paton, that a renewal receipt had been given by Paton to the deceased, which the deceased's father had himself read, and the precise terms of which he professed perfectly to recollect, although, strange to say, it had not been alleged in the statement of claim that any renewal receipt had ever been given to the deceased, nor had it been suggested that any ever had until this witness who was called after Paton had produced as an exhibit in court the form of the receipt which had been forwarded to him to be countersigned by him and when so countersigned delivered to the deceased in the event of his renewing the policy by payment of the renewal premium within the terms of the policy in that behalf, but which receipt never had been countersigned by Paton and delivered to the decease for the reasons which Paton had already explained in his evidence. In the notes which we have of the evidence taken at the trial, it is true that when this witness Pudsey commenced to give his evidence the defendant's counsel objected to the evidence being taken but the ground and nature of the objection taken does not appear, which certainly seems singular when we read the evidence taken down from the lips of the witness, and see how manifestly objectionable the admission of such evidence was under the circumstances. All that we see on the case before us is that on the motion made on behalf of the defendants in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to set aside the findings of the jury upon the questions submitted to them and to enter judgment for the defendants the following grounds of objection are stated.\n1. Because there is no evidence to support said finding.\n2. Because on the evidence the findings ought to have been in the negative.\n3. Because said findings and each of them are against the weight of the evidence.\n4. Because of improper admission of evidence.\n5. Because there was no evidence for the jury and the case ought to have been withdrawn from the jury.\n6. Because the judge who tried the cause improperly admitted evidence of conversations with an agent of the company who had no authority to bind the company.\n7. Because the judge who tried the cause admitted secondary evidence of contents of a receipt without any proof that the original was lost. The objection could certainly have been put in more plain terms, for what was in fact done was that after it had been testified upon the evidence of a witness called by the plaintiff and examined upon matters peculiarly within his knowledge that no renewal receipt had ever been given to the deceased, the plaintiff was permitted to examine another witness for the purpose of proving by him that the evidence of the previous witness was false for that the witness contradicting him had seen a renewal receipt in the deceased's hands and had read it and could precisely state its contents, which evidence he was permitted to give, and the result was that the evidence of these two conflicting witnesses of the plaintiff was submitted to the jury as if the case was one of conflicting evidence between witnesses, the one of the plaintiff and the other of the defendant, between whom it was the province of the jury to determine which was telling the truth and which what was false. The evidence so given by this witness is in substance as follows:\nOn the last day of September or first of October, 1893, he, his son the deceased, and the witness Paton were at the station in Kentville; while witness was standing in the doorway, his son came in, and he and Paton shook hands. He then said that Paton asked his son if he was going to renew his insurance; that his son replied that he would but that he had not money enough to pay all the renewal; that he and Paton spoke together for a moment, and his son took a bank note out of his pocket which he gave to Paton saying it was all the money he had; that Paton said he would take his note for the balance, that his son replied all right, and that he and Paton then went into the railway office and witness passed on to the wicket where he could see into the railway office; that Paton was writing at a little desk, and when he got through writing he stepped aside and signed some paper; that witness's son then passed out of the office into the waiting room and handed witness a paper partly written and partly printed which he read and then handed back to his son; that this paper was headed \"Manufacturers Accident Insurance Company,\" on the left hand there was \"an arm with a hammer in it\" enclosed in a circle, and in the body was a receipt from Obadiah Pudsey for $16 (sixteen dollars); that it was signed by three names, two on the right hand corner, and one on the left; that the name on the left hand corner was \"J. B. Paton, agent, Halifax;\" that at the bottom was \"John F. Ellis\" and \"G.W. Gooderham,\" one of whom was designated manager, and the other, he thought, superintendent. He said that he did not hear what passed between his son and Paton in the railway office; then he said on cross-examination that on the day upon which he was giving his evidence the plaintiff's counsel had shown him a paper which looked like the paper his son had shown him; that it was like both in shape and appearance, that he did not read this paper, for that almost as soon as he looked at it when handed it by the plaintiff's attorney a gentleman came into the room and took it into court; then he said that he thought he had made a mistake in what he had said as to the description attached to the names on the right hand; that he thought the first name on the right hand was described \"President,\" and the second, \"General Manager and Superintendent.\" This latter description accords with the paper which had been produced by Paton and filed as exhibit C, which plainly was the document handed by the plaintiff's solicitor to the witness before he went into the witness box to give his evidence. The witness finally said that on the paper shown to him by his son at the railway station there was a date which as near as he could recollect was October 10th or 11th, 1893. Now it is to be borne in mind that up to the time of this evidence having been given in court it does not appear that it had ever been suggested that any renewal receipt had been given to the deceased, or that the witness or any other person had ever said that one had been seen in the possession of the deceased, and it is further to be borne in mind, as already observed, that the statement made by the witness, the father of the deceased, in his evidence, was not made until both the promissory note dated the 28th September, 1893, and the paper produced by Paton and filed as exhibit 0, had been filed in court; and it is further worthy of observation that while the witness swears that the paper which his son had shown him in the railway office, and which he then read, had on the left hand enclosed in a circle, \"an arm with a hammer in it,\" and that in the body of it was a \"receipt from Obadiah Pudsey for $16 (sixteen dollars)\" with the names, \"John F. Ellis,\" and \"G. W. Gooderham,\" subscribed in the right corner, the one as \"General Manager,\" and the other as \"Superintendent,\" or the one as \"President,\" and the other as \"General Manager,\" or \"Superintendent,\" and that the paper shown to him on the morning of his giving his evidence by the plaintiff's attorney, which could have been no other than the exhibit \"C\" produced by Paton, and filed in the cause, resembled both in shape and appearance the paper which he said he had seen in his son's hands and had read, yet \"the arm with a hammer in it\" is not upon this exhibit \"C\" at all, but is upon the paper filed as exhibit \"B\" which obviously the witness never saw in the hands of his son for it is the note of the date of the 28th September, 1893, which is on a printed form of note belonging not to the defendant company at all who do not take notes for renewal premiums, but belonging to the Manufacturers Life Assurance Company in whose name as payees the note is made and of which company also Paton was agent, and upon this document there is no such heading as the witness swore was upon the paper shown to him by his son or any heading, but there is the date of October the 10th, the day upon which the sum of fifteen dollars mentioned in the note is made payable, which date or that of the 11th of October the witness swore was on the paper which his son showed him in the railway office.\nIt is apparent from this evidence that whatever paper, if any, his son had shown the witness in the railway office it was not the promissory note signed by his son and filed as exhibit B, and yet this document alone and not the exhibit \"C\" had on it two marks viz: \"the arm with the hammer in it,\" and the date October 10th, 1898, both of which the witness swore were on the paper which his son had shown him and which he read. Then again the exhibit \"C\" which the witness swore resembled in shape and appearance the paper shown to him by his son, while it had on it neither of these two distinctive marks, and though it has on it the names \"John F. Ellis\" and \"Geo. Gooderham\" subscribed, the former as \"Managing Director\" and the latter as \"President,\" has not on it the name of Paton as agent, without which (as is expressly declared by the policy) a receipt, although having the other names upon it, is absolutely valueless. It is plain therefore that if ever the witness saw a receipt in the form of exhibit \"C\" having subscribed thereto the name \"J. B. Paton, agent, Halifax,\" the company must have sent from their head office, Toronto, to Paton, at Halifax, two receipts both signed by \"Geo. Gooderham\" and \"John F. Ellis\" for Pudsey's renewal premium. For what purpose two such receipts should he sent no suggestion is offered. It can well be conceived that the defendants, in the absence of any previous allegation that the deceased had ever had in his possession any renewal except signed by the officers of the defendant company, should have been taken by surprise by such evidence and that they should not have been prepared to show at Halifax, so far from their head office, that the only receipt sent from the head office to Paton of the nature spoken of was the exhibit \"C\" produced by Paton and filed in evidence.\nUnder all the above circumstances it appears to me to be difficult to conceive how any intelligent jurors who duly appreciated the duties of their office could have overlooked these facts and have answered the questions submitted to them as they have, even if there were no objection to the reception of the evidence of the witness Pudsey. It appears to me a heavy draft upon credulity to conceive that the evidence of that witness stands upon any other foundation than that it was conceived and devised by reason of the witness having seen the exhibits \"B\" and \"C\" which Paton had produced and filed in court, without having distinguished, with sufficient care, between them and what appeared upon them respectively so as to give to his evidence the similitude of truth when subjected to careful scrutiny. The tendering of such evidence if indeed the plaintiff had ever heard anything of it until it was delivered by the witness in court could have been only for the purpose of appealing upon it to the jury to discredit as unworthy of belief the evidence of Paton whom the plaintiff had put into the witness box as a credible witness, and who was the only person through whom the policy if renewed by the defendants had been renewed, which question constituted the sole material issue in the cause. The defendants only now ask that the findings of the jury shall be set aside and a new trial ordered; that relief, to prevent a miscarriage of justice must, in my opinion, be granted. When the real facts of the case relied upon by the plaintiff for the purpose of establishing that the policy was renewed by the defendants shall be established upon unimpeachable evidence it will be time enough to determine whether those facts constitute a renewal binding in law upon the defendants. If the plaintiff can succeed in establishing her cause of action as alleged without the evidence of Paton he ought not to be put into the box as a witness for the plaintiff, and if she cannot succeed without calling him her action must fail upon his evidence as given. As there has, I think, been a miscarriage in the case as tried the appeal must, in my opinion, be allowed with costs and a rule be ordered to be issued in the court below for a new trial and without costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: H.

S. C. ch. 32) is not complete until the vessel containing the goods arrives at the port at which they are to be landed.\nSection 4 of the Tariff Act, 1895, (58 & 59 Vict. ch. 23) provided that \"this Act shall be held to have come into force on the 3rd of May in the present year, 1895.\" It was not assented to until July.\nHeld, that goods imported into Canada on May 4th, 1895, were subject to duty under said Act.\nAppeal from a decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], in favour of the defendant.\nThe proceeding in this case was by the Crown on information of the Attorney General of Canada to recover an amount claimed to be due for duties on a cargo of sugar imported by the defendant company. The duty could only be levied, if at all, under the Tariff Act of 1895, which, by its terms, was to be held to be in force on May 3rd of that year. The vessel containing the sugar arrived at Montreal, where the goods were to be landed, on May 4th, having in April entered the port of North Sydney where the master reported according to the provisions of sec. 25 of the Customs Act, R. S C. ch, 32.\nBy the Tariff Act in force at the time the duties were to be levied when the goods were imported into Canada, and by sec. 150 of the Customs Act such importation is to be deemed completed from the time when the vessel containing the goods came within the limits of the port at which they ought to be reported. The defendant company claimed that the latter provision referred to the report to be made under sec. 25 of the Customs Act, and that the vessel having been reported at North Sydney in April, the goods were not subject to duty under the Act which came into force on May 3rd. The Exchequer Court held this view and gave judgment against the Crown accordingly.\nThe defendant contended also, that the provision in the Tariff Act, 1894, bringing it into force on May 3rd, though it was not passed until July, did not apply to this importation. This contention was not dealt with by the Exchequer Court where it was not necessary to decide the point as the goods were held non-dutiable in any event.\nThe statutes bearing on the matter in dispute are set out in the judgment of His Lordship the Chief Justice.\nFitzpatrick Q.C. Solicitor General of Canada, and Newcombe Q.C. Deputy Minister of Justice, for the appellant, referred to United States v. Arnold[2]; Kohne v. Insurance Co. of North America[3]; Wilson v. Robertson[4].\nOsler Q.C. and Gormully Q.C. for the respondent, cited Maxwell on Statutes[5]; Hammill on Customs Laws, pp. 24-5. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Exchequer holding the respondents not liable to duties upon a cargo of raw sugar imported by the respondents in 1895. The proceeding in which the judgment was pronounced was an information by the Attorney General of the Dominion, and it sought to recover duties according to the tariff of 1895 upon 6,587,439 pounds of sugar.\nThe questions arising are two. First, as to whether the importation of these sugars was completed before the tariff of 1895 came into force. Secondly, as to the effect of the entry and subsequent delivery of the sugar to the respondents as free of duty by the officers of Customs at Montreal.\nThe sugar was shipped on board the steamer \"Cynthiana,\" at Antwerp. The port of destination of the ship was Montreal. In the course of the voyage, however, the \"Cynthiana\" entered the port of North Sydney, in Cape Breton, which was not her port of destination, and in compliance with the requirements of section 25 of the Customs Act (R.S.C. ch. 32) there made to the collector of the port of North Sydney, a report in writing embodying the particulars specified in that section.\nIf this entry at North Sydney constituted an importation of the goods into Canada, then inasmuch as the amended Tariff Act under which the duties are claimed by the Crown, did not come into force until the 3rd of May, 1895, no duties were payable. The vessel, without discharging any portion of her cargo at North Sydney cleared from that port on the 29th April, 1895, for Montreal, her original port of destination, where she arrived on the afternoon of the 4th of May.\nIt does not appear for what purpose the ship went into North Sydney; there is nothing to show whether she called there for coal, for repairs, or in distress, but it is beyond question that it was not her port of destination, that port being Montreal.\nThe amended Tariff Act, 58 & 59 Vict. ch, 23, entitled, \"An Act to amend the Customs Tariff, 1894,\" did not receive the Royal assent until the 22nd of July, 1895, but it contained a clause (according to the usual course adopted in the Dominion tariff legislation) giving retroactive effect to its provisions, as if it had been passed on the 3rd of May, 1895, on which day the resolutions on which the Act was founded were introduced.\nThe principal statutory provisions applicable to the questions in controversy are as follows; By section 4 of the Customs Tariff, 1894 (57 & 58 Vict. ch, 33), of which the Act of 1895 was an amendment, it is enacted as follows:\n4. Subject to the provisions of this Act, and to the requirements of the Customs Act, chapter thirty-two of the Revised Statutes, as amended, there shall he levied, collected and paid upon all goods enumerated, or referred to as not enumerated, in schedule A to this Act, the several rates of duties of customs set forth and described in the said schedule and set opposite to each item respectively or charged thereon as not enumerated, when such goods are imported into Canada or taken out of warehouse for consumption therein.\nThe Tariff Act does not contain any definition of what shall constitute \"importation.\"\nThe Customs Act (R. S. C. ch. 32) contains, however, the following clause (sec. 150):\nWhenever, on the levying of any duty, or for any other purpose, it becomes necessary to determine the precise time of the importation or exportation of any goods, or of the arrival or departure of any vessel, such importation, if made by sea, coastwise, or by inland navigation in any decked vessel, shall be deemed to have been completed from the time the vessel in which such goods were imported came within the limits of the port at which they ought to be reported, and if made by land, or by inland navigation in any undecked vessel, then from the time such goods were brought within the limits of Canada; and the exportation of any goods shall be deemed to have been commenced from the time of the legal shipment of such goods for exportation, after due entry outwards, in any decked vessel, or from the time the goods were carried beyond the limits of Canada, if the exportation is by land or in any undecked vessel; and the time of the arrival of any vessel shall be deemed to be the time at which the report of such vessel was, is or ought to have been made, and the time of the departure of any vessel to be the time of the last clearance of such vessel on the voyage on which she departed.\nBy section 25 of the same Act (The Customs Act):\nThe master of every vessel coming from any port or place out of Canada, or coastwise and entering any port in Canada, whether laden or in ballast, shall go without delay, when such vessel is anchored or moored, to the Customs House for the port or place of entry where he arrives, and there make a report in writing to the collector or other proper officer, of the arrival and voyage of such vessel, stating her name, country, and tonnage, the port of registry, the name of the master, the country of the owners, the number and names of the passengers, if any, the number of the crew, and whether the vessel is laden or in ballast, and if laden, the marks and numbers of every package and parcel of goods on board, and where the same was laden, and the particulars of any goods stowed loose, and where and to whom consigned, and where any and what goods, if any, have been laden or unladen or bulk has been broken during the voyage, what part of the cargo and the number and names of the passengers which are intended to be landed at that port, and what and whom at any other port in Canada, and what part of the cargo, if any, is intended to be exported in the same vessel, and what surplus stores remain on board, as far as any of such particulars are or can be known to him.\nThe respondents contend that the report in section 25 being one which the master was bound to make on his arrival at North Sydney, there was then an arrival (though not at the port of destination) and a consequent importation at that port under section 150 of the Customs Act.\nI unhesitatingly dissent from this contention. Section 31 of the Customs Act alone affords a conclusive answer to such contention. That section provides that:\nIf any goods are brought in any decked vessel, from any place out of Canada to any port of entry therein, and not landed, but it is intended to convey such goods to some other port in Canada in the same vessel there to be landed, the duty shall not be paid or the entry completed at the first port, but at the port where the goods are to be landed, and to which they shall be conveyed accordingly under such regulations and with such security or precautions for compliance with the requirements of this Act, as the Governor General in Council from time to time directs.\nAnd this is reinforced by section 4 of the Customs Tariff which says that:\nSubject to the provisions of this Act and the requirements of the Customs Act, duties shall be collected, levied and paid upon goods when imported into Canada.\nIt is thus clear beyond argument that upon these goods destined for Montreal and laden upon a ship bound for that port, duties were not payable at North Sydney, but under section 31 were to be paid where the goods were to be landed, and where in fact they were landed, namely at Montreal. The collector at North Sydney could not legally have received the duties there. Then as section 4 of the Customs Tariff requires that the duties are to be levied when the goods are imported into Canada, and as under section 31 those duties in a case like the present where a vessel touches at a port of entry other than her port of destination, are to be paid at the latter port, by reading these two sections together we find it to be the intention of the legislature that the port at which the duties are to be paid is to be considered the place of importation, thus making it plain that the words of section 150 of the Customs Act \"come within the limits of the port at which they ought to be reported\" means \"reported\" for the purpose of levying the duties thereon.\nThe construction adopted by the court below would have the effect of making the duties payable by a vessel touching for any cause, at a port in Canada other than the port of destination of the cargo, payable at such port of call, which is directly contrary to section 31, or of making the importation precede the time at which the duties are payable, which is contrary to section 4 of the Customs Tariff. So that as the duties are to be paid when the goods are imported, and not before, the importation cannot precede the time at which the duties are payable; the obligation to pay the duties and the importing must be contemporaneous, and a construction which would make the importation precede the payment of duties is precluded.\nNumerous American authorities, cases decided in the United States Courts, establish what is generally understood to be the place of importation for fiscal purposes. In the United States v. Arnold[6] Mr. Justice Story says \"there must be arrival at the port of entry to make the right to duties attach. An importation has in many cases been held to mean 'a voluntary bringing into port of goods with an intent to land or discharge them.'\" This case went to the Supreme Court on appeal and was there affirmed[7].\nThe following authorities are to the same effect: Perot v. United States[8]; Prince v. United States[9]; United States v. Vowell[10]; Meredith v. United States[11]; Kolme v. The Insurance Co. of North America[12]; Elmes, Law of the Customs[13].\nThese American authorities are of course not of direct application in the construction of our Canadian statutes, but they serve to shew what eminent judges and courts have considered to be the proper and primary signification of the terms \"imported\" and \"importation\" and are therefore of force when we find the statutes which we have to deal with leading us to the same interpretation. The 4th section of the Act of 1895,\" An Act to amend the Customs Tariff, 1894,\" expressly makes it retroactive to the 3rd of May, 1895; the words are: \"This Act shall be held to have come into force on the 3rd of May in the present year 1895.\" There is therefore no principle upon which to avoid giving effect to this enactment which Parliament had of course full powers to enact. The authorities cited by Mr. Osier were cases in which the language was not express but it was sought by implication to make statutes retrospective, which will not of course be done when the language is clear.\nWe must, therefore, treat the statute as though it had passed on the 3rd of May. If the Act had been assented to on that date there cannot be a doubt that the illegal and unauthorized act of a subordinate officer of the Custom House at Montreal in accepting on the 2nd of May, before the arrival of the \"Cynthiana\" at Montreal, an entry of these sugars as free goods would not have had the effect of relieving the respondents from the payment of the duties when she actually arrived on the 4th of May. The collector was then perfectly right when in the performance of what he properly considered to be his duty he cancelled the entry.\nThe appeal must be allowed, and judgment entered for the Crown for the amount of the duties claimed.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014We must read the statute 58 & 59 Vict. ch. 23, under which, in connection with R. S. C. ch. 32, the question on this appeal arises, as if it had been passed on the 3rd May, 1895, and the sole question is whether goods shipped at Antwerp upon a vessel which cleared from that port for the port of Montreal, such goods being consigned to merchants in Montreal where the vessel arrived only on the 4th May, 1895, were or were not liable to the duties imposed upon such goods by the above statute 58 & 59 Vict. ch. 23.\nBy sec. 4 of 57 & 58 Vict. ch. 33, it is enacted that subject to the requirements of R. S. C. ch. 32, duties shall be levied on all goods subject to duty,\nwhen such goods are imported into Canada, or taken out of warehouses, for consumption therein.\nUntil importation is complete no duty is legible, but upon importation the goods chargeable with duty become liable thereto.\nBy sec. 34 of R. S. C. ch. 33, it is enacted that every importer of goods by sea, or from any place out of Canada, shall within three days after the arrival of the importing vessel make due entry inwards of such goods and land the same.\nSection 35 prescribes how such entry is to be made by the importer.\nSection 36 enacts that unless the goods so entered are to be warehoused, as provided in the Act, the importer shall pay duty on the goods so entered.\nThen section 150 enacts that:\nWhenever on the levying of any duty, it becomes necessary to determine the precise time of importation of any goods, such importation if made by sea shall be deemed to have been completed from the time the vessel in which such goods were imported came within the limits of the port at which they ought to be reported.\nThe language of this sec. 150 is as explicit as to the meaning of the words \"importation\" and \"imported,\" as if they had been explained in an interpretation clause, and the effect is that importation of goods by sea into Canada is not effected until the vessel in which they are imported comes within the limits of the port at which they ought to be reported, that is to say the port to which they are consigned, and where they are intended to be landed, and where they must be entered at the Custom House by the importer under the provisions of sections 21, 34, 35, 36 and 37.\nBut it is contended by the respondents that the port \"at which they ought to be reported,\" is by sec. 25, the port of entry in Canada into which a vessel first enters, although not cleared for that port from the port from which she was cleared on commencing her voyage.\nThat section as it appears to me relates to ports of entry for which the vessel has been cleared, and not to a port into which a vessel cleared for another port has for any cause entered. Secs. 30 & 31 seem to me to support this view, and sec. 162 provides for a vessel putting into a port of entry other than that for which she had cleared upon her voyage, by reason of damage sustained by stress of weather. Then again, there is nothing in the 25th section of the Act, or in any other section, indicating any intention of the legislature to provide for such a contingency as a vessel voluntarily entering a port in Canada different from that for which she had cleared on commencing her voyage. But whether the section be or be not limited to ports of entry for which vessels were by their clearance papers bound on their voyage, the report by that section required to be made is not at all the report referred to in sec. 150. The report to be made under sec. 25 is to be made by the master alone. The report under sec. 150 is of the goods imported which cannot be made by the master, but must be made by the importer under the secs. 21, 34 to 37, which sections could not be complied with if in the present case the goods in question should be deemed to have been imported into Canada when the vessel upon which they were shipped consigned to Montreal entered the port of North Sydney. I am of opinion, therefore, that the appeal must be allowed with costs, and judgment be ordered to be entered in the action for the Crown.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\nKING J.\u2014Though with very great doubt I am inclined to think the judgment of the Exchequer Court right.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I am of the opinion that the judgment appealed from should be confirmed, for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Burbidge, and the appeal dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E.

The immoveable character of machinery so affixed disappears when the land and the machinery belong to different owners. There are also distinctions between this case and Leonard v. Boisvert ([22]) for here the usual consequences of a sale are suspended; no title vested in the purchaser till the full price had been paid. The Code (art. 13) does not forbid such conditions; Richard v. Le cur\u00e9 et Marguilliers etc. de Qu\u00e9bec ([23]). There never was any intention here to immobolize, but the contrary is apparent, Wyatt v. Lewis & Kennebec Railway Co. ([24]). The maxim \" possesssion vaut titre \" has been narrowed down by our jurisprudence to a presumption merely which can be rebutted as has been done in this case. There has been no promise of sale and the provisional delivery of possession pending payment of the full price has no effect in changing the ownership; Grange v. McLennan ([25]); Lucas v.

The sheriff of the district of\nJoloiette having, under a writ of Fieri Facias de bonis et de terris issued in an action brought by Edouard Migue against Francis Kelly, seized certain immoveables as being the property of the defendant in the action, the present respondents filed and served upon the sheriff an opposition by which they opposed the publication, sale and adjudication of the following property, to wit:\nAll the working machinery of the mills situated and. built upon lot no. 578 on the official plan and book of reference of the cadastre of the town of Joliette for registration purposes and all the saw-mills thereupon situated, as well as all the working machinery in front of the said mills, and all the machines, engines, boilers, tools, utensils and accessories attached or dependent thereto whatsoever.\nThe appellants having intervened and contested the opposition, the parties went to proof.\nFrom the pleadings and depositions the following facts appeared. The immoveable in question was originally the property of Dame Honorine Grenier widow of Andrew Kelly. On the 20th of November \u00a1 1884 Mrs. Kelly, by a notarial deed of that date, sold and ceded this property to Francis Kelly and William Copping. This deed was duly enregistered the 27th of June 1885. The price in consideration of which this sale was made was the sum of $7 000. As security for the payment of this price the vendor, by the deed of sale, expressly reserved a privilege or hypothec of bailleur de fond on the property sold, and the purchasers by the same deed expressly hypothecated the property for the same purpose in favour of the vendor. On the 31st December, 1895, there being then due to Mrs. Kelly on account of the purchase money and interest accrued thereon $8,456800, the appellants paid off the same and obtained a subrogation to the hypothec and privilege which she held under the deed of sale as security for the purchase money. The appellants subsequently sued the firm of Kelly Brothers (in whom the title to the land had become vested) for the amount of their hypothec, and on the 18th March, 1896 recovered judgment for the sum of $9,203.72.\nThe respondents found their opposition on the following facts which were duly proved. The respondents are manufacturers of saw-mills and mill machinery and carry on their business and have their works at Brantford, in the province of Ontario. On the 10th of March, 1888, the firm of Kelly & Brother agreed to purchase the machinery in question from the respondents for the price of $7,000, and the contract, embodied in a written agreement of that date, was entered into. This agreement was as follows:\nNotes to be in all cases given before removing machinery from works or station\n$7000.00. Brantford, March 10th, 1888.\nTo the Waterous Engine Works Co. (Limited).\nYou will please manufacture for us and deliver F. O. B. cars at Brantford, on or about the 15th day of April, 1888, or as soon thereafter as finished and a car can be obtained, one of your sawmills as per specification attached and signed by us.\nFor the above we agree to pay you the sum of seven thousand dollars as follows: $500 cash on signing order $500 when goods are ready to ship, and for the balance we will sign and deliver before shipment, promissory notes as follows, $3,000 on 4th September, and $3,000 on 4th December, 1888, with interest at 7 per cent per annum from date of shipment.\nDelivery as above is to constitute fulfilment of this contract by W. E. W. Co.\nThis order is taken subject to approval of W. E. W. Co., at head office, Brantford, and may be cancelled by them at any time, even if accepted and goods shipped. Any arrangements made or implied to erect machinery mentioned in this order is tobe on conditions enumerated on last page of price list. It is agreed the W. E. W. Co. are not to be held responsible for delay caused by fire, disturbance among employees, or other causes that could not be foreseen or prevented by reasonable diligence.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS SALE\nThe title to the above mentioned machinery is to remain in the Waterous Engine Works Co. (Limited) till purchase money, all, repairs thereon, and any other indebtedness to the said company incurred during the currency of notes given for purchase money, are paid and in default of payment in full, vendors, or their officers or agents, may resume possession and remove the same after default, or at any time they are of the opinion that the security is or was or has become unsatisfactory, or if in their opinion it is necessary to do so to secure the said debt or protect themselves from loss either of the original sum or interest or any repairs thereon, or attorneys or agents costs incurred in collecting said notes or accounts by non-payment when due, or making seizure and vending said machinery in case of default. You may insure the above mentioned machinery in any good company for two-thirds of the time payments and charge premium to me\nThis contract with its terms and conditions has been read over to me and are thoroughly understood by me. I understand no money is to be paid agents except on your written order, and I will not hold you responsible for statements of agents or others not enumerated on this order.\nIt is specially agreed that in case of default all amounts unpaid immediately become due.\nKELLY & BRO.,\nJoliette, P.Q. Kelly & Brother affixed the machinery in their saw-* mill and used it for some years. Subsequently the execution already mentioned was issued against the goods and lands of Francis Kelly, and under it the sheriff seized the saw-mill property and also the machinery, against the sale and adjudication of which the respondents have formed the present opposition At the date of the seizure and opposition a part of the price had been paid but there remained still due to the respondents a balance of the purchase money and interest amounting to $4,881.\nUpon this state of facts the Superior Court gave judgment for the appellants. This judgment was, however, unanimously reversed by the Court of Appeals, the judges present being the Chief Justice, and Boss\u00e9 Blanchet, Hall and W\u00fcrtele, Justices. The reasons upon which the latter court based their judgment are set forth in the consid\u00e9rants of the judgment itself, and are also fully developed in the notes of Mr. Justice W\u00fcrtele which accompanied the judgment. The opinion of Mr. Justice W\u00fcrtele is preceded by a -very full statement of the facts ([33]) which I may refer to as containing a history of the title to the immoveable upon which the machinery was set up, which is not, however, material to the questions now arising for decision\nTwo questions have arisen and been argued in this appeal which may be defined in the words of Mr. Justice W\u00fcrtele as follows :\n1st. Is the stipulation contained in the contract of the 10th March 1888 by which the ownership of the machinery was retained by the respondents until the payment of the whole price, lawful and valid, and did the ownership remain vested in the respondents after the machinery was delivered to Kelly Brothers? 2nd. Was the machinery immobilized by being placed by Kelly Brothers in the building which they; had constructed to be used as a saw-mill to the detriment of the right of property which by the agreement of the 10th of March, 1888, the respondents had stipulated should be retained and remain vested in them until the price was fully paid?\nAs to the first question it is to be observed that what the respondents contend is that no property passed under the contract of the 10th of March, 1888, and that according to the clauses of that agreement none was to pass until the price was fully paid which it never has been. What the respondents are, therefore, insisting upon, is not any right to a resolution of the sale under a resolutory condition, either express or implied by law, nor to a privilege in respect of the purchaee money for which they agreed to sell, but upon a suspensive condition by which the property in the machinery was retained to the vendors until payment. Had this condition not been expressly stipulated the property would no doubt have passed to Kelly Brothers upon the conclusion of the contract. It having, however, been expressly agreed that this ordinary legal consequence of a sale should not take effect in the present instance, the only point for decision on the first question propounded is: Was such a condition legal ?\nThe contract of sale may by English law be modified in any way the parties may agree, and in particular it is open to them to suspend the operation of the general effect of the contract in respect of the vesting of the property in the vendee, and to provide that it shall not pass until the price is fully paid. It has, however,. been assumed, and I accept it as a settled point in the case, that the law of the province of Quebec is to furnish the rule of decision in the present case. No proof of the law of Ontario was made and the court had a right, therefore, to assume that it was identical with the law of Quebe upon the point involved, as indeed it is. Then it cannot for a moment be preteded that there was anything illegal in this stipulationthat the vendor should retain the property. Mr. Justice W\u00fcrtele fully explains the principles of the French law on this head and the authorities he refers to and the extracts he has given from Laurent and Aubry & Ran, beyond all question state the law correctly. To these authori ties, that of many other authors might be added. As regards the jurisprudence we have first the case of Filiatrault v. Goldie ([34]). There in the case of a sale of moveables the contract contained a provision identical with that in the present case, that the property should not pass to the purchaser until the price was entirely paid. It was held by the Court of Queen's Bench in a very clear and able judgment pronunced by Sir Alex ander Lacoste, Chief Justice, that the provision in question was a good suspensive condition and one which would have entitled the vendor, had he tendered and offered to repay the portion of the price he had received, to judgment in an action of revendication. I also refer on this head to a case reported m Sirey ([35]), Staron v. Comp. des Moteurs \u00e0 gaz, decided by the Court of Appeal at Lyons on the 10th August, 1888, (which I shall have occasion to refer to hereafter as it is exactly in point upon both the questions involved in the pre sent case) were it was expressly decided that a sale under a condition suspensive such as that in the case before us, whereby the property is reserved to the seller until the whole of the price is paid is valid. To the report of this case in Sirey is appended a very full and clear note by M. Appleton, in which the whole doctrine and jurisprudence is examined and the correctness of the arr\u00eat of the court of Lyons most satisfactorily demonstrated ([36]), and Sirey ([37]), may be also cited as authorities to the same effect. I therefore conclude that the judgment of the Court of Appeal upon the first point propounded was entirely correct. Coming to the second question: Was the machinery in question immobilized by the act of Kelly Brothers, the purchasers in affixing it in their saw-mill in such a way that it became their property and as such liable to be seized and sold for the satisfaction of judgments against them? I find the reasoning of the Court of Appeal even more decisively supported by the authorities than that on the first point. On this head the law of France is identical with that of the Quebec Code, so that there can be no question as to the applicability of the authority of the French authors and the decisions of the French courts\nIn the first place the Court of Appeal were clearly authorized by the express words of article 379 in holding that this machinery, supposing it to have been the property of Kelly Brothers, would have been immoveable by destination under article 379, and not immovabee by nature under articles 376 and 377 The second paragraph of article 379, \" Les ustensiles n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'exploitation des forges, papeteries et autres usines,\" would in that case have undoubtedly included this engine and machinery affixed in the saw-mill.\nThis was the conclusion of both the courts below and it has not been seriously argued that the property in question was immoveable by nature. Had these fixtures been detached from the building, as they easily could have been they would have had an independent existence as moveables which is the proper test to be applied in distinguishing immoveables by destinatonn from immoveables by nature Then what are the essentials, compliance with which the law requires in order that moveable property may be constituted immoveable by destination? I cannot answer this question better than by citing a passage from Huc ([38]), where that author says:\nPour pouvoir donner \u00e0 un objet mobilier le caract\u00e8re d'immeuble par destination ii faut \u00e9tre \u00e0 Ia fois propri\u00e9taire du fonds et propri\u00e9taire du meuble \u00e0 immobiliser.\nIf this is a correct statement of the law there can be no doubt as to the absolute correctness of the conclusion arrived at by the Court of Queen's Bench. Kelly Brothers, upon the hypothesis that the judgment of the court upon the first point was a sound conclusion as I have endeavoured to demonstrate that it was were never the owners of the engine and machinery, and thererefore, could not make them immoveables by destination. Baudry-Lacantinerie & Chauveau ([39]) are to the same effect, in enumerating the essential requisites to the constitution of a moveable an immoveable by destination. They say:\n4 Que le propri\u00e9taire du fonds soit en m\u00eame temps propri\u00e9taire de l'objet plac\u00e9 sur le fonds. Si un propri\u00e9taire placait sur son fonds des meubles \u00e0 lui remis en d\u00e9p\u00f4t, ou \u00e0 titre degage, de pr\u00eat, sa volont\u00e9 ne suffirait pas \u00e0 produire l'immobilisation et n'arr\u00eaterait en aucune fa\u00e7on Ia revendication des tiers, propri\u00e9taires des objects mobiliers.\nThe arr\u00eat already quoted from Sirey ([40]), is here again precisely in point; two questions were there decided, both identical with the two points which have been adjudicated by the Court of Queen's Bench in the present case. An en crine worked by gas, moteur \u00e0 gazr had been furnished by the defendants to certain manu* factur\u00e9rs who having affixed it in their factory, subsequently hypothecated the factory in favour of the plaintiff in the action. The hypothecary deed expressly included the engine in question. The engine had been delivered to the intending purchaser just as in the present case, under a stipulation that the property was to remain vested in the vendors until the price had been fully paid. The action was instituted by the mortgagee against the company, who had agreed to sell the engine under the suspensive condition mentioned to have it declared that the machine had been included in his hypothec as being an immoveable by destination.\nThe tribunal of first instance having decided in favour of the company that judgment was confirmed by the arr\u00eat of the Court of Appeal. The court say:\nAttendu qu'il est certain d'apr\u00e8s les documents produits que le moteur \u00e0 gaz dont il s'agit de determiner le caract\u00e8re au point de vue de la distinction des biens a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni aux Sieurs Guinard en mars 1881; qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 dans leur usine, et qu'il s'y trouvait le 23 f\u00e9vrier 1884 comme faisant partie, en apparence tout an moins, des ustensiles n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'exploitation de cette usine, qu'il devait donc \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une de ces choses mobili\u00e8res de leur nature qui se confondent parfois avec les fonds o\u00f9 elles sont apport\u00e9es et qui deviennent immeubles par destination, si les conditions exig\u00e9es pour que cette destination puisse leur \u00eatre donn\u00e9e se trouvent accomplies. Attendu que la premi\u00e8re de ces conditions est d'\u00eatre \u00e0 Ia Lois propri\u00e9taire du fonds et de l'objet \u00e0 immobiliser lui-m\u00eame, que le locataire ne rend pas plus immeuble une chose mobili\u00e8re \u00e0 lui appartenant et qu'il apporte dans un b\u00e2timent qui n'est pas le sien, que le propri\u00e9taired d'une usine ne rend immeuble une chose mobili\u00e8re de sa nature non employ\u00e9e \u00e0 Ia construction et dont il n'est possesseur qu'\u00e0 titre pr\u00e9caire.\nThis concise statement of the reasons in the judgment. itself is upon this second branch of the case as well as upon the first, developed by the note of Professor Appleton already referred to, appended to the report.\nThe case of Lain\u00e9 v. B\u00e9land ([41]) has been much, relied on by the appellants. That case is, however, in no way inconsistent with the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench. There could be no doubt that the boiler there in question was an immoveable by desttnation; it had been affixed to the soil, whilst both it and the immoveable to which it was annexed were in the common ownership of Nelson & Company and there never had been any actual physical severance. The question there was an entirely different one It was considered that what was insisted on by the appellants there as a constructive severance, namely, a sale of the boiler as a separate moveable to persons under whom the plaintiff in the action for revendication claimed did not affect a remobilization against an hypothecary creditor whose hypothec had been duly registered. In truth that was rather a question on the registry law of the province of Quebec than such a question as is here presented. I only mention this as sufficiently distinguishing the case without saying whether I considered Mr. Justice Blanchet right or not. For myself I decided the appeal on the same grounds as those relied on by the learned Chief Justice of the Queen's Bench, namely that the plaintiffs in the action had failed to prove their title\nI may add that I entirely agree with Mr. Justice W\u00fcrtele in that part of his judgment in which he points out why the principle on which the defendant in the case of Filiatrault v. Goldie ([42]) succeeded is wholly inapplicable here. it was there held that the plaintiff, the vendor, ought to have tendered to the purchaser the portion of the price paid on account. The respondents are not here seeking to recover the possession of the property sold, they are merely opposing a sale by the sheriff which would defeat their rights altogether. Filiatrault v. Goldie (1) is, therefore, of no application on this point. There is a strong reason for adopting a fortiori, the rule of law sanctioned by the French authorities cited in the consideration that in France the rule possession vaut titre prevails whilst in the law as formulated in the Civil Code of the province of Quebec that maxim has no place.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The sole question, as it appears to me, which is involved in this appeal is the construction of art. 379 of the Civil Code of the province of Quebec. The question is: How can moveable things or chattels become immoveable or real property by destination? And the answer which the article gives is ; By being incorporated by the owner with his own real property. The language of the article is: \" Moveable things which a proprietor\" (or in other words an owner) \"has placed on his real property for a permanency, or which he has incorporated therewith, are immoveable by their destination so long as they remain there. \" The plain construction of that article both according to its letter and its spirit, is that the person capable of converting chattel property into realty by destination must be owner both of the chattel to be converedd into realty, and of the realty into which by incorporation therewith, the chattel is converted. The words, \" moveable things which a proprietor \" taken alone without any of the words subsequently used in the article, according to their natural grammatical construction, plainly indicate the person capable of doing what the subsequent part of the article authorizes\u2014that is to say, of converting chattel. property into realty, and the subsequent language in the article only designates the mode by which such proprietor can effect his purpose, and the person so indicated can be no other than the owner of the chattel to be converted. Now how is the conversion to be effected? Plainly by the proprietor or owner already mentioned dealing with the chattel in some manner and so the article adds, \" has placed on his real property or which he \" (that is to say the proprietor or owner already mentioned in the first five words of the article in connectinn with the words \" moveable things \") h has incorporated therewith,\" that is to say, with his real property; the ownership of the real property is designated by the pronoun \"his, \" and the ownership of the goods by the words \" moveable things,\" which, a \" proprietor,\" or an owner, or the owner, or any owner, for there is substantially no difference between these expressions in this connection, so that the person acting to effect the conversion of a chattel into realty must be the owner of the chattel and of the real property with which the chattel is to become incorporated by destination And this is in precise accord with the spirit of the article, for it is contrary to natural justice and to reason that an owner of real property by incorporating with such real property a chattel which is the property of a stranger can give such chattel the character of realty so long as he shall keep the chattel so incorporated with his realty. The article uses no language to which such an unreasonable construction involving such manifest injustice can be given. As, then, it appears that the owners of the real property to which the machinery has been by them annexed were not proprietors of the machinery so annexed, but that the property therein is still vested in the respondents, the conversion of the machinery into the real property has never been effected so as to come within the article and consequently the machinery did not pass under the mortgage of the realty in virtue of which alone the appellants claim, and the appeal must, in my opinion, be dismissed. SedgewCK and King JJ. concurred in the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGIROUARD J. (dissenting)\u2014I am bound to admit that, as to one fact, this case is not analogous to Lain\u00e9 v. B\u00e9land ([43]), for in the latter case the incorporation had been originally made by the proprietor of both the immoveable and the moveable property, whereas in this case the incorporation was done by the proprietor of the immoveable property, with the express consent of the proprietor of the moveable effects. In the two cases, however, the contract is the same and as to the principle of law involved the cases are similar Speaking for myself and also for my brothers Taschereau, Sedgewick and King, who agreed \" for the reasons stated in the judgment pronounced,\" I said in Lain\u00e9 v. B\u00e9land (1), in support of the judgment of the Court of Appeals;\nLa majorit\u00e9 des juges de la cour d'appel n'a pas song\u00e9 \u00e0 rechercher Ia nature du contrat du 7 avril 1893; \u00e0 leurs yeux, sans doute, et je crois qu'ils avaient raison, ii importait peu que les appelants fussent vendeurs ou simples locateurs; ils avaient consenti \u00e0 l'incorporation les machines \u00e0 l'immeuble; ils les avaient vendues pendant qu'elles \u00e9taient ainsi incorpor\u00e9es; elles \u00e9taient donc devenues immeubles et frapp\u00e9es des hypoth\u00e8ques de l'intim\u00e9.\nL'honorable juge en chef et M. le juge Boss\u00e9 expriment l'opinion, dans leurs notes, que ces objets mobiliers peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s immeubles par nature; mais le texte du jugement d\u00e9clare simplement qu'ils \u00e9taient incorpor\u00e9s \u00e0 l'iimmeuble et en faisaient partie int\u00e9grante sans s'expliquer sur la nature de leur immobilisation, Je crois qu'ils sont devenus immeubles par le seul fait de l'incorporation qu'en firent les propri\u00e9taires du fonds, et qu'ils sent immeubles par destination tant qu'ils y restent,\" aux termes de l'article 379 du Code Civil. Cet article d\u00e9clare que:\n\"Les objets mobiliers que le propri\u00e9taire a plac\u00e9s sur son fends \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure, ou qu'il y a incorpor\u00e9s, sont immeubles par destination, tant qu'ils y restent. Ainsi sont immeubles sous ces restrictions les objets suivants, et autres semblables: 1. Les pressoirs, chaudi\u00e8res, alambics, cuves et tonnes; 2. Les ustensiles n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l'exploitation des forges, papeteries et autres usines.\"\nIl est incontestable, et le fait me para\u00eet admis par l'appelant et tons lea juges, qu'il y a eu de fait incorporation des machines \u00e0 l'immeuble, et que cette incorporation a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par le propri\u00e9taire du fonds. Voil\u00e0 tout ce que l'article 379 de notre Code prescrit, il n'exige m\u00eame pas que l'incorporation ait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure. Il ne fait aucune mention du vendeur non pay\u00e9, ou avec la condition r\u00e9solutoire, pas m\u00e9me de locateur on de tout autre propri\u00e9taire des objets mobiliers qui aurait consenti \u00e0 leur incorporation.\nAnd again on page 429:\nVoil\u00e0 d'ailleurs la doctrine que cette cour a consacr\u00e9e \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du vendeur non pay\u00e9 dans un jugement \u00e9labo\u00e9\u00e9 et rempli d autorit\u00e9s, rendu en 1890 dans les causes de Wallbridge v. Farwell, et Ontario Car Foundry Co. v. Farwell ([44]), qui jusqu'ici a cependant \u00e9chapp\u00e9 \u00e0 l'attention des parties. Cette cour d\u00e9cida que le cr\u00e9ancier hypoth\u00e9caire doit \u00e9tre pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 au vendeur non pay\u00e9, et je crois que cette d\u00e9cision s'applique au vendeur avec condition r\u00e9solutoire, et m\u00e9me an locateur, car le droit de revendiquer du vendeur non pay\u00e9 implique la resolution du contrat comme dans le cas du vendeur avec condition r\u00e9solutoire ou du locateur, avec cette seule diff\u00e9rence, que dans le premier cas, Ia resolution r\u00e9sulte de la loi, tandis que dans l'autre elle r\u00e9sulte du contrat.\nIn the present case the Court of Appeal took no notice of its former decision in Lain\u00e9 v. B\u00e9land ([45]). The Court of Review, per Pagnuelo J., in Leonard v. Boisvert ([46]), has recently expressed the opinion that the two decisions are contradictory, and gave its preference to Lain\u00e9 v. B\u00e9land (2). The decision of this court, dismissing this appeal, would widen the chaos of the jurisprudence in this very important matter.\nApart from this consideration, have the respondents established that, at the time of the incorporation, they were the proprietors of the machinery? It is admitted that the contract under which they claim this right was not signed at the date it bears, a fact which was, however, taken for granted by the Court of Appeal; it was signed some time afterwards, but how long after, whether before or after the incorporation does not clearly appear from the evidence. It was incumbent upon them to prove this fact beyond doubt, for the presumption of law is that the possessor is the proprietor of moveable property, or even improvements or constructions on the land. (Arts. 415 2194 and 2268 C. C.) To remove this legal presumption, they were bound to prove that, at the time the machinery was incorporated, it was their property under the contract. Mr. Waterous, the manager of the company, respondents, says that he cannot tell if the machinery had been placed in the mill when the contract was signed * and Kelly, the purchaser, says likewise that he cannot say when he signed the contract. And it must not be forgotten that a contract perfect in itself had been signed by both parties, containing no reservation whatever long before the machinery was delivered.\nBut this question of fact is not the important point at issue. Admitting that the contract relied upon by the respondents had been signed on the day it hears date, namely, on the 10th March, 1888, or at least before the delivery of the machinery and its incorporation with the building, can they revindicate the same as against an hypothecary creditor?\nThe Quebec Code, art. 379 says:\nMoveable things which a proprietor has placed on his real property for a permanency, or which he has incorporated therewith, are immoveable by their destination so long as they remain there\nThe French version says:\nLes objects mobiliers que le propri\u00e9taire a placss sur son fonds, etc.\nTherefore the only condition the Quebec law requires for incorporation, is that it should be done by the proprietor of the immoveable property, and for the very good reason that he is the best judge as to whether\n(1) See Cass. 20 Dec. 1875 S V. 76, 1, 208. the incorporation would improve his estate or not; it matters not however, whether the incorporation is to be permanent or only temporary; it will last so long as the moveable property is there.\nThere is marked difference between the French Code and the Quebec Code upon the subject. Article 524 of the French Code says '.\nLes objets que le propri\u00e9taire d'un fonds y a plac\u00e9s pour le service et l'exploitation de ce fonds, sont immeubles par destination, etc.\nNothing is said of the mere incorporation by the proprietor for a limited time. It is contended by some commentators that the French Code contemplates only permanent incorporations.\nThe French Code immediately adds:\nAinsi sont immeubles par destination, quand ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9s par le propri\u00e9taire pour le service et l'exploitation du fonds, etc.\nHere a doubt may be left open as to the meaning of the word \" proprietor.\" Does it mean the proprietor of the immoveable property, or the proprietor of the moveable property or both? I must confess that, in the second paragraph as in the first one, the French Code refers only to the proprietor of the immoveable property. The Quebec Code is not, however, open to any doubt; \"Thus,\" it declares, \"within these restrictions, the following and other like objects are immOveable \" etc. No reference is again made to the proprietor, and the point remains as determined by the first paragraph of the article. Therefore, the French authorities are not applicable in the province of Quebec. Their opinion is based upon the principle of the French Code that immobilization by destination can take place only when the moveable things have been placed on the immoveable property, \" pour le service et l'exploitation de ce fonds, or as explained. by many writers and decisions, for a permanency \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure, whereas, under the Quebec Code, it can also be effected by their mere incorporation \"therewith, \" with or without the intention of a permanency, \" so long as they remain there.\"\nThe only question under the Quebec Code is whether there was incorporation by the proprietor of the immoveable property. In this case, the incorporation was so complete that, without the machinery incorporated, the immoveable property would cease to exist as a saw-mill. So when a manufacturer, or any other person has leased or lent to the proprietor of a mill, for a certain time, the whole or part of a machinery required to run the same, it becomes immoveable by destination as to hypothecary creditors, if the proprietor of the immoveable property incorporates it therewith, either for a permanency or not, so long as it will remain there. We have so decided in Lain\u00e9 v. B\u00e9land ([47]) and if we had not done so we should so decide in the present case.\nEven in France, the jurisprudence and the text writers are far from being unanimous. A very interesting dissertation by DeVilleneuve will be found in Sirey, Recueil ([48]), in support of the contention of the appellants. The following decisions may also be quoted in their favour: Rej 9 Dec. 1835 ([49]); Rennes 31 Ao\u00fbt, 1864 ([50]); Cass. 20 D\u00e9c., 1875 ([51]); Amiens, 12 Mars, 1884; Cass. 16 Juin, 1885 ([52]); Bourges, 26 D\u00e9c., 1887 ([53]); Cass. 11 Janvier, 1887 ([54]); Cass. 17 Juillet 1895 ([55]).\nThe question in this cause is not whether the contract entered into was valid between the parties. This is not, and cannot be, disputed. The point is whether the machinery was immoveable by destination at least so far as hypothecary creditors are concerned. Mr. Justice Wurtele, who apparently expressed the views of the Court of Appeal, does not refer to article 379 of the Quebec Code, but merely repeats the definition by the French writers of the immobilization by destination, arguing, as they do, from a very different text of law. He says and this is the only part of his opinion which requires notice:\nMoveable things which are attached to a building or to the soil, to remain there 'permanently as an accessory, and which are fastened with. iron and nails or in such a way that they cannot be removed without breakage or destroying or deteriorating the building or property to which they are attached, become immoveable by destination. But in order to be so immobilized, it is necessary that they be placed m the building or on the land by its proprietor and also that they belong to him ([56]).\nBaudry-Lacantinerie does not express any opinion of his own; he merely reproduces, without comment, the decision of the Court of Lyons of the 10th of August,. 1888 ([57]) and so does Huc, in his recent commentary ([58]). No article of the French Code is quoted, and no-argument is offered. We are simply told that the law is so because that court has so decided. And likewise the judgment of the Court of Lyons is not based upon any article of the French Code, or any high judicial authority; it merely states, referring to the conditions reauired to constitute immobilization by destination:\nAttendu que la premiere de ces conditions est d'\u00eatre \u00e0 la fois propri\u00e9taire du fonds et de l'objet \u00e0 immobiliser lui-m\u00eame; que le locataire ne rend pas plus immeuble une chose mobili\u00e8re \u00e0 lui appartenant, et qu'il apporte dans un b\u00e2timent qui n'est pas le sien, que le propri\u00e9taire d'une usine ne rend immeuble une chose mobili\u00e8re de sa. nature non employ\u00e9e \u00e0 la construction et dont ii n'est possesseur qu'\u00e0 titre pr\u00e9caire.\nThe reasoning of this arr\u00eat is evidently bad. The French Code ([59]), says in express terms that immobilization by destination must be made by the proprietor of the land, but is silent as to the proprietor of the moveable effects immobilized. It is not therefore surprising that nearly all the commentators are likewise silent upon that point. For the same reason, it is not astonishing to notice that the reporter of the Lyons decision observes that the point is controverter and quotes many decisions even of the Court of Cassation, where the very opposite doctrine was maintained.\nLet us suppose, for argument's sake, that the French and Quebec Codes are alike; where is the authority to guide us in this conflict of legal opinions s For my own part, I do not feel inclined to adopt in preference the theories of writers however learned and popular they may be, when contradicted by a long array of decisions, and not supported by clear and sound arguments It is not my intention to review the French decisions on the subject, as I contend that our Code is diff\u00e9rent from the French Code it is sufficient to refer to them. I hope I will be excused for calling attention to the two last arr\u00eats of the Cour de Cassation quoted above the first rendered on the 11th of January, 1887 ([60]); and the second on the 11th of July 1895. ([61])\nIn the first case the manufacturer had supplied the machinery under the following stipulation:\nLes appareils d'installation resteront Ia propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Ia soci\u00e9t\u00e9, sau ou suivant les conditions pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l'article 8 ci-apr\u00e8s,\nwhich article provided that the proprietor of the mill might become proprietor of the machinery on payment of certain sums of money payable at fixed periods. It was further agreed that until full payment the latter was mere tenant of the machinery and was bound to pay a certain rent. It was held:\nAttendu qu'il n'est point contest\u00e9 que les appareils fournis par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 francaise la Diffusion aient \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9s dans l'usine de Montfourny pour le service et l'exploitation de la dite usine, et soient ainsi devenus immeuble par destination; Attendu que l'action en resolution des ventes de meubles, comme le privil\u00e8ge \u00e9tabli par l'art. 2102 s. 4, C. civ., ne peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 au prejudice des cr\u00e9anciers ayant hypoth\u00e8que sur l'immeuble dont les meubles vendus sont devenus les accessoires; qu'en effet cet exercice serait contraire \u00e0 l'art 524 C. civ. et \u00e0 tout le syst\u00e8me hypoth\u00e9caire; qu'il suit de l\u00e0 qu'en repoussant la demande de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 francaise la Diffusion l'arr\u00eat attaqu\u00e9 n'a viol\u00e9 ou faussement appliqu\u00e9 aucun des articles cit\u00e9s, et a fait, au contraire, une juste application des principles en la mati\u00e8re.\nIn a foot note the reporter says:\n(6) En ce sens: Cass., 9 juin 1847. Rivi\u00e8re, Code civ. ann., sur l'art. 2102 note K.\u2014Rennes, 31 ao\u00fbt 1864, S. V. 65,2,111, P. 65, 490.Comp. Cass. 9 d\u00e9cembre 1835, S. V. 36,1,177.\u2014Rivi\u00e8re. Jurispr. de la Cour de cassation n. 558 et suiv.\u2014Cependant la question est controvers\u00e9e, mais plus g\u00e9neralement r\u00e9solue dans le sens ci-dessus. (V. Tabee g\u00e9n., Devill. et Gillo, v\u00b0. Privil\u00e8ges, n. 115 et suiv.; R\u00e9p. g\u00e9n. Pal., et Suppl. eod. verbo, 360 et suiv.; Marcad\u00e9, t.

III p. 409, s. 284, Art. 4, p. 400, s. 356; Pont, Priv. et hyp. n. 156).\nThe second arr\u00eat is more remarkable as the contest was not with a hypothecary creditor, but with ordinary creditors. It was held:\nLes tribunaux ont le droit d'appr\u00e9cier souverainement le v\u00e9ritable caract\u00e8re des conventions, sans s'arr\u00eater \u00e0 Ia qualification qui leur a \u00e9t\u0141 donn\u00e9e par les parties.\nEn mati\u00e8re de liquidation judiciaire ou de faillite, il peut \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'un acte qualifi\u00e9 bail, constatant la location de certains meubles trouv\u00e9s en la possession du failli, avec reserve de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 jusqu'au paiement int\u00e9gral de loyers stipul\u00e9s, est fictif et contient en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 une vente ferme et \u00e0 credit, qui n'est pas opposable aux autres cr\u00e9anciers de la faillite. (C. Com. Art. 550.)\nSome allusion has been made to the recent decision of the Court of Review sitting in Montreal, in Leonard v Boisvert ([62]). It was stated at the heating that only Mr. Justice Pagnuelo criticised the decision of the Court of Appeal in this case. True, Mr. Justice Jett\u00e9 .and Mr. Justice Doherty made some reservation as to some remarks of Mr. Justice Pagnuelo bearing upon another branch of the case; hut, upon the point as to whether the moveable effects were immoveable by destination, the judges were unanimous, although the incorporation had been made by one who at the time had sold the immoveable property subject to a facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9. Mr. Justice Pagnuelo, after having recited the contract, said:\nLe contrat de vente (that is of the machinery) n'est donc ni Suspendu, ni r\u00e9solu. L'objet de Ia clause ne serait que de conserver aux vendeurs un privil\u00e8ge sur la chose pour le paiement du prix, privil\u00e8ge exorbitant du droit commun quant aux tiers (Art. 2000 C. C.)\nNous sommes unanimes sur ce point. et ce sera le motif don\u00e9\u00e9 pour infirmer le jugement.\nMr. Justice Jett\u00e9, speaking for himself and Mr. Justice Doherty, said:\nPour la majorit\u00e9 de Ia cour, l'hon. juge Doherty et moi, il ne se pr\u00e9sente, dans l'esp\u00e8ce, qu'une simple question d'appr\u00e9ciation du contrat fait entre le demandeur et le d\u00e9fendeur, Adoiphe Boisvert. Ce contrat, suivant nous, n'\u00e9tait pas suffisant pour conserver au demandeur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 des engins et machines vendues, jusqu'au , paiement du prix. C'est l\u00e0, par consequent, le seul point que d\u00e9cide-le jugement de cette cour, et M. le juge Doherty et moi, desirons faire les reserves les plus absolues quant aux autres questions discut\u00e9es par notre honorable coll\u0141gue M. le juge Pagnuelo.\nThe contract in this case is stated in the head note of the report and in the opinion of Mr. Justice Pagnuelo as follows:\nIt is distinctly understood and agreed that the property in the goods. so to be furnished by you (Leonard) to me (Boisvert), is not to pass to me until you are fully paid the price for same and that the notes so to be given are to be held by you as collateral security in respect of such purchase money. If default be made in the payment of said notes, or if the said goods are attempted to be disposed of by me or are seized in execution in respect of any debt due by me, then you are at liberty to take possession of the goods and re-sell the same by public auction or private sale, crediting me with the proceeds only less all expenses.\nThe ground of the judgment is as follows:\nConsidering that the effect of said stipulation was at most to give plaintiffs a personal right against said Boisvert to enforce their claim for the price of said effects, by bringing said goods to sale without resorting to judicial proceedings, and that said stipulation had Dot the effect of making the passing to said Boisvert of the property in the effects sold, subject to the payment in full of the price thereof as a suspensive condition and preventing the passing of said property to Boisvert until said price was paid, etc.\nTaking for granted that Boisvert was proprietor of the mill within the meaning of article 379 C. C, this decision is undoubtedly correct, and is in accord with Lain\u00e9 v. B\u00e9land ([63]), and the Quebec Code. Under that Code, as already observed, permanency or perp\u00e9tuelle demeure is not necessary to constitute immobilization by destination; it may also result from the mere incorporation with the immoveable property by its proprietor The erroneous notion of immobilization by destinatonn under the Quebec Code was the cause of the error in the judgment of the Court of Appeal. It also explains why, in Quebec, Baudry-Lacantinerie, or any other French authority does not apply even to cases of immobilization by means of a permanency, or \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuelle demeure, because article 379 of the Quebec Code shows that the immobilization of moveable things in all cases takes place as a matter of fact, \" so long as they remain there,\" irrespective of the intention of the proprietor of the immoveable property or of his rights to the moveable things, so far at least as third parties are concerned; provided of course, I am willing to concede for the purposes of this case, the incorporation is made with the consent express or implied of the proprietor of the moveable effects.\nTrue art. 1027 of the Quebec Code enacts that sales are perfect not only between contracting parties, but also as to third parties by mere consent, but they are\nsubject in contracts for the transfer of immoveable property, to the special provisions contained in this Code for the registration of titles to and claims upon such property. Of course, the rights of the respondents were perfect, so long as their machinery remained moveable property, but the moment it became immoveable by destination or otherwise, their rights became subject to the special provisions of the Code respecting immoveable property, as the Court of Appeal and this court decided in Lain\u00e9 v B\u00e9land ([64]).\nSome arguments have been advanced that the pro- prietors of the mill could not grant or create greater rights than they had. We have also answered this objection in Lain\u00e9 v. B\u00e9land (1). In the latter case the proprietor of the mill was not proprietor of the machinery, yet we held that the hypothec extended to it as being immoveable by destination. In Thibau--deau v. Mailley. Re Steele ([65]), the Court of Appeal composed of Dorion C.J., Ramsay, Tessier, Cross and Baby JJ., went so far as to hold that, when the incorporation of the machinery has been made by a mere tenant of the immoveable property who subsequently became proprietor thereof, the sale of the machinery by the tenant while mere tenant, conveyed nothing as against a creditor who had obtained a hypothec after the tenant became proprietor of the land.\nThis decision was undoubtedly correct. As Laurent vol. 30, no. 233, points out:\nVainement l'acheteur dirait-il que la vente seule mobilise les immeubles par destination; cela est vrai entre les parties cela n'est pas vrai \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du cr\u00e9ancier \u00a1hypoth\u00e9caire qui a un droit reel dans la chose, droit qu'il conserve tant que la chose est attach\u00e9e au fonds\nIf the machinery had been incorporated without the consent or the knowledge of its proprietor, some serious argument might be offered that it did not take place, although I do not wish to express any opinion upon this point. in this ease, we have the formal acquiescence of the proprietor of the machinery to its incorporation; it was even done by him, and so we have the proof that the incorporation was made by both the proprietor of the real property and the owner of the moveable effects. Therefore the respondents must have known that by doing so, it became part of the real estate par destination, and subject to mortgages, liens and alienations generally\nThe respondents are estopped from invoking their contract in this respect. They are supposed to know the laws of Quebec as to immoveables by destination and hypothecs. Their contract protected them so long as the machinery was moveable property, but not so when it had ceased to be. Estoppel is not peculiar to the English system of laws; it is known in Quebec by the name of acquiescement.\nIt is said that the presumption of acquiescence is rebutted by the very terms of the contract. The contract is, however, perfectly silent as to the. incorporation by the respondents of the machinery with the building. Likewise are the specifications attached to the contract, or any other specifications subsequently asreed to. The evidence does not show that it was at first intended that the machinery was to be placed by the respondents. Beer their millwright, sent several months after the sale to place the machinery, states that the placing had been partly done before he arrived at Joliette.\nIf we decide that, in a case like the present one, hypothecary creditors h ave no lien upon the machinery which has been incorporated with the mill, we destroy the whole economy of Quebec real estate system. Even a purchaser in good faith, who has carefully examined the premises and the books of the registry office will be exposed sooner or later to find that the most valuable part of the estate he intended to acquire is gone. Such was not the intention of the legislature and is not the law. We must not overlook article 2017 of the Civil Code:\nHypothec is indivisible and subsists m entirety upon all the immoveables made liable, upon each of them and upon every portion thereof. Hypothec extends over all subsequent improvements or increase by alluvion of the property hypothecated.\nThe Code does not distinguish as to the party who makes these improvements, yet we are now told that the hypothec does not extend over improvements made before or after it was created, which are not the property of the proprietor of the immoveable. We have decided otherwise in Lain\u00e9 v. B\u00e9land ([66]).\nThe Code has provided for only one exception to the rule that a hypothec extends to all the improvements, and that is when the third party is a tiers d\u00e9tenteur or in possession of the immoveable as proprietor; and then he cannot remove the improvements he has made while such proprietor; he has merely \" a right to retain the property,\" until he is reimbursed. Art.418. Expressio unius exclusio est alterius.\nIt must be noted that one of the mortgages held by the appellants was created in 1884, long before the sale by the respondents.\nIf the decision of the Court of Appeal be allowed to stand as law, bondholders, secured by mortgages on railways or mills and factories in the province of Quebec, have no security upon the rolling stock or machinery which might have been supplied under contracts and circumstances similar to those alleged by the respondents. If the law be so, parties, dealing with proprietors of mills, factories and railways, must make an inquiry into the actual position, as a matter of fact, of the machinery, rolling stock and other accessories, and satisfy themselves that they are the property of the proprietor of the land, an inquiry which is far from being a safe guide, as the present case proves. Two deeds or memoranda of sale were made, one with a reservation as to the ownership of the things sold till full payment was made, and the other without any such reservation. The mortgage creditor or even the vendee, upon production of the latter document, might naturally consider himself perfectly secured, but he will soon, and unfortunately too late, discover that another deed with a suspensive clause was signed sometime afterwards, at least before the moveable effects were placed. Can such a state of affairs be authorized by law? I answer no, without hesitation, at least so far as hypothecary creditors are concerned, which is the only point before us.\nTo hold that the respondents continued to remain proprietors, is to introduce a system far more dangerous than that of chattel mortgages, for at least there some publication is necessary and the public can protect itself, but here no protection is possible.\nCourts of justice should hesitate before giving to a clear and complete text of law an interpretation so pregnant with disastrous consequences to the community. Article 379 is not open to such unreasonable construction; quite the reverse. It merely requires that the incorporation be made by the proprietor of the immoveable property, whether for a permanency or a term, and is entirely silent as to the proprietor of the moveable things incorporated; and I think that it is the duty of courts of justice to apply the law as they find it.\nFor these reasons, and without expressing any opinion as to the rights of chirographary creditors in a case like the present one, I have come to the conclusion that Lain\u00e9 v. B\u00e9land ([67]) decides this case, and that the appeal ought to be allowed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: B\u00e9ique, Lafontaine, Tuvgeon & Robertson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Greenshields, Green-shields, Laflamme & Glass.\n[1] Q.

The mortgage after reciting the terms of the lease proceeded to convey to the mortgagee the indenture and the benefit of all covenants and agreements therein, the leased property by description and \u201call and singular the engines and boilers which now are or shall at any time hereafter be brought and placed upon or affixed to the said premises, all of which said engines and boilers are hereby declared to be and form part of the said leasehold premises hereby granted and mortgaged or intended so to be and form part of the term hereby granted and mortgaged;\u201d the habendum of the mortgage was: \u201cTo have and to hold unto the said mortgagee, their successors and assigns for the residue yet to come and unexpired of the term of years created by the said lease less one day thereof and all renewals, etc.\u201d\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the court of appeal, that the premises of the said mortgage above referred to contained an express assignment of the whole term, and the habendum, if intended to reserve a portion to the mortgagor, was repugnant to the said premises and therefore void; that the words \u201cleasehold premises\u201d were quite sufficient to carry the whole term, the word \u201cpremises\u201d not meaning lands or property but referring to the recital which described the lease as one for a term of twenty-one years.\nHeld further, that the habendum did not reserve a reversion to the mortgagor; that the reversion of a day generally without stating it to be the last day of the term is insufficient to give the instrument the character of a sub-lease. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing the judgment of the Common Pleas Division in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe appellant Jameson having leased certain premises in Toronto to one Armstrong for a term of twenty-one years, with a covenant for renewal, Armstrong mortgaged the lease to the respondents and the sole question is whether such mortgage operated as an assignment of the whole term or a sub-lease. The material portions of the mortgage are set out in the judgment of the court.\nThe Divisional Court held the mortgage to be an assignment. The Court of Appeal reversed this judgment, being of opinion that there was a reversion of part of the term to the mortgagor.\nArmour Q.C. and Irving for the appellant. The grant of the \u201cleasehold premises\u201d in the mortgage refers to the recital and is sufficient to pass the whole term. Germaine v. Orchard[2]; Goodtitle v. Gibbs[3]; Roddington v. Robinson[4].\nThe habendum contains no reservation. Reserving a day generally is not sufficient. It should be the last day. Doe Meyers v. Marsh[5]; Smith v. Cooke[6].\nArnoldi Q.C. for the respondent cited Burton v. Barclay[7]; Barthel v. Scotten[8].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014On the 1st of January, 1889, the appellant executed an indenture of lease of certain land and buildings in the city of Toronto whereby he demised the same to one James Rogers Armstrong for a term of twenty-one years, reserving an annual rent of $1,400. The lease contained the usual covenants, a covenant on the part of the lessee not to assign or sublet without license, and a covenant for renewal. This latter covenant which is very material to the question raised by the appeal, was in the following words:\nThe said lessor for himself, his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, covenants and agrees with the said lessee, his executors, administrators and assigns, in the manner following: That the said lessee, his executors, administrators or assigns, duly and regularly paying the said rent and performing all and every the covenants, provisoes and agreements herein contained on his part to be paid and performed, the said lessor, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, will at the expiration of the term hereby granted, or any renewal or renewals thereof, grant to the said lessee, his executors, administrators or assigns, a renewal lease of the said hereby demised premises for a further term of twenty-one years, such renewal lease to contain the same covenants, provisoes and conditions as are contained in these presents, and at a certain rent payable (except as to the amount thereof) as before provided, the amount of such rent on every renewal of the said term (if it cannot be agreed upon), to be ascertained by three arbitrators.\nOn the 22nd of March, 1889, James Rogers Armstrong, the lessee in the before mentioned lease, executed a mortgage in favour of the respondents of the lease and leasehold premises to secure the payment of the sum of $4,000 lent and advanced by the respondents to the mortgagor. This mortgage (as well as a subsequent mortgage by way of further charge identical in terms with the first and to which further reference need not be made) was by indenture made between Armstrong and the respondents. The respondents contend that according to the proper construction, it took effect by way of sub-lease reserving a reversion to the mortgagor. On the other hand the appellant, the lessor, contends that it operated as an assignment of the whole term, and that the respondents as assignees are consequently liable upon the covenants to pay rent. Mr. Justice Robertson, before whom the action was tried, was of the opinion that the instrument operated by way of assignment, and pronounced judgment for the appellant accordingly. The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment, the learned Chief Justice of Ontario doubting but not dissenting.\nThe solution of the question raised depends entirely on the construction of the mortgage deed already referred to.\nThe material parts of this deed to be considered, for the purpose of determining its character as a sub-lease or an assignment, are the recital, the part of the deed called by conveyancers the premises, and the habendum. I, therefore, set forth these several clauses in extenso. The recital is as follows:\nWhereas by indenture of lease bearing date the first day of January, 1889, and made between Philip Jameson, of the said city of Toronto, merchant, as lessor, and the said mortgagor as lessee, the said Philip Jameson demised unto the said mortgagor, his executors, administrators and assigns, the lands hereinafter mentioned for the term of twenty-one years from the first day of January, 1889, subject to the rents, covenants and conditions therein reserved and contained and with the rights of renewal therein contained.\nThe premises are in these words:\nNow, therefore, this indenture witnesseth that in consideration of four thousand dollars of lawful money of Canada now paid by the said mortgagees to the said mortgagor (the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged), the said mortgagor doth grant and mortgage unto the said mortgagees, their successors and assigns for ever, all and singular the said indenture of lease and the benefit of all covenants and agreements therein contained, and all that certain parcel or tract of land and premises situate lying and being in the city of Toronto, in the county of York, being composed of lots numbers five and six on the south side of Queen street according to registered plan 14, together with all and singular the engines and boilers which now are or shall at any time hereafter be brought upon and placed upon or affixed to the said premises, all of which said engines and boilers are hereby declared to be and form part of the said leasehold premises hereby granted and mortgaged or intended so to be and be and form part of the term hereby granted and mortgaged. The habendum which immediately follows the premises, is thus expressed:\nTo have and to hold unto the said mortgagees, their successors and assigns for the residue yet to come and unexpired of the term of years created by the said lease, less one day thereof, and all renewals and substituted estates and rights of renewal and other interest of him the said mortgagor or which he may hereafter acquire therein. Together with all the outhouses, outbuildings, easements and appurtenances thereto belonging or now in anywise used or enjoyed in connection with the said premises by the said mortgagor.\nI am of opinion that the first judgment was right, and that the decision of the Court of Appeal cannot be supported. The contention of the respondent was that the premises did not contain an express assignment, but merely an assignment by implication, and that therefore there was no repugnancy between the premises and the habendum, that consequently the latter clause governed, and that by its terms there was a clear reservation of a reversion to the mortgagor, the result being that the instrument operated as a mortgage by way of sub-lease, and not as an assignment. There can be no doubt that if the premises of the deed did contain an express assignment of the whole term, the habendum, construing it as reserving a reversion to the mortgagor, would be repugnant and void. In order, however, to arrive at this conclusion we must find that there is in the premises an explicitly declared intention to assign the whole term. The Court of Appeal considered that the words were to be construed as an assignment in the first place of the indenture, by which the lease was effected as a document of title merely, and of some certain and undefined interest in the parcels described, and that there was no assignment of the term. I cannot agree in this conclusion. The words \u201cleasehold premises,\u201d in my opinion, are quite sufficient to carry the whole term. We must attribute to the word \u201cpremises,\u201d in this formal instrument its proper, legal and technical signification, and not read it as synonomous with \u201clands\u201d or \u201cproperty,\u201d as it is, I admit, commonly used in popular language. Then what do these words mean? The word \u201cpremises\u201d clearly has reference to the recital in which the lease is described as a lease for a term of 21 years. The words \u201cleasehold premises,\u201d must, therefore, be read as referring to and including this term, and this part of the deed must be held to contain an express assignment of the whole term with which an habendum so limited as to leave a reversion in the mortgagor would be inconsistent, and, therefore, void for repugnancy. The case of Germaine v. Orchard, in the House of Lords, reported in the 3rd (p. 222) vol. of Salkeld, and in Showers Parliamentary Cases (p. 252), is an express authority directly in point and undistinguishable from the present case. It is true Germaine v. Orchard is an old case, but it has, so far as I can find, never been called in question, but has been recognized in modern decisions, and also very lately by such authoritative writers on conveyancing as Mr. Challis[9], and Sir Howard Elphinstone[10]. It is also cited by Preston[11], as a governing authority. Therefore, assuming the construction that the respondent asks us to place upon the habendum to be correct, it would be void for the reasons stated.\nThis, however, is not the only reason why I find it impossible to uphold the judgment under appeal. The habendum itself does not reserve a reversion to the mortgagor. If we read it as doing so, we make it inconsistent with itself and therefore void. See per Robinson C.J., Doe Meyers v. Marsh[12]; Touchstone[13]. If we are to construe the words \u201cless one day thereof,\u201d as meaning the last day of the term, as we necessarily must do if we are to give effect to the respondent\u2019s proposition that there was a reservation of a reversion, we bring these words into direct conflict with other terms of the habendum and thus introduce that repugnancy which must be fatal to it. This is apparent in two respects. The habendum expressly includes \u201call renewals and substituted estates and rights of renewal, and other interests of him the said mortgagor, which he may hereafter acquire therein.\u201d\nNow in the first place, if we turn to the renewal clause in the lease above set forth, we find that no right of renewal is to arise until the expiration of the lease, so that if we are to consider the last day of the term as reserved to the mortgagor the right of renewal, as between the lessor and the lessee and those claiming under the latter, would be in the lessee himself and not in his mortgagees. This shows conclusively, in my opinion, that it was intended by this part of the habendum that the mortgagees should have the whole term in them including the last day an interpretation essential to qualify them to exercise the right of renewal. This is strengthened by the second and other argument drawn from the words \u201cand other interests of him the said mortgagor\u201d which are utterly inconsistent with the retention by the latter of a reversion. In order to avoid this repugnancy we must, therefore, construe the reservation of a day generally (without saying the last day of the term), as meaning the first day after the execution of the mortgage. Preston[14], as high an authority as any which could be quoted on such a point, has this passage:\nIn order that an instrument may operate as an under-lease, a reversion must be retained by the former owner and consequently the under-lease must be for a period less in point of time than the term or estate of the lessor, or when the grant is for the residue of the term of the grantor, there must be an exception of the last day or the last hour, or of some other period of the term. This exception as well as a grant made for part only of the period during which the estate of the grantor is to continue, will leave a reversion in the grantor. It is material that the instrument shall reserve the last portion of the estate for an instrument may, it should seem, operate as an assignment notwithstanding it reserves a portion of the estate, being the first part of it as in the case of an assignment to hold from a day to come or from an event to happen unless it is to happen after the death of a person by express limitation.\nThus it will be seen that even as regards an habendum which contains no terms inconsistent with a day generally reserved being construed as the last day of the term Preston considers such a general reservation insufficient to give the character of a sub-lease. Then a fortiori must this be so if to construe such a general reservation would make the habendum itself irreconcilable with the express provisions to be found (as in the present case) in the habendum clause itself.\nAgain the same writer (Preston) says[15]:\nAfter the under-lease is made by a term for years the grantor has in point of estate not merely and simply the residue of the time of his original term; he has the same measure of time, duration of interest and estate as he had prior to the under-lease subject only to that lease. The sole effect of the under-lease is to confer a right to the possession or other beneficial enjoyment during the term granted by the under-lease; and the lessor in the under-lease retains by way of seigniory or reversion his original ownership, subject only to the right conferred by the under-lease.\nThis is undoubtedly a correct definition of the estates and relative rights in the term of a lessee and under-lessee. Then how can it possibly be said that an habendum which grants, as the present habendum does, all the interests of the lessee as well as those he may subsequently acquire, is susceptible, consistently with Preston\u2019s definition, of being construed as creating not an assignment, but a mere under\u2013lease.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs and the judgment of Mr. Justice Robertson restored.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Kilmer & Irving.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Howland, Arnoldi & Bristol.\n[1] 23 Ont.

The courts below held that the will was valid.\nHeld, affirming such decisions, that as the evidence of the relationship of the alleged grantors to the deceased was only hearsay and the best evidence had not been adduced; that as the heirship at law was dependent upon the alleged heir having survived his father and it was not established and the court would not presume that his father died before him; and that as the persons claiming under the will had no information as to the identity of the parties in interest who were represented in the transactions by men of straw, one of whom was alleged to be a trustee, and there was no evidence as to the nature of his trust and there was strong suspicion of the existence of champerty or maintenance on the part of the persons attacking the will, the latter had failed to establish the title of the persons under whom they claimed and the appeal should be dismissed. APPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], which affirmed the judgment of the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice[2], dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action with costs.\nThe appellant brought his action claiming title to certain lands under the heirs-at-law of William Pidgen, deceased, and to have an alleged will and sheriff\u2019s deed upon which the respondent\u2019s title depended, set aside.\nThe will is as follows:\u2014\u201cI, William Pidgen, of the Township of Etobicoke, in the County of York, Yeoman, do declare this to be my last will and testament revoking all others by me heretofore made. It is my will that as to all my estate both real and personal, whether in possession expectancy or otherwise which I may die possessed of, my wife Elizabeth, and I hereby appoint my said wife Elizabeth, to be executrix of this my will,\u201d and is in the testator\u2019s own handwriting.\nThe plaintiff contended that the will was void for uncertainty and that the deed from the sheriff was illegally and irregularly issued. The courts below held that the will was valid and gave the lands in fee simple to the testator\u2019s wife under whom the respondents claim their title to the lands in question.\nDonovan for the appellant.\nShepley Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal must be dismissed. In the first place the appellant failed to give proper evidence establishing the title of the persons under whom he claims as heirs at law of William Pidgen, deceased. The only proof of the relationship of the persons who were the grantors in the alleged conveyance of the 20th June, 1894, to Walter J. Kilner, to be found in the record, is that contained in the deposition of the witness William Pidgen. This young man who was only twenty years old when he left England in 1890, assumes to give the history of his father\u2019s family; but he discloses in his evidence that what he knew of it he only learned from other persons, in other words, that his evidence was mere hearsay consisting of statements which his father, who was still living, had made to him. Thus for instance, on re-examination by the counsel for the plaintiff, he is asked \u201cIs it possible that one of the brothers or sisters named by my learned friend, left any children?\u201d And this question being objected to, the following evidence is given.\nQ. If they had any children would you have heard of it? A. Yes.\nQ. Did you ever hear that they had no children? A. I heard my father say that all that were left were the ones that I mentioned.\nQ. You heard that they did not leave any children? A. Yes.\nQ. And that those persons you have named were the only survivors of William Pidgen? A. Yes, the ones I have mentioned were the only ones that were related to him.\nThis, as the respondent in his factum insists, is of course not the proper way to prove pedigree which includes heirship or descent. In such cases it is true that hearsay evidence of a peculiar kind is admissible, but this is limited to declarations made by a person who is proved, by evidence aliunde his own statements, to be a relation of the parties of whose existence or death he spoke, and who is himself deceased, for nothing can be better established than that such declarant, if living, must himself be called as a witness, and that his declarations are in that case inadmissible. There could be no possible difficulty in examining Thomas Pidgen, the father of the witness, in England, under a commission before which, in the present state of the law, he might have been compelled by process to appear. This principle of the law of evidence is so elementary that it scarcely requires any reference to authority. Taylor[3] and Greenleaf[4] may, however, be referred to as stating this rule of evidence which prevails in America as well as in England.\nAnother defect in the proof of descent is this. When William Pidgen died in 1878 the law of Ontario on the subject of the descent of real property was regulated by the Act of 1852, and under that Act, William Pidgen having died without issue, his heir at law was his father, if living. The age of William Pidgen is nowhere stated, and even if it were, we cannot presume that his father died before him. There is, therefore, really nothing to shew that the persons mentioned in the deposition of the witness William Pidgen, ever had any interest whatever in these lands. The respondent has taken the objection to the sufficiency of the proof of heirship upon the first point very precisely in his factum, and I can see no answer to it. It constitutes therefore, by itself, a sufficient answer to this appeal and as such must prevail.\nI could not, however, assent to a judgment for the appellant even if I thought the plaintiff had proved his title, and that all the defences pleaded had failed. In such case, I should have been of opinion that the respondent was entitled to a new trial on the ground that evidence had been improperly rejected.\nI think for several reasons the defendant was entitled to be informed who the party in interest, represented in the somewhat unusual transactions respecting this property by such men of straw as Kilner and May, really was. The defendant was entitled to know with whom he was really and actually contending, in order that he might be able in future to protect himself from further litigation by the parties having the beneficial interest. He was also entitled to know the terms of the trust under which Kilner held the land in order that he might be assured that the conveyance from Kilner to May was not in breach of trust, for if it were such, and so not binding on the beneficiary, a judgment in this action either way would not be conclusive on the cestui que trust, and not being conclusive, would leave the defendant exposed to future litigation by the beneficial owner.\nThen for another reason evidence which was rejected ought to have been received. The acquisition of this land under the purchase from the alleged heirs at law was a very exceptional, not to say a suspicious, transaction, which in my opinion the defendant was entitled to have thoroughly probed on cross-examination, by way of testing the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s proof of title, if for no other reason. Aside from this, however, altogether, there was on the record a defence distinctly pleaded setting up the illegality of the transfer of title from Kilner to May, by reason of champerty or maintenance. I am not at all sure that, as it is, on the evidence of Kilner and May taken in conjunction with that of Merritt A. Brown, this defence was not established, but I do not proceed on that ground, in dismissing the appeal. I am, however, clear that the defendant was entitled to have answers to many of the questions which were put by his counsel which were overruled. I refer particularly to questions put to the witnesses Kilner, May, Brown and especially to the witness Donovan, who was also counsel for the plaintiff at the trial.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Joseph A.

He did not apply to the School Board or the caretaker in charge of the premises before making his visit.\nHeld, that in thus voluntarily visiting the premises for his own purposes and without notice to the occupants, he assumed all risks of danger from the condition of the premises and could not recover damages.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], which reversed the judgment entered upon the verdict rendered in the trial court for the plaintiff for $5,700 damages and costs.\nA statement of the circumstances and questions at issue in this case will be found in the judgment of the court now reported.\nMcCarthy Q.C. for the appellant.\nRobinson Q.C. and Hodgins for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nKING J.\u2014This appeal is from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario setting aside a judgment recovered in the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench and dismissing the action.\nThe action was originally brought by one Benjamin Rogers, since deceased, to recover damages for an injury sustained by falling into a furnace pit in the basement of Ryerson school building, in the city of Toronto. During pendency of the action the plaintiff died, and his widow and executrix was substituted as plaintiff under the provisions of R.S.O. ch. 110, sec. 9.\nRogers was yardmaster for the firm of Elias Rogers & Co., coal merchants, at Toronto, who had a contract with defendants for supplying all the coal for the school for the year beginning June, 1894. It was provided by the contract that the coal was to be delivered at such times and places, and in such manner and quantities, as might be directed by the supply committee and in terms of the tender, whereby it was stipulated that it was to be stored in the basement or wood-shed of the schools, under the inspection of an inspector or inspectors appointed by the supply committee, and to be subject to the approval of said committee.\nThe defendants notified the contractors that they would accept delivery of the coal for the Ryerson school on the 17th July. It was part of Rogers\u2019 duty to supervise this work on his employers\u2019 behalf. Their business was large, and he had to lay out the daily work of the carters and labourers, and, in doing this, it was advantageous to examine the places in which the coal was to be stored. Accordingly, he went to the Ryerson school building on the 16th July, between 7.30 and 8 p.m., to see (as he says) \u201cwhat was the condition of the place for the delivery of the coal, and whether he would have to send an extra man up or not.\u201d During the day the defendants sent one Lindsay to notify the caretaker of the school that the delivery would be going on the next day. When Lindsay got to the caretaker\u2019s he found that his arm was broken, and Crawford, the caretaker, asked Lindsay to telephone to Mr. Bishop, the superintendent of buildings, to see if he could send a man to receive the coal as he was not in a fit state to receive it. Lindsay did so, and was himself appointed in Crawford\u2019s place to receive the coal.\nThe defendants were not advised beforehand of Rogers\u2019 visit to the school building. What took place when he got there is stated without material variation by Rogers, Mrs. Crawford, and by one Rooney, who had been employed a year or two before for a few weeks to act as caretaker during Crawford\u2019s illness, but who was not then in the employment of the board, and had called merely to see Crawford on account of his injury.\nWhen Rogers reached the premises he went to the cottage of the caretaker and inquired of a woman whom he supposed to be, and who was, Mrs. Crawford as to where Crawford was. His wife said that he had broken his arm and was in bed. Rogers said that he had coal to deliver the next day, and that he had come to see where it was to go in. Mrs. Crawford pointed to three windows in the basement of the school building, and Rogers then said that he would like to see where it was to be stored. Rooney then came forward and volunteered to go with him.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s account is as follows:\nI walked over to the caretaker\u2019s house, and the caretaker\u2019s wife, I took it to be, was standing at the door, and I asked for the caretaker, and she explained that he had broken his arm, and that he was in bed; just at that time I stated my business.\nQ. Tell us what you said. A. I said I had called to see where the coal was to be delivered, and then this young man came out.\nQ. What did she say? A. She said nothing, only that her husband was in bed with a broken arm. I do not remember that she said anything else; and then this young man came out of the door at the time and he says \u201cI will go with you\u201d and so he went with me. Rooney says that to the best of his opinion he did not get the key from any one, and that the door was open.\nAt the foot of the stairs leading down into the basement there is a partition, and through it a door opening inwards. Directly opposite this doorway was an unfenced furnace pit, the space between which and the door, when opened, was quite narrow. Rogers knew nothing of the pit, and, as it was quite dusky, did not perceive it, and was not warned of it, and without any negligence on his part fell into it and was seriously injured.\nThe Chief Justice of the Queen\u2019s Bench directed the jury that if the plaintiff went to the schoolhouse in and about the reasonable performance of the contract which his employers had for the delivery of the coal and storing it in the basement, then he would be there by the implied invitation of the School Board, and the law in regard to an invitation of that kind applies.\nThe obligation of an occupier of premises to one whom he expressly or impliedly invites to come before them for the purposes in which the occupier has an interest is to take, by himself and servants, reasonable care that the person so coming shall not be exposed to unusual danger. The premises are to be in a reasonably safe condition, or, if otherwise, notice is to be given of their condition. The rules of law as to the responsibility of a principal for the negligence of a servant extend to the performance of his obligation. Circumstances giving rise, ordinarily, to the obligation would have existed if Rogers had gone upon the premises on the 17th in performance of the contract. It is unnecessary to say how it might have been if Crawford had known of Rogers\u2019 visit on the 16th, and had admitted him to the premises, or permitted him to enter. But Crawford, although upon the premises, knew nothing of Rogers being at the house until after the accident. The building was not one that was open to the public, and so far as regards the performance of the coal contract, it had been declared, in effect, that it would be open to the contractors for such purpose only from the 17th of July. The right of the defendant to enter it would then depend upon getting other permission to do so.\nThe evidence is insufficient to show that Mrs. Crawford was recognized by the board as acting caretaker. It was but that day that Crawford had notified them of his injury, and requested the appointment of another to take delivery of the coal. It also appears that on a former occasion of his illness a temporary caretaker had been appointed. Without some evidence tending to show authority to Mrs. Crawford, or recognition of her agency, the permission (if such it was) of Mrs. Crawford to plaintiff to enter the building was an unauthorized act not binding the defendants. The defence is substantial, for it may well be conceived that the caretaker would not have permitted the entering of the basement at such a late hour without precautions being taken for safety.\nThe reasonable conclusion is that, with knowledge that he had not the permission of the caretaker, Rogers took the chance of going into the basement at a time when the light of day had almost disappeared, under the guidance of a volunteer who unfortunately was not as cautious as he ought to have been.\nWith these views the judgment below ought to be affirmed and the appeal dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McCarthy, Osler, Hoskin & Creelman.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McMurrich, Coatsworth & Hodgins.\n[1] 23 Ont.

The action was brought to test the validity of the assessment for taxes of the appellant\u2019s mains and pipes laid under the surface of the public places, roads and tramways, of the city of Toronto, and used to supply gas to consumers. The questions were raised by suit to recover $7,940, amount of taxes paid by appellants under protest upon such assessment for the year 1894.\nThe parties to the action agreed upon a special case which was in effect as follows:\u2014\nThe appellant has the right to lay mains and pipes upon and under the streets and highways of the city of Toronto, as provided by its Act of incorporation and the Acts amending the same, and thereby to convey gas manufactured by it at its works situate in ward 2 of the said city, to the consumers upon properties fronting or abutting upon the various streets and highways of the said city, and the said company, pursuant to such powers, did lay such mains and pipes from its works, which mains and pipes were in the year 1893 of at least the value of $500,000.\nDuring the year 1893 the Board of Assessors of the city of Toronto assessed the said company, for 1894, in the Assessment Roll, for said ward 2, as shewn in the Assessment Roll, and in the sum of $653,000, (increased by County Judge to $717,590,) set out under the column headed \u201cValue of Buildings\u201d was included the sum of $500,000 in respect of the said mains and pipes so laid as aforesaid, some of which are situated in each of the six wards of the city of Toronto.\nThe company appealed against the assessment to the Court of Revision, which confirmed the same, and the company then appealed to the proper County Judge against the decision of the Court of Revision.\nOn the hearing of the last mentioned appeal it was admitted by the said company that the assessment upon its building was $64,500 less than their true value, and it consented to the assessment being increased by that sum. The County Judge was then asked to consider, and consider only, the question of whether the mains and pipes belonging to the said company and laid in the city streets, and attached to the said plant and buildings, were exempt from taxation, and after hearing the arguments for the company, and for the defendant, the County Judge decided that the said mains and pipes were assessable, and confirmed the assessment, but at the request of the said company specially showed that the mains and pipes were assessed at $500,000, and amended the Roll accordingly.\nThe rate of taxation for the year 1894 was fixed at sixteen mills in the dollar, and the company, on 10th July, 1894, after demand and under protest, paid $7,940, being the taxes upon the said assessment of $500,000 upon the said mains and pipes after allowing a discount of $60, on the last instalment of said taxes.\nThe said company invests the principal part of its means in gas works, within the meaning of subsection 2 of section 34 of the Assessment Act.\nThe special case so agreed upon provided that if the court should be of opinion that the assessment of the mains and pipes was illegal, then judgment should be entered for the plaintiff for $7,940, with interest and costs, or if the court should be of opinion that the assessment was in part illegal, by reason of all of the mains and pipes being assessed in ward 2 or otherwise, then it is to be referred to the County Judge to ascertain the value of the mains not assessable under such assessment, and to fix what part of said taxes should be returned to the plaintiff, based upon the reduced assessment so ascertained by him, the portion of said $7,940 so fixed to be payable to the company, with interest; costs in such case to be in the discretion of the County Court Judge; or in case the court should be of opinion that the assessment was legal, then the action was to be dismissed with costs.\nMcCarthy Q.C. and Miller Q.C. for the appellant. Our courts have held that rails laid on the streets are not assessable as real estate; Toronto Street Railway Co. v. Fleming[3]; and gas pipes are in the same position. See also Hay v. Edinburgh Water Co.[4]; Chelsea Waterworks Co. v. Bowley[5].\nThe assessment was only valid, in any case, as to ward 2. Rex v. Brighton Gas Co.[6]\nRobinson Q.C. and Fullerton Q.C. for the respondent referred to Metropolitan Railway Co. v. Fowler[7].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I have read the judgment of Mr. Justice Gwynne, and entirely concur in it, so far as it goes.\nApart altogether from the enactment contained in the Act incorporating the appellant company relied on by Mr. Justice Gwynne, I am, however, of opinion that the judgment of the Chancellor, except so much of it as relates to the mode of assessment, was right and ought for the reasons given by him, to be affirmed.\nBy section 6 of the Ontario Assessment Act of 1892, it is enacted that:\nAll municipal, local or direct taxes or rates shall, where no other express provision has been made in this respect, be levied equally upon the whole ratable property real and personal of the municipality, or other locality according to the assessed value of such property, and not upon one or more kinds of property in particular, or in different proportions.\nSection 7 of the same Act is as follows: All property in this province shall be liable to taxation, subject to the following exemptions.\nNone of these exemptions have any bearing on the present case.\nSection 9 enacts that:\nAll real property situate within, but owned out of the province, shall be liable to assessment in the same manner and subject to the like exemptions as other real property under the provisions of this Act.\nBy the interpretation clause, section 2, the following definitions are given:\nLand, real property and real estate respectively shall include all buildings or other things erected upon or affixed to the land, and all machinery or other things so fixed to any building as to form in law part of the realty, and all trees or underwood growing upon the land and land covered with water, and all mines, minerals, quarries, and fossils in and under the same except mines belonging to Her Majesty.\nI am of opinion that the gas pipes of the appellants laid under the streets of the city were under this Act real property belonging to them, and as such liable to assessment. I regard the case of The Metropolitan Railway Company v. Fowler7, as conclusively showing that these pipes are not to be considered as chattels placed beneath the public streets and highways, in the exercise of a mere easement, but being affixed to the land, as actual real property within the meaning of the interpretation clause. No matter in whom the fee in the soil of the surface of the streets was vested, so much of the subsoil as is occupied by the appellant\u2019s pipes must be held to constitute part of the land, unless we are altogether to disregard the decision of the House of Lords in the case cited.\nAs is clearly and forcibly stated in the judgment of Lord Watson, the pipes must be considered as much land as the highway itself. I can see no difference between the case of pipes thus placed on the highway, and pipes or mains placed or affixed under the surface of land, the property of which might be in a private owner. The Court of Appeal were no doubt embarrassed by their previous decision in the case of Fleming v. The Street Railway Company[8].\nThe Chancellor attempted to distinguish that case from the present, but I confess I do not think it is susceptible of distinction. I was a party to that decision, but I do not hesitate to say that I now think the rails were \u201cthings affixed to the land,\u201d and as such liable to assessment as real property, and that that case was consequently wrongly determined. I agree with Mr. Justice Gwynne that the assessment ought to have been made as in the case of real estate and land generally, in the separate wards of the city. Therefore, the mode of assessment adopted was illegal and in accordance with clause 15 of the special case it must be referred to the county judge to ascertain the amount to be returned to the appellants. And it will be for the County Judge to make such order as may seem to him proper as to the costs, not merely in the first instance, but in the Court of Appeal and in this court.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The appellants are a gas company in the city of Toronto incorporated by Act of the provincial legislature and by that Act are authorized to lay mains and pipes upon and under the streets and highways of the city. They have been assessed for the year 1894 in the sum of $500,000 for \u201cmains under public streets or roads\u201d and $217,950 for buildings and plant.\nThe question before us is solely as to the validity of the assessment as to the mains and pipes and comes up on a special case, and the question is whether that assessment is or is not valid under the Ontario Con- solidated Assessment Act of 1892 (55 Vict. ch. 48), as coming within the terms \u201cland\u201d and \u201creal property\u201d made liable to the assessment by that Act.\nThe question appears to me to be determined by the appellant\u2019s Act of incorporation, 11 Vict. ch. 14. The 1st section of that Act conferred upon the company power to purchase, take and hold lands, tenements and other real property for the purposes of the said company and for the erection and construction and convenient use of the gas works of the company.\nThen by section 13 the company is empowered to break up, dig and trench so much and so many of the streets, squares and public places of the city as may at any time be necessary for laying down the mains and pipes to conduct the gas from the works of the company to the consumers thereof or for taking up, renewing, altering or repairing the same when the said company shall deem it expedient, doing no unnecessary damage, etc., and making the said openings in such parts of the said streets as the City Surveyor under the direction of the Council shall permit and point out. Now, this 13th section operates, I think, clearly as a legislative grant to the company of so much of the land of the said streets and below the surface as it shall find necessary to take and hold under section 1 for the purposes of the company and for the convenient use of the gas works, and when the places are designated by the corporation where the mains may be laid, and they are placed there, the land occupied by such mains is land taken and held by the company for the necessary purposes of the company and the convenient use of the gas works, and is therefore liable to assessment as land under the provisions of the assessment Act relating to land and real property. The appellant, however, claims exemption under section 7, subsection 6 of that Act, which exempts from taxation every public road and way or public square\u2014whether the public streets wherein the mains are laid are vested in the Crown or in the municipality of the city for the public use is of no importance, for in neither case would they in the absence of this subsection be subject to taxation by the city who is bound to maintain them for the use of the public; so that this subsection would seem to have no application except to streets, roads or squares the soil and freehold of which is vested in some private person or corporation, and which would be liable to be assessed against the owner but for the exemption contained in this subsection.\nThe property in question being assessable as land must be assessed in the several wards of the city and the case therefore must be referred back to the County Judge in the terms of the special case.\nSEDGEWICK, KING and GIROUARD JJ. concurred in the opinion of the Chief Justice.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Mulock, Miller, Crowther & Montgomery.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Thomas Caswell.\n[1] 23 Ont.

The effect of its being complied with was to allow the snow to remain on the crossings which therefore became higher than the sidewalks, and when pressed down by traffic an incline more or less steep was formed at the ends of the crossings. A young lady slipped and fell on one of these inclines, and being severely injured brought an action of damages against the city and obtained a verdict.\nThe Municipal Act of Ontario makes a corporation, if guilty of gross negligence, liable for accidents resulting from snow and ice on sidewalks; notice of action in such case must be given, but may be dispensed with on the trial if the court is of opinion that there was reasonable excuse for the want of it, and that the corporation has not been prejudiced in its defence.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal, Gwynne J. dissenting, that there was sufficient evidence to justify the jury in finding that the corporation had not fulfilled its statutory obligation to keep the streets and sidewalks in repair; Cornwall v. Derochie (24 Can. S.C.R. 301) followed; that it was no excuse that the difference in level between the sidewalk and crossing was due to observance of the by-law; that a crossing may be regarded as part of the adjoining sidewalk for the purpose of the act; that \u201cgross negligence\u201d in the act means very great negligence, of which the jury found the corporation guilty; and that an appellate court would not interfere with the discretion of the trial judge in dispensing with notice of action. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment of the Common Pleas Divisional Court in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff, who was a medical student attending college in the City of Kingston, on the eighth day of February, 1896, was descending Princess street in said city, and was crossing Montreal street, which intersects Princess almost at right angles, when she fell at the lower or east end of the street crossing on a declivity formed by the difference in level between the crossing, which was covered with snow, and the sidewalk which, under a by-law of the city, was kept clear of snow or nearly so by the tenant of the shop adjoining. The plaintiff was injured in her hip by the fall.\nThe action was brought under section 531 of the Municipal Act of the Province of Ontario passed in the year 1892, being 55 Vict. ch. 42. This act was amended in the year 1894 by 57 Vict. ch. 50, section 13, so that at the time of the accident subsec. 1 of the main section read as follows:\u2014S. 531, (1) \u201cEvery public road, street, bridge and highway shall be kept in repair by the corporation, and on default of the corporation so to keep in repair, the corporation shall, besides being subject to any punishment provided by law, be civilly responsible for all damages sustained by any person by reason of such default; but the action must be brought within three months after the damages have been sustained.\u201d\n\u201cProvided, however, that no municipal corporation shall be liable for accidents arising from persons falling, owing to snow or ice upon the sidewalks, unless in case of gross negligence by the corporation; and provided also that no action shall be brought to enforce a claim for damages under this sub-section unless notice in writing of the accident and the cause thereof has been served upon or mailed through the post office to the mayor, reeve or other head of the corporation, or to the clerk of the municipality, within thirty days after the happening of the accident; and provided also that in case of the death of the person by whom the damages have been sustained, the want of notice shall be no bar to the maintenance of the action; nor in other cases shall the want or insufficiency of the notice be a bar to the action if the court or judge before whom the action is tried is of opinion that there was reasonable excuse for the want or insufficiency of such notice; and that the defendants have not thereby been prejudiced in their defence.\u201d\nAt the trial the defendants\u2019 counsel at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case moved for a nonsuit substantially on the following grounds which are set up by the statement of defence, and which the appellants put forward as their grounds of this appeal.\n1. That the crossing was not out of repair within the meaning of the statute, and that the defendants had not been shown to have been guilty of negligence in respect thereof.\n2. That the accident had not happened on a sidewalk, and the defendants had not been guilty of gross negligence required by the statute to make them liable.\n3. That the plaintiff had not given the notice required by the statute or proved circumstances sufficient to form a reasonable excuse for want of notice so as to justify the judge presiding at the trial in dispensing with notice.\nThe trial judge held that there was reasonable excuse for not giving notice of action and that the defendants were not prejudiced in their defence for want of it. Under his charge the jury found the corporation guilty of gross negligence and judgment was entered for the plaintiff with $1,500 damages. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal from whose decision the corporation appealed to this court.\nWalkem Q.C. for the appellant. The difference in level between the sidewalk and crossing was unavoidable if the by-law for removing snow on sidewalks was carried out. It could not, therefore, be deemed negligence on the part of the corporation. Goldsmith v. City of London[2]; Burns v. City of Toronto[3].\nAllowing snow and ice to remain on a sidewalk is not of itself evidence of negligence. Ringland v. City of Toronto[4]; Forward v. City of Toronto[5].\nAt all events there was no evidence of gross negligence to be submitted to the jury.\nNotice of action was not given and the discretion of the judge in dispensing with it is subject to review. Hayter v. Beall[6]; Jones v. Tuck[7].\nHutcheson for the respondent. As to liability for accidents caused by snow and ice on the streets see City of Halifax v. Walker[8]; Caswell v. Corporation of St. Mary\u2019s[9]; Gordon v. Belleville[10]; Town of Cornwall v. Derochie[11].\nThe discretion of the judge as to notice will not be reviewed unless it has led to a miscarriage of justice. Ormerod v. Todmorden Mill Co.[12]; In re Martin[13]; In re Oriental Bank[14].\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014On the 8th of February 1895 the plaintiff, then being a student attending the medical school in connection with Queen\u2019s University, Kingston, while walking in an easterly direction down Princess street and upon the crossing at its intersection with Montreal street, fell upon the slope of the crossing and sustained an injury to her hip so severe that she was laid up in the hospital for twenty-four weeks, and has been lame ever since. She brought this action against the municipality, and upon trial before Meredith C.J. and a jury a verdict was entered in her favour for $1500 damages. A motion to set aside the verdict was unsuccessful in the Divisional Court, and upon the case coming before the Court of Appeal there was an equal division of opinion, Hagarty C.J., and Maclennan J. thinking the verdict should not stand; Burton and Osler JJ. contra. From the judgment in the plaintiff\u2019s favour resulting from this equal division the City of Kingston has brought this appeal.\nThe substantial question is as to whether the City of Kingston in the present case has fulfilled the obligation imposed by the statute 55 Vict. ch. 42, s. 531, s.s. 1, which is as follows:\nEvery public road, street, bridge, and highway shall be kept in repair by the corporation, and on default of the corporation so to keep in repair, the corporation shall, besides being subject to any punishment provided by law, be civilly responsible for all damages sustained by any person by reason of such default, but the action must be brought within three months after the damages have been sustained.\nFurther questions arise from an amendment of this subsection, 57 Vict. ch. 50, sec. 13, which is as follows:\nProvided, however, that no municipal corporation shall be liable for accidents arising from persons falling owing to snow or ice upon the sidewalks unless in case of gross negligence by the corporation; and provided also that no action shall be brought to enfore a claim for damages under this subsection, unless notice in writing of the accident and the cause thereof has been served upon, or mailed through the post office to, the mayor, reeve, or other head of the corporation, or to the clerk of the municipality, within thirty days after the happening of the accident; and provided also that in case of the death of the person by whom the damages have been sustained, want of notice shall be no bar to the maintenance of the action, nor in other cases shall the want or insufficiency of notice be a bar to the action if the court or judge before whom the action is tried is of opinion that there was reasonable excuse for the want or insufficiency of such notice and that the defendants have not thereby been prejudiced in their defence.\nThe main inquiry then is: Was Princess street at the place of the accident \u201ckept in repair\u201d by the municipal authorities within the meaning of the principal enactment?\nThe following facts appear to be undisputed. (a) The plaintiff fell not on what is usually known as the sidewalk, but on the crossing, and just before it joined the sidewalk. (b). Princess street goes easterly on a down grade. (c). A by-law of the city requires frontagers to remove snow and ice from sidewalks and in the present case the sidewalk was so cleared. (d). The snow is of course allowed to remain on crossings and on the remaining portions of the streets as it falls. The removal of the snow from the sidewalk, and its remaining on the crossing, must necessarily cause a difference of level between the sidewalk and the crossing and the injurious effect of the interference with travel and locomotion is modified or obviated by removing a portion of the snow from the crossing where it joins the sidewalk, making at that point a declivity or incline which may be greater or less according to the depth of the snow upon the crossing and which may be as gentle or precipitous as the authorities may choose to permit. Where a street is not on the level the angle of inclination would in ordinary cases be accentuated, and travel upon it more hazardous. It was at such a point and upon a declivity caused in some such way that the accident in the present case occurred. There is of course much question as to the dangerous character of this slope, the plaintiff contend- ing that the ordinary grade or slope was very greatly increased, forming a steep smooth icy declivity from two to four feet long, descending to the sidewalk, at an angle of from twenty-five to forty-five degrees.\nThe witness Atwood describes the slope as being at an angle of at least thirty degrees with the adjoining sidewalk, and thought this declivity extended a yard at least on the crossing, and described the surface of the incline as being highly polished, principally by footwear.\nThe witness Boyd describes the place as being \u201cvery slippery, a kind of deep incline; and although he worked in the adjoining store he had only seen the crossing cleaned off once all winter.\u201d In speaking of the incline, he said: \u201cIt came down very sharp just for probably two feet, back; it came down very steep.\u201d\nThe witness Brickwood says that the snow and ice were removed from the pavement but allowed to accumulate on the crossing, thereby leaving the crossing much higher than the adjoining pavement; and speaks of the approach from the pavement to the crossing being very sudden, and slippery, and illustrates it by a large book showing an angle of about forty degrees; while this place was in the same condition he says he saw a great many people slip there, and he says he saw two or three people fall, and speaks of one particularly bad fall.\nThe witness Garbutt says the accumulation on the crossing caused a steep incline extending about four feet from the pavement, and illustrated by the same large book, showing a slope at an angle of twenty-five degrees or thirty degrees, and describes the surface as being \u201cicy, almost impossible to go down it with safety.\u201d\nOne White fell himself at the same place on the same day and was partially stunned by the fall, not recovering for some hours. He describes the place as being \u201cquite a drop from the snow down to the edge of the sidewalk where it had been cleaned\u201d; and says the surface of the slope was \u201cvery glare, had been worn off; people, it seemed, stepping on it had made it smooth.\u201d\nOne Johnston fell at the same place within two or three days of the day in question, and describes the crossing as being in \u201ca very slippery condition,\u201d and as being very much higher than the pavement or sidewalk.\nMr. Justice Osler in his opinion in the court below thus speaks:\nThe only question, therefore, as I have said before is whether there was evidence of such neglect proper to be submitted to the jury. The defendants are no backwoods township or small straggling village, but an ancient busy and populous city and the place where the accident happened was on the crossing of two of its principal and most frequented streets\u2014Princess and Montreal\u2014on one of the most important thoroughfares. The condition of this crossing, where it joined the sidewalks in the direction in which the plaintiff was going, is thus described in the evidence. The dip to the sidewalk was by reason of the ice and snow which had accumulated in it considerably more abrupt than the natural inclination of the crossing, a dip of 30 or 40 degrees in three feet, very slippery,\u2014a kind of deep incline where the crossing joined the pavement\u2014came down very sharp for probably two feet back,\u2014approach very sudden\u2014came down very sudden on a jog of 40 degrees\u2014quite a drop from the snow to the edge of the sidewalk\u2014it was dangerous\u2014almost impossible to go down it with safety\u2014a very bad crossing\u2014many people had been seen to slip there and two or three to fall\u2014had been more or less all the winter in a slippery and dangerous condition\u2014in the condition in which it was when the plaintiff fell, for two weeks at least. There were three aldermen for the ward in which the crossing was, and the mayor lived \u201cup that way.\u201d That the defendants recognised what ought to be done in respect of such a crossing there is the evidence of the city engineer who said that every time he saw it it was in good condition, if not, would send men to make it so; kept men cleaning snow off these crossings, maintained a general supervision on the streets and there was also a foreman; was often up and down Princess street in the winter; often went to look up and down it in icy weather to see if anything could be done; frequently got ashes and sand sprinkled on the whole surface of road and especially on the crossings; kept barrels of sand in the tool house for the purpose, and would send men to get ashes from the stores. One of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses said that ashes had been put on the street once during the winter.\nThe learned Chief Justice Meredith (a recognized authority on municipal law) in addressing the jury said:\nNow I may say this to you as applied to the facts of the case. If you think that owing to the condition of that crossing\u2014the snow upon the slope, the condition of the snow, if you think it was dangerous\u2014that that danger was a manifest danger to anybody who was caring to look\u2014if that state of things had existed in a central portion of the city where many people were passing\u2014in one of the most frequented parts of the city\u2014if that condition had existed for many days; if the means of preventing that condition of things was simple; if the corporation neglected to discharge the duty of applying that simple remedy\u2014then I think the case would be one of gross negligence. I will ask you therefore to say whether you think there was negligence on the part of the corporation or whether you think there was gross negligence.\nThis charge was not objected to, nor has misdirection been made a ground of setting aside the verdict. Upon the charge the jury found as I have said for the plaintiff and that the corporation was guilty of \u201cgross negligence,\u201d bringing the case within the amending statute above set out.\nSuch being the evidence and such the charge and findings we are asked to set aside these findings substantially upon the ground that there was no evidence of negligence that could properly be presented to a jury.\nIt is not of course for me to say whether I believe the evidence\u2014whether I would upon the evidence have found as the jury did. That is their function, not ours, and even if I disagreed with the result at which they arrived that is no reason why I should disturb it, unless I find that there was no evidence of negligence at all, or the finding so shocks my reason as to convince me that the jury in coming to it were bereft of theirs.\nThe obligation of the city was to keep the streets and sidewalks in a reasonable state of repair\u2014in such a condition that the traveller using them with ordinary care might do so with safety. There was evidence (and I think sufficient evidence) to justify the jury in finding a breach of that obligation. That evidence\u2014a portion of it above set out\u2014showed that the slope was unnecessarily, unreasonably, and unsafely steep; that its existence and character must have for some time before the accident been brought to the knowledge of the authorities, or at least they must be presumed to have had such knowledge; and that it was a feasible, simple and inexpensive matter to remove all occasion of injury.\nThere has been much difference of opinion in Canadian and United States courts as to municipal liability for accidents occasioned by snow or ice upon highways. That there is liability in certain cases in those provinces of Canada whose legislation imposes a civil liability for accidents occasioned by \u201cdefault of repair,\u201d is unquestioned. That at least was held by this court in the late case of Cornwall v. Derochie[15].\nThis difference has been occasioned it seems to me more than a divergence of view as to facts than as to law. The learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal says in his able opinion:\nWe have so often had to comment on and review cases in which recoveries have been held for accidents on highways that it is hardly necessary again to discuss the subject in general. We are now face to face with the question whether the presence of snow on a road or street raised by the action of vehicles and partly by the law compelling sweeping or clearing of sidewalks, so as to be raised as here to a higher level than the sidewalk presenting a slippery descent of six or seven inches in the distance of from three to two feet creates a cause of action against the city by an accident to a passenger slipping thereon.\nThis statement of the question it seems to me (and I say it with the utmost deference and respect) minimizes the result of the evidence as found by the jury. Had he added to his description a statement to the effect that by reason of the premises the place was made unnecessarily and unreasonably dangerous, a defect that by the exercise of proper diligence might easily have been removed, he would have introduced an element which must have had its effect upon the mind of the jury and which likewise must affect ours, since we must assume it to be the fact. Admit the presence of a defect by reason of changed conditions in a highway,\u2014admit that this defect is dangerous to life and limb\u2014admit that its removal may be accomplished without an unreasonable call upon municipal revenue and you have a case of municipal obligation and, in the event of accident from default, of municipal liability.\nIn the present case it seems to me the evidence showed that the municipality were not only passively negligent in not removing the defect, but they were actively instrumental in creating it. They were not bound to pass a by-law compelling the removal of snow and ice from sidewalks, but having passed it it became obligatory on them to take all proper precautions, looking to the safety of those points where the crossings and sidewalks meet. Had there been no by-law both would have been on the same level or grade, there would have been no extraordinary slope and probably no accident. The case is not one with special features or involving peculiar principles of law, because it deals with ice or snow. The city was not bound to build sidewalks, but having done so it is bound to keep them in repair to this extent at least that they are not more dangerous than if they did not exist at all. It is the same case as if it was originally erecting a sidewalk and by defect of plan or specification or otherwise a particular part of it was so much more sloping than the natural way or necessity called for that an accident followed. Then, there would be liability as in any other case of structural defect.\nA municipality (I repeat) is not liable for accidents occasioned solely by the presence of snow or ice upon a street or sidewalk. It is not, as a rule, bound to remove either. But if after a heavy rainfall a bridge is swept away there is a liability to replace it; so snow may so accumulate as to make particular places impassable and impose the obligation of removal. As stated in an American work[16]\nit is only in such cases as where mounds of snow and ice are negligently allowed to remain on a street or where there is an unreasonable delay in making a road passable or where there is some defect in the way itself that is made more dangerous by the snow that the municipality will be held responsible for injuries occasioned by its presence in the street. In the country entire inaction is sometimes excusable, and the fact that a road was impassable from snow for three months has been held insufficient evidence of negligence.\nAfter referring to the various views as to ice on sidewalks the learned author proceeds (sec. 100).\nIn a climate where snow and ice exist almost constantly through the winter season, the requirements of the duty to exercise reasonable care to keep the street safe for use would not oblige a corporation to attempt to accomplish that which is practically impossible. In such a climate to keep the sidewalks clear would require extraordinary and unreasonable care, and the common law puts no such obligation on a municipality.\nIn support of the general rule that mere slipperiness will not give rise to liability he cites Kinney v. Troy[17], where Danforth J. says:\nThe situation was one common to all cities in a northern climate and to all sidewalks in such cities. A sidewalk, difficult it may be of pass- age, but if so, from the ordinary action of the elements only, and from a formation of ice which no body of men are competent to prevent nor under any ordinary circumstances to remove. Something more than a slippery sidewalk must be shown to enable one suffering from it to cast the burden of compensation upon the city.\nUpon the general question reference may be had to McGiffin v. Palmer\u2019s Ship Building Co.[18], where Field, J., says:\u2014\nThe case has been put of a way perfectly well constructed, but upon which, on a frosty December morning, water falls so that it gets into a dangerous state. I cannot help thinking that that would be a defect in the condition of the way, because the way is the thing which people walk upon, and the thing itself is actually altered.\nIn Leek Commissioners v. Stafford[19], Bowen, L.J., says:\u2014\nThe repairing of a road includes whatever is necessary to keep it in a proper condition for the traffic, having regard to the character and original manufacture of the road.\nThe Canadian cases are illustrated by:\nCaswell v. St. Mary\u2019s[20]. Per Wilson, J., at page 251.\nIf a particular part for two or three rods in length happens to be in a very dangerous condition, exceptionally and particularly dangerous as distinct from the rest of the road, and it can be put in a safe state and at a reasonable expense, there is no reason why it should not be made safe for travel although it was caused by rain, snow or ice, or what may be called \u201cnatural means.\u201d\nAnd again at page 252:\nIf the snow collects at a spot, and by thawing and freezing, travel upon becomes specially dangerous and if this special difficulty can be conveniently corrected by removing the snow or ice, or by other reasonable means, there must be the duty of the person or body on whom the care of reparation rests, to make such place safe and fit for travel.\nGordon v. Belleville[21]. Where the plaintiff was injured by falling on a ridge of ice which had been allowed to form and remain for a long time along the centre of a sidewalk the plaintiff recovered, though he knew of its dangerous condition. The verdict was upheld by the Divisional Court.\nReference may also be had to the Nova Scotia case of Walker v. The City of Halifax[22], where Mr. Justice (afterwards Sir John) Thompson delivered an elaborate judgment (subsequently affirmed by this court) upon the liability of a city for damage caused by cahots on a public street. This case was overruled by the Privy Council in Pictou v. Geldert[23] but upon another ground.\nUpon the whole I am of opinion that the verdict cannot be disturbed upon the question of negligence.\nThere are however three subsidiary questions still to be referred to, all arising under the amendment of 1894 above set out.\nFirst, the appellants allege and the respondent denies that this amendment applies. The accident in question happened upon a \u201ccrossing.\u201d Was the crossing at that particular place a \u201csidewalk\u201d within the meaning of the statute? The statute of which this amendment forms part in several places refers to sidewalks and crossings, and it is argued that these terms are mutually exclusive of each other. I have also in this opinion referred to them as different things. I am however of opinion that \u201csidewalks\u201d here includes \u201ccrossings.\u201d In the case before us the street area covered by Princess and Montreal streets intersected has two names. Looking at it east and west it is Princess, north and south it is Montreal street. Here at the two sides of the first are walks or granolithic pavements for the special use of foot passengers walking up or down Princess street; they are called crossings but they are sidewalks quoad or in relation to Princess street. So also to the walks on each side of Montreal street. So far as my general observation goes a crossing is usually a sidewalk and I think that in the present case the statute should be so construed. We are doing no violence to the statute in so holding. On the contrary we are giving effect to what appears to me to have been the legislative intent.\nSecondly it is contended that although there may have been negligence here there was no gross negligence such as the amendment requires to create a liability.\nI am not bold enough to enter upon a detailed investigation as to the difference between gross and other kinds of negligence. That question has been discussed by civilians and text\u2011book writers to such an extent that judges have been found to say that there are no degrees of negligence. However this may be we must, I suppose, give some meaning to this expression of the legislative will and the meaning I give to it is \u201cvery great negligence.\u201d The jury have found that species of negligence in this concrete case. The trial judge did not attempt, as I do not, to define. He merely put to the jury the contentions of fact and the supporting evidence stating that if these contentions were true there was gross negligence present here. That I think was the proper course and the jury\u2019s finding should not be disturbed on that ground.\nFinally. The amendment provides that no action shall be brought unless notice in writing has been served within thirty days after the happening of the accident, but that the want or insufficiency of the notice should not be a bar if the court or judge before whom the action is tried is of opinion that there was reasonable excuse for the want or insufficiency of such notice and that the defendants have not thereby been prejudiced in their defence. Notice was not given, but at the trial the appellants admitted that they were in no way prejudiced by the plaintiff\u2019s failure to give notice and the trial judge decided under the statute that there was reasonable excuse for the want of it. The appellants, although admittedly in no way prejudiced by want of notice, seek to set aside the verdict on that account. I do not feel called upon to decide whether in the present case the certificate of the trial judge is reviewable. The rule is universal however that when a statute gives a judge discretion to do a particular act his decision will not be interfered with by an appellate court unless he has made a palpable mistake or has acted upon a manifestly erroneous principle. That cannot be the case here. The main object of notice is to give the defendant a chance of getting at the facts while evidence is available and fresh in the minds of witnesses. For this purpose no notice in the present case was necessary as admitted by counsel. It was proved that the plaintiff was in the hospital twenty-four weeks, during the first thirty days enduring great physical pain. Little during that time would she think of her court remedies. She would probably not dream that she had any. Under the circumstances I am not disposed to question the discretion of the trial judge in dispensing with the notice.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014In The Municipality of the town of Pictou v. Geldert[24], it was held by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council that the default of a municipal corporation or other public body in keeping in repair a highway or bridge, the obligation to maintain which in repair was imposed upon such corporation or public body by statute or common law, does not give to any person injured by such default any cause of action to recover damages in respect of such default and injury, and that such an action can only be maintained by force of some legislative provision indicating an intention upon the part of the legislature to give to a party injured by such default an action for the damages by him sustained in respect thereof. In the present case, however, we have such a legislative provision, for by \u201cThe Municipal Institutions Act\u201d of the province of Ontario, 55 Vict. ch. 42, which was but a consolidation of previous Acts, having like provisions, it was enacted in sec. 531, that:\nEvery public road, street, bridge and highway, shall be kept in repair by the corporation, and on default of the corporation so to keep in repair, the corporation shall, besides being subject to any punishment provided by law, be civilly responsible for all damages sustained by any person by reason of such default, but the action must be brought within three months after the damages have been sustained.\nNow, the true construction of this section is, as it appears to me, that the action which this statute gives to a private person injured by the default of a municipality to keep in repair the roads &c., under its control, is one founded upon the same precise default as would subject the municipality to criminal proceedings, and that therefore the same evidence of the fact of the default of the corporation is as necessary for the maintenance of the private action as for the maintenance of a criminal prosecution. This, as it appears to me, is the plain construction of the statute. I dwell upon this point no further than to refer to the cases cited by me in my judgment in The Town of Portland v. Griffiths, in this court[25].\nIt must, however, be, I think, admitted that juries, moved no doubt by sympathy for the sufferers, have rendered verdicts for damages in private actions which have been upheld by the courts upon evidence which would not have been for a moment entertained as sufficient to support an indictment for the same alleged default.\nIn a recent case of The Town of Cornwall v. Derochie[26], a verdict obtained by the plaintiff in an action like the present was upheld by this court, but in that case the judgment of the majority of the court, in which I was unable to concur, proceeded wholly upon this, that in their opinion the evidence sufficiently showed that the sidewalk, by falling upon which the plaintiff there received the injury complained of, was either originally improperly constructed, or by age and use had so sunk down as to allow water to accumulate upon it, in consequence of which the ice which caused the accident was formed. That judgment does not at all affect the present case, for there is not a title of evidence upon which could be rested a suggestion of any defect in the construction of the crossing by falling upon which the plaintiff sustained damage. That crossing, it is true, was higher in the centre of the street than at its sides, it was rounded off in the centre and sloped downwards to the sides of the street, and more, perhaps, on the side at which the plaintiff fell, because Princess street where it crossed Montreal street had itself a considerable natural descent of grade in that direction, but such formation of the crossing could not be, and has not been, relied upon as having been a defect in its construction, nor is the plaintiff\u2019s injury in any respect attributable or attributed to such construction. The whole of the plaintiff\u2019s case is, as it is put by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario in his judgment, as follows:\nPrincess street, in Kingston, which runs east and west, is crossed by Montreal street, and a granolithic pavement crosses the latter street on a down grade from west to east. At the southeast corner the pavement joins or connects with the south sidewalk of Princess street. At that point the snow, under a city by-law, is habitually swept from the sidewalk adjoining the crossing, and the passage of sleighs had the effect of pushing or forcing the snow on or at the crossing upon or to the end of the sidewalk which sloped somewhat from north to south. The result was that where the sidewalk met the crossing the snow and ice had accumulated, and for from 3 to 2 feet back there was a descent in the crossing of 6 or 7 inches in the yard, and this descent was slippery. * * We are now, he added, face to face with the question whether the presence of snow on a road or street raised by the action of vehicles and partly by the law compelling the sweeping or clearing of sidewalks so as to be raised as here to a higher level than the sidewalk, presenting a slippery descent of 6 or 7 inches in the distance of from 3 to 2 feet, creates a cause of action against the city by an accident to a passenger slipping thereon.\nThe evidence given on behalf of the plaintiff for the purpose of establishing that default of the corporation in keeping the street, where the accident happened, in repair, which is made by the statute the foundation of the action, is in substance as follows. The day itself was very cold and stormy; it was snowing a little at the time of the accident. During that and the previous day it had been snowing off and on, while within the six days preceding there had been a very heavy fall of snow. All the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses concurred in saying that upon the crossing there was formed by snow and ice accumulated there an abrupt incline or dip down to the sidewalk at the junction of the crossing with which the plaintiff slipped and fell. This incline, according to one witness, commenced at the distance of about three feet, according to another, at about four, from the sidewalk; and one witness said that it was highly polished by traffic, by foot-wear principally, and, as he thought, by the wind that day. All proved that the sidewalk was kept almost without any snow upon it, it being required to be so kept by a by\u2011law of the corporation. Upon it there was about an inch of snow, while upon the incline in the cross- ing there was 6 or 7 inches, or perhaps more. The sidewalk being kept clear of snow the snow on the crossing accumulated by reason of the passing sleighs sweeping round the corner having the tendency to sweep the snow on to the crossing. This and the snow falls caused the incline to be formed. One witness who resided at the corner where the accident happened said that there is always, in winter, a certain amount of snow on the crossing, and that there will naturally always be a dip there which cannot be prevented.\nThere were as usual suggestions after the event as to modes by which the accident might have been avoided, some of which, if adopted, would seem to be injurious rather than otherwise. As for example, one witness suggested that a snow plough, which is used in keeping sidewalks clear of snow, should have been run along the crossing, that is, from one side of Montreal Street to the other; but such a proceeding, it is obvious, in a heavy fall of snow, by heaping the snow up on one side of the crossing across the whole width of the street, might cause an obstruction to passing vehicles, and in the case of an accident happening thereby might subject the corporation to actions, not for non-feasance but for actual mis-feasance; and the action of the snow plough on the crossing would naturally press down the edges to an icy, slippery condition more than would the footsteps of passing pedestrians. Another suggested that in lieu of the incline, and at the top of it, that is to say, at the distance of three or four feet from the sidewalk, a step should have been cut perpendicularly down to the level of the sidewalk. The benefit to be derived from such a step was not explained; and indeed while offering no benefit to pedestrians, it might be prejudicial to persons in sleighs coming round the corner. On the close of the evidence, counsel for the defendants moved for a non-suit which the learned judge refused to grant, and thereupon the defendants called the meteorological observer of the Dominion at Kingston, who testified as to the state of the weather on the 8th of February, 1895, the day of the accident. It was, he said, a very cold and stormy day; the thermometer at three o\u2019clock in the afternoon stood at eight degrees below zero. It was snowing all day. It began to snow at seven o\u2019clock the previous evening, and, judging from the snow-fall registered in the morning, he thought that it must have snowed all night. There was a snow-fall of four inches registered at eight o\u2019clock in the morning, and between that and three o\u2019clock in the afternoon it snowed 1.8 inches more. It snowed in fact almost continuously from seven o\u2019clock the previous evening until ten o\u2019clock on the night of the 8th February, making a snow-fall during that period of a little over six inches. The defendants called one other witness, the city engineer, who has charge of the streets of the city, who testified that after every snow-fall in the winter men are sent out to shovel snow off the crossings where necessary, but that it is utterly impossible to shovel off every crossing in the city at the same time; that on the day preceding the accident he had ten men, and on the day of the accident, the 8th of February, he had 34 men out shovelling snow off the crossings; that he had frequently during the winter seen the crossing where the plaintiff fell but had never seen anything wrong with it.\nThe jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff with $1,500 damages. Upon a motion to set aside that verdict and to enter a non-suit, or a verdict for the defendants, or that a new trial should be ordered, the Divisional Court of Common Pleas at Toronto discharged the motion, and upon appeal therefrom, the Court of Appeal at Toronto, by a divided court, dis- missed the appeal, and from that judgment this appeal is taken.\nAll the evidence, both that given on the part of the defendants and of the plaintiff, must be taken into consideration for the purpose of determining whether there was any evidence given sufficient to warrant a jury either in a criminal proceeding or in a civil action rendering a verdict against the defendants, as for any default upon their part in keeping the street, where the plaintiff fell, in repair within the meaning of the statute upon which the action is founded, and in my opinion the only conclusion which can reasonably be arrived at, is that there was not. If the verdict rendered in this case could be maintained, it would, I think, be quite useless for a municipal corporation ever to defend any action of this nature for any injury happening upon a street under their control, even though caused by the inclement state of the weather. To that cause, and to that alone, and not any want of repair in the crossing of which, in my opinion, there was no evidence whatever, does the evidence justify the conclusion that the plaintiff\u2019s accident was attributable. The evidence would not be entertained for a moment as sufficient to maintain a verdict against the defendants in a criminal proceeding, and it can be no more sufficient in a civil action than in a criminal proceeding. While the plaintiff is entitled to the deepest sympathy in the injury which she suffered, which appears to have been very great, we should be very careful not to suffer our sympathies to get the better of our judgment, as juries, it is to be regretted, in actions of this nature, too often do.\nThe appeal should, in my opinion, be allowed with costs, and a non-suit be ordered to be entered. It is unnecessary to express any opinion upon other points taken under the provisions of 57 Vict. ch. 50, sec. 13, as wholly independently of that Act, I am of opinion that there was no evidence given which was proper to be submitted to a jury as sufficient for the maintenance of the action.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Donald M.

Had the Parliament of Canada authority to enact sections 275 and 276 of the Criminal Code, 1892?\n2. If the said sections or either of them are ultra vires in part only, then (a) what portions of the said sections are ultra vires; (b) to what extent are the said sections, or either of them, ultra vires? Sections 275 and 276 of the Criminal Code, 1892, are as follows:\u2014\n\"275. Bigamy is\u2014\n\"(a.) The act of a person who, being married, goes through a form of marriage with any other person in any part of the world; or\n\"(b.) The act of a person who goes through a form of marriage in any part of the world with any person whom he or she knows to be married; or\n\"(c.) The act of a person who goes through a form of marriage with more than one person simultaneously or on the same day. R.S.C., c. 37, s. 10.\n\"2. A 'form of marriage' is any form either recognized as a valid form by the law of the place where it is gone through, or, though not so recognized, is such that a marriage celebrated there in that form is recognized as binding by the law of the place where the offender is tried. Every form shall, for the purpose of this section, be valid, notwithstanding any act or default of the person charged with bigamy, if it is otherwise a valid form. The fact that the parties would, if unmarried, have been incompetent to contract marriage shall be no defence upon a prosecution for bigamy.\n\"3. No one commits bigamy by going through a form of marriage\u2014\n\"(a.) If he or she in good faith, and on reasonable grounds, believes his wife or her husband to be dead; or\n\"(b.) If his wife or her husband has been continually absent for seven years then last past and he or she is not proved to have known that his wife or her husband was alive at any time during those seven years; or\n\"(c.) If he or she has been divorced from the bond of the first marriage; or \"(d.) If the former marriage has been declared void by a court of competent jurisdiction. R.S.C., c. 161, s. 4.\n\"4. No person shall be liable to be convicted of bigamy in respect of having gone through a form of r marriage in a place not in Canada, unless such a person, being a British subject resident in Canada, leaves Canada with intent to go through such form of marriage.\n\"276. Every one who commits bigamy is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to seven years' imprisonment.\n\"2. Every one who commits this offence after a previous conviction for a like offence shall be liable to fourteen years' imprisonment. R.S.C., c. 161, s. 4.\"\nThese enactments had been held intra vires by the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice for Ontario, in Reg v. Brierly[1], Chancellor Boyd, Ferguson and Robertson JJ. constituting the court. In that case the bigamous marriage had been contracted outside of Canada, but the facts were within the saving clause of subsection 4 of section 275. Afterwards in the case of Reg. v. Plowman[2], the question was raised in the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice of Ontario as to the validity of a conviction for bigamy where the facts were substantially the same as in Reg. v. Brierly (1). The court, consisting of Armour C. J., and Falconbridge J., held the above sections ultra vires in so far as they constituted the acts of the defendant, as stated, an offence, and that the case was covered by the authority of Macleodv. Attorney General for New South Wales[3].\nNewcomhe Q.C, Deputy Minister of Justice, for the Government of Canada. Similar legislation by the Parliament of the United Kingdom would be valid; In re Tivnan[4]; The Queen v. Keyn[5]; and the Parliament of Canada has like authority by sec. 91 of the British North America Act. Hodge v. The Queen[6]; Riel v.. The Queen[7]; Valin v. Langlois[8].\nMacleod v. Attorney General of New South Wales[9] is distinguishable. In that case the prisoner had no domicile in New South Wales when the offence was committed. And see Fielding v. Thomas[10].\nNo counsel appeared to oppose the validity of the said sections.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This reference comes before the court under an Order in Council bearing date the 25th day of April, 1896, and which is in the terms following:\nHis Excellency, in virtue of the provisions of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act, as amended by the Act 54 & 55 Victoria, Chapter 25, intituled \"An Act respecting the Supreme and Exchequer Courts,\" and by and with the advice of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, is pleased to refer, and does hereby refer, the following questions touching the constitutionality of legislation of the Parliament of Canada, to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration, namely:\u2014\n1. Had the Parliament of Canada authority to enact section 275 and 276 of the Criminal Code, 1892?\n2. If the said sections or either of them are ultra vires in part only, then (a) what portions of the said sections are ultra vires; (b) to what extent are the said sections, or either of them, ultra vires?\nSections 275 and 276 of the Criminal Code, 1892, are as follow:\n275. Bigamy is\u2014\n(a.) The act of a person who, being married, goes through a form of marriage with any other person in any part of the world; or\n(b.) The act of a person who goes through a form of marriage in any part of the world with any person whom he or she knows to be married; or (c.) The act of a person who goes through a form of marriage with more than one person simultaneously or on the same day. R.S.C., c. 37, s. 10.\n2. A \"form of marriage\" is any form either recognized as a valid form by the law of the place where it is gone through, or, though not so recognized, is such that a marriage celebrated there in that form is recognized as binding by the law of the place where the offender is tried. Every form shall, for the purpose of this section, be valid, notwithstanding any act or default of the person charged with bigamy, if it is otherwise a valid form. The fact that the parties would, if unmarried, have been incompetent to contract marriage shall be no defence upon a prosecution for bigamy.\n3. No one commits bigamy by going through a form of marriage\u2014\n(a.) If he or she in good faith, and on reasonable grounds, believes his wife or her husband to be dead; or\n(b.) If his wife or her husband has been continually absent for seven years then last past and he or she is not proved to have known that his wife or her husband was alive at any time during those seven years; or\n(c.) If he or she has been divorced from the bond of the first marriage; or\n(d.) If the former marriage has been declared void by a court of competent jurisdiction. R.S.C., c. 161, s. 4.\n4. No person shall be liable to be convicted of bigamy in respect of having gone through a form of marriage in a place not in Canada, unless such a person, being a British subject resident in Canada, leaves Canada with intent to go through such form of marriage.\n276. Every one who commits bigamy is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to seven years' imprisonment.\n2. Every one who commits this offence after a previous conviction for a like offence shall be liable to fourteen years' imprisonment. R.S.C., c. 161, s. 4.\nI am of opinion that paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection one of section 275, so far as they apply to persons who, being already married, may go through a form of marriage with any other person, and to persons who may go through a form of marriage with a person whom he or she knows to be married, elsewhere than in Canada, are prim\u00e2 facie ultra vires' of the Parliament of the Dominion. And, I am further of opinion that the limitation imposed by subsection 4 of section 275, that in order that a person may be convicted of bigamy in respect of having gone through a form of marriage, in a place not in Canada, such person must be a British subject, resident in Canada, and must have left Canada with intent to go through such form of marriage, has not the effect of so qualifying paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection 1, as to bring the substantive enactment contained in (a) and (b) within the powers of Parliament.\nThe legal construction of these provisions is clear. The offence is made to consist in a marriage anywhere without the Dominion of Canada, and although the condition is imposed that the party must have left Canada with the intent of celebrating such a pretended marriage, yet the so leaving Canada is not the offence constituted by the Code, but the criminal act is the marriage without the territorial jurisdiction of Parliament. I cannot read the provisions in question as equivalent to a declaration that it shall be a criminal offence to leave Canada with intent to go through the form of a bigamous marriage contract with the condition superadded that such a marriage shall afterwards be celebrated, thus making the essence of the offence to consist in leaving the Dominion with the criminal intent, for such leaving the Dominion is not by itself declared to be any criminal offence. The criminal offence is the marriage, coupled with the intent in leaving the country to carry such marriage into effect. To transpose or invert the plain words of the enactment so as to make the substantive and principal act the leaving the Dominion with the intent, coupled with the condition that such intent shall be subsequently effectuated, is to make that a crime which the legislature has not contemplated.\nSo far as anything essential to constitute the offence is required to be done out of Canada, it is in my opinion entirely beyond the legislative powers conferred on the Dominion by the British North America Act.\nBy section 91 subsection 27 of that Act, power is conferred on the Dominion to legislate on the subject of the criminal law. It is to this power exclusively that the authority of Parliament to enact the Criminal Code must be referred. It is a principle as well of constitutional as of international law, universally recognized, that the power of legislation in constituting offences and enacting punishments and penalties for such offences is prim\u00e2 facie local, limited to the territory over which the legislature has jurisdiction, and does not extend to offences committed beyond its confines. As the Lord Chancellor says in giving the judgment of the Judicial Committee in the case of Macleod v. The Attorney General of New South Wales[11], the rule of law is expressed in the maxim: Extra territorium jus dicenti impune non paretur.\nIn Jefferys v. Boosey[12], Baron Parke, in advising the House of Lords, says:\nThe legislature has no power over any persons except its own subjects, that is, persons natural born subjects, or resident, or whilst they are within the limits of the kingdom. The legislature can impose no duties except on them, and when legislating for the benefit of persons must, prim\u00e2 facie, be considered to mean the benefit of those who owe obedience to our laws, and whose interests the legislature is under a correlative obligation to protect.\nI may say here that the legislation in question in the case of Jefferys v. Boosey (2), was beneficial, and not criminal legislation.\nIn the case of Macleod v. The Attorney General for New South Wales (1), already referred to, the question under appeal involved the legality of a conviction of the appellant for bigamy for having married without the limits of the colony, whilst a first wife by a legal marriage was alive. The conviction had taken place under a Colonial Act which provides that\u2014\nWhosoever being married marries another person during the life of the former husband or wife, wheresoever such second marriage takes place, shall be liable to penal servitude for seven years.\nThe appeal was decided, not on the ground that the actual legislation, as it was finally interpreted, was beyond the powers of the legislature, but on the construction of the words \"whosoever\" and \"wheresoever.\" It was held that inasmuch as the legislature had no power to make a bigamous marriage contracted beyond its jurisdiction an offence, that consideration made it necessary, in the opinion of the Judicial Committee, to construe the words \"whosoever being married,\" as meaning\u2014\nWhosoever being married, and who is amenable at the time of the offence committed to the jurisdiction of the colony of New South Wales.\nAnd to restrict the words \"wheresoever\" as meaning\u2014\nWheresoever in this colony the offence is created.\nThe Lord Chancellor in adopting this construction reasons thus:\nThere is no limit of person according to one construction of \"whosoever,\" and the word \"wheresoever\" is equally universal in its application. Therefore, if their Lordships construe the statute as it stands and upon the bare words, any person married to any other person, who marries a second time anywhere in the habitable globe, is amenable to the criminal jurisdiction of New South Wales, if he can be caught in that colony. That seems to their Lordships to be an impossible construction of the statute. The colony can have no such jurisdiction, and their Lordships do not desire to attribute to the Colonial Legislature an effort to enlarge their jurisdiction to such an extent as would be inconsistent with the powers committed to a colony, and indeed inconsistent with the most familiar principles of international law.\nThen, it is said in the same judgment as regards the constitutional question which would have arisen if the construction which was adopted had not been admissible:\nTheir Lordships think it right to add that they are of opinion that if the wider construction had been applicable to the statute, and it was supposed that it was intended thereby to comprehend cases so wide as those insisted on at the bar, it would have been beyond the jurisdiction of the colony to enact such a law. Their jurisdiction is confined within their own territories, and the maxim which has been more than once quoted extra territorium jus dicenti impune non paretur would be applicable in this case. * * * * * All crime is local. The jurisdiction over the crime belongs to the country where the crime is committed, and except over her own subjects, Her Majesty and the Imperial Legislature have no power whatever.\nIn the case of Shields v. Peak[13], decided in 1883, the same line of reasoning was adopted as conclusive in favour of a construction of the penal clause in an insolvency Act, which, without limitation in point of locality, made it an offence punishable with line and imprisonment for an insolvent person to obtain credit. It was held that the statute did not apply to an act committed in England to which the statute would have applied if it had had extra-territorial force. In my judgment in that case I stated the reasons which led me to a conclusion in all respects the same as that arrived at in the case in the Privy Council, and cited several authorities, including some of those now referred to, in support of my decision. Mr. Justice Henry and Mr. Justice Taschereau also arrived at the same conclusion, and for the same reasons. I adhere in all respects to what was said in Shields v. Peak (1), on the subject now under consideration.\nIt follows from the authorities stated that standing alone paragraphs (b) and (c) of subsection 1 of section 275' would be ultra vires so far as they apply to the offence of bigamy committed by all persons without any qualification or condition of British allegiance, in any part of the world. Subsection 4 of the same section 275, however, requires that in order to the constitution of the offence certain other conditions must concur. First, it is required that the accused person must, in order that he may be indicted for a marriage celebrated without the jurisdiction, have left Canada with intent \"to go through such form of marriage.\" The bare intent by itself does not, according to the statute, constitute any offence. The crime must be a compound one, consisting in the going through the form of marriage without the jurisdiction, coupled with leaving the Dominion with that intent. Therefore, so far as this proviso goes, the objection pointed out in Macleod v. The Attorney General[14], that the legislature cannot make an act committed without the jurisdiction criminal, is just as much applicable to the present legislation as to that before the Privy Council in the case cited, as the celebration of the marriage abroad is a necessary ingredient in the crime.\nThere are, however, two other qualifications; the party indicted must be resident in Canada, and must also be a British subject.\nFirst, as to residence in Canada. It is to be observed that what is required is not domicile, but mere residence within the Dominion. Residence is of course a very different thing from domicile; a subject of a foreign state may well be resident in Canada without having a domicile there; of course such a foreign resident is, so long as he is within the Dominion, as much subject to its laws as if he were a subject, but, upon well established principles of international law, one whose national character is that of a foreign subject or citizen, is not affected, as regards his acts or conduct outside the territorial jurisdiction of the country in which he may happen to be resident, by the criminal legislation of the latter state. Thus, according to the rules prevailing in the system of international law universally adopted by all civilized nations, a resident of a foreign country\u2014by which I mean a country other than that to which he owes allegiance\u2014cannot be criminally prosecuted for an act committed whilst absent from his residence, in another country, either in that of his own nationality or any other. Such extraterritorial legislation, though it might bind courts and judges amenable to the domestic law, would not be considered by foreign nations as having any extraterritorial force, and therefore all presumptions must be made against an intention on the part of the legislature to enact laws in contravention of this principle.\nThis is indeed recognized by the framers of the Code, for the fourth subsection does not make residence the only condition required to make a party amenable for the ex-territorial act, but conjoins it with another, namely, that in order to come within the enactment the party must be a British subject. This introduces a question of constitutional law common to the whole Empire, one which it was not necessary to decide in Macleod v. The Attorney General[15], and which is not directly touched upon in the observations which the Lord Chancellor added to the reasons of the Judicial Committee for its actual decision in that case.\nThis question may, therefore, be thus stated: Has the legislature of a dependency of the Crown of the United Kingdom the power which is undoubtedly possessed by the Parliament of the Empire, of so regulating the conduct of British subjects, resident within its local jurisdiction, as to constitute an act, committed without that local jurisdiction, a criminal offence?\nThe legislative authority of the Parliament of the United Kingdom to control the personal conduct of the Queen's subjects, irrespective of their locality, depends altogether upon their allegiance, not upon their residence or domicile, and they remain subject to such legislation so long as they retain their national character as British subjects. Numerous instances of such personal legislation are to be found in the statute-book, such as the statutes of Henry the 8th and George the 4th, and that of the present reign, as regards murder committed by British subjects abroad, also the statute 43 George 3rd, ch. 11, section 6, relating to manslaughter by the same class of persons under like conditions, and enactments making piracy, slave trading and breaches of the Foreign Enlistment Acts criminal, though the offence may be committed on the high seas (even in a foreign vessel) or within the limits of a foreign territory. Such offences are, however, unless jurisdiction is specially conferred on colonial courts, indictable only in England.\nAs, however, the general rule already mentioned requires the presumption to be made in all cases that criminal legislation is intended to be local, it is essential to the constitution by statute, of personal, ex-territorial, criminal offences of the class mentioned, that they should even in England be made law by express enactment, as otherwise the presumption referred to will operate to restrain the statute by interpretation to the local jurisdiction. This being established as an elementary principle of the constitution by authorities so clear and indubitable that no one treating this question without prejudice can venture to deny it, we are brought to the ulterior question as to whether colonies or dependencies of the Crown, whose constitutions emanate from the Imperial Parliament, also possess this power of so legislating as to make British subjects resident within their jurisdiction criminally amenable for acts committed without their territorial limits. As the Imperial Parliament is a sovereign legislature I do not for a moment dispute the proposition that it may confer upon a colonial legislature powers in this respect co-equal with its own, by granting it authority to enact the personal liability of all British subjects resident within its jurisdiction, or indeed of all British subjects generally, for crimes committed without the jurisdiction. The question to be dealt with here is not as to the power of Parliament in this respect, but as to whether such authority has actually been conferred.\nThe powers of the Canadian Parliament to legislate in matters of criminal law are, as has been said, to be found in the British North America Act. It is absurd to say that the recital in the preamble of that Act that the provinces had expressed their desire to be federally united into one Dominion under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with a constitution similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom, can have any influence upon the question of legislative jurisdiction involved in the case laid before us. In the first place this is a mere recital in the preamble, not carried out in any enacting clause, and next the words \"similar in principle,\" even if there had been such an enacting clause would have been wholly insufficient to confer upon the Dominion Legislature, called into existence by the Act, the full and absolute sovereign powers of the Imperial Parliament. This is so apparent that it requires no demonstration.\nThe answer to the question to be resolved must therefore depend altogether on the construction to be placed upon the language of the 91st section, subsection 27.\nThe criminal law, except the constitution of the courts of criminal jurisdiction, but including the procedure in criminal matters.\nWas it intended by this to confer the power to legislate regarding criminal responsibility for the acts of all British subjects, or of all British subjects resident in Canada, though committed without the territory of the Dominion?\nI am clearly of opinion that no such power was conferred.\nNo distinction can be made as regards this question of parliamentary jurisdiction between the Dominion and the smallest colony of the Empire whose constitution and powers of criminal legislation depend on a constitution conferred by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Notwithstanding the great geographical extent of the Dominion, the number of its population and its importance relatively to other colonies and dependencies, powers of this kind must be interpreted in the same way for all alike. Therefore, if under this grant of power to enact criminal laws, the legislature of Canada can declare the acts of British subjects in a foreign country to be criminal and penal, any colony which possesses general powers of criminal legislation may do the same, subject only to its enactment not being repugnant to an Imperial Act of Parliament and so coming within the Act 28 & 29 Victoria, chapter 93.\nThat such a consequence could possibly follow a grant of the authority to legislate in criminal matters, expressed in the general and vague terms of section 91 of the British North America Act, is, in my judgment, entirely inadmissible.\nIt is out of the question to say that the legislature of a dependency created by an Imperial statute has sovereign powers of legislation in all personal and extraterritorial matters relating to British subjects resident within its limits irrespective of express grant. In the case of the national character of residents of alien origin it has no such power. Personal allegiance is a matter which has always been and always must be, in the absence of the statutory delegation of its powers, dealt with by the Imperial Parliament. The acquisition of British nationality is a matter upon which the Imperial Parliament has the exclusive right of legislation, although the effect of alienate upon the local tenure of land may well be dealt with by a colonial legislature. I think it clear beyond question, therefore, that the power of legislation conferred, as regards criminal law, by section 91 is confined to local offences committed within the Dominion, and does not warrant personal jurisdiction as to matters outside it.\nIn interpreting an ordinary criminal law constituting a new statutory offence, upon the authorities referred to, English courts have always held that local jurisdiction was alone intended. In order that such a statute might operate upon the acts or conduct of British subjects without the Queen's dominions, an intention to create such personal liability must be actually expressed. If therefore the creation of a penal offence is by settled rules of interpretation to be restricted as regards locality, it would seem that on the same principles a grant of power to legislate on the subject of criminal law, to be exercised by a dependent legislature, should also be so construed. Indeed the argument in favour of the limitation is far stronger in the latter case than in the former, inasmuch as reasons of good policy, national safety and convenience all concur in favour of retaining all matters of legislation which may in any way tend to convict with the rights or claims of foreign nations in the hands of the Imperial Government; and everything done within the jurisdiction of a foreign government must to some extent be a concern of that government which may give rise to international reclamations upon the Imperial Government.\nThe statute is no doubt less extensive in its terms than the New South Wales Act would have been if it had received the construction put upon it by the colonial court. I fail, however, to find anything either in that part of the judgment of the Judicial Committee which embodies the ratio decidendi, or in the additional observations of the Lord Chancellor, which gives any countenance to the, suggestion that the law there in question would have been held intra vires if it had been confined to British subjects resident in the colony. On the contrary I think the following extract implies that the right of extra-territorial criminal legislation would, if the question had directly arisen under a statute identical with this, have been held to have been ultra vires. The Lord Chancellor says:\nAll crime is local. The jurisdiction over the crime belongs to the country where the crime is committed, and except over her own subjects, Her Majesty and the Imperial Legislature have no power whatever.\nIn Forsyth's book on Constitutional Law[16], a case is mentioned which was submitted to the law officers of the Crown, then Sir Robert Phillimore, Sir Fitzroy Kelly and Sir Hugh Cairns, as to the power of the Indian Legislative Council to enact a law making Indian native subjects of the Crown liable to indictment and punishment for certain offences committed beyond British jurisdiction.\nThe two great lawyers last named considered the legislation was ultra vires, whilst Sir R. Phillimore was of the contrary opinion. This opinion, though not of the same weight as a judicial decision, is still, considering the high professional reputation of the great law officers who subscribed it, of considerable authority and more than counterbalances anything which may be derived from the uncertain and indeterminate opinion of Sir J. Harding, Sir Alexander Cockburn and Sir Richard Bethell, given by the same author[17], where they say:\nWe conceive that the Colonial Legislature cannot legally exercise its jurisdiction beyond its territorial limits\u2014three miles from the shore\u2014or at the utmost can only do this over persons domiciled in the colony who may offend against its ordinances beyond their limits but not over other persons.\nApart altogether from the hesitation to express any definite opinion as to ex-territorial Acts, the very reference to the term \"domicile\" in connection with the subject in question shows that this opinion was not fully considered.\n\"Domicile,\" so far as I have been able to discover, apart from local residence on the one hand and national allegiance on the other, has nothing to do with criminal law; its effects are altogether of either an international or civil character; its introduction into a question of English constitutional law seems to be confined to this opinion. Without pretending to give anything like a full definition of the consequences and legal effects of domicile, I may say that it is generally confined to questions of civil status, marriage, divorce, contract, civil wrongs, descent, testamentary power and civil jurisdiction, and I have never heard or read that it can be invoked in a question of public constitutional law.\nIn Hall's International Law[18], a case is referred to which is not without bearing on the present question. The author says in a note:\nIt may be worth while to cite an illustrative instance of improper exercise of jurisdiction. An English sailor on board an American vessel stabbed the mate. On the arrival of the vessel at Calcutta the sailor was handed over to the police for safe-keeping\". The commission of the crime having been thus brought to the notice of the authorities, they put the sailor on his trial under an Indian statute giving the courts of the Empire jurisdiction over crimes committed by British subjects on the high seas, even though such crimes should be committed on board a foreign vessel. The Government of the United States complained of this assumption of jurisdiction to the British Government, and the latter expressed its regret that the action of the authorities at Calcutta should have been governed by a view of the law which in the opinion of Her Majesty's Government cannot be supported, as a foreign merchant vessel on the high seas is in the position for legal purposes of foreign territory. This case would appear to have depended upon the incompetency of the Indian legislature to enact the law in question.\nHad the offence created by the act been confined to leaving the Dominion with intent to go through a bigamous marriage in a foreign country, in which case an act committed in a foreign state or without the jurisdiction, would not have been essential to the completion of the offence, which would in that case have been wholly local, it would in my opinion have been within the jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament, but as I have shown above, in the legislation before us the criminal act is the marriage without the jurisdiction preceded by the act of leaving the Dominion with intent to celebrate it.\nIn addition to those already cited, I refer to the following authorities which appear to have more or less bearing on the questions submitted. Halleck's International Law[19]; Walker's Science of International Law[20]; Wharton's Digest of International Law[21]; Story's Conflict of Laws[22]; Wharton's Conflict of Laws[23].\nMy answer to the question propounded must, therefore, agreeing with the judgment of the Ontario Queen's Bench Division in the case of The Queen v. Plowman[24], be that so much of section 275 of the Criminal Code as is contained in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection 1 standing by themselves is ultra vires and void, and that those provisions are not validated by anything contained in subsection 4 of section 275.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The sole question which arises upon this reference is, whether or not the Dominion Parliament had jurisdiction to enact the provisions contained in sections 275 and 276 of the Criminal Code. What the sections in substance purport to enact is that, any person who being married and being a British subject resident in Canada leaves Canada with intent to go through a form of marriage in a place out of Canada shall be guilty of an indictable offence to which the Act gives the appropriate name of Bigamy, and upon conviction shall be liable to the punishment by section 276 attached to such offence. Now when we reflect that Her Majesty the Queen permitted her loyal subjects resident in the old provinces in British North America to devise a scheme for federally erecting these provinces into a wholly new creation, and to frame a constitution for such new creation to which the name of The Dominion of Canada has been given, a name theretofore unknown among the dependencies of the British Empire; and when we reflect that the constitution so framed after having been adopted by the legislatures of the provinces proposed to be so united, was in every clause thoroughly discussed and considered by and between delegates, at Her Majesty's gracious suggestion appointed by Her Majesty's Governments in the said provinces, and Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom; and that when so discussed and considered the terms were finally agreed upon as in the nature of a treaty before ever the constitution so agreed upon was presented by Her Majesty's Government to the Parliament of the United Kingdom for the purpose of legislative adoption; and when we see in the constitution so agreed upon that it is expressly declared, that such constitution is similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom, and further, that one object of the new creation, the constitution of which was so framed and agreed upon, was to promote the interests of the British Empire, and when we see that it is also therein expressly declared that our gracious Sovereign shall constitute, as she does in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, an integral component part of the Parliament of Canada, which, it is declared shall consist of The Queen, an Upper House styled a Senate and a House of Commons, I cannot fail to see the manifest intention of the framers of our constitution to have been to give to Her Majesty's, subjects constituting the people of Canada, a political status infinitely superior to that of a colony\u2014a national existence in fact as an integral portion of the British Empire\u2014having a constitution similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom and a Parliament (of which our gracious Sovereign is a component part as she is of the Parliament of the United Kingdom) with sovereign jurisdiction over all matters placed by the constitution under their control.\nNow among these matters so placed under the sovereign control of the Parliament we find \"Criminal Law,\" and \"Marriage and Divorce.\" I confess, it appears to me, that the whole of the proceedings adopted for the purpose of framing the constitution of this Dominion must be designated a sham and a farce\u2014that the object and intent of the framers of that constitution would be completely frustrated, and the hopes of Her Majesty's loyal Canadian subjects who have regarded this new creation of the Dominion of Canada as a mode of introduction, as it were, into the family of nations of a new born offspring of the British Empire, to be followed by a like introduction of others, and as a most important step taken towards the accomplishment of Imperial federation, will be utterly disappointed if the Parliament of this great Dominion now extending from ocean to ocean, and embracing within its limits half a continent, and having under its sovereign control all matters relating to marriage and divorce, and criminal law, especially, and to the peace, order and good government of Canada, generally, should be held not to have jurisdiction to exercise that control in the terms of sections 275 and 276 of the Criminal Code.\nBordering as Canada does upon several foreign States, in many of which the laws relating to marriage and divorce are loose, demoralizing and degrading to the marriage state, such legislation as is contained in the above sections of the Criminal Code seem to be absolutely essential to the peace, order and good government of Canada, and in particular to the maintenance within the Dominion of the purity and sanctity of the marriage state, and for my part I cannot entertain a doubt that the Parliament of Canada\u2014that is to say, that Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada\u2014can pass an Act as effectual to affect Her Majesty's subjects who being married and resident in Canada go through a form of marriage out of Canada, having left Canada with the intent of going through such form of marriage, fully to the same extent as an Act in like terms passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom could affect Her Majesty's subjects resident in the United Kingdom, who being married should go through a form of marriage outside of the United Kingdom having left any part thereof for the purpose of so doing. If the courts of justice should hold otherwise they would, in my opinion, inflict a deadly stab upon the constitution of the Dominion.\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014I am of opinion that the sections of the Criminal Code, 1892, referred to in the reference herein, are wholly intra vires of the Parliament of Canada, for the reasons stated by my brother King in his written judgment, reserving my right to consider hereafter the question whether any Act of the Parliament of Canada can be held to be ultra vires unless in terms repugnant to an Act of the Imperial Parliament or in conflict with the federal provisions of the Constitutional Act, that Act having expressly conferred upon this Dominion a \"constitution similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom.\"\nKING J.\u2014The question is as to the validity of these clauses in their application to the case where the form of the alleged bigamous marriage is gone through outside of Canada. Unfortunately, the matter is before us ex parte.\nWhen the law making power has drawn its lines around a defined combination of act and intent declaring a punishment therefor, it has created a specific crime. It may give the crime a name or not. Bishop, Criminal Law, sec. 776.\nSec. 27.5, after stating that bigamy is (inter alia) the act of a person who being married goes through a form of marriage with any other person in any part of the world, or the act of a person who goes through the form of a marriage in any part of the world with any person whom he or she knows to be married, declares (by subsec. 4), that \"no person shall be liable to be convicted of bigamy in respect of having gone through a form of marriage in a place not in Canada unless such person being a British subject resident in Canada leaves Canada with intent to go through such form of marriage.\"\nSec. 276 imposes the punishment.\nWhat is made punishable here, in the case of a form of marriage gone through abroad, is the combination of act and intent involved in having the intent in Canada to do a certain act outside of Canada, and leaving Canada for the purpose of carrying out such intent, and then actually carrying it out. The whole is a compound act, no part of which is an offence without the rest, and each part is an essential ingredient of it.\nI assume as axiomatic that it would be valid to enjoin a British subject resident in Canada from leaving the country without a license, or with any particular intent, and to make the doing so an indictable offence. If it be said that this is the same question under another form, as the act of leaving a place is not complete until it is actually left, the answer is that, if so, it shews that the completion of an act outside of Canada does not prevent legislative jurisdiction in reference to the entire act, because it seems really beyond controversy that such an obligation might validly be imposed. But, as the leaving a place happens eo instanti, on the passing beyond the dividing line, the act may probably be regarded as an act done in the country which is left.\nThen, does it differ in principle if the act of leaving the country with the particular intent is made an offence only if the intent is afterwards carried out, or (which, in a question of things and not of words, is substantially the same) if the combination of fact and intent involved in the whole is regarded, and if what is made the offence is the leaving this country with an intent to do something, and the doing of it afterwards?\n[Page 484\nIf any reasonable construction can be placed upon an act to avoid invalidity, it is proper to do so.\nIn Bishop on Criminal Law it is said (sec. 116), that:\nIf a material part of any crime is committed upon our soil, though it is the lighter part, legislation with us may properly provide for the punishment of the whole of it here.\nIn Macleod v. Attorney General of New South Wales[25], the alleged offence was one that was wholly committed in the foreign country. Further, the enactment in question there was one which, upon the construction unsuccessfully contended for, would have extended as well to the case of foreigners, and to British subjects who were not in the colony at anytime before the passing of the Act or commission of the offence, and who in no view could be regarded as amenable to colonial jurisdiction. This was held to be beyond the power of the colonial legislature, and the language of the Act was held to be used\nsubject to the well known and well considered limitation that the legislature were only legislating for those who were actually within their jurisdiction, and within the limits of the colony.\nBut it must be recognized that their Lordships did not merely treat it as a matter of construction:\nTheir Lordships think it right to add that they are of opinion that if the wider construction had been applied to the statute, and it was supposed that it was intended thereby to comprehend cases so wide as those insisted on at the bar, it would have been beyond the jurisdiction of the colony to enact such a law. Their jurisdiction is confined within their own territories.\nThe report of the argument does not show what cases were insisted on at the bar as being comprehended by the Act. The following passage, however, from the judgment shows that, in order to sustain the indictment, a power to impose extra territorial obligations Jon persons not British subjects, or in any way amenable to colonial jurisdiction, was required. It appears to their Lordships that the effect of giving the wider interpretation to this statute necessary to sustain this indictment would be to comprehend a great deal more than Her Majesty's subjects, more than any person who may be within the jurisdiction of the colony by any means whatsoever.\nMr. Newcombe draws attention to the fact, appearing from the report of the case below, that the person there charged was at the time of the commission of the alleged offence (and probably at the time of the passing of the Colonial Act) a person not domiciled in the colony at all.\nAs to the propositions that crime is local, and that the jurisdiction over the crime belongs to the country where the crime is committed, these are not intended to be] absolute and exclusive, as every state admittedly has a right to impose duties upon its own subjects in a foreign country, a right often exercised by the Imperial Parliament. And further, in the case before us, the crime is not wholly committed in the foreign country, as an act requisite to constitute it must be done in this country. Besides, the act forbidden may or may not be an offence in the other country.\nIt does not seem reasonable that a British subject who should change his domicile to different colonies should continue to be followed by the criminal law of each colony in which he was successively domiciled; but on the other hand it seems reasonable and in accordance with considerations of public convenience, and not, as it seems to me, covered by authority to the contrary, that, where a material part of a prohibited act is committed in this country, a British subject domiciled here, and only temporarily absent, might well continue to owe to Her Majesty in relation to her government of Canada an obligation to refrain from the completion of the prohibited conduct whilst absent without any animus manendi. To the extent that the Act covers such cases, I am inclined to think it valid.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014I am of opinion that the Parliament of Canada had authority to enact articles 275 and 276 of the Criminal Code, for the reasons given by Chancellor Boyd in Reg. v. Brierly[26]. Dealing with similar enactments, which had been in force in Canada since 1841, (4 & 5 Vict. c. 27, s. 22; Ca. Cons. Stat. ch. 91, ss. 29, 30; 32 & 33 Vict. ch. 20, s. 58; R. S. C. ch. 161, s. 4), the learned judge held that the Canadian Parliament, when acting within the limits prescribed by the Constitutional Act, has and was intended to have plenary powers of legislation, as ample as those of the Imperial Parliament. Among the numerous authorities quoted in his exhaustive judgment, is a decision rendered by two eminent judges of the province of Quebec, Holland and Aylwin JJ., in Reg. v. McQuiggan[27]. Justices Ferguson and Robertson agreed with him, the former also embodying his views in an elaborate opinion. Since these decisions have been rendered, a different conclusion was arrived at in Reg. v. Plowman[28]. Chief Justice Armour said:\nThe Imperial Parliament could enact that it should be a crime for a British subject to go through a form or ceremony of marriage abroad, but it has not done so. The Dominion Parliament, being a subordinate legislature, has no such power; and that is the effect of the case of Macleod v. Attorney General for New South Wales[29], which covers this case. The second marriage is the offence, and the Dominion Parliament has no power to legislate about such an offence committed in a foreign country.\nFalconbridge J. concurred.\nIt seems to me that Macleod v. Attorney General for New South Wales (4), is distinguishable from the one contemplated in the Canadian Code. Article 275 of the Code, par 4, says:\nNo person shall be liable to be convicted of bigamy in respect of having gone through a form of marriage in a place not in Canada, unless such a person, being a British subject resident in Canada, leaves Canada with intent to go through such form of marriage.\nSo far as I can gather from the quotation of the New South Wales statute made by the judicial committee, that statute does not contain any such qualification. Section 54 enacts that:\nWhosoever being married, marries another person during the life of the former husband or wife, wheresoever such second marriage takes place, shall be liable to penal servitude for seven years.\nTheir Lordships remarked that:\nIf they construe that statute as it stands, and upon the bare words, any person married to any other person, who marries a second time anywhere in the habitable globe, is amenable to the criminal jurisdiction of New South Wales, if he can be caught in that colony. That seems to their Lordships to be an impossible construction of the statute; the colony can have no such jurisdiction.\nThe decision of the judicial committee appears to have turned upon the construction of the words \"whosoever\" and \"wheresoever.\" Wheresoever said their Lordships, \"therefore may be read, wheresoever in this colony the offence is committed.\"\nThe concluding remarks of the judgment rather support the constitutionality of colonial legislation like the Canadian Code. Quoting Lord Wensleydale in Jefferys v. Boosey[30], they remark:\nThe legislature has no power over any persons except its own subjects, that is, persons natural-born subjects or residents, or whilst they are within the limits of the kingdom. The legislature can impose no duties except on them, and when legislating for the benefit of persons, must, prim\u00e2 facie, be considered to mean the benefit of those who owe obedience to our laws, and whose interests the legislature is under a correlative obligation to protect. All crime is local. The jurisdiction over the crime belongs to the country where the crime is committed, and, except over her own subjects, Her Majesty and the Imperial Legislature have no power whatever. Chief Justice Armour observes that the Imperial Parliament has not yet enacted such a law as the one under consideration. It seems to me that a still more comprehensive statute has been passed by the British Parliament, in the early part of the present century. Section 22 of 9 Geo. IV, ch. 31, re-enacted in 24 & 25 Vict., ch. 100, s. 57, after declaring bigamy to be a felony \"whether the second marriage shall have taken place in England or elsewhere\" declares:\nProvided always that nothing herein contained shall extend to any second marriage, contracted out of England by any other than a subject of His Majesty.\nThe Canadian statute applies only to a British subject resident in Canada and leaving Canada with intent to go through such form of marriage.\nThe assumption by a state of legislative jurisdiction over certain crimes committed abroad by its subjects, is fully recognized in international law. Wheaton, International Law, sect. 113, says:\nBy the common law of England, which has been adopted in this respect in the United States, criminal offences are considered as altogether local, and are justifiable only by the courts of that country where the offence is committed. But this principle is peculiar to the jurisprudence of Great Britain and the United States; and even in these two countries it has been frequently disregarded by the positive legislation of each, in the enactment of statutes, under which offences committed by a subject or citizen, within the territorial limits of a foreign state, have been made punishable in the courts of that country to which the party owes allegiance, and whose laws he is bound to obey. There is some contrariety in the opinions of different public jurists on this question, but the preponderance of their authority is greatly in favour of the jurisdiction of the courts of the offender's country, in such a case, wherever such jurisdiction is expressly conferred upon those courts by the local laws of that country. This doctrine is also fully confirmed by the international usage and constant legislation of the different states of the European continent, by which crimes in general, or certain specified offences against the municipal code, committed by a citizen subject in a foreign country, are made punishable in the courts of his own. See also Bowyer's Universal Public Law, pp. 180-182; W. B. Lawrence in La Revue de Droit International, vol. 2, p. 256.\nThis extra-territorial jurisdiction has been asserted by the British Parliament not only in cases of bigamy, but also as to several other crimes which are recapitulated in Endlich on the Interpretation of Statutes, p. 234, n. c. ed. 1888, and has been recognized by high judicial authority. The recent case of The Queen v. Jameson[31], is a remarkable one. By s. 11 of the Foreign Enlistment Act, 1870,\nif any person within the limits of Her Majesty's dominions, and without the license of Her Majesty, prepares or fits out any naval or military expedition to proceed against the dominions of any friendly State, the following consequences shall ensue: (1). Every person engaged in such preparation or fitting out, or assisting therein, or employed in any capacity in such expedition, shall be guilty of an offence.\nHeld, that if there be an unlawful preparation of an expedition by some person within Her Majesty's dominions, any British subject who assists in such preparation will be guilty of an offence even though he renders the assistance from a place outside Her Majesty's dominions.\nLord Chief Justice Russell of Killoween, said:\nIt may be said generally that the area within which a statute is to operate, and the persons against whom it is to operate, are to be gathered from the language and purview of the particular statute. But there may be suggested some general rules; for instance, if there be nothing which points to a contrary intention the statute will be taken to apply only to the United Kingdom. But whether it be confined to its operation to the United Kingdom, or whether, as is the case here, it be applied to the whole of the Queen's dominions, it will be taken to apply to all the persons in the United Kingdom or in the Queen's dominions, as the case may be, including foreigners who during their residence there owe temporary allegiance to Her Majesty. And, according to its context, it may be taken to apply to the Queen's subjects everywhere, whether within the Queen's dominions or without. One other general canon of construction is this\u2014that if any construction otherwise be possible, an Act will not be construed as applying to foreigners in respect to acts done by them outside the dominions of the sovereign power enacting. That is a rule based on international law by which one sovereign power is bound to respect the subjects and the rights of all other sovereign powers outside of its own territory. Now apply those considerations to the present case. Sect. 2 provides that \"This Act shall extend to all the dominions of Her Majesty.\" Therefore the preparations mentioned in s. 11 under which this indictment is framed, are preparations made either by subjects of the Queen or by foreigners in any part of the Queen's dominions. And it also seems clear that the provisions of that section were intended to apply to subjects of the Queen wherever they might be, for we must consider the mischief that was aimed at by the Act. I think the objections raised to the ninth and subsequent counts were based on a construction of the statute, both as to the area of its operation and as to the class of persons to whom it is applied, with which I cannot agree. It is no doubt clear that in order to bring a case within s. 11 there must have been a preparation in the Queen's dominions; but I think that, when you have got that fact established, there may be an assistance in such preparation, or an employment of the kind mentioned in the section, outside the Queen's dominions, which will amount to an offence against the Act, if the person rendering such assistance or accepting such employment be a subject of Her Majesty.\nPollock B. and Hawkins J. concurred.\nIt is contended that this power has been conceded to independent states only; in fact Chief Justice Armour admits that \"the Imperial Parliament could enact that it be a crime for a British subject to go through a form or ceremony of marriage abroad;\" but the learned judge adds that \"the Dominion Parliament, being a subordinate legislature, has no such power.\" Subordinate, in the sense that it is subject to the special laws of the British Parliament, but omnipotent, so long as its legislation is not repugnant to that of the Empire. That is the only limit and it is hardly necessary to remark that, in the present case, the Canadian law is not repugnant to the statutes of the Empire; quite the reverse. A nation has undoubtedly the right to govern itself by one or more legislatures, and when acting within the constitutional limitations, it cannot be said that one is subordinate to the other. All are necessary to secure peace, order and good government throughout the whole Empire. If the Imperial Parliament be silent, the colonial legislatures may pass such laws as the good government of that part of the Empire may require, and those laws are just as binding, at least upon British courts, as any statute of the British Parliament. It is not, therefore, surprising that ail those laws are enacted in the name of Her Majesty and of the people immediately interested, and as represented in their respective parliaments.\nThe internal sovereignty of self-governing British colonies has often been recognized by most eminent Crown law officers and judges of the British courts, both in this country and in England. These opinions and decisions will be found collected in Reg. v. Brierly[32], and to these the following may be added: Opinions of Sir J. Harding, Queen's Advocate, Sir A. E. Cockburn, Attorney General, and Sir ft. Bethel, Solicitor General, Forsyth Const. Cases, 24; Todd, Parliamentary Government in British Colonies, 159; Baron Parke in Kielley v. Carson[33]; Hodge v. The Queen[34]; Ritchie C. J. in Valin v. Langlois[35].\nThe opinion of the Secretary of State for the Colonies of the 17th December, 1869, respecting the validity of \"an Act respecting perjury,\" passed by the Parliament of Canada, may be quoted as adverse to the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Canadian Parliament in any case. But that Act, as well as the Canadian statute passed in 1861 to give jurisdiction to Canadian magistrates in respect of certain offences committed in New Brunswick by persons afterwards escaping to Canada, contain the same defect as the New South Wales statute. They purport to punish \"every person\" committing the alleged offence or offences' whether a British subject residing in Canada or not.\nThe semi-sovereign position of the British self-governing colonies has been recognized even by authorities on international law. Eschbach, Int. \u00e0 l'Etude du Droit, ed. 1856, p. 65, says:\nUn Etat n'est plus que mi-souverain, quand un autre a acquis contractuellement le droit de s'immiscer dans l'exercice de son gouvernement o\u00f9 de le d\u00e9terminer dans une partie de ses actes int\u00e9rieurs ou ext\u00e9rieurs. Pareille restriction affecte surtout la souverainet\u00e9 ext\u00e9rieure, et le degr\u00e9 s'en d\u00e9termine par les clauses du trait\u00e9 qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 cette semi-d\u00e9pendance. Un Etat, quoique mi-souverain, n'en est pas moins un Etat; il continue \u00e0 pouvoir invoquer directement les principes du droit international, et conserve le droit de traiter, comme puissance ind\u00e9pendante avec les autres Etats, sur tous les points autres que ceux sur lesquels il est tenu \u00e0 subordination.\nProfessor Bluntschli, Droit Int. ed. 1896, p. 97, says:\nLes colonies quoique d\u00e9pendant politiquement 'de la m\u00e9tropole, peuvent cependant avoir un certain degr\u00e9 d'ind\u00e9pendance et faire certains actes rentrant dans le domaine du droit international. Le grand \u00e9loignement des colonies d'outre-mer rend souvent d\u00e9sirable, dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat m\u00eame de celles-ci, qu'elles aient un gouvernement sp\u00e9cial et jouissent d'une repr\u00e9sentation distincte. Quoique \u00e0 l'origine, la m\u00e8re-patrie soit seule le si\u00e8ge de la souverainet\u00e9, le d\u00e9veloppement de la colonie exige une plus grande libert\u00e9 de mouvements. C'est par ce moyen que les colonies arrivent \u00e0 avoir une vie propre et a s'\u00e9riger m\u00eame en Etats souverains. L'histoire de l'Am\u00e9rique est tr\u00e8s instructive sous ce rapport. Comme exemple de bonne politique coloniale, nous pouvons citer la conduite actuelle de l'Angleterre depuis les r\u00e9formes de Lord Durham (1836) au Canada et en Australie.\nThe policy, and conduct of the British authorities upon the Canadian legislation since the passing of the Confederation Act in different matters of international concern, and among others, extradition of criminals, Chinese emigration, trade tariff, reciprocity with the United States, and trade arrangements with foreign nations, patents and copyright, banking and currency, navigation and coasting trade, shipwrecks, sea-coast fisheries, admiralty, the confirmation of the treaty of Washington by the Parliament of Canada, etc., demonstrate that Canada, in the eyes of British public law and international law, is no longer to be considered as a mere colonial possession or dependency, but as a component part of the British Empire. They mean that Canada is no longer submitted to the mere dictum of Downing Street, but only to the restrictions of the British Parliament. This clearly results from the language of the British North America Act. The preamble of the Act declares that the provinces now forming the Confederation of Canada\ndesire to be federally united into one Dominion, under the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with a constitution similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom.\nSection 3 enacts that the provinces \"shall form and be one Dominion under the name of Canada.\"\nSection 91:\nIt shall be lawful for the Queen, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons, to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada, in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces, and for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms of this section, it is hereby declared that (notwithstanding anything in this Act), the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to all matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter enumerated.\nThat the word \"Dominion\" means something more than the word \"colony,\" is made apparent by \"the Colonial Habeas Corpus Act, 1862,\" where the Imperial Parliament uses the two expressions \"colony\" and \"foreign dominion of the Crown.\"\nSection 132 of the British North America Act also says:\nThe Parliament and Government of Canada shall have all powers necessary or proper for performing the obligations of Canada, or of any province thereof, as part of the British Empire, towards foreign countries, arising under the treaties between the Empire and such foreign countries. By the Confederation Act Amendment Act, 1871, the Parliament of Canada may establish new provinces and provide for their constitution, and even alter the limits of provinces already established, with their consent.\nBy the Amendment Act of 1875, the Parliament of Canada may confer upon the Senate and House of Commons of Canada \"the privileges, immunities and powers\" of the British House of Commons.\nAnd finally, by \"An Act to remove doubts as to the validity of Colonial Laws,\" (28 & 29 Vict. ch. 63) the Imperial Parliament enacts, sec. 2:\nAny colonial law, which is or shall be repugnant to the provisions of any Act of Parliament extending to the colony to which such law may relate, or repugnant to any order or regulation made under authority of such Act of Parliament, or having in the colony the force or effect of such Act, shall be read subject to such Act, order or regulation, and shall to the extent of such repugnancy, but not otherwise, be and remain absolutely void and inoperative.\nSection 3:\nNo colonial law shall be, or be deemed to have been, void or inoperative on the ground of repugnancy to the law of England, unless the same shall be repugnant to the provisions of some such Act of Parliament, order, or regulation, as aforesaid.\n[1] 14 O.

(1887) c. 184\u2014Ontario Consolidated Municipal Act of 1892\u201455 V. c. 42 (O.)\nThe provision of the Ontario Municipal Act (55 V. c. 42, s. 590) that if a drain constructed in one municipality is used as an outlet or will provide an outlet for the water of lands of another the lands in the latter so benefited may be assessed for their proportion of the cost applies only to drains properly so called, and does not include original watercourses which have been deepened or enlarged.\nIf a municipality constructing such a drain has passed a by-law purporting to assess lands in an adjoining municipality for contribution to the cost a person whose lands might appear to be affected thereby, or by any by-law of the adjoining municipality proposing to levy contributions toward the cost of such works, would be entitled to have such other municipality restrained from passing a contributory by-law, or taking any steps towards that end, by an action brought before the passing of such contributory by-law.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] which affirmed the judgment of the Common Pleas Division of the High Court of Justice[2], maintaining the judgment of the trial court which had dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action without costs. The appellant is owner of certain lands in the township of Elma, included amongst lands in that township sought to be affected by a by-law of the corporation of the township of Grey under the provisions of the Ontario Consolidated Municipal Act, 55 Vict. ch. 42, sec. 585, by which taxes were charged and assessed upon these lands to raise funds for the construction and future maintenance of drainage works to be made by the said township of Grey. He brought this action for the purpose of having the said by-law of the township of Grey set aside as null and of no effect so far as his lands were concerned, and further to restrain the corporation of the township of Elma from passing a proposed by-law to raise funds to be levied by rating said lands to meet the proportion of contribution towards said drainage works charged thereon by the report of the engineer on which the by-law of the corporation of Grey had been passed.\nMabee for the appellant.\nGarrow Q.C. for the respondent, Township of Grey.\nMcPherson for the respondent, Township of Elma.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE J.\u2014Before adverting to the nature of the scheme of drainage work proposed to be executed by the municipality of the township of Grey, so as to affect lands in the township of Elma, in which township the land of the plaintiff is situate, it will be convenient to draw attention to the status quo ante, and to the acts of the legislature of Ontario, tracing them from their source, in virtue of which the municipality of the township of Grey claims to be invested with power to assess lands in the township of Elma for the purpose of compelling such lands to contribute to the cost of the construction and maintenance of a work necessary for the better draining of lands in the township of Grey and proposed to be constructed wholly within that township, the nearest point of which proposed work to the township of Elma is about four miles from the boundary line between the two townships.\nIn or about the year 1873 a small drain was constructed in the township of Grey under the provisions of secs. 3 and 4 of the Ontario Drainage Act of 1873\u201436 Vict. ch. 38. By the provisions of that Act, the drain so constructed having been a local one, constructed wholly within the limits of the township of Grey, it became the duty of the municipality of that township to maintain the drain and to keep it in repair when completed, either at the sole expense of the municipality or of the parties more immediately interested, or at the joint expense of such parties and of the municipality.\nBy an Act passed in the same session of the Ontario legislature, viz.: 36 Vict. ch. 39, s. 2\u2014it was enacted that\u2014\nIn case the majority in number of the owners as shown by the last revised assessment roll to be resident on the property to be benefited in any part of the municipality, do petition the council for the deepening of any stream, creek or watercourse, or for draining of the property (describing it), the council may procure an examination to be made by an engineer or provincial land surveyor of the stream, creek or watercourse proposed to be deepened, or of the locality proposed to be drained, and may procure plans and estimates to be made of the work by such engineer or provincial land surveyor, and an assessment to be made by such engineer or surveyor of the real property to be benefited by such deepening or draining, stating as nearly as may be in the opinion of such engineer or provincial land surveyor, the proportion of benefit to be derived by such deepening or drainage by every road and lot and portion of lot, and if the council be of opinion that the deepening of such stream, creek or watercourse, or the draining of the locality described or a portion thereof, would be desirable the council may pass by-laws in form or to the effect set forth in the schedule for (among other things) determining what real property will be benefited by the deepening or draining and the proportion in which the assessment should be made on the various portions of lands so benefited,\nsubject to appeal as provided in the sections.\nThen by sec. 7 it was enacted that:\nWhen the deepening and drainage do not extend beyond the limits of the municipality in which they are commenced, but in the opinion of the engineer or surveyor aforesaid benefit lands in an adjoining municipality or greatly improve any road lying within any municipality, or between two or more municipalities, then the engineer or surveyor aforesaid shall charge the lands to be so benefited and the corporations, corporation or company whose road or roads are improved with such proportion of the costs of the works as he may deem just, and the amounts so charged for roads as agreed upon by the arbitrators, shall be paid out of the general funds of such municipality or company.\nBy sec. 10 it was enacted that:\nThe council of the municipality in which the drainage was to be commenced shall serve the head of the council of the municipality whose lands or roads are to be benefited without the drainage being continued therein, with a copy of the report, &c., &c., of the engineer so far as they affected such last mentioned municipality, and unless the same is appealed from as hereinafter provided, shall be binding upon the council of such municipality.\nSec. 11 enacted that\nthe council of such last mentioned municipality shall within four months from the delivery to the head of the corporation of the report of the engineer or surveyor as provided in the next preceding section, pass a by-law in the same manner as if a majority of the owners resident on the lands to be taxed, had petitioned, as provided in the first section of this Act, to raise such sum as may be named in the report, or in case of an appeal, for such sum as may be determined by the arbitrators.\nSecs. 12 to 15 inclusive provided for the appeal to the arbitrators, and it was enacted sec. 16 that\nin case of difference between the arbitrators the decision of any two of them shall be conclusive.\nThen it was enacted by sec. 18 that\nshould a drain already constructed, or hereafter constructed by a municipality be used as an outlet or otherwise by another muni- cipality, company or individual, such municipality, company or individual using the same, as an outlet or otherwise, may be assessed for the construction and maintenance thereof in such proportion as shall be ascertained by the engineer, surveyor or arbitrators under the formalities provided in the preceding sections.\nAll of the above provisions are re-enacted in ch. 184 of R.S.O.1887, by which all the previous Acts on the subject are repealed. In this ch. 184, the section in which the provisions of sec. 18 of 36 Vict. ch. 39 are re-enacted, is numbered 590, and is as follows:\nIf a drain already constructed, or hereafter constructed by a municipality is used as an outlet by another municipality, company or individual, or if any municipality, company or individual, by any means, causes waters to flow upon and injure the lands of another municipality, company or individual, the municipality, company or individual using such drain as an outlet or otherwise or causing waters to flow upon and injure such lands, may be assessed in such proportion and amount as may be ascertained by the engineer, surveyor or arbitrators under the formalities (except the petition) provided in the foregoing sections for the construction and maintenance of the drain so used as an outlet as aforesaid, or for the construction or maintenance of such drain or drains as may be necessary for conveying from such lands the waters so caused to flow upon and injure the same.\nSome amendments were made to this section by 52 Vict. ch. 36 sec. 37 (1889) and 53 Vict. ch. 50 sec. 37, (1890), but they are unimportant as regards the present case.\nNow in 1891 it was decided by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in the case of the Township of Orford v. Howard[3], upon the construction of this sec. 590 of R.S.O. of 1887, that a drain to be regarded within the meaning of that section, as an outlet for the waters flowing from a township situated higher up than that in which the drain has been constructed must be a drain artificially constructed within the limits of the lower township and must be used by the upper township as an outlet for carrying off the waters reaching the drain from the upper township, and that a municipality from which surface water flows whether by\ndrain or by natural outlets into a natural watercourse cannot be called on to contribute to the expense of a drainage scheme merely because the natural course is used as a connecting link between drains constructed under that scheme and because the drainage scheme is in part necessitated by the large amount of surface water brought into the natural watercourse in question. In that judgment and in the reasons given by the learned judges who pronounced it, I entirely concur. It proceeds much upon the same principle as it appears to me as did the judgment of this court upon one of the points decided in Chatham v. Dover[4]. In that case the Municipal Council of the Township of Chatham upon a report of their engineer adopted by the council passed a by-law for the construction of a drain within the limits of the township of Chatham into a stream called Bear Creek for the drainage of certain lands in Chatham. This stream called Bear Creek flowed through the townships of Chatham and Dover and by it all waters brought into it by drains constructed both in Chatham and Dover flowed down the natural stream into Lake St. Clair. In the engineer\u2019s report which was adopted by the by-law it was declared that for the purpose of making the drain proposed to be constructed effectual it would be necessary to deepen the stream, into which the waters coming down the drain would flow, not only in the township of Chatham but also in the township of Dover, and the by\u2011law therefore to compel the lands in the latter township to contribute to the expense of the works assessed the lands in Dover as for outlet. The council of Dover appealed against this by-law, insisting, among other things, that the lands in Dover were not liable to con- tribute to the cost of such a work. The case came before us on appeal from an award of the arbitrators. In the case before the arbitrators the engineer who devised the scheme which the by-law adopted gave evidence among other things\u2014that the lands in Dover could use the creek without the drain, and that he had assessed the lands in Dover not because they would derive any possible benefit, but because they used and would use the natural stream which he called the outlet. This court was, however, of opinion that the use by lands in Dover of the natural stream for the purpose of carrying off water brought into it by drains in Dover did not subject those lands to any obligation to contribute to the cost of the work proposed to be done under the Chatham by-law.\nIn the year 1892 the legislature by the Consolidated Municipal Act of that year, 55 Vict. ch. 42, altered the language of the sec. 590 of ch. 184 of R.S.O. 1887 in some respects. That section in the Act of 1892 reads as follows:\u2014\n590. If a drain already constructed, hereafter constructed, or proposed to be constructed, by a municipality, is used as an outlet, or will provide when constructed an outlet for the water of the lands of another municipality, or of a company or individual, or if from the lands of any municipality, company or individual, water is by any means caused to flow upon and injure the lands of another municipality, company or individual, then the lands that use or will use such drain when constructed as an outlet either immediately or by means of another drain from which water is caused to flow upon and injure lands, may be assessed in such proportion and amount as may be ascertained by the engineer or surveyor, Court of Revision, county judge or referee, under the formalities, except the petition, provided in the foregoing sections, for the construction and maintenance of the drain so used or to be used as an outlet as aforesaid,\nor for the construction and maintenance of such drain or drains as may be necessary for conveying from such lands the waters so caused to flow upon and injure the same. In The Township of Harwich v. Raleigh[5], where a question arose identical with that which had arisen in Orford v. Howard[6], the Court of Appeal for Ontario were divided in opinion upon the question whether the section 590 of the Consolidated Municipal Act of 1892, so differed in its language from sec. 590 of ch. 184 of R.S.O. 1887 under which Orford v. Howard6, was decided as to necessitate in Harwich v. Raleigh5, a different judgment from that which was pronounced in Orford v. Howard6.\nThe Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Burton were of opinion in the affirmative, Mr. Justice Osler and Mr. Justice Maclennan in the negative, these two learned judges being of opinion that sec. 590 of the Act of 1892, equally as that section in the Act of 1887, applies, upon the question of outlet, only to drains properly so called, and does not extend to nor include original watercourses which have been deepened or enlarged. In this opinion, and in the reasons given in support of it, I certainly concur. Indeed, the contrary opinion appears to me to be wholly inconsistent with the principle upon which the whole of the legislation upon the subject is founded. The language of all of the Acts is very express, and in my opinion very clear, that it is only where a drain constructed by one municipality within its own limits is used by lands in another municipality for the purpose of carrying off water from the lands in such other municipality that the term outlet is used. It is only in such a case that the lands in the latter municipality are subjected to the obligation of contributing to the cost of the construction of a drain in another municipality. A natural stream running through a municipality in which a drain is constructed by the municipality, and into which the waters brought down by the drain are discharged for the purpose of being carried off thereby, is no part of the drain constructed by the municipality; and lands in another municipality situate higher up on the same stream into which the lands in such municipality are also drained by drains discharging their waters into the same stream within the limits of the upper municipality, can in no sense be said to use a drain constructed by the lower municipality within its own limits, and which discharges its waters into the same stream, and therefore such lands are not by any of the Acts subjected to the obligation of contributing to the cost of the construction of a drain in the lower municipality from which, as not using it they do not, and cannot, derive any benefit.\nThere does not appear in any of the Acts a scintilla of intent on the part of the legislature to legislate in such a manner as to enable one municipality by a by-law passed by its council to impose upon lands situate in another municipality an obligation to contribute to the cost of the construction and maintenance of a drain constructed within the limits of the former municipality for the drainage of lands situate therein, which work, in point of fact, contributed no benefit whatever upon the lands in the other municipality. The whole scheme of the legislation upon the subject is that they who derive benefit from such a work, and they only, shall bear the burden of its construction and maintenance. Qui senlit commodum sentire debet et onus is the principle upon which all legislation on the subject is expressly founded. The learned counsel for the respondents rested their defence to the present appeal wholly upon the above sec. 590, and upon sec. 585 of the Act of 1892. This latter section enacts as follows:\nIn any case wherein the better to maintain any drain constructed under the provisions of this Act, or of the Ontario Drainage Act and the amendments thereto, or of the Ontario Drainage Act of 1873, or of any other Act respecting drainage works and local assessment therefor, or of the municipal drainage aid Act, or to prevent damage to adjacent lands, it shall be deemed expedient to change the course of such drain or make a new outlet, or otherwise improve, extend or alter the drain, or to cover any portion of the said drain where it passes through a ridge of land, the council of the municipality or of any of the municipalities whose duty it is to preserve and maintain the said drain, may, on the report of an engineer or surveyor appointed by them to examine and report on such drain, undertake and complete the alterations and improvements or extension specified in the report under the provisions of sec. 569 to 582 inclusive, without the petition required by sec. 569, and the engineer, or surveyor, Court of Revision, county judge, or referee, (as the case may be) shall for such alterations, improvements or extension, have all the powers to assess and charge lands and roads conferred by said sections, and section 590.\nNow in connection with this section all that we have to do with is the drain constructed under the Drainage Act of 1873 within the limits of the township of Grey, and which had been constructed wholly at the expense of the municipality of Grey and the landowners therein who were alone benefited by the work.\nNow by the by-law of the township of Grey set out in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim, we see that this drain \u201ccommenced on the road allowance between the 17th and 18th concessions at about the line between lots 28 and 29, and was constructed from that point along the road westerly to Beauchamp Creek,\u201d where it terminated, having there its outlet into the creek by which the waters coming down the drain into the creek were carried to the River Maitland, where, as appears by the engineer\u2019s report adopted by the by-law, the engineer treated the outlet of the drain to be, thus regarding the Beauchamp Creek which is a natural stream into which drains in Elma also discharge their waters, to be part of the drain which was constructed under the Ontario Drainage Act of 1873, which very clearly it was not. Now what the engineer by the scheme suggested in his report recommended to be undertaken, was the improving this stream called Beauchamp Creek from the mouth of the drain no. 2 to the River Maitland, and so he says in his report:\nIn order to make a proper outlet for this drain it will be necessary to improve this creek to the line between the 12th and 13th concessions, which is almost its intersection with the Maitland River. This creek as a whole is in a very bad state to form a proper outlet for the extent of country that drains into it. In places there is a well defined channel requiring little improvement, while in most of its courses it will require to be deepened, widened and straightened, and have all the fallen timber taken out.\nThe main portion of the work so proposed to be done consists in deepening, widening and strengthening this natural stream called Beauchamp Creek to the junction of its waters, from the point of discharge into it of drain no. 2, the drain constructed under the Ontario Drainage Act of 1873, with the Maitland River so as to give to this creek sufficient capacity to enable it to carry off all the water already discharged into it from drains constructed in Elma and Grey, and which upon the completion of the work the engineer has estimated will be drained into from lands in the township of McKillop, which lands he has assessed (as for \u201coutlet,\u201d also apart from any benefits). In another part of his report the engineer speaks of this proposed work in Beauchamp Creek as constituting almost the whole of the work proposed to be done. He says:\nThe amount of fall in the proposed work being small, the effect of straightening and shortening the course of the proposed work is very important.\nThe fall in Beauchamp Creek from the mouth of the original drain no. 2 to the Maitland River being small, would doubtless make it very important that the stream should be deepened and its course straightened for the purpose of enabling it to carry off the waters flowing into it from drains situate low down upon the stream in the township of Grey, but the sluggish character of the stream there points to the conclusion that the proposed deepening &c., &c., of the stream where proposed to be done would have no sensible effect on the stream in the township of Elma, the nearest point of which is distant four miles from the drain, and so an explanation is given by the engineer why he did not assess any lands in Elma as for any benefit whatever but solely as for \u201coutlet,\u201d quite apart from any benefit being conferred by the work upon any lands in Elma. The engineer also shows upon his report, which the by-law has adopted, what that which he calls \u201coutlet\u201d is, for which he has assessed the lands in Elma to the amount of $4,013.24. He says:\nIn laying out the work I have endeavoured as far as practicable to straighten the course of the Beauchamp Greek or outlet.\u201d\nSo that it is apparent that what the lands in Elma are assessed for is the outlet which Beauchamp Creek gives to them, and it is the lands and roads naturally draining into the same, which in another place the engineer says that he has assessed for outlet. Now as to this section 585 it is apparent that if any by-law is authorized to be passed under it, the section in express terms, by making the provisions of the section subject to the provisions in sections 569 to 582, limits the jurisdiction as to any lands outside of the township of Grey to such lands as are benefited by the work proposed to be undertaken and to the extent of such benefit. So as to section 590, as already observed, neither that nor any other section authorizes lands in Elma to be assessed for contribution under the name of \u201coutlet\u201d or otherwise for any work constructed wholly within the limits of the township of Grey and which confers no benefit whatever upon the lands in Elma. That section in its terms expressly is limited to cases (1) where a drain already constructed is used as an outlet, or (2) to one which when \u201chereafter\u201d constructed will provide an outlet for the water of the lands of another municipality, etc., then the lands which use or will use such drain when constructed as an outlet, either immediately or by means of another drain from which water is caused to flow upon and injure lands may be assessed.\nNow the government drain no. 2 as originally constructed terminated at the point where it discharged the waters coming down it into Beauchamp Creek\u2014and it will still continue to be in precisely the same spot when the work proposed to be undertaken under the by-law of the township of Grey shall be completed. That drain never has been used as an outlet for waters on lands in Elma whether brought into the drain either immediately or by means of another drain, nor is it suggested that the drain so originally constructed when the work proposed to be undertaken shall be completed will provide such an outlet for any lands in Elma. What the by-law regards as an outlet for which the lands in Elma have been assessed, plainly is, the natural stream called Beauchamp Creek as proposed to be deepened, &c., which the engineer\u2019s report which is adopted by, and made part of, the by-law calls the outlet of the drain no. 2. Well, it is equally so of all the water draining into it from lands in Elma; but such an outlet provided by a natural stream for all waters drained into it by drains in the several townships through which it flows is a very different thing from a drain constructed in Grey which conducts its waters to the stream being an outlet provided by Grey which is used by lands in Elma, when in point of fact no water from any lands in Elma passes through the drain in Grey into the stream, but all waters from lands in Elma reach the stream within the limits of the township of Elma by drains constructed in that township.\nIf the deepening, straightening and widening of Beauchamp Creek, where it is proposed to be deepened, &c., &c., within the township of Grey, benefited lands in Elma for drainage purposes, they might be assessed by a proper by-law for that purpose to the extent of the benefit conferred by such work; but that is a very different case from the present, where it is apparent on the engineer\u2019s report adapted by the by-law that the proposed work does not benefit the lands in Elma. But moreover, the by-law assesses the lands in Elma to the amount of $604.12 for the cost of the original construction of the drain no. 2, in Grey, constructed in 1873, and has credited the parties originally assessed for that work in Grey with such amount upon the assessments made against the lands in Grey for the work proposed to be undertaken. For this charge there is no pretence of there being any authority whatever.\nThus it appears by the by-law that lands in Elma are charged with the sum of $4,617.36, which with interest added for twenty years during which debentures will run, which are contemplated to be issued to raise the necessary funds, amounts to $6,796.60 as the contribution assessed upon lands in Elma for the execution of work from which those lands do not derive any benefit whatever.\nFor the above reasons I am of opinion that the lands in Elma purported to be affected by the by-law are not assessable for, nor liable to contribute any part of the cost of, the proposed work, and that as regards these lands the by-law of the township of Grey is absolutely ultra vires. Now it appears that the Township of Elma not only have not appealed, as they might have done, but although requested by the plaintiff to do so have insisted upon acting under it, and have passed a provisional by-law for that purpose which they intend finally to pass unless prevented by process of law, and as the lands of the plaintiff or his title thereto would in the event of the Municipal Council of Elma passing such by-law and issuing debentures thereunder, be prejudiced until the cloud affecting them by such by-law should be judicially removed, the plaintiff has, I think, an undoubted right to appeal now to the courts by the proceeding which he has taken instead of waiting until after the passing of the Elma by-law. Greater difficulties might be raised to his seeking redress if the by-law should be, as it might, and no doubt would be, registered under secs. 351 et seq. of the Municipal Act of 1892.\nI am of opinion, therefore, that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief prayed in his statement of claim, and that therefore his appeal must be allowed with costs in this court and in the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and that a decree be ordered to be made in the action in the court wherein the action has been brought, to the effect that the by-law no. 53 of the Township of Grey, in the pleadings mentioned, is void and ultra vires, as affecting or purporting to affect lands in the township of Elma, and that the defendants, the Township of Elma be enjoined from passing the proposed by-law no. 321 already provisionally passed, and from taking any steps for the purpose of giving effect in the township of Elma to the said by-law of the Township of Grey\u2014with costs against the said Township of Elma. The defendants, the Township of Grey to have no costs of defence to the said action.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J.P.

Malzard. The goods in question are claimed by F. L. Malzard's wife, a married woman doing business in her own name under the provisions of sections 52 and 53 of the Married Woman's Property Act[1].\nAll the witnesses in the case were examined before a commissioner, and the evidence so taken submitted to the trial judge, who gave judgment for the respondent, and the full court affirmed his judgment in appeal, without costs.\nCohan for the appellant. All the evidence was taken before a commissioner, and the trial judge did not see the witnesses, consequently this court cannot be embarrassed by the findings. North British & Mercantile Ins. Co. v. Tourville[2]. He based his decision upon Adams v. Archibald and Slaughenwhite v. Archibald, and erred in supposing that these decisions had any bearing on the case. Neither of these cases control here. In Slaughenwhite v. Archibald, the court set aside the decision of the trial judge, holding that property acquired by a married woman on her own credit, was property acquired otherwise than from her own husband. That case has not the slightest application here. In Adams v. Archibald it was held that the facts disclosed a fraudulent design to cover up the husband's property. Nothing of the kind appears here. The appellant carried on the business with her own moneys and credit, as her own separate business, on premises owned by her in her own right, and paid for by money belonging to her. The property seized was purchased in connection with this business. She cannot be divested of her property on account of mere conjectures and loose or indeterminate evidence. Fraud will never be imputed when the circumstances and facts may be consistent with honesty and purity of intention. Bump, Fraudulent Conveyances (4 ed.) p. 593. Re Dearmer[3]; Ashworth v. Outram[4]; Eddowes v. Argentine Loan & Mercantile Agency Co.[5].\nThe provisions of ch. 94 R. S. N. S. (5th ser.) requiring the husband's written authority to carry on a separate business and registration are based on the Married Woman's Property Act of Massachusetts, ch. 198 of the Acts of 1862[6]. Neither the English Act nor the Ontario Act have such provisions. The following authorities, under the Massachusetts statute, are referred to:\u2014Chapman v. Briggs[7]; Snow v. Sheldon[8]; Long v.

The proper certificates and consent are filed in this case, and the burden is on the person seeking to show that the business is not that of the wife, to show clearly that it is the business of her husband\u2014which is not shown here. Lush, \"Married Women,\" (2 ed.) pp. 170, 171, 302, 323, 391\nBorden Q.C. for the respondent. This appeal should be dismissed because the question is solely one of fact, and a court of appeal will not disturb the findings of the trial judge. Revised Statutes, Nova Scotia, (5th ser.) ch. 104, s. 20, s.s. 4. Gray v. Turnbull[15]; Arpin v. The Queen[16]; Bowker v. Laumeister[17]; Bickford v. Hawkins[18]; Warner v. Murray[19]; Allan v. Quebec Warehouse Co.[20]; Owners \"P. Caland\" v. Glamorgan S. S. Co.[21]. The evidence is also clear that the business of appellant's husband, Francis L. Malzard, was carried on continuously after his assignment, first in the name of his assignee, and afterwards in the appellant's own name, and consequently this business must be considered to be his, and the property seized subject to execution for his debts. Meakin v. Samson[22]; Harrison v. Douglas[23]; Crowe v. Adams[24]; Levine v. Claflin[25]; Campbell v. Cole[26]; Murray v. McCallum[27].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014We are all of opinion that this appeal should be allowed.\nThe evidence was taken, not before the trial judge but by a commission, and we are therefore at liberty to deal with it with less reserve than if the judge had heard it or there had been a finding of fact by a jury. After a careful perusal of the record I have failed to find any evidence upon which the judgment in question can be supported. Prim\u00e2 facie the goods seized were the property of the appellant\u2014they were purchased for her, in her name, and were then ostensibly in her possession. All the provisions of the statute authorizing her to carry on business in her own name and for her own benefit, were complied with. None of the husband's money or property went into the business. The fact of her carrying on business in her own name was public and notorious, and there was no evidence, nothing but suspicion or surmise, to support the contention that the business was the husband's, not her's. The facts being as stated there was a strong burden upon the creditors attacking the appellant's position, to prove the contrary. In this we think they have signally and conspicuously failed, and therefore that the judgment should be reversed.\nThe appeal will be allowed with costs and there will be judgment for the plaintiff (appellant) with costs, including the costs of the argument before the court in banc.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

Action to annul deed\u2014Parties in interest\u2014Incidental proceedings.\nThe appeal from judgments of distribution under article 761 of the Code of Civil Procure is not restricted to the parties to the suit but extends to every person having an interest in the distribution of the moneys levied under the execution.\nThe provision of article 144 of the Code of Civil Procedure that every fact of which the existence or truth is not expressly denied or declared to be unknown by the pleadings filed shall be held to be admitted, applies to incidental proceedings upon an appeal in the Court of Queens Bench.\nThe nullity of a deed of assignment can only be invoked by proceedings to which all persons interested in the deed have been made parties. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) on the incidental petition of the respondent, dismissing an appeal by an hypothecary creditor against a judgment of the Superior Court, District of Libreville, which homologated a report of distribution of moneys levied on a sale of lands under execution.\nPending the appeal by the present appellant in the court below, the respondent filed a petition to quash alleging, in substance and without entering upon the merits, that the appellant had no right of appeal, that he was not the transferee or representative of La Compagnie de Pr\u00eat et Cr\u00e9dit Foncier, mentioned in the registrar's certificate as hypothecary creditor that in the pretended transfer, filed on the appeal the appellant was only the pr\u00eate-nom or locum-tenens of one of the administrators and liquidators of the said company, who could not either by himself or through another person acquire the property entrusted to him for sale, and that consequently the transfer was illegal, fraudulent, null and of no effect, and did not confer any right of appeal.\nThe reasons for quashing the appeal stated in the minuses of the judgment now appealed from are as follows :\u2011\n\u201cConsid\u00e9rant que li intim\u00e9 a, paras requ\u00eate sommaire, plaid\u00e9 la non-existence du droit d'appel de l'appelant\n\"Consid\u00e9rant que l'appelant n'\u00e9tait pas partie au proc\u00e8s, en premiere instance, ni dament repr\u00e9sent\u00e9;\n\"Et consid\u00e9rant qu'il n'a pas, pr\u00e9alablement \u00e0 l'institution du pr\u00e9sent appel, fait signifier le transport de sa cr\u00e9ance, qui fait l'objet du litige, et qu'il n'appert pas que le dit transport ait \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e par le d\u00e9biteur ;\nConsid\u00e9rant, par cons\u00e9quent, que l'appelant n\u2019avait pas, lors de l\u2019institution du pr\u00e9sent appel, de possession utile de la dite cr\u00e9ance, \u00e0 l'encontre des tiers et notamment \u00e0 l'encontre des Intim\u00e9s; \"\nA statement of faces and of tile Questions at issue on the present appeal is given in the judgment reported.\nB\u00e9\u00efque Q.C. and Lafontaine Q.C. for the appellant. The appellant's quality of transferee has been, admitted by respondent\u2019s pleadings specially omitting any denial of the fact although material in the case; (Arts. 20 & 144 C. C. P.); and therefore no signification of the transfer was necessary. The waiver of this \u00b0Found of defence tacitly admitted the transfer. Had the alleged non-signification been pleaded appellant would have made proof on that issue. Nullities which are relative only must be pleaded. See art. 1484 C. C. ; Rolland v. La Caisse d\u2019Economie ([1]); 24 Laurent no. 50; Dal. Art. 1596 C. N. no. 60. North-West Transportation Co. v. Beatty ([2]).\nArticle 1571 C. C. does not apply to a party coming into court under article 761 C. C. P. See also Gibeau v. Dupuis ([3]); Stanley v. Honlon ([4]); Reinhardt, et al. v. Davidsnn ([5]); Baiti v.

The purchaser of an hypothecary creditors claim has no right of appeal, and in any event he is vested with no legal rights until signification of the transfer has been made; C. C. arts. 1027 & 1571. The deed of assignment is in contravention of art. 1484 C. C. See Charlebois v. Forsyth ([10]); Murphy v. Bury ([11]); B\u00e9rard v. Barrette ([12]); Grenier y. Gauvreau([13]).\nThe judgment of tile court was delivered by:\nGROUARD J\u2014II s'agit dans cette cause d'une question, de proc\u00e9dure en cour d'Appel, mais si importance qu'elle affect\u00e9e et d\u00e9cide m\u00eame les droits des parties au fonds. Le cessionnaire d'une hypoth\u00e8que, dont \u00cee transport n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9 an d\u00e9biteur, peut-il interjeter appel d'un jugement de distribution qui l'int\u00e9resse?\nVoici les faits en quelques mots. Un immeuble est vendu par le sh\u00e9rif et un jugement de distribution est pr\u00e9par\u00e9 et homologu\u00e9 selon la pratique ordinaire. Le certificat du Bureau d'Enregistrement constate, entre autres choses, deux hypoth\u00e8ques, Ia premi\u00e8re par ordre d'inscription, pour $3,500 et int\u00e9r\u00eat en faveur de la Compagnie de Pr\u00eat et de Cr\u00e9dit Foncier, et la seconde pour $1,800 et int\u00e9r\u00eat en faveur de Cyriaque Sansterre. Lors du. jugement de distribution, ces deux hypoth\u00e8ques avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 apparemment transport\u00e9es, la premi\u00e8re \u00e0 l'appelant, et la seconde \u00e0 li intim\u00e9. Tous deux n'avaient pas fait enregistrer, ni signifier leur transport, mais li intim\u00e9 produisit le sien et d'autres documents dans le dossier avant la pr\u00e9paration du jugement de distribuions. Le protonotaire ignora la premiere hypoth\u00e8que pour la raison que certains jugements produits par li intim\u00e9 \u00e9tablissaient, selon lui, l'extinction de la premi\u00e8re hypoth\u00e8que et colloqua li intim\u00e9. Ce jugement fut homologu\u00e9 par la cour sans contestation. L'appelant, prenant le titre de c cessionnaire de la Compagnie de Pr\u00eat et de Cr\u00e9dit Foncier,\" appela de ce jugement, pr\u00e9tendant qu'ii \u00e9tait mal fond\u00e9 \u00e0 la face du dossier. Dans son inscription en appel, l'appelant compara\u00eet comme suit\nNous comparaissons pour Calixte Gu\u00e9rin, marchand de Ia paroisse de Bel\u0153il district de Montr\u00e9al, cessionnaire de Ia Compagnie de Pr\u00eat et Cr\u00e9dit Foncier, ci-devant corps politique et incorpor\u00e9 ayant sa principale place d'affaires \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al et maintenant repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le dit C Gu\u00e9rin en vertu de l'acte de cession et transport pass\u00e9e devant Mitre Garand en date du 19 septembre 1890 annex\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente inscription pour en faire partie et d\u00e9pos\u00e9 avec elle, laquelle dite comac nie est cr\u00e9anci\u00e8re du dit feu Alexandre Sansterre et est inscrite au certificat du r\u00e9gistration sur les immeubles vendus en la cause ci-dessus\nL'intim\u00e9 demande le renvoi de l'appel, non pas parce que le transport n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9, mais parce qu'il \u00e9tait nul, attendu que l'appelant n'\u00e9tait que le pr\u00eate-nom d'Alexandre Lapalme, un des liquidateurs de la dite Compagnie en liquidation, et que comme tel, il ne pouvait acqu\u00e9rir aucune partie de ses biens conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 1484 du Code Civil.\nL'appelant r\u00e9pondit que le transport qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait avait \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 par les actionnaires de la compagnie, et que ce fait apparaissait \u00e0 la face m\u00eame du transport et que d'ailleurs la validit\u00e9 du dit transport ne pouvait \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e par un incident en cour d'Appel, oie toutes les personnes int\u00e9ress\u00e9es n'\u00e9taient pas parties.\nLa cour d'Appel ordonna une articulation des faits que chaque partie entendait prouvera l'appui de ses pr\u00e9tentions. L'intim\u00e9 en produisit une dans laquelle il n'est aucunement fait mention du d\u00e9faut de [signification du transport fait \u00e0 l'appelant t ii se content\u00e9e d'articuler des faits relatifs a la nullit\u00e9 du transport comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 fait \u00e0 une personne interpos\u00e9e contrairement \u00e0 l'article 1484 du Code Civil.\nL'appelant articule que le transport en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 par les actionnaires de la Compagnie et que d'ailleurs Santerre le d\u00e9biteur principal, na jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 actionnaire. Li intim\u00e9 fit motion demandant la permission de faire \"une enqu\u00eate des faits par lui all\u00e9gu\u00e9s.\nLe 21 mai 1895 la cour d'Appel, Boss\u00e9 et Blanchet dissidents, rejeta cette motion, et renvoya l'appel pour deux raisons :\u2014\nConsid\u00e9rant que l'appelant n'\u00e9tait pas partie au procs on premi\u00e8re instance ni d\u00fbment repr\u00e9sente ;\nEt consid\u00e9rant qu'il n'a pas, pr\u00e9alablement \u00e0 l'institution de pr\u00e9sent appel fat signifier le transport de sa cr\u00e9ance, qui fait l'objet du litige, et qu'il n'appert pas que le dit transport ait \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 jar le d\u00e9biteur.\nLes \"juges dissidents sont d'avis que les plaidoiries \u00e9crites impliquent une admission de la qualit\u00e9 de cessionnaire.\"\nNous sommes de cet avis au moins quant \u00e0 la signification du transport qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9e. L'appelant prend la qualit\u00e9 de cessionnaire dans son inscription cette all\u00e9gation suppose que le transport avait \u00e9t\u00e9 signifi\u00e9, autrement la cession ne serait pas compl\u00e8te et l'appelant ne poudr\u00e2t \u00eatre c cessionnaire.\" L'article 144 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure doit recevoir ici son application :\nNulle forme particuli\u00e8re n'est requise pour les plaidoiries; mais tout fat dont le existence ou Ia v\u00e9rit\u00e9 n'est pas express\u00e9ment ni\u00e9e, ou d\u00e9clar\u00e9e n'\u00eatre pas connue est c\u00e8ne admis.\nNous croyons que cet article s'applique aux incidents qui sont soulev\u00e9s en appel. Puis vient l'article 1130 que l'appelant invoque \u00e0 bon droit au soutien de son appel. Cet article d\u00e9cr\u00e8te en effet que\n\u00e0 moins que le tribunal n'en ordonn\u00e9e autrement, l'intim\u00e9 peut dans les hutt jours qui suivent le temps fix\u00e9 pour faire acte de comparution, opposer par requ\u00eate sommaire les exceptions, fins de non-recevoir et tous les moyens r\u00e9sultant (par. 3) de Ia non-existence ou d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du droit \u00e0 se pourvoir par appel ou pour erreur.\nLe moyen r\u00e9sultant du d\u00e9faut de signification du transport de l'appelant n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9 par li intim\u00e9. Supposant m\u00eame que le d\u00e9faut de signification du transport alt. \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9 dans sa requ\u00eate, nous croyons que le droit d'appel existe. Ii se peut que dans les appels ordinaires, la signification du transport soit n\u00e9cessaire, si un tiers d\u00e9sire exercer le droit d'appel en son nom, point sur lequel nous n'avons pas \u00e0 nous prononcer.\nLe pr\u00e9sent appel n'est pas pris en vertu de l'article 1154 cite par li intim\u00e9, mais en vertu de l'article 761 qui donne particuli\u00e8rement un droit de appel des jugements de distribution. Get article se lit comme suit :\nToute partie l\u00e9s\u00e9e par un jugement de distribution peut se pourvoir en appel, ou par requ\u00eate civile s'il y a lieu, soit qu'elle ait comparu dans la cause ou que sa cr\u00e9ance soit mentionn\u00e9e dans le certificat des hypoth\u00e8ques et qu'El\u00e9e n'ait pas comparu.\nNous sommes d'avis que l'appelant est une \" partie l\u00e9s\u00e9e par un jugement de distribution,\" si l\u00e9s\u00e9e que, si le jugement est maintenu, il perd sa cr\u00e9ance. Nous croyons que dans cet article, le mot \"partie\" ne veut pas dire seulement partie \u00e0 une action ou \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s, mais toute personne int\u00e9ress\u00e9e dans Ia distribution des deniers.\" C'est dans ce sens que les articles pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents ayant trait au m\u00eame sujet, entr\u2019autres les articles 736, 738 741 747 749 et 751, emploient le mot \"partie,\" et il est raisonnable de lui donner la m\u00eame port\u00e9e lorsqu'il s'agit du droit d'appel du jugement de distribution Nous sommes enfin d'opinion que l'acte de transport en question ne peut \u00eatre annul\u00e9 que par une proc\u00e9dure adopt\u00e9e contre toues les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es et particuli\u00e8rement la Compagnie de Pr\u00eat ou ses repr\u00e9sentants, qui ne sont pas parties \u00e0 cet appel. La cour d'Appel n'a pas adjug\u00e9 sur ce point et a m\u00eame renvoy\u00e9 la motion demandant \u00e0 faire une enqu\u00eate. Nous croyons qu'elle avait raison. Nous sommes enfin d'avis de renvoyer la requ\u00eate de li intim\u00e9 du 25 septembre 1894, purement et simplement Nous ordonnons donne que 16 dossier soit remis \u00e0 la cour du Bane de la Rune, si\u00e9geant en appel, pour y \u00eatre proc\u00e9d\u00e9 sur le m\u00e9rite de l'appel, qui y fut intent\u00e9 par l'appelant, et nous condamnons l'intim\u00e9 \u00e0 payer les frais devant cette cour, et aussi les frais encourus devant Ia dite cour du Banc de la Reine sur la dite requ\u00eate, et tous les incidents qui s'y rapportent.\nAppeal allowed with costs and costs and case remitted for hearing on the merits.\nSolicitors for the appellant B\u00e9\u00efque: Lafontaine, Turgeon & Robertson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Paradis & Chass\u00e9.\n[1] Q.R.R. 4 Q.B. 314.\n[2] 12 App. Cas. 589.\n[3] 18 LC.

He thereby also agreed to make monthly payments of one per cent each upon the stock and that the loan should be repaid at the expiration of the class when upon the liquidation of the business of that class, members would be entitled to the allotment of their shares sub scribed as paid up, partly by the monthly instalments and partly by accumulated profits to be derived from whatever moneys had been paid in and invested for the benefit of that class at which time whatever he might be so entitled to receive in shares of stock should be credited towards the reimbursement of the loan. He further obliged himself to pay as interest and bonus, the additional sum of one per cent upon the loan by similar monthly instalments during the time it remained unpaid. S. paid all the instalments by semi-annual payments of $420 each until 1st May, 1884, making a total of seventy monthly instalments of $70 each, leaving two more instalments of each kind still to become due before the date originally fixed for the termination of his class. The society went inoo liquidation under the provisions of 42 & 43 Vict. (Que.) ch. 32, in January, 1884, prior to A.'s last payment and about six months before the date fixed for the expiration of his loan. In October, 1884, the liquidators of the society, in the exercise of the powers vested in the directors under the deed and the societys regulations, passed a resolution declaring a deficit in the business of the class to which A. belonged, and, in order to provide the necessary funds to meet the proporiion of deficit at tributed as his share, they thereby exacted from him a further series of twenty-eight monthly payments in addition to the seventy-two instalments contemplated at the time of the execu tion of the deed. Subsequently,( in 1892) the plaintiff as trans feree of the society, brought action for the two original instal ments remaining unpaid and also for the amount of the twenty eight additional monthly payments upon the loan and the sub scription of shares.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench that the subscription for shares and the obligation undertaken in the deed constituted, upon the part of the borrower, merely one transaction involving a loan and an agreement to repay the amount advanded with interest and bonuses thereon amouniing together to a rate equivalent to interest at twelve per centum per annum on the amount of his loan.\nThat the contract made by the building society stipulating that they were to receive such rate of interest and bonus equivalent to a rate of twevle per centum per annum on the amount so loaned by the society, was not a violation of any laws respecting usury in force in the province of Quebec.\nThat the fact of the building society going into liquidation had the effect of causing all classes of loans then current to expire at the date when the society was placed in liquidation, notwithstanding that the various terms for which such class may have been established had not been fully completed.\nThat under the provisions of the statute, 42 & 43 Vict. (Que.) ch. 32 liquidators have the same powers in regard to the determination of the affairs of expired classes and to declare deficits therein and to call for further payments to meet the same as the directors of the society had while it continued in operation.\nThat the notice required by the twenty-first section of the Act 42 & 43 Vict. (Que.) ch. 32 does not apply to cases where liquidators have determined a loss upon the expiration of a class and required the full amount exigible upon loans to be paid by borrowers That, notwithstanging that the liquidation proceedings deprived the directors of the exercise of their powers as to the determination of the condition of the affairs of a class and the exaction of further payments when exigible in such cases on the expiration of a class, the resolution of the liquidators determining a deficit in the borrower's class and requiring full payment, of all sums exigible under his deed of obligation, was sufficient to constitute a valid right of action against the borrower for the amount of the balance of principal money loaned together with the interest and bonus instalments remaining due thereon according to the terms and conditions of his deed of obligation.\nHeld, further, affirming the decisions of both courss below, that in an action where no special demand to that effect has been made, the court cannot declare the nullitv Of a deed of transfer alleged to have been made in contravention of the provisions of article 1484 of the civil code.\nAppeal from the judgment of the' Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side) ([1]) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, and dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe action was originally brought by La Compagnie de Pr\u00eat et Cr\u00e9dit Foncier against Alexandre Sansterre, sr. since deceased, the respondents being his executors, and, the company having subsequently transferred all its assets to the appellant, he look up the instance.\nA statement of the principal facss and the questions at issue will be found in the judgment of the court delivered by His Lordship Mr. Justice Girouard. The following brief reference to the company's constitution and method of carrying on its business may however be added as explanatory.\nThe company was a building society subject under its Act of incorporation and an Act amending the same ([2]) to the provisions of C. S. L. C. ch. 69 and amendments thereto, and went into voluntary liqui dation under 42 & 43 Vict. (Que.) ch. 32. Its membership consisted:1. Of shareholders called permanent members, whose rights and obligations resembled those of shareholders in ordinary joint stock com panies; and\u20142. Of non-permanent shareholders, com posed of \"classes\",each \"class\" consisting of such persons as should become shareholders during a period of six years terminating at fixed dates. When a class expired, the shares of its members were liqui dated and the proeeeds paid to the sharehodders in the manner provided by the by-laws.\nNon-permantnt members were subdivided into: Non-borrowing members who paid for their shares by instalmenss till the expiration of their class when the received the amount earned either in cash or per manent shares; and\u2014Borrowing members, who were advanedd all or part of their shares on subscribing for them, on conditions for the repayment of principal, with interest and bonus provided by the by-laws.\nIn the class to which the defendant belonged the borrowers received in advanee the face value their shares, and agreed to repay the principal loaned by 72 monthly instalments of 1 per cent, or 50c a share each, the duration of the class being 72 months and also to pay every month, till the end of the class, interest and bonus amonnting to one per cent of the principal loaned. Borrowing members were either; Non-participating borrowers whose relations with the company ceased after they had repaid their loans and who did not participaee in the profits or losses of the company; or participating borrowers who at the expiration of their class, shared in its profits or con tributed to the payment of its deficits. If its shares were completely paid up by means of the 72 instal ments and accrued profits the balances of loans on shares were paid by compensation, but if not fully paid, they continued to pay monthly instalments in the same way as before until the shares of the class were fully paid up.\nThe position of a class, at its termination, and the rights and obligations of its various members, were to be determined as soon as possible by resolution of the directors declaring, as the case might be that the shares had or had not been paid up; in the latter case speci fying the amount of the deficit and how much the non-borrowing members and the participating bor rowers should respectively pay to make up the de ficits. Such resolution was to be prim\u00e2 facie proof of the truth of its contents, and binding on all interested parties.\nThe original defendant, a participating borrower, became a member of a class formed in July, 1878, by means of a deed wherein he agreed to take 70 shares of the par value of $3,500, that amount of money being then and there advanced to him, and undertook to repay the loan at the extinction of the class according to the rules as to participating borrowers. Up to June 1st, 1884, he made 70 payments of $35 each on account of the shares, and 70 payments of $35 each as interest and bonus.\nIn the meantime the company went into voluntary liquidation under 42 & 43 Vict. (Que.), ch. 32, and liqui dators were appointed who, after examining the affairs 6f the company, found that no profits had been made in the class in question, but that part of the capital had been eaten up. They accordingly, by resolution, on October 22nd 1884, declared that the 72 monthly pay ments were not sufficient to pay up the shares, that there was a deficiency of more than 28 per cent of the capital and that the shareholders should pay in addition to the 72 instalmenss accrued during the ex istence of the class 28 further instalments of one per cent each on the amount of their shares. Trenholme Q.C. and B\u00e9\u00efque Q.C. for the appellant. At the time the liquidators' resolution was passed the defendant had made 70 payments on account of the principal of his shares, and 70 payments by way of interest and bonus. If sufficient profits had been earned, two more payments on the shares and two more on the interest and bonus would have discharged him, i. e. for every dollar received he would only have to pay 72c. But no profits having been earned, only 70 per cent of his debt was extinguished, leaving 30 per cent still to be paid in monthly instalmenss of $35 each, and until this was paid in full, he was further bound to pay $35 a month, or 12 per cent, as interest and bonus on his obligation.\nThe contract provided that if the defendant should at any time fail to make six consecutive monthly pay ments, then the whole capital sum should at once become exigible without the necessity of formal notice, and at the time of the action he was in arrears for eight monthly instalments, so the whole had become due and action was taken for:\n30 instalments of $35 on account of principal $1,050.00\n30 instalments of $35 interest and. bonus up to\ndate of last instalment on the capital 1,050.00\n$2,100.00\n6 p.c. ineerest on said instalments sinee last pay ment.. 588.15 588.15\n$2,688.55\nbased 1st. on the deed of obligation for the advan'ce on the shares; 2ndly. on the by-laws invoked by said deed; 3rdly. on the resolution of the liquidators, and 4thly. on the statute 42 & 43 Vict. ch. 32, secs. 18 19 and 2l.\nThe liquidation caused all classes to expire, and at that time a balance was due upon this loan and th\u00f4 company was entitled to demand both principal and interest according to contract and by-laws, and also interest at 6 per cent since the last payments made.\nGeoffrion Q.O. and P. H. Roy for the respondents. The defendant opened negotiations in this matter by a simple application for a loan, and never intended to he and never was a member of the plaintiff's corpo ration; nevertheless the plaintiff, by using equivocal terms and expressions in the deed, took advantage of his ignorance and illiteracy and he should be treated as a non-participating borrower for nothing in the evidence can lead to the conclusion that he was a par ticipating borrower. His obligation ceased at the expiration of the class in which plaintiff thought fit to include him.\nThe liquidaiion put an end to all classes and the liquidators were bound, without requiring further instalments on shares (which would have been continuing the operations of the society), to proceed according to section 21 of 42 & 48 Vict. ch. 32, and call in, on the capital of the obligations, such amounts as they might consider necessary to place all share holders on an equal footing at the close of the liquidation, but only after one month's notice to the debtors. This they did not do.\nThe company being in liquidation on the 10th January, 1884, and classes all expired, the special powers in respect thereto did not pass to any one because, for such purposes, the directors alone were designated, and consequently the time fixed by the statute lapsed, and the liquidators never had the right either by law or by the by-laws of the society to pass the resolution of October 22nd, 1884. This resolution is ultra vires and of no effect.\nThe plaintiff cannot recover the usurious rate of interest charged ([3]), and the by-laws charging interest above 6 per cent are illegal and ultra vires. Section 2 of ch. 69 C. S. L. C does not provide a method of charging more than 6 per cent on loans. The only bonus there authorized is in the case of a member receiving his share in advance before the class to which he belongs is realized, and this bonus cannot be anything but one fixed sum, payable once, and not a series of small sums forming a sum equal to 6 per cent over and above the 6 per cent charged as interest. The bonus, in this form, is usury disguised and a violation of the statute against usury with respect to building societies.\nThe defendant paid plaintiff from 1878 to May, 1884, $5,65.51; the sum loaned was .$3,500 and the interest accrued on the capital remaining due after each payment amounts to $630, forming together $4,130, which was all the plaintiff was ever entitled to receive hut defendant has, through ignorance, paid $1,527.51 in excess of his legitimate debt and should have it reimbursed. Thus the defendant owed nothing to the plaintiff at the time of action.\nThe present appellant has no actual interest in the suit, but is merely the prele-nom of one of the liquidators of the company who has, through his inter vention, sought illegally to acquire the company's property while a trustee, in contravention of article 1484 of the Civil Code.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGRIROUARD J.\u2014Cette cause, d\u00e9barrass\u00e9e de nombreux d\u00e9tails de fait et de proc\u00e9dure qui sont plus propess \u00e0 l'embroulller qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9claircir, se r\u00e9duit \u00e0 peu de points. En 1878, Alexandre Sansterre, p\u00e9re, devint emprunteur participant, c'est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 Ia fois emprunteur et action naire d'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de construction, et comme toujours il esp\u00e9rait que les profits r\u00e9alis\u00e9s lui permettraient de rembourser, en 72 versements mensuels de $35 chaque' le capital emprunt\u00e9, savoir $3,500, et les int\u00e9r\u00eats et bonus au taux de 12 par cent par ann\u00e9e, c'est-\u00e0-dire, 72 autres versements mensuels de $35 chaque.\nI'entreprise ne fut pas aussi profitable que ses promoteurs l'esp\u00e9raient, et le 10 janvier 1884, elle demanda sa liquidation volontaire. Le 1cr mai 1884, Sansterre compl\u00e9tait ses soixante-dix versements en capital et int\u00e9r\u00eats et bonus de $70 chaque, et il n'avait que deux versemeuts de plus \u00e0 remplir pour s'acquttter enti\u00e8re-ment envers la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, s'il n'\u00e9tait survenu rien dextraordinaire Mais voil\u00e0 que le 22 octobre 1884, les liqui dateuss constatent, conform\u00e9ment aux r\u00e8glemenss de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, qu'il y a eu perte d'au moins 28 par cent pour la classe de Sansteree, et ajoutant les deux versements non pav\u00e9s, le d\u00e9biteur devait encore au moins 30 par cent sur le capitaL- De l\u00e0, la pr\u00e9sente action qui fut intent\u00e9e le 19 avril 1890 par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de construction et reprise par l'appelant comme son cessionnaire, une premi\u00e9re poursuite ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e, sauf \u00e0 se pourvoir. L'action a deux objets, d'abord le recouvrement de la dite balance de capital et celui de pareille somme \u00e0 titre d'int\u00e9r\u00eats et bonus, en tout $2,100 et $586 diint\u00e9r\u00eat au taux de 6 par cent par an. La Cour SupCrieure ( Tait J.) accorda les conclusions de l'action. Sur appel pris parles ex\u00e9cuteurs t\u00e9stamentaires d'Alexandre Sansterre, d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 pendant l'instance, la Cour d'Appel les renvoya in toto. Elle fut unanime \u00e0 juger que la liquidation mettait fin aux op\u00e9rations de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, et qu'aucun versement subs\u00e9quent ne pouvait \u00eatre demand\u00e9 aux actionnarres, \u00e0 ce seul titre, sauf pour payer les dettes imputables \u00e0 la classe \u00e0 laquelle Sansterre appartenait, et il n'en existait aucune. Les juges Boss\u00e9 et Blanchet \u00e9taient enfin d'avis que l'emprunteur devait payer la balance de son obligation, et que l'action devait \u00eatre maintenue pour autant. Nous sommes aussi de cet avis.\nLes intim\u00e9s pr\u00e9tendent que l'appelant n'est que le pr\u00eate-nom d'Alexandre Lapalme qui, bien que liquidateur de ladite soci\u00e9t\u00e9, en a acquss l'actif pour son profit et particuli\u00e8rement la dite r\u00e9clamation contre lui, par l'interposition de l'appelant contrairement \u00e0 l'article 1484 du Code Civil. Mais il n'a pas demand\u00e9 Ia nul lit\u00e9 de ce transport. Et puis, peut-elle \u00eatre prononc\u00e9e lorsque la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ou ses liquddateurs ne sont pas en cause? Ce moyen n'est done pas fond\u00e9, et ii a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 taut par la cour Sup\u00e9rieure que par la cour d'Appel.\nLa majorit\u00e9 des jugss de la cour d'Appel invoque la derni\u00e8re partie de la section 21 de la 42 & 43 Vict. ch. 32 (Qu\u00e9bec) qui exige un mois d'avis \u00e0 l'emprunteur par ticipant, ou actionnaire, avis qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9; mais comme je lis cetee section, cet avis n'est requis que lorsque les liquidateurs demandent le paiement par tiel de ce qui reste d\u00fb en vertu de l'obiigaiion, et non pas lorsqu'ils ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9, comme ils l'ont fait dans l'es p\u00e9ce, que l'obiigation recevrait sa pleine ex\u00e9cution et que l'emprunteur doit payer cent centins par piastre. Cette section 21 en effet se lit comme suit:\nLe capital de toute obligation consentie par un actionnaire \u00e0 Ia soci\u00e9t\u00e9, et dont l'\u00e9poque du remboursement est ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e ou fix\u00e9e \u00e0 l'extinction d'une clasee continuera \u00e0 devenir exigible aux termes de l'obligation m\u00eame et des r\u00e8glements de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9; mais de plus, les liquidateurs pourront, de temps \u00e0 autre, exiger sir le capital de ces obligations tels montants qui seront jug\u00e9s par eux n\u00e9cessaires, pour placer les actionnaires sur un pied d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 dans le r\u00e9sultat final de la liquidation, mais tels montants ne deviendront exigibles qu'apr\u00e8s un mois d'avss aux d\u00e9biteurs.\nLe paiement des 100 versements a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 par une r\u00e9solution des liquddateurs pass\u00e9e le 22 octobre 1884, de laquelle je d\u00e9tache le passage suivant:\nConsid\u00e9rant en outre qu'il est r\u00e9sult\u00e9 de ces pertes un deficit, pour chacune des dites classes, exc\u00e9dant vingt-huit pour cent sur leur capital respectif, il est maintenant r\u00e9solu que les actionnaires de ces classes (au nombre desquelles \u00e9tait la classe de Santerre) auront \u00e0 payer, en outre des soixante-douze versements mensuels \u00e9chus pendant la dur\u00e9e des dites classes, vingt-huit autres versements aussi mensuels de un pour cent chacun sui le montant de leurs actions, c'est-\u00e0-dire, qu'ils devront paver en tout cent versemenss mensuels de un pour cent ou le montant enter du capital souscrit par chacun d'eux.\nLe jugement de la cour d'Appel d\u00e9clare cette r\u00e9solution ultra vires. Mais les liquidateurs n\u2019ont fait que ce qu'un premier jugement de la cour d'Appel, pr\u00e9 sid\u00e9en par Sir A. A. Dorions, C.J., entre les m\u00eames parties et au sujet du recouvrement de Ia m\u00eame obligation, les autorisait de faire. La cour a en effet d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans ses consid\u00e9rants que la mise en liquidation avait \u00e9teint toutes les clases de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et\nqu'\u00e0 compter du 10 jaugier 1884, les actionnaires ne pouvaient \u00eatre appel\u00e9s \u00e0 fournir de nouveaux versements qu'en vertu d'une d\u00e9claration des liquidateurs \u00e0 cet effet tel que requis par l'article 3, section 5 des r\u00e8glements de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nCe jugement me para\u00eet choie jug\u00e9e entre les parties et s'il ne l'est pas il constitue, an moins, une forte autorit\u00e9 en faveur de l'appelant que la r\u00e9solution du 22 octobre 1884 est intra vires et l\u00e9gale, et je crois que cette conclusion est bien fond\u00e9e.\nLa section 18 de la 42 & 43 Vict., ch. 32, dit que__\nles liquidateurs auront tous les pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s et seront soumis envers les actionnaires, \u00e0 toutes les obligations impos\u00e9es aux directeurs par Ia loi et par les r\u00e8glements de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nL'on conc\u00e8de que la r\u00e9solution aurait pu \u00eatre adopt\u00e9e par les directeurs pendant la dur\u00e9e de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9; mais l'on pr\u00e9tend qu'elle. ne pouvait l'\u00eatre par les liqui dateurs. Le savant juge en chef Lacoste, observ\u00e9e que la section 18 ajoute que\nla soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ne pourra pas faire d'autres op\u00e9rations que celles requises pour parvenir \u00e0 Ia liquidation.\nMais en ordonnant le paiement entier des obligations consenties en faveur de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, les liquidateurs, loin de faire de nouvelles op\u00e9rations, liquidaient celles qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 commenc\u00e9es par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, et qui n'\u00e9taient pas termin\u00e9es.\nJe crois enfin que l'acte d'obligation contient une stipulation qui suffit pour d\u00e9terminer l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance et 1. exigibilit\u00e9 du capital de la dite obligation, et c'est la suivante:\nEt le dit sieur Santerre, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 comme susdit s'oblige de rembourser et payer la dite somme capitale \u00e0 la dite Compagnie de Pr\u00eat et Cr\u00e9dit Foncier, ce acceptant, \u00e0 l'extinction de la dite classe, savoir: \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 conform\u00e9ment aux lois r\u00e9gissant la constitution de la dite compagnie et \u00e0 ses r\u00e8glements, les affaires de Ia classe de membres dont le dit d\u00e9biteur fait partie \u00e0 raison des dites soixante et dix parts seront liquid\u00e9es et o\u00f9 les membres seront en droit d'en toucher leurs actions on parts, c'est-\u00e0-dire, lorsque les profits accumul\u00e9s, joints au capital pay\u00e9 sur les parts, formeront un montant \u00e9gal an montant nominal des dites parts.\nLa classe \u00e0 laquelle apparentait Santerre expirait naturellement le ler juillet 1884; mais il est admis qu'elle expira et devint \u00e9teinte par le seul fait de la mise en liquidation, le 10 janvier 1884.\nL'appelant soutient que c'est \u00e0 l'emprunteur \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que\nles profits accumul\u00e9s, joints au capital pay\u00e9 sur lea parts, forment un montant \u00e9gal au montant nominal des dites parts,\nc'est-a-dire, au montant capital de l'obligation. Il a fait plus: il a prouv\u00e9 qu'il y avait perte ou d\u00e9ficit, au montant de 28 parcent, et ajoutant les deux versements dus en juin et juillet 1884, et n\u00e9cessaires pour former les 72 paiements payables \u00e0 tous \u00e9v\u00e9nements, il ajoute qu'il est en droit de demander les 30 versements. Cette preuve r\u00e9sulte de Ia r\u00e9solution du 22 octobre 1884, que Sansterre, en signant les r\u00e8glements de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, s'est engag\u00e9 d'accepter comme preuve prim\u00e2 facie. Voici ce que disent les r\u00e8glements de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, art. 3, par. 5 et 6:\n5. Aussit\u00f4t possible apr\u00e8s l'expiration d'une classe le Bureau de Direction d\u00e9clarera, par r\u00e9solution enregistr\u00e9e dans son ' Livre de D\u00e9lib\u00e9rations' si, d'aspes les livres de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, les parts ou actions de cette classe sont seulement remplies ou si elles sont remplies avcc un surplus de profits, ou, Si elles ne sont pas remplies, quel est le deficit et combien les membres non-emprunteurs et les membres participants auront encore \u00e0 payer \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour remplir cc deficit.\n6 Et toute telle declaration fera preuve prim facie, et jusqu'\u00e0 preuve du contraire, de Ia v\u00e9rit\u00e9 de son contenu et sera obligatoire pour tous les in\u00e9ress\u00e9s sans qu'il soit besoin de produire les livres ou un \u00e9tat des livres dela soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ou aucune autre preuve quelconque.\nReste une derni\u00e8re objection. L'appelant, par son action, ne demande pas nomm\u00e9ment une balance due sur l'obiigation de Sansterre, mais seulement ce qu'il doit sur ses actions. Je crois que la souscription des actions par Sansterre et son obligatoon ne forment qu'une seule et m\u00eame transaction, et que comme, en vertu de Ia convention des parties, les versements sur les actions devaient \u00e9teindre et ont \u00e9teint l'obligation d'autant, d'apr\u00e8s l'aveu de tous, il n'est que juste de consid\u00e9rer cette partie de l'action qui demande $1,050 sur les actions comme ayant pour objet le recouvre ment de la balance du capital de l'obiigation aux termes de la section 21 de la 42 & 43 Vict., ch. 32. C'est d'ailleurs ainsi que les parties ont consid\u00e9r\u00e9 la nature de leur contrat. Dans son cinqui\u00e8me plaidoyer le d\u00e9fendeur admet qu'il a emprunt\u00e9 de la demanderesse la somme de $3,500 et qu'il s'agtt de cet emprunt dans cette cause, puisque pour des raisons qu'il all\u00e8gue et que nous ne pouvons pas accepter, il demande qu'il soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il y a eu compenaation. Cependant, si l'appelant le juge n\u00e9cessaire, nous lui permettons d'amender sa d\u00e9clara tion de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 faire concorder sa demande avec la preuve.\nIl en serait autrement si nous accordoons les autres $1,050 \u00e0 titre d'int\u00e9r\u00eat et bonus, qui formaient sa mise dans le fonds social de Ia soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et la source de ses esp\u00e9rances de profits; nous admettrions par l\u00e0 m\u00eame que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pent r\u00e9aliser des profits, qu'elle est encore en op\u00e9ration, que les actions n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9teintes par la liquidation, et enfin que l'emprunteur est redevable comme actionnaire'pur et simple, sans savoir s'il y a des cr\u00e9anciers \u00e0 satisfaire ou non ou plut\u00f4t sachant qu'il n'y en a pas. Ce serait l\u00e0 un appel \u00e0 un membre de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 comme simple actionnaire, tandis qu'ici la demande ne lui est faite que comme d\u00e9biteur ou emprunteur. Yoil\u00e0 pourquoi les sections 19 et 21 du m\u00e9me statut mettent fin \u00e0 l'int\u00e9r\u00e9t et bonus et d\u00e9clarent que 1 int\u00e9r\u00eat que les liquidateurs pourront exiger sur ses arr\u00earages, c'est-a-dire, sur la balance de son obligation, sera non pas au taux de 12 par cent, mais \u00e0 celui de 6 par cent par an. L'appelant ne demande que ce taux d'int\u00e9r\u00eat sur les 30 versements dus et non pay\u00e9s.\nIl n'est que juste que l'emprunteur rembourse le montant de son obligation avec l'int\u00e9r\u00eat au taux de 12 par cent, qu'il s'est oblig\u00e9 de payer, et qu'il a de fait pay\u00e9s pendant que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait en operation, et au taux de 6 par cent sur Ia balance qui restait non pay\u00e9e lorsqueelle fut misc en liquidation, et cela aux \u00e9ch\u00e9an ces fix\u00e9es par le dit acte d'obligation et la r\u00e9solution du 22 octobre 1884.\nEnfin, la clasee \u00e0 laquelle Sansterre appartenait, expirant le 10 janvier 1884, date de la misc en liqui dation, Sansterre se trouee avoir pay\u00e9 quatre verse ments de $35 d'int\u00e9r\u00eats et bonus qu'il ne devatt pas, savoir ceux dus. les 1er f\u00e9vrier, mars, avril et mai 1884, en tout $140 qui doivent \u00e9tre port\u00e9es \u00e0son credit.\nApr\u00e8s m\u00fbre d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration, nous sommes arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 la conclusion suivante '. Sansteree a re\u00e7u $3,500 de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de construction qu'il promit rembourser avec int\u00e9r\u00eat et bonus au taux de 12 par cent par an. D'apr\u00e8s la jurisprudence de toutes les provinces et la decision de touess les cours dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, ce taux pouvait \u00eatre stipul\u00e9 sans violer les lois contre l'usure ([4]). Lorsque la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 tomba en liquidation, l'emprunteur avait pay\u00e9 $2,450 sur ses parts on le capital de son obligation et pareille somme \u00e0 titre -d'int\u00e9r\u00eat et bonus, et par cons\u00e9quent, il restait du, \u00e0 tous \u00e9v\u00e9nements, une balance de $1,050 sur le capital, savoir, 30 verse ments mensuels de $35 chaque, dont deux sont Deve nus \u00e9chus avant la r\u00e9solution du 22 octobre 1884 savoir, le 1er juin et le l.er juillet 1884, tel que port\u00e9 en l'acte d'obligation, et les vingt-hutt autres verse ments apr\u00e8s la dite r\u00e9solution, \u00e0 commencer le 1er d\u00e9cembre 1884, et ainsi de suite le premier de chaque mois suivant, jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la dite somme de $1,050 soit compl\u00e9t\u00e9e\u2014soit le 1er mars 1887\u2014 avec l'int\u00e9r\u00eat sur chaque versement \u00e9chu apr\u00e8s le 19 avril 1885 (cinq ans avant l'action) au taux de 6 par cent par ann\u00e9e, jusqu'\u00e0 parfait paiement, conform\u00e9ment la \u00e0 section 19 de la 42 & 43 Vict., ch. 32.\nNous n'allouons que cinq ann\u00e9es d'int\u00e9r\u00eat, accrus avant l'institution de l'action les int\u00e9r\u00eats ant\u00e9rieurs au 19 avril 1885 \u00e9tant prescrits aux termes des articles 2250 et 2267 du Code Civil.\nIl faudra d\u00e9duire les $140 pay\u00e9es apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9claration en liquidaiion \u00e0 titre d'int\u00e9r\u00eat et bonus, ainsi qu'il est dit plus haut.

The plaintiff's daughter was employed in the defendant's laundry in the operation of a steam mangle of which she perfectly understood the management. At the time of the accident the machine was in good working order and was not considered dangerous to operate provided the person using it exercised ordinary care and prudence. The Government Inspector of Factories visited the establishment and approved of the machine before the accident occurred and could not suggest any new guard or improvement necessary for the safety of an employee operating it. The factory was kept in the\\ best possible order, was well ventilated and at the time of the accident was not unusually warm. It appeared that the victim of the accident had gone to work on the morning in question without breakfast, and was attacked by faintness, and, while in a state of unconsciousness she dropped her hand into an opening in the machine and received severe injuries by coming in contact with the heated cylinder and large revolving rollers.\nGeoffrion Q.C. and Goyette for the appellant.\nMcGibbon Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTaschereau J.\u00ad__This appeal must be dismissed.

This is an appeal upon a question of fact, and though it is true, as said before us by counsel for the appellant, that his action was maintained by the court of first instance, yet his appeal here does not get much support from it. For it is settled law upon which we have often acted here, that where a judgment upon facts has been rendered by a court of first instance, and a first court of appeal has reversed that judgment a second court of appeal should interfere with the judgment on the first appeal, only if clearly satisfled that it is erroneous; Symington v.

(1) L. R. 2 H. L. Sc. 415.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF QUEENS BENCH FOR LOWER CANADA (APPEAL SIDE).\nMaster and Servant\u2014Hiring of Personal Services\u2014Municipal corporation\u2014 Appointment of officers \u2014 Summary dismissal\u2014Libellous resolution\u2014 Statute, interpretation of\u2014Difference in text of English and French versions\u201452 V. c. 79, s.79 (Q.)\u2014 \"A discretion\"\u2014 At pleasure.\"\nThe Charter of the City of Montreal, 1889 (52 Vict. ch. 79,) section 79 givss power to the City Council to appoint and remove such officers as it may deem necessary to carry into execution the powers vested in it by the charter, the French version of the Act stating that such powers may be exercised \"d sa dis cr\u00e9tion,\" while the English version has the words \"at its pleasure.\"\nHeld, that notwithstanding the apparent difference between the two versions of the statute, it must be interpreted as one and the same enactment, and. the City Council was thereby given full and unlimited power, in cases where the engagement has been made indefinitely as to duration, to remove officers summarily and without previous notice, upon payment only of the amount of salary accrued to such officer up to the date of such dismissal. Appeal from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]), which set aside and varied the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal in favour of the plaintiff.\nBy the judgment of the trial court the plaintiff was awarded $3,000 damages for wrongful and abrupt dismissal as an officer of the Corporation of Montreal and a further sum of $487.50, (the equivalent of his salary at the rate of his engagement from the date of the last payment made to him up to the institution of the action,) as salary and damages for the violation of the contract of engagement between him and the respondent. On appeal the Court of Queen's Bench re versed the finding of the Superior Court as to the damages for wrongful dismissal, and reduced the other item to $257.50, amount of salary remaining unpaid at the time of his dismissal.\nA statement of the circumstances under which the action was brought and of the facts and questions at issue, will be found in the judgment reported. The resolution of the Council of the City of Montreal dismissing the appellant was in the following terms:\u2014\n\"Whereas it appears by the report of the Sub-Committee, that Adolphus Davis, the superintendent of the Water Works Department, Montreal, committed a serious fault by making unfounded charges against his assistant Mr. Laforest, and especially by accusing the latter of incompetency;\n\" Whereas in said report, said Davis is charged with negligence towards his committee;\n\"Whereas it appears that said Davis, since he is employed by the city, has refused and still refuses, systematically and without any cause whatever, to re cognize Mr. Laforest as his assistant, and tends to render inefficient the administration of the Water Department;\n\"Be it resolved to dismiss said Davis as Superintendent of the Montreal Water Works and that he be hereby dismissed as such.\nMadore for the appellant. On the appellant's ap pointment his salary was fixed at a certain rate per year. His engagement was therefore a yearly engagement subject to the ordinary rules as to renewals and termi nation; Arts. 1609, 1642, 1667, 1670 C.C. Appellant is entitled to his full salary up to the time he brought action and further recourse for whatever balance he can claim under his contract. No unusual privilege arises from the respondent's powers under 52 Vict. ch. 79, sec. 79. The right of dismissal given by the statute cannot be exercised arbitrarily; it must be done according to the laws applicable to the lease and hire of personal services. In the exercise of all discretion thus given, the rules of reason and justice must be followed. Rooke's Case ([2]); Keighley's Case ([3]); Lee v. Bude and Torrington Junction Railway Co. ([4]); and dismissals made in a manner legal and regular and not capri ciously. Substantial reasons must be given. In re Taylor ([5]); Doherty v. Allman ([6]); Wilson v. Rastali ([7]).\nThere is a difference between the term \"at pleasure\" used in the English version of this section 79 and \" \u00e1 discr\u00e9tion'' in the French version,\u2014and it is quite evident that the French text expressed the intention of the Quebec legislature with the greatest certainty.\nSection 79 is the reproduction of section 64 of ch. 51 of 37 Vict., (Que.) under which Dugdale v. The City of Montreal ([8]), was decided. This disposition did not give the right to dismiss servants, unfairly, without notice and in violation of contract. The Montreal Turnpike Trustees v. Rielle ([9]), decided under a similar clause of the charter of the Montreal Turn pike Trustees supports this contention, as also does Brown v. The City of Montreal ([10]).\nThe respondents have failed to justify their conduct and ought to be mulct in damages on account of the libellous terms of their resolution \"which was malicious and based only upon the hostility of certain members of the council towards the appellant.\nEthier Q.C. for the respondent. It has not been proved that the city council or its members who voted for the motion of dismissal were actuated by malice, but the council appears to have acted in good faith.\nThe proper interpretation of section 79 of the city charter (52 Vict. ch. 79) given the council power to appoint and remove officers at its pleasure. We have to deal here with a commission conferred during pleasure called by the authors ad nutum or durante beneplacito. Full power is given to the employer to remove the employee for reasons that may be good or bad and the value of which cannot be scrutinized by the courts because the employee or officer accepts the position on those terms. Houseman v. The Commonwealth ([11]). Angell & Ames on Corporations, sec. 426, and authorities quoted. Dillon on Municipal Corporations, (4 ed.) secs. 249, 250 and cases cited in note 3. 1 Beach on Public Corporations sec. 189. Harrison's Municipal Manual, (5 ed.) p. 205 and cases cited under note e. No damages have been proved by appellant.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by: TaschereaU J.\u2014The appellant who held the position of superintendent of the water-works in the city of Montreal having been summarily dismissed has taken an action against the city for damages and a portion of his salary, pretended to have become due subsequently to the date of his dismissal. The facts of the case may be briefly stated as follows:\u2014On the first of August, 1892, the appellant was appointed by the city council as superintendent of the water-works. At that time nothing was mentioned of his salary but two months later on the third day of October, a resolution was passed by the council fixing it at $3,500 per annum. On the twenty-first day of May, 1895, the city council passed a resolution dismissing him. Hence the pre sent action, contanning a number of allegations, to the effect that the council were prompted by pure malice and hostility towards the appellant; that a conspiracy had been got up by certain members of the council with the object of getting rid of him; that an investigation had taken place before the water committee with the determination on the part of its members to obtain his dismissal; that Laforest his assistant, with a view of superseding him, had influenced the committee in every possible way, and that, the dismissal being unjusti fiable, he, tthe appellant), was well founded in asking $50,000 damages and $487.50 for salary.\nThe answer of the respondent to those allegations consists in stating that the agreement entered into between the city and the appellant on the first of August, 1892, was vague and uncertain; no time was therein mentioned for its duration, and even no salary of any kind was determined; that by 52 Vict. ch. 79, sec. 79,\nthe council may appoint such officers as it may think necessary to carry into execution the powers vested in it by the said Act, and may prescribe and regulate by by-law the duties of such officers repectively, and at its pleasure remove any such officer and appoint another in his place;\nthat this privilege of nominating and dismissing officers is absolute.\nThe Superior Court gave judgment in favour of the appellant for $3,000 damages and $487.50 salary. In the court of appeal the action was dismissed in toto as to the damages claimed and judgment entered but for the salary that had accrued at the time of the dismissal. There is no cross appeal, and the amount so granted to the plaintiff in the court of appeal is not in con troversy here.\nThe plaintiff's appeal must in my opinion be dis missed. As to the damages there is no evidence whatever in the record that the corporation acted through malicious motives when passing the resolution to dismiss the appellant. There is nothing that can see in the wording of that resolution of a nature at all injurious to the appellant's character and reputation, either as an engineer or as a private citizen.\nAs to the claim for salary the appeal must also fail. When the legislature empowered the corporation to remove its officers at its pleasure, it must have intended to vest it with the power claimed by it in this case The statute would otherwise have no meaning. It must be interpreted as giving powers which otherwise would not lie in the corporation. The appellant has attempted in vain to have us find a difference on this point between the French and English versions of the statute There would appear at first sight to be one but we have to interpret both as one and the same enactment, not as two different ones. And the statute would mean nothing if the appellant's contention as to the French word discretion as differing from the English version \"at pleasure\" was to prevail. Chief Justice Sir Alexandre Lacoste's reasoning for the court on both parts of the claim seems to me unanswerable, and. I would. dismiss the appeal with costs\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant Madore & Guerin.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Rouer Roy and L. J. Ethier.\n[1] Q. R. 6 Q.

C.C.P.\nThe owners of contiguous farms executed a deed for the purpose of settling a boundary line between their lands, thereby naming a third person to ascertain and fix the true division line upon the ground and agreeing further to abide by his decision and accept the line which he might establish as correct. On the conclusion of the referee's operations one of the parties refused to accept or act upon this decision, and action was brought by the other party to have the line so established declared to be the true boundary and to revendicate the strip of land lying upon his side of it.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench that the agreement thus entered into was a contract binding upon the parties to be executed between them according to the terms therein expressed and was not subject to the formalities prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure relating to arbitrations.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), which reversed the decision of the Superior Court, District of Ottawa, maintaining the plaintiff's action with costs. The circumstances under which the action was brought, and questions in issue, are stated in the report of the judgment on a motion to quash the pre sent appeal ([1]), and are also referred to in the final judgment now reported.\nForan Q.C. for the appellant. This case depends upon the binding effect of the agreement the parties made in 1889 referring their dispute to the decision of a third party. That agreement must be carried out between them according to the provisions it contains, and does not call for the observance of the formalities required by the Code of Civil Procedure ([2]) governing submissions to arbitration. The appellant is not obliged to proceed to a bornage ([3]), but is entitled to have the agreement fully carried out and validated as a link in his chain of title to the lands in dispute up to the division line which was ascertained and fixed by the referee on the ground.\nThe technical objections as to formalities taken in the Court of Queen's Bench and here, even if they can apply were not set up in defendant's pleadings filed in the trial court and thus she is not, in any event, en titled to succeed upon them, especially as it appears from the record that she was fully aware of the referee's proceedings and only claims title to the dis puted strip of land by virtue of long possession without any other title\u2014\"Omnia pr\u00e6sumuntur contra spolia torem.\" \"Usurpateur n'acquiert que pied \u00e0 pica\" ([4]). As to questoins not put in issue by the pleas, see L'Union St. Joseph v. Lapierre ([5]); Bain v. City of Montreal ([6]); Venner v. Sun Life Insuarance Co. ([7]); Heyneman v. Smith ([8]); The Queen v. Cimon ([9]); Rolland v. Cassidy ([10]). Geoffrion Q.O., (Champagne with him,) for the respondent. The deed of 1889 is a deed of submission, under which the surveyor Farley, the third party named therein, was bound to make an award and therefore he had to proceed under the rules contained in articles 1341 and following of our Code of Civil Procedure. His proces-verbal and survey do not con stitute an award or decision binding upon the parties, and as there was no award ever rendered the re spondent could properly refuse to sign the proces-verbal or accept the line. If the deed was not a submission, but a simple agreement to proceed to a bornage, and if the signature and acquiescence of the respondents were necessary, the respondents were justifiable in refusing to accept such bornage as unjust, erroneous and illegal. The deed does not comply with art. 1344 C. C. P., as the time within which the award must be given is not stated, and it appears that prior to his appoint ment Farley had already begun his proceedings, without the knowledge of the respondent.\nArticle 1352 C. C. P requires awards to be made out in notarial form, or deposited with a notary who draws up an authencic act of the deposit, and they must be given or pronounced to the parties, or served upon them, within the delay fixed by the submission. None of these formalities have been observed. On the effect of the informalities we refer the court to Chapman v. Hodgson ([11]); Peters et al. v. Commissaires du H\u00fbvre de Qu\u00e9bec ([12]); H\u00e9bert et al. v. Wright ([13]). An award which has been neither pronounced nor served upon the parties within the time fixed by the sub mission is null, whatever knowledge the parties may have otherwise had of the award, and it can be pro nounced only by reading the award to the party. The respondents claim that it is clearly established that their possession for more than thirty years, of the land now occupied by them, is determined by a fence. The evidence both before the surveyor and before the Superior Court, shows these properties as separated by an existing fence for over forty years, and that the appellant and his auteurs recognized this fence as the division line. The surveyor adopted the fence as being the line for part of the way, and rejected it for another part; this is a mere caprice on his part as the fence is visible in all its course and is straight and without deviations.\nThe Superior Court held that Farley's survey was in conformity with the titles of the parties as to the contents of their properties, and that from the measure ment, it would appear that the fence encroaches on the appellant's side. Though the surveyor says as much in his proces-verbal, no titles were produced. At any rate titles are of no value against peaceable possession for thirty years, even beyond the limits mentioned in the titles.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTaschereau J.\u2014This is an appeal by the plaintiff. His action was maintained in the Superior Court but dismissed in the court of appeal. By his declaration he alleged that the defendant and he were each owners respectively of two lots of land that were contiguous but not divided by any regular line or boundaries; that in November, 1889, he and the defendant agreed that for the future such a line should be established by a surveyor named Farley, binding themselves to abide by and accept the said surveyor's report as indicatigg the boundary line between their said respective properties. He further alleged that in the said month of November, and in December, January and February following, Farley proceeded to ascertain the true line of delimination and. declared by his survey and proces-verbal and plan that a line \"D. H.,\" was the true boundary of the properties; but that although he, the appellant, accepted the result of such operations and had signed the proces-verbal, the other parties to the agreement, now represented by the respondent, had refused to do so on demand being made, and continued to occupy a considerable strip of land west of the line, and refused to allow appellant to enter upon it and to remodel the fences according to the surveyor's decision. The appellant's conclusions are that the line as marked in the field and recorded in the plan and proces-verbal of survey of Farley, the surveyor, should be declared the true line of division, that the respondent should be enjoined not to trespass beyond it and give up possession of all land west of it; that appellant should be declared proprietor of the land up to the line and be put in possession of it; and finally, that fixed and final boundary marks should be placed in the field along the line in question to determine the same.\nThe respondent by her plea admits that the parties are owners of the contiguous properties as alleged in the declaration. By several allegations she claims that she was at the time of the action, the owner of the land as divided from the appellant's by a fence for over forty years. The respondent further alleges that she never refused to proceed to a bornage, and she specially denies that she was bound to accept the boundary line as fixed and determined by the surveyor Farley; that the respondent refused to sign the said proces-verbal of survey because the same was irregular, erroneous, and not in conformity to the titles and possession of the parties; that the respondent was not obliged to sign or accept any proces-verbal of survey, more especially when said proces-verbal of survey was irregular, erroneous and contrary to the rights of the parties. By the conclusions of her plea, the respondent de clared that she is ready to run a line of division between the properties in question, according to the possession of the said respondent, and provided said survey takes place according to the formalities indicated by the, laws of the province.\nThe grounds upon which the court of appeal relied for reversing the judgment of the Superior Court are exclusively that the formalities required, for awards of arbitrators by the Code of Civil Procedure, arts. 1344 and following, had not been complied with. I am of opinion that we should not thus allow shipwreck of a good cause to be made on the rocks of refined technicality. This is not a case of arbitration under the Code, but of an agreement binding upon the parties. Here are two neighbours who, to avoid litigation and settle amicably the divsion line between their properties, agree that a line to be drawn upon the spot by a third party, be he a surveyor or anything else, shall thereafter be that division line and bind themselves to accept that third party's decision, but, now that this third party has fixed that line, the respondent refuses to be bound by his conclusions, because they are not in accordance with her opinions and contentions in the matter. She wishes us to read her agreement of November, 1889, as if she had expressly stipulated therein that she would not be bound by it if the third party's line did not suit her or was not in accordance with her views. We cannot do that. She cannot be so allowed to repudiete her engagements. No fraud or malversation of any kind is imputed to this surveyor's operations, and the Superior Court was right in maintaining the action. I would allow the appeal, and restore the judgment of the Superior Court. It does not, however, grant that part of the plaintiff's conclusions that final boundaries be placed in the field along the said line by said Farley or any other surveyor to be named by the Superior Court, according to said proces-verbal, but that may be added on the drawing up of the minutes if thought necessary.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant : Thomas P Foran.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Rochnn & Champagne.\n[1] 27 Can.

C.\nDuring her last illness and a short time before her death, B. granted certain lands to V. by an instrument purporting to be a deed of sale for a price therein stated, but in reality the transaction was intended as a settlement of arrears of salary due by B to the grantee and the consideration acknowledged by the deed was never paid.\nHeld, reversing the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench, that the-deed could not be set aside and annulled as void, under the provisions of article 762 of the Civil Code, as the circum stances tended to shew that the transaction was actually for good consideration (dation en paiement,) and consequently legal and valid APPEAL from the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, sitting in Review at Montreal, which set aside the judgment of the trial court in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe facts and questions at issue in this case are set out in the judgment of the court pronounced by His Lordship Mr. Justice Girouard.\nGeoffrion Q.C. and Beudin Q.C. for the appellant. The appellant has proved the true consideration for the grant of the lands to him to have been legal and valid. Art. 989 0.C.; O'Brien v. Molson ([1]); 6 Toullier, nos. 176 & 177. It is not necessary to express the con sideration in a deed except where the law expressly reauires it; 1 Larombi\u00e8re art. 1132 C. N., no. 8; Dem., \" Contrats \" vol. 1, no. 373; Merlin Rep. vo. \" Conven tion\" \u00a7 2, no. N; Farrau v. Syndics Cartier ([2]). The appellant had been in possession of the property for a long time during the donor's lifetime in anticipation of his title being made perfect by a deed for the con sideration of salary due him. Art. 762 C.C., by its exceptions as to validating circumstances and peace able possession, covers the case.\nMadore for the respondents. The debt due the appellant could not have been enforced at law as it appeared he had received, under a former donation and otherwise, adequate indemnity for any wages owing to him, and consequently, as no valid debt existed at the time of the passing of the deed of sale, and no money was paid upon the purchase price mentioned, this was necessarily a deed of donation passed during the mortal illness of the donor and in contemplation of her death.

The son's evidence on the trial of the suit was to the effect that he never int ended to sign the note, and if he had actually signed it with his father's name, it was because he believed that it was merely a receipt for goods delivered by express. Immediately after the dismissal of the suit, S. wrote to the payees asking them if they would give him any information which would help him in laying a criminal charge in order to force payment of the note and costs. He also applied to the express company's agent, by whom the goods were delivered and the note procured and was informed that there was a receipt for the goods in the delivery-book but that the signature was denied and could not be proved. However, without further inquiry, and notwithstanding the warning of a mutual friend against taking criminal proceedings, S. laid an infor mation against the son for forgery. The Police Magistrate at Montreal, upon the investigation of the charge, declared it to be unfounded and discharged the prisoner.\nHeld, reversing the judgments of both courts below, that, under the circumstances, the prosecution was without reasonable or probable cause, and the plaintiff was entitled to substantial damages.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, which dismissed the plaintiff's action with costs.\nA statement of the case and matters at issue will be found in the judgment of the court pronounced by His Lordship Mr. Justice Gwynne.\nSaint-Pierre Q.C. for the appellant.\nGeoffrion Q.C. and Beaudin Q.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE J.__This is an action for malicious prosecution on a criminal charge.\nThe plaintiff in his declaration alleges that on the 22nd of October, 1892, the defendant without any reasonable or probable cause but from mere malice and after having been previously warned of the illegality of his procedure and of the risk he would run, laid a complaint upon oath before a Justice of the Peace for the Province of Quebec in which he accused the plaintiff of having feloniously and with intent to defraud, forged the name of his father Leon Charlebois upon a certain promissory note. The complaint made by the defendant before the justice was then set forth whereby it appeared that the defendant had deposed on oath that he had become the bearer of a promissory note for the sum of sixty dollars, dated Newmarket, 25th March, 1892, payable at sixty days from date, to the order of the Newmarket Washing Machine Company, at the Bank of Ontario, at Newmarket, signed \" L\u00e9on Charlebois \"\u2014that he had since ascertained that the said note had been feloniously forged\u2014that the signature \" L\u00e9on Charlebois \" should be that of Mr Leon Charlebois, merchant of Pointe Clair in the District of Montreal, but that the said Leon Charle-bois had denied upon oath in a civil court that he had ever signed the said note\u2014that Ars\u00e8ne Charlebois, his son, had admitted in the same cause indirectly having set the signature at the foot of the note and that the father Leon Charlebois, had also sworn in court that he had never authorized any person to sign the said note, \" in consequence of which\" the complaint pro ceeded the defendant accused the said Ars\u00e8ne Charle bois with having feloniously forged the said note with intent to defraud. This complaint had been dismissed by the Police Magistrate, Judge Desnoyers, as un founded To this declaration the defendant pleaded among other things that he was the hearer for value of a promissory note bearing the signature of Leon Charle bois, the plaintiff's father; that having sued the said Leon Charlebois in the Circuit Court upon the note he pleaded to the said action, and made oath that the signature placed at the foot of the note was not his and that he had never authorized any one to sign it for him; that upon trial of the cause the defendant's action was dismissed with costs because it was then and there proved that the signature at the foot of the note had never been set thereto by the said Leon Charlebois, but by his son the plaintiff in the present action, without the authority, consent or knowledge of the said Charlebois; that in these cir cumstances and considering the position of the plaintiff, his information and business experience the defendant was justified in believing and had good reason to believe that the plaintiff knew perfectly well what he was doing when he signed the name of his father.\nThe Superior Court and the Court of Appeal dis missed the plaintiff's action\u2014and hence the present appeal.\nIt is noteworthy here that the defendant in his com plaint before the magistrate alleged that since the trial of the action in the Circuit Court he had ascertained that the note had been feloniously forged. The dismissal of the complaint shows that he failed in establishing that allegation. In the present action the defendant justifies his having made the charge upon much the same grounds. It becomes therefore important to consider whether the matter alleged by the defendant in his deposition upon the criminal charge and in his plea fairly states the whole of the matters brought to his notice before he made the criminal charge and whether in view of the circumstances which were so brought to his knowledge, it can be said that he had reasonable and probable cause for making the accusation against this young man who, according to the evidence, appears to bear the very best character and belongs to a family of the highest reputation of their class in the neighbourhood where they live.\nImmediately after the trial of the action on the note and upon the 1st of October, 1892, the defendant wrote to Mr. Isaac Shupe, Newmarket, the agent of the company, and from whom the defendant had received the note as follows:\nDear Sir,\u2014I have just got through with my lawsuit with Charle-bois, amount $60.00 which I lost. The father came and swore that he never authorized his son to sign notes or cheques and the son swore that he never intended and had no authority to sign notes, and that he signed this one just as a receipt to the express, believing that it was the express receipt. Can you give me any information that would lead me to make of this a criminal case for besides the loss of $60.00 I have a bill of costs of $40.00. I would like to get repaid if I can from father or son I hone to hear from you soon.\nWe have not the whole of the evidence which was given in the action in the Circuit Court How ever in the present action the defendant has called and examined on his own behalf the plaintiff in this action and on his examination the document purporting to constitute his father agent of the New market Washing Machine Co., was put into his hands the same as was spoken of in the civil action and he was required to read it, which he did. The document is headed:\nNEWMARKET WASHING MACHINE CO.\nNEWMARKET, ONT.,\nPOINTE-CLAIRE, 12th March, 1892.\nThis is to certify that we have this day appointed L\u00e9on Charlebois our agent to sell machines in the parish of La Pointe-Claire and sur rounding country.\nWe agree to furnish Leon Charlebois with all the machines he may require for thirty dollars a dozen, payable in sixty days, or twenty-four dollars cash on delivery the said Charlebois to have and to hold the agency as long as he will push the sales and continue to purchase. Said Leon Charlebois agrees to keep the retail prices up to four We further agree to take back at manufacturer's prices and will pay cash on delivery, at any time after the expiration of sixty days from date hereof any machines that said Leon Charlebois cannot sell.\nUpon the back of the document were printed the words following:\u2014\nNEWMARKET WASHING MACHINE CO.\nNEWMARKET, ONT.,March 12th, 1892.\nPlease have manufactured and sent me by express to Pointe Claire two dozen of your washing machines for which I agree to pay thirty dollars per dozen, in sixty days, by note, or twenty-four dollars per dozen, cash on delivery.\nLEON CHARLEBOIS,\nPer ARSENE CHARLEBOIS.\nThe witness having been asked whether he had signed his father's name to this document, answered that he had; that he had been requested to do so by Mr Shupe, but that he had never read what was on the back; that he had read what was on the face and Shupe had explained it to him to mean that at the expiration of 60 days such of the machines as were not sold, if not returned, should be paid for, and that such as should have been sold should also be paid for, and he stated that his uncle Duchesneau was present at the time but witness swore that he had not observed nor was his notice drawn to the words on the back of the document, nor was there any mention made of a note; that the only conditions of the bargain were those on the face of the document which Shupe explained as above, and that he relied wholly upon what Shupe explained to be the conditions which the document imposed. The witness also swore that when he went to the station on the 25th March for the machines, Parent, the agent, never said a word about there being $48 to be paid, or a promissory note at 60 days to be given. That it was about six o'clock in the evening when witness went to the station, that Parent said, \"sign this,\" and that witness signed without reading what he signed; that then Parent said there was a dollar and something over to pay for freight, and witness said that he did not recollect whether he had paid it or not, but he repeated and swore positively that not a word was said either about a promissory note or $48, and the witness added that he had been examined as a witness in the action in the Circuit Court, and had given this same testimony in the presence of the defendant.\nThe defendant in his examination before the Police Magistrete Mr. Desnoyers, on the criminal charge against the plaintiff, said that the plaintiff in his examination in the action in the Circuit Court ad mitted that he had signed his father's name on the note produced in the action and that he had done so under the belief that he was signing a receipt for the express, and that he had signed no other receipt for the machines. He admitted also that Leon Chailebois had said in his evidence in the same action that he had returned 22 of the machines and that he was ready to pay for the other two, but the defendant never informed Mr. Shupe of this fact. He further said that he knew that Shupe's forms of contract permitted the agent to return machines at the manufacturer's price and that he had reason to believe that 22 of the machines had been returned but that he had not been reimbursed by the Newmarket Washing Machine Company the manufacturer's price of the returned machines. He admitted also that Mr. St. Pierre, the advocate before the commencement of the criminal proceedings, had requested him to suspend his proceedings until Mr. St. Pierre should have an opportunity to see Leon Charlebois to obtain the necessary information in the matter and that Mr. St. Pierre told the defendant that if after obtaining such information he should be of opinion that either the plaintiff or his father were in any manner responsible to the defend. ant that he would advise them to pay the note, and further that on two different occasions Mr. St. Pierre had called at defendant's place of business and had told the defendant's agents that he had seen the Charlebois, both the father and the son, and after hearing their explanations he advised defendant as his friend not to take the criminal proceeding. He admitted also that he did not believe that the plaintiff had been benefited in any manner by writing the name of his father on the note in question, but he added that if the machines had been sold it might have been different, and he said that he did not act upon Mr. St. Pierre's advice because he considered it impossible for a man of business to sign a receipt for a promissory note.\nOn his examination in the present action he admit ted that it was at his instance that Mr. Bryce the superintendent wrote a letter which was produced to Mr. Parent, and that Mr. Bryce submitted to defendant Parents reply immediately upon receipt of which he made the criminal charge against the plaintiff.\nThese letters are as follows:\u2014 CANADIAN EXPRESS COMPANY,\nSUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE\nMONTREAL, October 7th, 1892.\nAGENT\u2014POINTE CLAIRE, QUE.\nDear Sir,\u2014Re shipment as per all way-bill. It is claimed by the party receiving the consignment that he signed the note for $60.00 instead of paying the C. O. D. and in signing the note he did so merely as receiving the goods and has no other receipt for the goods. Do you hold receipt in your book for the consignment, whom by, and on what date delivered? Your prompt reply will oblige,\nYours Truly,\nJ. BRYCE, Supt.\nPointe Claire, October 11th, 1892.\nMR. BRYCE\u2014DEAR SIR,\u2014The party receiving the goods, I have his signature in delivery book but he denies having signed. I cannot swear it is his own signature but he signed the note all right and I gave him to understand what it was for\nYours truly,\nR. PARENT.\nNow, at the time of the defendant writing to Mr. Shupe the letter of the 1st October, 1892, he had the plaintiff's statement upon oath of the circumstances under which Shupe procured him to sign the docu ment appointing his father agent of the Washing Machine Manufacturing Company which, upon its face has not a word about a promissory note being to be given and further that the plaintiff's attention had not been drawn to the nature and purport of the in dorsement in which the words \" by note\" are intro duced thus changing the purport and effect of what appears on the face of the document which had been explained to him by Shupe in the manner described by the plaintiff No evidence whatever had been given to shake this sworn testimony of the plaintiff and uncontradicted it seems to point very strongly to the fact of a deception of no uncommon character having been practised upon this youth by Mr. Shupe and calculated to deceive and which has succeeded in deceiving and defrauding more experienced persons than this youth of 20 years of age as the experience of courss of justice has abundantly shown. No promis sory note having been mentioned in the transaction, and the plaintiff's attention not having been drawn as he swore it had not to the contents of the indorsement which Shupe procured him to sign, it was but natural that he should not have expected a promissory note to be presented to him for his signature when he went for the machines at six o'clock on the evening of the 25th March, and only one paper having been pre sented to him for his signature when he received the machines, it is by no means incredible that the plain tiff should have signed it without reading it in the belief that it was a receipt for the goods that were being delivered to him that he was asked to sign Yet it is upon the suggested incredibility of this state ment of the plaintiff on his oath that the defendant mainly rests his charge against the plaintiff of his having feloniously forged his father's name to the note although no possible benefit that he could obtain or fraud that he could thereby have committed has been or apparently can be suggested. The defendant also in the civil action heard Leon Charlebois swear that he had returned twenty-two of the machines as unsaleable and in accordance with the terms of the document appointing him agent of the company, and the defendant has admitted that he knew Shupe's forms of contracts, and that they allow agents to return unsold machines at the manufacturer's prices and that he had reason to believe that twentv two of the machines received by Oharlebois had been returned It is apparent then from the defendant's knowledge of the above facts that he had not and from his letter of the 1st of October, 1892 that he knew he had not any reasonable grounds whereon to make a charge of forgery against the plaintiff, and that his object in writing the letter was to try to obtain any evidence whereon to found such a charge in the hope and expectation of thereby compelling Leon Charlebois, the father, to pay what the defendant had lost by his civil action having failed instead of suing the company who were liable to him as the indorsers. Now the only further evidence upon which the defendant rested his charge of felonious forgery against the plaintiff was Parent's answer to the latter written to him by Mr. Bryce at the defend ant's suggestion, immediately after seeing which the defendant admits that he laid the charge in which he swore that since the action he had ascertained that the promissory note upon which the action was founded had been feloniously forged. From the above facts it plainly appears, I think, that the defendant was willing to catch at any straw to satisfy his conscience and to enable him to force the plaintiff or his father rather to reimburse to him his loss, when he accepted this letter of Parent as sufficient to displace all the sworn testimony and to support such a grave charge as felonious forgery which the contents of Parent's letter, even if uncontradicted were wholly insufficient to support. I must say that the making of such a charge under the circumstances appearing in evidence as above detailed and in the face of the warning given by Mr. St. Pierre, an intimate acquaintance of the defendant and the plaintiff's father, was a wrongful, wanton, reckless and utterly unfounded proceeding originating in what is plainly shown to be actual malice.\nUpon the charge before the magistrate the defendant appears to have called Parent to substantiate the statement in his letter. Comparing his evidence so given in chief with what is in his letter no one could suppose, although established by himself in cross- examination that the receipt for the machines in the book of the express company which is in the name of \" L. Charlebois \" and over the \" L \" the letter \"A\" is inserted erasing the \" L\"is in the handwriting of Parent himself and whom it would be as reasonable to accuse of forgery as to charge the plaintiff with forgery, even if he had knowingly set his father's name to the note. The witness stated that it was in the evening, about 6 o'clock, when he, Parent, was very much engaged that plaintiff signed the paper, the entry having been presented to him upon receipt of which the machines were delivered to him; had the defendant been in possession of Parent's affidavit instead of his letter only there was nothing in it which in the face of all the other matters in the defendant's knowledge could have justified him in making the charge.\nI think that the judgment of the court below cannot be sustained, and that the plaintiff is entitled to substantial damages for a very grave charge maliciously preferred against him without any reasonable or probable cause whatever. The appeal must therefore be allowed with costs and judgment be Ordered to be entered for the plaintiff in the action in the court below for five hundred dollars damages and costs in all the courts of the class of action as brought.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Saint-Pierre Pellissier & Wilson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Beaudin, Cardinal Loranger & St. Germain.\n",

The appellant's establishment was kept in the best possible order. Cooper v. Wooley ([2]); Nichols v. Hall ([3]). The revolving shaft where the accident occurred cannot by any practicable means be guarded so as to prevent such accidents. The skirt board introduced after the accident could not prevent accidents under similar circumstances. Desroches et al. v. Gauthier ([4]). There is no proof of any fault, on the part of the appellant, to which the accident was directly due. Montreal Rolling Mills Co. v. Corcoran ([5]); Mercier v. Morin ([6]); Dominion Oil Cloth Co. v. Coallier ([7]); Sarault v. Viau ([8]); Thomas v. Quartermaina ([9]); Radley v. London and North-Western Railway Co. ([10]). The breach of a duty imposed by the \" Quebec Factories Act \" does not vest any right of action for damages in a person injured; Atkinson v. Newcastle etc. Waterworks Co. ([11]); it is merely an Act providing for police regulations; Wilson v. Merry ([12]); Montreal Rolling Mills v. Corcoran (1). This Act merely requires reasonable and necessary guards, such as are practicable, not that every conceivable point should be protected. The master is not an insurer of his servant's safety. Moffette v. The Grand Trunk Railway Go. ([13]); Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Goyette ([14]); Currie v. Couture ([15]). The accident could not have been foreseen or provided against by the appellant.\nThe factory rules strictly prohibited employees making their toilet before the closing hour, or at or near the machines. The accident was due to the employee's disobedience of rules, negligence and imprudence; \" Volenti non fit injuria.\" Sourdat, \" Responsabilit\u00e9 \" nos. 660 & 912; 7 Larombi\u00e8re, Arts 1382-1383 C.

He had not fulfilled the requirements of the \" Quebec Factories Act,\" and the presumptions are against him as a wrongdoer, responsibility follows as a matterof course. The case of The Montreal Rolling Mills Co. v. Corcoran ([18]), must be distinguished, for there the cause of the accident was a mystery, whilst in this case it is clearly shown to have been caused by the unguarded shaft. The facts have been found in the respondent's favour in the trial court, and in the Court of Review; these findings should not be disturbed here.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nGirouard J.\u2014Le 8 octobre 1894, quelques minutes\navant six heures, la fille mineure de l'intim\u00e9 depuis pr\u00e8s de trois ans \u00e0 l'emploi de l'appelant, fabriquant de chemises, fut la victime d'un grave et p\u00e9nible accident. Attendant l'heure de la fermeture, 6 heures, p.m., elle se mit en frais de faire la toilette de sa chevelure, \u00e9tant encore \u00e0 son si\u00e8ge, en face de sa machine \u00e0 coudre, mue par Ia vapeur. Malheureusement, le peigne de sa chevelure tomba, et dans la recherche qu'elle fit pour le retrouver, la chevelure, qui \u00e9tait pendante, fut prise par la courroie qui se trouvait au bas, sans garde, ni protection, et la cons\u00e9quence fut Ia perte de la chevelure et d'une oreille. Depuis l'accident, \u00e0 la recommandation de l'inspecteur provincial, une planche fut plac\u00e9e en avant de la machine, croyant par l\u00e0 m\u00eame au moins diminuer le danger.\nIl est en preuve que l'appelant tenait un \u00e9tablisse ment mod\u00e8le sous tous les rapports et qu'avant l'accident, ces machines, partout o\u00f9 elles fonctionnaient, n'avaient pas la planche que l'inspecteur exigea apr\u00e8s.\nEn supposant m\u00eame que l'appelant eut \u00e9t\u00e9 en d\u00e9faut \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, nous sommes d'opinion que ce d\u00e9faut n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause du dommage. La cause principale et imm\u00e9diate de l'accident, a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'imprudence de la jeune fille, qui, contrairement aux r\u00e8glements de l'\u00e9tablisse ment, commen\u00e7a \u00e0 faire sa toilette au si\u00e8ge de son ouvrage et exposa sa chevelure aux \u00e9volutions de Ia courroie. En d\u00e9cidant ainsi, nous ne faisons que suivre la jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, particuli\u00e8re ment dans les causes de Moffette v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co. of Canada ([19]); Sarault v. Viau ([20]); Desroches v. Gauthier ([21]); Compagnie de Navigation du Richelieu et d'Ontario v. St. Jean ([22]); St. Lawrence Sugar Refining Co. v. Campbell ([23]); Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Cadieux ([24]); Allan v. La Compagnie d' Assurance Maritime des Marchands du Canada ([25]).

It was also agreed that payment of the notes was not to be required while the books remained in the possession of the firm. The notes were protested for non-payment and, A. having died, R. as surviving partner of the firm and vested with all rights in the notes, sued the maker and indorser jointly and severally for the full amount. At the time of the action some of the books were still in the possession of R. and it appeared that he had not rendered the indorser any statement of the financial situation between the principal debtor and the firm.\nHeld, that the action was not based upon the real contract between the parties and that the plaintiff was not, under the circumstances, entitled to recover in an action upon the notes.\nHeld further, per Sedgwick J., that neither the payee of a promissory note nor the drawer of a bill of exchange can maintain an action against an indorser, where the action is founded upon the instrument itself.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, which maintained the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe plaintiff by his declaration claimed from one McConniff and the present respondent jointly and severally: 1 The amount of a promissory note dated 7 Nov., 1891, by McConniff to Austin & Robertson, indorsed by the appellant, pour aval, payable in four years $l,75000\n2. Costs of protest thereof 3 59\n3. The amount of a promissory note dated 6 Oct., 1895, from the same party to the same firm, indorsed by the appellant, pour aval, payable thirty days after date (this note having been given in renewal of another of the same amount, dated 6 Oct., 1891, payable in four years) 3,500 00\n4. Costs of protest thereof 3 59\nTotal amount of claim $5,277 18\nHe also alleged that the firm of Austin & Robertson was dissolved by the death of Austin and that he took over the business of the firm and was vested with its rights.\nMcConniff did not contest, but on the contestation by the respondent it appeared that both the notes sued on had written across their faces the words \"not negotiable and given as security\"; that the respondent had agreed in this manner to become security for advances the firm made to McConniff for the publication of several editions of guide-books, the whole of which were to be left in the hands of the firm as further security, the proceeds of sales to be credited to McConniff, in deduction of the amount of the advances. A number of sales were made, the moneys received placed to McConniff's credit and in the meantime further advances made as the editions were published. At the time of the action some of the books were still in the hands of the firm, and it appeared that no statement of the accounts between McConniff and the firm had been furnished to respondent.\nGreenshields Q.C. and Lafleur for the appellant. The notes were accommodation paper, indorsed by respondent without consideration, for the purpose of accommodating, by a loan of his credit, McConniff who was to provide for the notes when they fell due ([1]). Although as between the party accommodated and accommodating party the relations are those of principal and surety, yet the accommodation indorser is not entitled to be credited with the amount of any securities in the hands of the holder taken by the latter from the principal debtor, until the accommodation indorser has himself paid the principal debt ([2]); so we were not obliged to account or to tender the books. The security was continuing and survived the dissolution of the firm by Austin's death.\nThe cases cited and remarks of Sir William Ritchie C.J. in Starrs v. Cosgraee ([3]), show the distinctions between that case and the present one. See also remarks by Fournier J. in the same case, p. 587, and Gwynne J. at p. 593.\nMacmaster Q.C. for the respondent. The conditions of the contract show that there was not to be a continuing security, but one which lasted only until the amount of the notes was reached, and the advances of that amount were fully reimbursed by receipts from sales before action; Gerson v. Hamilton ([4]); subsequent advances were upon McConniffs's own credit; art. 1935 C. C\nThe retention of the books in his possession would bar this action, and plaintiff was also bound to render a full statement of the financial situation of the principal debtor before acting on the security; arts. 1931, 1941 C. C.\nThe essential character of promissory notes was taken away from the instruments sued upon by the indorsement of a condition. Art. 2344 C. C.; 53 Vict. (D.) ch. 33, s. 82. The instruments constituted a contract of suretyship, which terminated either upon the repayment of the first moneys to that amount, or at any rate, upon the death of Austin. Starrs v. Cosgrave ([5]); Haffield v. Meadows ([6]); Leathley et al. v. Spyer ([7]).\nTASCHEREAU J. This appeal must be dismissed.\nI would myself have done so after having heard the appellant, without calling upon the respondent.\nThe appellant cannot get over the objection that his action is not based on the real contract that he has proved between the firm of Austin & Robertson and the respondent. He has alleged a certain cause of action and he has proved another. That is fatal to him. Upon that ground, taken by the Court of Appeal, the appeal is dismissed with costs.\nThough we adopt this reason for disposing of the appeal, the appellant must not be led to understand that he would have succeeded, had he taken the proper action, on the question of the respondent's payment in full of all his liabilities under the agreement in question.\nGWYNNE, KING and GIROUARD J J. concurred.\nSedgewick J.\u2014I agree, but with this further statement. Upon the authority of Steele v. McKinlay ([8]), in the House of Lords, this action is not maintainable. Under no circumstances can the payee of a promissory note or the drawer of a bill of exchange maintain an action against an indorser, where the action is founded upon the instrument itself.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Greenshields, Greenshields, Laflamme & Glass.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Macmaster & Maclennan.\n[1] Randolph Com.

C. P\u2014Nature of possession of unenclosed vacant lands\u2014 Boundary marks\u2014Delivery of possession.\nIn 1890, G. purchased a lot of land 25 feet wide, and the vendor pointed it out to him, on the ground, and showed him the pickets marking its width and depth. The lot remained vacant and unenclosed up to the time of the disturbance, and was assessed as a 25 foot lot to G., who paid all municipal taxes and rates thereon. In 1895 the adjoining lot, which was also vacant and unenclosed, was sold to another person who commenced laving foundations for a building, and, in doing so, encroached by two feet on the width of the lot so purchased by G., who brought a possessory action within a couple of months from the date of the disturbance.\nHeld, that the possession annale, required by article 946 of the Code of Civil Procedure, was sufficiently established to entitle the plaintiff to maintain his action.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench (appeal side), affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, which dismissed the plaintiff's action with costs.\nA Statement of the facts and questions at issue in the case will be found in the judgment reported.\nBelcourt for the appellant.\nMadore and MerriIl for the respondents. The judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGIROUARD J.\u2014Cette cause ne pr\u00e9sente aucune difficult\u00e9. L'appelant a pris une action possessoire, all\u00e9guant la possession annale d'un lot vacant situ\u00e9 en la cite de Montr\u00e9al et connu sous le num\u00e9ro 1189-3 au cadastre du quartier Saint-Jacques. Cet emplacement faisait partie d'un terrain plus \u00e9tendu appartenant \u00e0 feu M. Duhamel, C. R., qui l'avait divis\u00e9. L'appelant acheta son lot de M. Duhamel en 1890 en m\u00eame temps que deux ou trois de ses voisins.\nM Duhamel s'\u00e9tait engag\u00e9 par le contrat \u00e0 donner l'alignement de chaque lot, et en consequence peu de temps apr\u00e8s, en 1890, il en fit tirer les bornes et les indiqua par des piquets ou petits poteaux fich\u00e9s en terre selon l'usage, pour indiquer chaque alignement et la superficie de chaque lot, qui devait avoir vingt-cinq pieds de front sur quatre-vingt-dix pieds de profondeur; puis il informe chaque acqu\u00e9reur, et en particulier l'appelant, que son terrain se trouve entre tel et tel alignement, et de fait le met en possession ouverte et publique. Cette tradition constitue la possession.\nMais une fois la tradition op\u00e9r\u00e9e,\u2014dit Appleton,\u2014([1]) tout change, l'acqu\u00e9reur a la possession, il peut y joindre celle de son vendeur et exercer les actions posessoires tant contre ce dernier que contre les tiers.\nIl est inutile d'observer qu'un terrain vacant est susceptible de la possession comme un terrain b\u00e2ti ou cl\u00f4tur\u00e9; seulement, lorsqu'il est simplement vacant, il est plus difficile de prouver l'\u00e9tendue exacte de cette possession surtout si le lot voisin est aussi vacant. Bans l'esp\u00e8ce cette difficult\u00e9 ne se pr\u00e9sente pas, puisqu'il y avait des bornes bien visibles, qui ont exist\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 l'ann\u00e9e 1895, \u00e9poque o\u00f9 Gratton acheta de la succession Duhamel le lot voisin le num\u00e9ro 1189-2, et commen\u00e7a \u00e0 b\u00e2tir, en enlevant les bornes du lot de l'appelant, et empi\u00e9tant de deux pieds sui ce dernier lot, ne lui laissant par cons\u00e9quent que vingt-trois pieds de front.\nCes bornes bien constat\u00e9es suffisent pour prouver la possession du terrain entre les dites bornes, que le terrain soit vacant on non. Dans la cause de Laprade v. Gauthier ([2]), la cour d'Appel jugea que l'action possessoire compl\u00e8te au possesseur d'un h\u00e9ritage non enclos et non d\u00e9limit\u00e9 par des bornes l\u00e9gales ou naturelles bien visibles, lorsque son \u00e9tendue est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par des marques quelconques capables de faire reconna\u00eetre l'endroit jusqu'o\u00f9 la possession s'est exerc\u00e9e, et le possesseur troubl\u00e9, sans recourir \u00e0 l'action en bornage, pent tout de suite intenter l'action possessoire. Et dans une autre cause, la m\u00eame cour d\u00e9clarait que le simple proc\u00e8s-verbal de bornage, fait par un arpenteur avec le consentement des parties, suffisait pour \u00e9tablir la possession annale jusqu'\u00e0 ces bornes. Laviolette v. Le-clerc ([3]). La cour de Revision, \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, a m\u00eame d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le placement des bornes pour en d\u00e9terminer le cours ou l'alignement indique, d'une mani\u00e8re permanente, la ligne qui doit diviser les terrains et l'\u00e9tendue de la possession non seulement \u00e0 l'endroit ou se trouvent bes dites bornes, mais sur toute la profondeur des h\u00e9ritages o\u00f9 il n'y avait pas de bornes, et ce jugement fut confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9 par la cour d'Appel Cormier v Leblanc ([4]). Il est vrai que dans cette derni\u00e8re cause les bornes avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9es par un arpenteur, qui avait dress\u00e9 un proc\u00e8s-verbal de son arpentage, mais ce placement ne pouvait avoir plus d'autorit\u00e9 que celui qui estfait parles parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es par exemple par le vendeur lui-m\u00eame comme cela cut lieu dans l'esp\u00e8ce actuelle. Ici les bornes out \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9es non seulement \u00e0 la devanture, mais aussi \u00e0 la profondeur des lots vendus. La d\u00e9cision du Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans de Gasp\u00e9 v. Bessner ([5]), est aussi en faveur de l'appelant. Il y fut jug\u00e9 que, pour maintenir l'action possessoire, il faut des bornes connues, si non visibles. Les bornes du terrain de l'appelant \u00e9taient et connues et visibles.\nPendant tout cet espace de temps qui s'est \u00e9coul\u00e9 depuis le placement des bornes, qui doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 en possession du terrain tel qu'align\u00e9, \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire? Ce n'est certainement pas M. Duhamel, ou ses h\u00e9ritiers, les intim\u00e9s. Ce n'est pas non plus Gratton qui n'a acquis d'euxle lot voisin qu'en 1895, quelques mois avant l'institution de l'action. Le possesseur ne peut \u00eatre que l'appelant qui, peu de temps apr\u00e9s son achat et lors de l'alignement fait par son vendeur en ex\u00e9cution du contrat de vente, a de fait pris possession de son lot, publiquemett \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire, possession qu'il a continu\u00e9 d'exercer paisiblement et sans interruption jusqu'\u00e0 la date du trouble caus\u00e9 par Gratton. C'est lui qui en a pav\u00e9 les taxes et redevances municipales, les comptes de la corporation et les r\u00f4les d'\u00e9valuation municipales comme le cadastre et le plan officiel faisant mention d'un lot de vingt-cinq pieds de front sur quatre-vingt-dix pieds de profondeur. L'appelant se trouve donc avoir acquis la possession requise par les articles 946 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure et 2193 du Code Civil, c'est-\u00e0-dire, la possession annale, continue et non interrompue, paisible, publique, non-\u00e9quivoque et \u00e0 titre de propri\u00e9taire, ayant de justes motifs pour se croire propri\u00e9taire de tout le terrain compris entre les lignes piqu\u00e9es. Ii a donc l'action possessoire. Voil\u00e0 la seule question devant nous, et que nous avons \u00e0 d\u00e9cider. Nous sommes d'avis que dans les circonstances, la possession de tout le terrain, compris entre les dites bornes, \u00e9tait compl\u00e9te et que s'il y a erreur dans la d\u00e9limitation, elle doit faire l'objet d'une action p\u00e9titoire, ou en bornage, et qu'enfin l'action possessoire de l'appelant a \u00e9t\u00e9 bien intent\u00e9e. Appleton, n. 303; Laviolette v. Leclerc (1) D\u00e9cider autrement serait permettre le cumul du possessoire et du p\u00e9titoire, contrairement \u00e0 l'article 948 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure. Nous accordons l'appel et maintenons l'action de l'appelant, avec d\u00e9pens devant toutes les cours contre les intim\u00e9s.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Lamothe, Trudel & Trudel.\nSolicitor for the respondents : Alfred E.

C. c. 135, s. 29 (b)\u201454 & 55 V. c, 25, s. 3\u201456 V. c. 29, s. 1.\nIn an action to quash a by-law passed for the expropriation of land the controversy relates to a title to lands and an appeal lies to the Supreme Court of Canada, althuugh the amount in controversy is less than $2,000.\nThe judgment on the merits dismissed the appeal for the reasons stated in the judgment of the court below. Appeal from the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal ([1]) which dismissed the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe respondents adopted a by-law for the widening of a street, by adding a strip of five feet on one side, and of ten feet on the other, and authorizing the council to acquire the necessary lands by expropriation proceedings, the cost, indemnity and damages to be paid by means of a special tax levied, in part, upon the properties fronting on the street to be widened and for the balance upon such properties as the commissioners might declare benefited by such widening.\nThe appellant, whose property abuts upon the section to be so widened, brought an action to quash the by-law and the proceedings by which part of his lot was expropriated, as illegal, null and void, and as being ultra vires of the corporation. His action was dismissed by the Superior Court, and this judgment was unanimously affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench on appeal.\nOn the inscription for hearing on the present appeal in the Supreme Court of Canada the respondents moved to quash on the ground that no appeal lay under the provisions of \" The Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act,\" as the mateers in contooversy did not amount to the sum or value of $2000 nor involve or relate to any question or matter included amongst the provisions of section 29 of the said Act.\nGeoffrion Q.C. and Dunlop Q.C. for the motion cited as to jurisdiction The City of Sherbrooke v. McManamy\n([2]); The County of Verch\u00e8res v. The Village of Varennss\n([3]); Quebec, Montmorency and Charlevoxx Railway Co. v Mathieu ([4]); Bell Telephone Co. v.

The by-law involves the expropriation of lands, and either deprives appellant of his title to the strip of land sought to be expropriated, or, if declared null, confirms him in his title. All the cases cited by respondent can he distinguished from such a case as the present; but such cases as Les Eccl\u00e9siastiques de St. Sulpice v. City of Montreal ([13]); Blatchford v. McBain ([14]); and Lefeuntun v. V\u00e9ronneau ([15]), are in point.\nTheir Lordships after hearing counsel decided to reserve judgment upon the motion to quash and directed that the appeal should in the meantime be heard upon the merits.\nUpon the hearing on the merits,\nFalconer and Gibb appeared as counsel for the appellant and Geoffrion Q.C. and Dunlop Q.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by :\nTaschereau J.\u2014The motion to quash made by the respondent must be dismissed with costs. The controversy relates to a title to land, and the case is therefore appealable. Upon the merits, the appeal must be dismissed. There is nothing in the appellant's contentions but an attempt to override the clear intentions of the legislature by refined technicalities. He should have been convinced of the unsoundness of his contentions by the reasoning of the learned judge who gave the judgment of the court below and he cannot expect more from us here in rejecting his appeal, than a reference to that judgment, and the reasons given in support of it.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nMotion to quash and appeal both dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Robertson, Fleet and Falconer.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Dunlop, Lyman & Macpherson.\n[1] Q.

G. P.\u2014False return of service.\nNo entry of default for non-appearance can be made, nor ex parte judgment rendered, against a defendant who has not been duly served with the writ of summons, althouhh the papers in the action may have actuall reached him throuhh a person with whom they were left by the bailiff.\nThe provisions of articles 483 and following of the Code of Civil Procedure of Lower Canada relate only to cases where a defendant is legally in default to appear or to plead and have no application to an ex parte judgment rendered, for default of appearance, in an action which has not been duly served upon the defendant, and the defendant may at any time seek relief against any such judgment, and have it set aside notwithstanding that more than a year and a day may have elapsed from the rendering of the same, and without alleging or establishing that he has a good defence to the action on the merits.\nAn opposition asking to have a judgment set aside, on the ground that the defendant has not been duly served with the action, which also alleges the defendant's grounds of defence upon the merits, should not be dismissed merely for the reason that the rescissoire has thus been improperly joined with the rescindant.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), which affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Three Rivers dismissing the appellant's opposition with costs. The action is based upon promissory notes. The writ of summons and declaration were handed by the bailiff charged with the service to a person whom he met on the street outside of the defendant's residence. It appeared that the papers were mailed to the defendant and received by him at the city of Quebec, but he paid no attention to the action. Upon the bailiff's return that the service had been made by leaving the papers with a reasonable person of the defendant's family at his domicile in the city of Three Rivers, default was entered for non-appearance, and about a year later, (in 1889,) upon the application of the plaintiff, the prothonotary rendered judgment ex parte against the defendant under the provisions of articles 89 and following of the Code of Civil Procedure. In 1892 the defendant sought relief against this judgment by opposition on the ground that he had not been duly served with the action and setting forth also grounds of a defenee to the merits. The plaintiff contested and the opposition was dismissed by the Superior Court, (Bourgeois J.) for reasons stated as follows :\u2014 ''Consid\u00e9rant que le dit d\u00e9fendeur et opposant ne s'est pas pourvu dans le d\u00e9lai de l'an et jour fix\u00e9 par l'article 483 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile pour faire reviser le jugement qui \u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu contre lui en cette cause ''consid\u00e9rant que le d\u00e9fendeur et opposant a cumul\u00e9 dans sa dite opposition des moyens d'exception \u00e0 la forme \u00e0 l'encontre de l'assignation en cette cause et des moyens de defense au m\u00e9rite \u00e0 la demande de Ia demanderesse.\n\" Consid\u00e9rant que les informalit\u00e9s dans l'assignation dont se plaint le dit d\u00e9fendeur et opposant pouvaient tout au plus faire pr\u00e9sumer la fraude, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 permettre au dit d\u00e9fendeur et opposant de fair valoir, par opposition \u00e0 jugement, en vertu de l'article 484 du Code do Proc\u00e9dure Civile, les moyens qu'il pouvait avoir \u00e0 opposer au m\u00e9rite de la demande de la dite demanderesse, mais n'auraient Pu \u00e0 elles seules donner ouverture \u00e0 une opposition \u00e0 jugement.\"\nThis judgment was affirmed by the Court of Queen's Bench by the judgment now appealed against.\nLanguedoc Q.C. for the appellant. Oppositions like the present may be founded on grounds of exception to the form or resulting from irregularities and on grounds of defence to the merits, or both ([1]); without modifying the law then existing of which it was merely an extension. In respect to oppositions the rule laid down by Loysel has always prevailed: \" le rescindant et le rescissoive sont accumulables.\" Article 492 C. C. P. puts this beyond matter of doubt. The irregularity in this case is so fundamental that the appellant was never before the court, and can never be said to have been in default at any time. The rule as to filing oppositions within the year and a day (1) only applies where a defendant is lawfully placed in default. We refer to Hall v. Harrison ([2]) Jubinville v The Bank of British North America ([3]); Brunet v. Colfer ([4]); Eastern Townships Bank v. Wright ([5]), See also 2 Carr\u00e8 & Ohauveau, pp. 3 and 177.\nLajoie for the respondent. The defendant has no substantial grievance and has waived the irregularity of the service by his failure to oppose within the year and a day ([6]), and allowing four years to elapse without taking proceedings, although he was aware that he had been sued and had the suit papers in his possession; Ross v. Leprohon ([7]); Goulet v. McCraw ([8]); Any such irregularity must be set up by exception to the form ([9]); and cannot be entertained when set up in a plea to the. merits as has been practically done in this case. Jubinville V. The Bank of British North America ([10]). This appeal rases merely a question of practice and the decision of the court below should not be interfered with; The Mayor of Monrreal v. Brown & Springle ([11]); Arpin v. The Merchants Bank of Canada ([12]); Dawson v. The Union Bank of Canada ([13]); Kellond v. Reed ([14]).\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by;.\nTASCHEREA U J. The appellant was the defendant\nin the Superior Court at Three Rivers in an action by the respondent on two promissory notes instituted on September 26th 1888 The service of this action on the appellant it is conceded was absolutely illegal. It was served upon a third party, nt at the appellant's domicile, and though the documents eventually reached the appellant, (when and whether before or after the return of the writ does not appear) yet he had the right to disregard it and treat it as a nullity.\nOver a year afterwards, on 19th October, 1889, the iespondent had a judgment entered ex parte against the appellant. The respondent never attempted to execute her judgment, and on the 25th April 1892, the appellant filed an opposition to the judgment, asking, inter alia that the said judgment be set aside, on the grounds that he, the appellant, had never been duly served with the action; art. 16 C. C. P. He, however, went further in the opposition and alleged his grounds of defene to the merits on the action; and it is on this ground because he had joined the rescissoire to the rescindant, that the court below has dismissed the opposition.\nThe other ground relied upon by the Superior Court that the opposition had not been filed within a year and a day after the judgment as required by article 483 of the Code of Procedure, is clearly untenable. The law cannot be so unjust as to peremptorily bind any one to exercise a right before he is in a position to be possibly aware of that right. 1 Pigeau, (ed. 1787) p. 490; 1 Poncet, \" Des Jugements,\" nos. 152, et seq.\nNow as to the ground on which the respondent mainly relied to support the judgment of the court below, the joining of the rescissoire with the rescindant, to which I have already referred, I am of opinion that the appellant must succeed, and that the judgment must be reversed. I fail to see any reason whatever for the rule which must have been the one followed by the court below, that if an opposant to judgment wrongfully mixes up the rescissoire with the rescindant, his opposition must, on that ground alone, be dismissed. The insufficiency of a litigant's allegations may be fatal to his claim, but if he alleges more than is necessary, or adds to a legitimate demand conclusions which he is not entitled to, that is no reason to reject the whole of his demand. It is a contradiction in any one to ask that a judgment be set aside because he has not been served with the action, and at the same time, to conclude by a plea to the merits of the action. He is not bound to plead at all to an action which has not been served upon him. He may certainly waive the want of service but the appellant here has not done so.\nThe articles 483 and following of the Code of Procedure have no application. They are enactments on cases where judgment has been rendered by default, where the defendant was in default to appear or to plead. But how can a party who has not been summoned be said to be in default for non-appearance? Merlin, Rep. vo. \"Opposition,\" \u00a7I, par. 1. The judgment here was rendered against the respondent, only because he appeared by the return of the bailiff to have been summoned but now that as it is conceded, this was a false return, a return souffl\u00e9 ([15]), the judgment falls to the ground as an inevitable consequence, the moment at any time, were it ten years or twenty years afterwards, that the defendant invokes that nullity, not having waived it in any way. The respondent obtained a judgment against the appellant upon false representations upon her bailiff's return which now turns out to have been untrue. Can such a judgment be supported? She would vainly rely on the merits of her claim. That is not in question here. It is not on her claim, or on the appellant's liabilities, that we have to adjudicate here, but exclusively on the judgment she has obtained against the appellant. And that judgment cannot stand. This appellant's opposition should not be defeated on technicalities and it is on technicalities exclusively that the courts below have found reasons to dismiss it.\nNo judgment can be legally entered on promissory notes under articles 89 and following of the Code of Procedure as this one assumes to have been, if the defendant is not in default to appear or to plead, and he cannot be in default if he has not been summoned. The plaintiff, respondent, has obtained this judgment against the appellant upon a false bailiff's return; that falsity now being established that judgment must be set aside. And the appellant has the right to have it set aside, without alleging or establishing that he has a good defence to the action; the respondent is not entitled to ask that from him not having served the (1) 1 Poncet, \" Des Jugements,\" no. 190. action upon him. His having alleged a defense does not disentitle the appellant from invoking the nullity of the judgment, as he does in his opposition. I repeat it the appellant is not, and never has been in default. The judgment against him is not only voidable, but it is void as an absolute nullity.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for appellant: W. C.

Cummings and People's Bank of Halifax (Defendants)\nRespondents\n1897: May 4; 1897: June 7.\nPresent:\u2014Taschereau, Gwynne, Sedgewick, King and Girouard JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nAssignment for the benefit of creditors\u2014Preferred creditors\u2014Moneys paid under voidable assignment\u2014Liability of assignee\u2014Statute of Elizabeth\u2014Hindering and delaying creditors.\nIn an action to have a deed of assignment for the benefit of creditors set aside by creditors of the assignor on the ground that it is void under the statute of Elizabeth neither moneys paid to preferred creditors nor trust property disposed of in good faith by the assignor or persons claiming under him can be recovered, nor can persons holding under the deed be held personally liable for moneys or property so received by them. Cox v. Worrall (26 N.S. Rep. 366) questioned.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, in banc, affirming the judgments in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia (Townshend J.) in favour of the defendants, the People's Bank of Halifax and Selden W. Cummings, respectively, and dismissing plaintiffs' appeals therefrom with costs.\nThe suit is in connection with an assignment for the benefit of his creditors by one Neil McKinnon to the respondent Selden W. Cummings wherein the other respondent, the People's Bank of Halifax, was preferred for $200, which amount was subsequently paid in full to the bank, as a preferred creditor, by the assignee. The firm of \"Wm. Cummings & Sons,\" another creditor, was likewise preferred therein to the amount of $1,201.\nThe clauses of the assignment in reference to these preferred claims are as follows:\u2014\"In the second place, to pay the People's Bank of Halifax the sum of two hundred dollars due the said the Peoples' Bank of Halifax by the said assignor. And, in the third place, after payment in full of the said claim of the People's Bank of Halifax, to pay to the firm of Wm. Cummings & Sons, of Truro, merchants, the sum of twelve hundred and one dollars, due by the said assignor to the said firm of Wm. Cummings & Sons. And in the fourth place, after payment in full of the said claims of the People's Bank of Halifax and Wm. Cummings & Sons, to pay and discharge out of the residue then remaining, if any, all debts due by the said assignor to the following persons pro rata according to the amount of their several claims against the assignor and in satisfaction so far as such money will extend of the debts, viz.: (here follows a list of creditors.)\"\nThe plaintiffs sued on behalf of themselves and all other creditors and claimed; a declaration that the assignment was fraudulent and void as against the plaintiffs and other creditors; an account from the defendants Selden W. Cummings, Wm. Cummings & Sons and the People's Bank of Halifax, of all property, moneys and assets received or paid by them or any or either of them under the provisions of the assignment; payment of the plaintiffs' claims, respectively, by the said Selden W. Cummings, Wm. Cummings & Sons and the People's Bank of Halifax out of any property and moneys received by them or any of them under said deed; the appointment of a receiver; an injunction, and other relief.\nThe statement of plaintiffs' claims alleged, as reasons against the assignment, that the Peoples' Bank of Halifax was preferred for $200, which was paid to them by Selden W. Cummings, as assignee and trustee, and accepted and received by them pursuant to the terms of said assignment; that there was a secret agreement between McKinnon, Selden W. Cummings and Wm. Cummings & Sons, whereby the said Wm. Cummings & Sons were preferred therein for a large sum in excess of their claim, which agreement was not set forth in the deed nor communicated to the other creditors and therefore hindered, delayed and defeated such creditors, retained a benefit for McKinnon by enabling him to retain a portion of such preference for himself, and was part of a fraudulent scheme by which he attempted to retain a portion of his estate.\nOther facts affecting the issues in this case are stated in the report of McDonald v. Cummings[1], in which the deed in question was set aside. Before the present action was taken, however, the assignee had disposed of the assets and, acting in good faith, had made the payments to the preferred creditors as provided in the deed of assignment, without notice of its fraudulent character,\nMcNeil for the appellants. We rely on Cox v. Worrall[2] as establishing the right of creditors to take such proceedings as these. Borden Q.C. and Lovett for the respondents, cited Collumb v. Read[3], Davis v. Wickson[4].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014We are of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed, not only for the reasons stated by the learned judges below, but because in our view the action itself was baseless except in so far as it sought to set aside the deed in question and thereby render the property covered by it available for execution or garnishment at the instance of judgment creditors.\nThe claim of the plaintiff for an account against William Cummings & Son and the People's Bank, with a view of making them pay over to the creditors the moneys received by them under the deed on account of the assignor's indebtedness to them, is absolutely untenable under English law, in an action to declare a deed void under the statute of Elizabeth. No decree has ever yet been made ordering restitution of property parted with by the assignor of the deed or persons claiming under him. That statute avoids the deed, nothing more\u2014it leaves the creditor defeated or delayed to his ordinary remedies, execution, garnishment. No English case has been shown where, in a suit of this kind, a personal liability for property disposed of has been cast upon persons taking under the deed, and the reason is obvious. A creditor, as such, has no claim either at law or in equity to his debtor's property. He must first obtain his judgment and charge it by way of execution.\nIn this view we must express our dissent from the decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in Cox v. Worrall[5], it being understood, however, that we are not dealing with a case where persons deliberately combine and conspire to dispose of property in fraud of creditors, but only with a case where a deed is sought to be set aside and the assignee and creditors have, in the meantime, in good faith, acted under it. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Alexander McNeil\nSolicitor for the respondent Cummings: H.

S. N. S. (2 ser.) c. 114, ss. 23 & 24\u2014Title by will\u2014Conveyance by tenant in tail.\nThe Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 1851 (1 ser.) chap. 112, provided as follows: \"All estates tail are abolished, and every estate which would hitherto have been adjudged a fee tail shall hereafter be adjudged a fee simple; and, if no valid remainder be limited thereon, shall be a fee simple absolute, and may be conveyed or devised by the tenant in tail, or otherwise shall descend to his heirs as a fee simple.\" In the revision of 1858 (R. S. N. S. 2 ser. c. 112) the terms are identical. In 1864 (R. S. N. S. 3 ser. c. 111) the provision was changed to the following: \"All estates tail on which no valid remainder is limited are abolished, and every such estate shall hereafter be adjudged to be a fee simple absolute, and may be conveyed or devised by the tenant in tail, or otherwise shall descend to his heirs as a fee simple.\" This latter statute was repealed in 1865 (28 Vict. c. 2) when it was provided as follows: \"All estates tail are abolished and every estate which hitherto would have been adjudged a fee tail shall hereafter be adjudged a fee simple and may be conveyed or devised or descend as such.\"\nZ., who died in 1859, by his will, made in 1857, devised lands in Nova Scotia to his son, and in default of lawful heirs, with a devise over to other relatives, in the course of descent from the first donee. On the death of Z., the son took possession of the property as devisee under the will, and held it until 1891, when he sold the lands in question in this suit to the appellant. Held, per Taschereau, Sedgewick and King JJ., that notwithstanding the reference to \"valid remainder\" in the statute of 1851 all estates tail were thereby abolished, and further, that subsequent to that statute there could be no valid remainder expectant on an estate tail, as there could not be a valid estate tail to support such remainder.\nHeld further, per Taschereau, Sedgewick and King JJ., that in the devise over to persons in the course of descent from the first devisee, in default of lawful issue, the words \"lawful heirs,\" in the limitation over, are to be read as if they were \"heirs of his body and that the estate of the first devisee was thus restricted to an estate tail and was consequently, by the operation of the statute of 1851, converted into an estate in fee simple and could lawfully be conveyed by the first devisee.\nHeld, per Gwynne and Girouard JJ., that estates tail having a remainder limited thereon were not abolished by the statutes of 1851 or 1864, but continued to exist until all estates tail were abolished by the statute of 1865; that the first devisee, in the case in question, took an estate tail in the lands devised and having held them as devisee in tail up to the time of the passing of the Act of 1865, the estate in his possession was then, by the operation of that statute, converted into an estate in fee simple which could be lawfully conveyed by him.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, in banc, affirming the decision of the trial court in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe facts of the case and questions at issue are stated in the judgment reported.\nC. H. Tapper Q.C. and Borden Q.C. for the appellant. If the devise did not, by virtue of the Wills Act independently of the statute abolishing estates tail, amount to a devise in fee simple, it became a devise in fee simple by virtue of that statute. The real estate is devised over, in default of heirs of the first devisee, to ulterior devisees related to the prior devisee so as to be in the course of descent from him. The prior devisee in that case could not die without heirs while the devisee over existed, so the word \"heirs\" means\" heirs of the body,\" and the estate of the first devisee, by the effect of the devise over, is restricted to an estate tail, and the estate of the devisee over, becomes a remainder expectant on that estate. 2 Jarman (5 ed.) 1170, 1175. Simson v. Ashworth[1]. Then by virtue of the statute abolishing estates tail, the estate so acquired became an absolute estate in fee simple; but that statute does not convert a remainder expectant upon an estate tail into an executory devise. The remainder ceased to exist when the estate in fee tail was converted by the statute into an estate in fee simple, as it had no estate tail to support it. Nottingham v. Jennings[2]; Tyte v. Willis[3]; Morgan v. Griffiths[4]; Harris v. Davis[5]; Doe d. Hatch v. Bluck[6]; Tyrwhitt v. Dewson[7].\nThe words \"lawful heirs\" used in the context are sufficient to create an estate tail. Good v. Good[8]. The words \"die without having any lawful heirs\" import indefinite failure of issue and therefore create an estate tail. A devise for life and \"if my son Richard (the eldest) do happen to die without heirs, then my son John shall enjoy my lands,\" gave an estate tail to Richard. 2 Jarman, \"Wills,\" (5 ed.) 1320 to 1324, and cases cited. Harris v. Davis[9]. Theobald, \"Wills,\" (4 ed.) 576, 582. Goodright v. Godridge[10]; Forsyth v. Gault[11]; Doe d. Forsyth v. Quackenbush[12]; Dawson v. Small[13]; In re Sallery[14]. The word \"heirs\" in the present case has its usual technical meaning. Leach v. Jay[15]; Morrall v. Sutton[16]; Lloyd v. Jackson[17]. 2 Jarman, \"Wills,\" (5 ed.) 1205 to 1217 and 930. 2 Williams, \"Executors,\" (9 Eng. ed.) 929 and 930. Smith v. Butcher[18]; Doe d. Comberbach v. Perryn[19]; Hall v. Priest[20].\nWade Q. C. for the respondent. All the contingencies upon which the devise to plaintiff depended having occurred, the plaintiff is entitled to the property unless the devise to him cannot have effect. The executory limitation is in defeasance of the prior estate in fee. Armstrong v. Nason[21]; Gray v. Richford[22]; Bowey v. Ardill[23]; Parkes v. Trusts Corporation of Ontario[24]; Muskett v. Eaton[25]; Dean v. Dean[26].\nThe words in the will, \"but should my son Jonas die without leaving any lawful heirs\" cannot be construed to mean an indefinite failure of issue but must be construed as a failure at the time of Jonas' death. R. S. N. S. (2 ser.) ch. 114, sec. 24. (Same as ch. 89, sec. 26, Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 5th series.) Jarman, p. 1320. The devise to plaintiff is therefore not affected by the rule against perpetuities, which allows a devise to a life or any number of lives in being and twenty-one years thereafter. Jarman, pp. 214-215. Whitter v. Bremridge[27]; Right v. Creber[28]; Haliburton v, Halliburton[29].\nThe word \"heirs\" in the sentence, \"but should my son Jonas die without leaving any lawful heirs\" should be construed as meaning \"children\" or \"issue,\" or \"heirs of the body.\" This construction is obvious from the evident absurdity of supposing the testator to mean that his devise over should depend on an event which cannot happen without involving the extinction of its immediate object. Since the plaintiff being a second cousin of Jonas is one of his heirs, he, the plaintiff, would have to die in order to get the property. By giving \"heirs\" the meaning of \"children\" or \"heirs of the body\" the devise is freed from this absurdity. North v. Martin[30]; Gummoe v. Howes[31]; Milroy v. Milroy[32]; Doe d. Comberbach v. Sir R. Perryn[33]. Jarman, 930, 1229, 1278-9. If the word \"heirs\" is ambiguous it must be construed so as not to be repugnant to the definite devise to plaintiff. Jarman, 436, 439, 440. The paramount intention of the testator should govern the construction of the will. Jenkins v. Hughes[34]; Jeffray v. Tredwell[35]. That plaintiff was intended to take on death of Jonas without children is indicated by the testator's wish expressed immediately after the devise to plaintiff, that his estates should for a time at least be retained and held by parties bearing his name.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014I agree that this appeal should be allowed for the reasons stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice King.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The question involved in this appeal arises upon the will of George Peter Zwicker, who departed this life in 1859, in the county of Lunenburg, in the province of Nova Scotia, having first made his will bearing date the 4th day of April, 1857, whereby among other things he devised as follows:\u2014\nI give and bequeath to my grandson, Emanuel Zwicker, who is now absent at sea, a certain piece of land lying in the north-west range, bought from Frederick Nick Lowe, being part of lot number forty-six, letter B, containing twenty-one acres more or less, as will more fully appear by two deeds from said F. Lowe, but should my grandson Emanuel Zwicker not return home, this last mentioned lot to revert and go to my son Jonas, together with all the remainder of my real estate as well as personal property, cattle, household furniture, &c., which I give and bequeath all to my son Jonas, viz.: my homestead, a lot of land lying in the rear of lot number nine and ten, being part of mill grant; also part of 300 acre lot number four, letter C, in first division, containing forty-two six-sevenths acres; also a lot at northwest, letter A, number 42, being that part which joins No. 41 containing 15 acres, but should my son Jonas die without leaving any lawful heirs, then I order that all my real estate now made over to my son Jonas revert and fall back to my great-grandson Elias Peter, and should my great-grandson Elias Peter die before my son Jonas, or before he comes of age, or should he die without any heirs, then I order, give or bequeath all my real estate to Samuel B. A. Zwicker and his heirs, youngest son of Benjamin Zwicker, Esquire. It being my sincere wish that my real estate should remain in my name, reserving the dower to my daughter-in-law as long as she remains a widow, should she survive my son Jonas.\nHaving sold in his lifetime the piece of land above devised to Emanuel, the testator by a codicil gave to Emanuel in lieu thereof the money he had received on the sale of such piece of land, so that we have to deal only with the residue of the real property devised to Jonas.\nNow Jonas having died without issue, and Elias Peter having also died in the lifetime of Jonas, and under age, and without issue, Samuel B. A. Zwicker has brought the present action in which he has recovered judgment in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia against the appellant Ernst, who is in possession of the lands so as above devised to Jonas under deeds of bargain and sale executed by Jonas in his lifetime conveying the lands to Ernst in fee simple.\nThe contention of the appellant in support of this title is that the estates devised by the will of Jonas and Elias Peter respectively, were estates to them and the heirs of their respective bodies successively in fee tail with remainder in fee simple to the respondent, and that the estate tail in the first tenant in tail Jonas has been by the statute law of the province of Nova Scotia converted into a fee simple whereby he had right to convey and by the deeds executed by him has conveyed a good title in fee simple to the appellant, whereas the contention on behalf of the respondent is that the estate devised to the respondent Samuel B. A. Zwicker was a fee simple estate by way of executory devise, and that in the events which have happened he is now entitled to recover possession of the lands so devised.\nThe Nova Scotia statutes upon which the appellant relies are as follows:\u2014\nIn 1851 it was enacted by a statute inserted as ch. 112 of the consolidated statutes of Nova Scotia (first series) that\nAll estates tail are abolished, and every estate which would hitherto have been adjudged a fee tail, shall hereafter be adjudged a fee simple, and if no valid remainder be limited thereon shall be a fee simple absolute, and may be conveyed or devised by tenant in tail, or otherwise shall descend to his heirs as a fee simple.\nIn 1858 this chapter was inserted in the consolidated statutes of that year, the second series, still as ch. 112 and in the identical terms of ch. 112 of the first series.\nThis statute was in 1864 inserted in the consolidated statutes of that year as ch. 111 (third series) in the terms following:\u2014\nAll estates tail on which no valid remainder is limited are abolished, and every such estate shall hereafter be adjudged a fee simple absolute, and may be conveyed or devised by the tenant in tail, or otherwise shall descend to his heirs as a fee simple.\nIn 1865 an alteration was made by a statute of the legislature, 28 Vic., ch. 2, which is in the terms following:\u2014\nAll estates tail are abolished, and every estate which hitherto would have been adjudged a fee tail, shall hereafter be adjudged a fee simple, and may be conveyed and devised or descend as such. In the consolidation of the statutes in 1873 (fourth series), ch. 78, and in the consolidation of the statutes in 1884 (fifth series), ch. 88, this chapter 2 of 28 Vict., is inserted verbatim.\nThe question to be determined is, what estate did Jonas the testator's son, Elias Peter his great-grandson and Samuel B. A. Zwicker, a person who was capable of inheriting as an heir of Elias Peter upon failure of his issue, take respectively upon the decease of the testator in 1859 in the lands devised to Jonas?\nThe will appears to have been drawn by a person having a slight but by no means an accurate knowledge of the technical language of wills or of the proper use of such language or of the construction put thereon by the courts. In construing wills this is a matter to be taken into consideration by courts when endeavouring to construe an ambiguously expressed will so as best to promote what can be gathered from the will to have been the intention of the testator. Thelluson v. Rendlesham[36]; Richards v. Davies[37].\nThe testator's intention in the present case I gather from his will to have been that the lands devised should remain in his name and in the direct line of descent as long as possible; and that Samuel B. A. Zwicker should not take anything until the issue of Jonas and of Elias Peter respectively should be exhausted. He says that he has devised the lands in the manner stated in his will\u2014it being his sincere wish that his real estate should remain in his name\u2014by which I understand him to have meant as long as possible, first in the direct line of Jonas so long as it should last, then in the direct line of Elias Peter, and afterwards to Samuel B. A. Zwicker in fee simple. Now if the testator had consulted a person competent to advise him and had employed him to draw his will, such person would have advised that treating Jonas, his son, and Elias Peter, his great-grandson, as the persons in the direct line whom he desired to benefit before his collateral relative, the respondent, should get anything, the ordinary mode in use for attaining his wish would be to limit an estate tail to Jonas and the heirs of his body with remainder to Elias Peter and the heirs of his body in like manner with remainder over to the respondent and his heirs in fee simple, and he would no doubt have so drawn the will with such limitations plainly expressed. What the testator did, however, was to devise the lands of which he was seized in fee simple to Jonas in language which was sufficient by force of ch. 114 of the first series of the Consolidated Statutes of Nova Scotia if it stood alone, to give to Jonas a fee simple estate but which was qualified by the words\nbut should my son Jonas die without leaving any lawful heirs, then I order that all my real estate now made over to my son Jonas revert and fall back to my great-grandson Elias Peter, &c., &c.\nIt may be admitted that the testator in using this language was ignorant of its effect, but the courts in order that the testator's manifest intention to benefit his great-grandson, Elias Peter, should not be defeated by the testator's ignorant use of legal terms construe the words \"without leaving any lawful heirs\" so used as meaning \"heirs of the body of Jonas,\" and give effect to them as if the limitation had been expressed to be to Jonas and the heirs of his body, and then, that is on the termination of that estate, to Elias Peter. The word \"then\" in the sentence \"then I order,\" &c., must be construed as relating to the determination of the first limitation of the estate to Jonas and the heirs of his body. Beavclerk v. Dormer[38]. The rule that a devise to A. in language sufficient to convey the fee simple followed in a subsequent part of the will or in a codicil by a limitation over if A. should die \"without leaving lawful heirs,\" here meaning heirs of the body of the donee, must be construed as a fee tail, is so imperative that it cannot be departed from unless there be language in the will itself which unmistakably shows the testator's intention to be that the limitation over should take effect upon the death of the first taker without leaving issue him surviving. The authorities upon this point are numerous and unequivocal. Nottingham v. Jennings[39]; Nanfan v. Legh[40]; Tenny v. Agar[41]; Jones v. Legg[42]; Coltsmann v. Coltsmann[43]; Ex parte Davies[44]; Doe d. Comberbach v. Perryn[45]. That the words \"without leaving,\" &c., &c., in a devise of realty will not have that effect is now well established upon the authority of Forth v. Chapman[46], notwithstanding the contrary opinion expressed by Lord Kenyon in Porter v. Bradley[47]; but in the case of a devise of personalty these words will be construed as relating to the death of the preceding donee, Crooke v. DeVandes[48]; Doe d. Comberbach v. Perryn (7); Fornereau v. Fornereau[49]; Dansey v. Griffiths[50]; Daintry v. Daintry[51]; Simpson v. Ashworth[52]; Morgan v. Morgan[53]: Slattery v. Ball[54].\nIn Porter v. Bradley (9), the devise over was if the first taker should die \"leaving no issue behind him.\" These last words were considered sufficient to make the limitation over an executory devise instead of a remainder on an estate tail. In Mortimer v. Hartley[55], a testator who died in April, 1826, devised certain of his real estate to his son John with a declaration that neither he nor his heirs to the third generation should have power to sell or mortgage any part of the devised property, but that if it should happen that his son John die without leaving lawful issue, the testator's daughter Ann should have his share subject to the same restrictions, limitations and exceptions under which John had it, and if it should please God to take away both Ann and John under age or without leaving lawful issue, then he gave and bequeathed the same lands to his, the testator's, brother Joseph, his heirs and assigns forever. The question was what estate Joseph took, namely, whether by way of executory devise or remainder in fee, and it was held that the limitation to him was of an estate in remainder in fee expectant upon an estate tail. See also Biss v. Smith[56]. In Coltsmann v. Collsmann[57], Lord Chancellor Cottenham and Lords Cranworth and Chelmsford show very clearly that language sufficient to justify the construction that the words \"dying without lawful issue\" in a case like the present should be applied to the time of the death of the donee of the precedent estate must be found in the will itself. Lord Cottenham there says that although he cannot admit that the words\n\"die without heirs of the body\" are necessarily inflexible, still that they are technical words, and they are very strong words, but they are words the technical meaning of which may on construction be controlled by the context. A gift over if A. shall die without heirs of the body at his death or living at his death would imply a failure of heirs of the body at that punctum temporis only, and the question in this case is: Does the context limit the words \"heirs of the body\"? in the same way, and it was held that the context did so limit the words and made the gift over an executory devise instead of a remainder expectant upon an estate tail, the judgment being rested expressly upon the fact that the words \"at his death\" were found in direct connection with the limitation over. The testator by his will had devised a property called Flesk Castle which he held in fee simple to his son John, precisely as in the present case. He afterwards made a codicil to his will in which he said:\nIf it should happen that my son John Coltsmann die without heirs of his body lawfully begotten, etc., in that case and in default of such heirs, I do hereby devise that my lands, etc., (now subject to certain charges) shall at my son's death descend and be transferred to my grandson Daniel Cronin, his heirs forever,\nand it was held expressly upon the construction of the words \"shall at my son's death descend, &c.\" that the devise was of an estate to John Coltsmann, in fee with an executory devise over to Daniel Cronin in the event that happened of John Coltsmann dying without heirs of his body living at his death.\nThat case is precisely similar to the present case only in the crucial point that the will in the present case has not any such word:; as \"shall at my son's death,\" or any words qualifying in any respect the construction which the law attaches, in the absence of qualifying language to the words\nbut should my son Jonas die without leaving any lawful heirs, then I order that all my real estate now made over to my son Jonas revert and fall back to my great-grandson, Elias Peter, &c.\nThe judgment in Ex parte Davies[58], had proceeded upon the same grounds as that in Coltsmann v. Coltsmann[59]. In Gray v. Richford[60], the devise was to the testator's son John, his heirs and assigns for ever:\nbut if my said son John should die without leaving any issue of his body lawfully begotten, or the children of such issue surviving him\u2014 then he devised the said lands to his son Thomas, his heirs and assigns, to have and to hold the same at the death of John.\nNothing could be more express than this language that the time when the limitation over was to take effect at the death of John without leaving issue, that is an heir of his body him surviving.\nIn Armstrong v. Nason[61], after a devise by testator of certain land to one of two daughters and of other land to the other, the words used were:\nand be it understood that if either of my daughters die without lawful issue, the part and portion of the deceased shall revert to the surviving daughter.\nThis word \"surviving\" so used plainly indicated the intention of the testator to be that the limitation over should take effect in the survivor immediately upon the decease of the other without leaving issue her surviving, for if the deceased daughter should leave a child her surviving, being her lawful issue, the surviving sister of the deceased would take nothing under the will even though the child of the deceased sister should die in infancy and unmarried.\nIn Bowey v. Ardill[62], the devise over was to testator's wife of a farm to have and to hold until testator's daughter E. E. should arrive at the age of 21 years, after that to his said daughter and her heirs for ever, and should his said daughter die before attaining the age of twenty-one years, then he devised the farm to his wife and to her heirs for ever. So in Parkes v. The Trusts Corporation[63], a testator devised a farm to his executors in trust for his grandson, with power to sell and to apply the proceeds for his benefit, and in case he died before attaining twenty-one they were to transfer the land, or if sold, the balance of the proceeds to his father. The father died before his son, who also died before attaining twenty-one without issue; the land was not sold, and it was held that the grandson took a vested., estate in fee simple subject to being divested upon the happening of a certain event which had become impossible. It is obvious that with these two last cases cited by the learned counsel for the respondent we have nothing to do whether they be well or ill decided, for they have no bearing upon the question raised in the present case. So also Whitter v. Bremridge[64], also cited in behalf of the respondent, has no bearing on the present case. There, testator devised his residuary, real and personal property upon trust to sell and invest, and pay the said property and the interest arising therefrom to his godson on his attaining the age of twenty-four years, but in case of his not attaining that age or leaving male issue, then over. The question in the case was whether the infant legatee was entitled to maintenance during his minority, which depended upon the question whether the gift was of a vested interest or wholly contingent upon his attaining twenty-four. The contention upon behalf of the infant was that he took a vested interest liable to be divested in the event of his not attaining the age of twenty-four or of his dying under that age without having male issue, and Vice Chancellor Wood, delivering judgment, said: \"It will be sufficient for the decision of the point to declare that the infant is absolutely entitled to the testator's residuary estate under the trusts of the will liable to be divested in the events in the will mentioned.\"\nSo neither has Muskett v. Eaton[65], also cited upon behalf of the respondent, any application in the present case. There the devise was of land\nto one C. M. for life and in the event of his having a son, born, or to be born in due time after his decease who should live to attain the age of twenty-one, then to such son and his heirs if he should live to attain twenty-one\nwith remainder over, and it was held that on the death of C. M. his infant son took a vested estate in the devised property subject to be divested if he should die under twenty-one. So neither has Dean v. Dean[66] any application. The devise was to A. for life and after the decease of A. unto and to the use of such child or children of A. living at his decease, and such issue then living of the child or children of A. then deceased as either before or after the death of A. should die under that age and leave issue. The learned counsel for the respondent has furnished us with a list of many other like cases, but none of them cast a shadow of a doubt upon the judgment in Coltsmann v. Coltsmann[67], and cases of that class which are those which apply in the present case. It has been argued here that a subsequent clause of the will whereby the testator declared his will to be that certain personal property should be equally divided between his son John, his daughter Elizabeth and his \"three great-grandchildren, the heirs of his grandson, Elias Zwicker,\" has the effect of limiting the time when the limitation over of the real estate to Elias Peter should take effect, to be the time of the death of Jonas without leaving any child him surviving, and so in like manner the time of the limitation over to Samuel B. A. Zwicker taking effect, to the death of Elias Peter without his leaving a child him surviving, and Right v. Creber[68] is cited as in support of this contention. But it is obvious that neither the language in the clause relied upon in the will now under consideration, nor that used in the will under consideration in Right v. Creber (3), which relate to gifts of personalty and to the designation of the persons to take under such gifts have any bearing upon the construction of limitations of freehold property or as to the time when those limitations take effect with which subject limitation clauses in a will bequeathing personalty have no connection whatever and have no relation to the rule as laid down in Coltsmann v. Coltsmann[69], and cases of that class.\nIn Right v. Creber[70], a testator had devised lands to trustees in trust to the use of his daughter Joan for life, and from and after her death he devised the property in which she had an equitable estate for life unto the heirs of her body share and share alike, their heirs and assigns for ever. At the time of the testator's death his daughter Joan had one child, a son, living, but after testator's death she had eleven others and the question was whether the child of Joan who was living at testator's death took the whole as a vested remainder in fee to him and his heirs forever to the exclusion of all the other children of Joan.\nBayley J. giving judgment says:\nHere there are the words share and share alike which show that the testator did not mean the property to go to the eldest male issue only, which he must have intended if the words \"heirs of the body\" be taken in a strict legal sense\nThen again:\nIf the words heirs of the body were not used in a strict legal sense the first question is, in what sense were they used? I think they were used in a sense similar to that expressed by the words descendants, children or issue. That being so, if the testator had used the words children or issue which are words apt and proper to express the sense in which he used the words heirs of the body, then, according to Doe v. Perryn, the estate limited to the children was a contingent remainder in fee which on the birth of each child vested in that child, subject to open and let in those who were born after. It is a settled rule that wherever a remainder can be construed to be a vested remainder it is to be considered vested and not contingent.\nThen again he says: Where it can be collected from expressions in the will that those words, (heirs of the body) are used in a different sense (from their strict legal sense, viz.,) as a designation of a person, then the remainder vests notwithstanding the general rule that nemo est hares viventis.\nThen he says:\nI think there is * * * sufficient on the face of the will to show that the words \"heirs of the body\" were used to denote children, and therefore that it was the intention of the testator that the remainder should vest in the first born child subject to open and let in the other children as soon as they came into esse,\nand so it was adjudged.\nHolroyd J. in the same case, says:\nIt has been said that the testator meant those children only who were living at the death of Joan Creber, there is nothing in the will to show that that was his meaning, the words share and share alike and their heirs and assigns show that the words heirs of the body were not used in their strict legal sense.\nThe judgment in this case in fact appears to be rather in support of the contention of the appellant than that of the respondent as being confirmatory of the rule laid down in Coltsmann v. Coltsmann[71], and cases of that class, namely, that when words are used in a will which have a strict legal sense they will be construed in such sense unless it be apparent from expressions in the will itself used in connection with those words that they are used by the testator in a sense different from their strict legal sense.\nThen there is the case of Richards v. Davies[72], where a testator devised real property to trustees and their heirs to the use of his daughter for life and after her decease in trust for such one or more of her children or his, her or their issue in such form, etc., as his daughter should by will appoint, and in default of appointment, in trust for all and every of her children and the heirs of their body or bodies lawfully begotten in equal shares and proportions; and in case of the death of his said daughter without leaving any child her surviving, and in the event of such child or children her surviving and dying without leaving any issue of his or her body, then in trust for his own right heirs forever; and it was held that upon this will the children of the testator's daughter, tenant for life, were made tenants in tail with cross remainders between them, and that the limitation to the right heirs of the testator was barred by a disentailing deed which had been executed by the tenant for life jointly with a son of hers in his lifetime who, however, had died in the lifetime of his mother.\nERLE C.J. there says:\nThe general scheme of the will, as it seems to me, is that the daughter was to take an estate for life with remainder to issue intact and in the event of her leaving no issue then the estate was to go to the right heirs of the testator. Although this construction enables a child of the first taker to defeat the limitation over it as an invariable rule in the construction of wills that the testator is not to be supposed to have in his contemplation the possibility of his intentions being frustrated by the exercise by a tenant in tail of his disentailing power. If that power had not been exercised in this case the whole intention of the testator would have been carried into effect by the construction which I put upon the whole will\u2014the line of the daughter having failed, the limitation over to the testator's right heirs would have taken effect.\nThen there is the case of Doe d. Blesard v. Simpson[73], where testator by his will devised certain copyhold lands to his son, his heirs and assigns for ever, followed by the words:\nbut if it shall happen my said son shall die without leaving any child or children, in that case I give, devise and bequeath all the before mentioned estates, &c., unto my five children (who were illegitimate, naming them) their heirs and assigns forever, to be equally divided among them share and share alike, and if any of my said five children should die before they come of age, without issue, such share of him, her or them so dying shall go equally among the survivors. Now there the words \"without leaving any child or children\" were expressly used as it is contended on behalf of the respondent that the words \"without leaving any lawful heirs\" in the will now under consideration should be construed as having been used, and yet it was held in the above case that if the lands had been freehold the testator's sons would, under the will, have taken an estate tail with remainder over to the testator's five natural children, as the words child or children were used in the sense of issue generally, but that the lands being copyhold and not being capable of being entailed, the testator's son took a fee simple conditional on which no remainder could be limited, and further, that the lands being copyhold lands and so incapable of being entailed, afforded no ground for construing the devise to the five natural children to be an executory devise to take effect in the event of the testator's son dying without any child living at his death.\nHaliburton v. Haliburton[74] was also relied upon by the learned counsel for the respondent, but as the conclusion arrived at in that case is expressly based upon the judgment in Right v. Creber[75], which, as already observed, has no application in the present case, we cannot recognize the judgment in Haliburton v. Haliburton (1), either as of any authority in the present case.\nMany other cases were cited by the learned counsel for the respondent showing that the word \"heirs\" in a will, will in some cases be construed as if the word \"children\" had been used instead. It is not necessary to refer to those cases further than has been already done, for it is not questioned that the word \"heirs\" will be so construed when it is plain from the context in which the word is used that is intended by it to designate that the persons who are intended to take are to take as purchasers, but such cases have no bearing upon the present case. There is one case, however, cited by the learned counsel for the respondent the judgment in which although not affecting the judgment to be rendered in the present case is very instructive as a guide in the construction of wills. It is the case of Jeffray v. Tredwell[76]. There a testator directed his trustees to pay the income of a trust fund to his wife during her life or until she should marry again, and from and after her marrying again he directed his trustees to pay her an annuity of \u00a32,000 during her life, and from and after the death of his wife he directed them to levy and pay certain legacies, all which although payment was postponed until after the decease of his said wife he directed should be taken as vested immediately upon his own decease. The testator's wife survived him and married again\u2014the question was whether the legacies were payable upon the life estate to the wife being determined by her second marriage or not until her decease.\nLord Justice Lindley delivering judgment says at p. 653:\nThere is no ambiguity in the will at all. There is no expression which gives rise to any doubt or difficulty. But we are asked to look out of the will into authorities, and I protest against having recourse to authorities for the purpose of raising a difficulty. I understand having recourse to authorities for the purpose of grappling with a difficulty when it arises, but it appears to be a misuse of cases on construction to depart from a plain instrument and to find from authorities something which you do not find in the instrument itself and which you import from the authorities into the instrument, and thereby raise a doubt, and then have recourse to the same authorities for the purpose of seeing how the doubt is to be met. It appears to me that is fundamentally erroneous, and I think our duty is upon a plain will to adopt the construction which the words require.\nIn the will before us, to construe the estate vested in Jonas by the will to be an estate in fee simple with an executory devise over to the testator's great-grandson Elias Peter, in the event of Jonas dying without leaving a child or children living at the death of Jonas, would have the effect of wholly defeating the devise over to Elias Peter in the event, which was a quite possible one, of Jonas dying and leaving a child or children his lawful issue him surviving, which issue should die in infancy and unmarried. In that event neither Elias Peter nor his issue who might continue for many generations would take anything, and the testator's manifest intention of benefiting Elias Peter and his issue would be defeated, as likewise would be the devise over to the present respondent. As then there is not a single expression in the will to qualify the construction which the law of England puts upon the word \"heirs\" in the context in which they are used in the present will, there can be no doubt that in 1859, upon the death of the testator, if the above ch. 112 of the first series of the Statutes of Nova Scotia had never been passed, the estate devised to testator's son Jonas must have been adjudged to be an estate in fee tail, and so likewise that the limitation over to Elias Peter, the testator's great-grandson, must have been adjudged an estate in fee tail upon default of issue of Jonas, and the limitation over to the respondent to have been a remainder in fee simple expectant upon the termination of the estates tail vested in Jonas and Elias Peter respectively.\nThe only difference between the devise of Jonas and that to Elias Peter, is that in the latter case the words used are: \"And should my great-grandson Elias Peter die before my son Jonas, or before he becomes of age, or should he die without any heirs, then &c.\" But in Mortimer v. Hartley[77], the words in the will after the devise to testator's son John were: If it should happen that my son John die without leaving lawful issue it is my will that my daughter Ann have his share, subject &c., &c., and\u2014if it should please God to take away both Ann and John under age, or without leaving lawful issue, I give and bequeath to my brother Joseph and his heirs for ever, all, &c., &c.\nAnn survived her father and died under age and unmarried; John also survived his father and attained the age of twenty-five years, leaving two surviving children who died in infancy. John by will devised all his real estate to the defendant. The question was whether (John having reached the age of twenty-five leaving children him surviving, who, however, had died in infancy,) Joseph the testator's brother or the devisees of John took the real property devised to John and Ann, and it was held that the word \"or\" in the clause \"if it should please God to take away both Ann and John, under age, or without lawful issue, must be read in its ordinary sense in the disjunctive and not as the copulative and. Baron Parke giving judgment says:\nIf we change \"or\" into \"and\" for the purpose of effecting the conjectural intention, to give a benefit to the issue on the death of their parents respectively under twenty-five, we defeat the clear and manifest intention to give the remainder to Joseph on failure of issue of John and Ann, and cause an intestacy as to that remainder, a circumstance which ought to be avoided.\nAnd it was judged that notwithstanding that John had passed the age of twenty-five, yet upon failure of the issue of John and Ann, that is upon the termination of the estates tail, Joseph took the lands under his estate in fee in remainder upon the determination of the estates tail. Here, however, it is of no importance whether the word \"or\" be read in the disjunctive or as \"and\" for the estate tail to Elias Peter was determined by his death, under age and without issue, in the lifetime of Jonas.\nIt remains only to consider what effect, if any, ch. 112 of the first and second series of the Consolidated Statutes of Nova Scotia, or any other of the above cited subsequent statutes, have upon the construction which in the absence of these statutes must, I think, have been put upon the will under consideration.\nIn the matter of The Estate of Simpson[78], the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in 1863 held that the above mentioned ch. 112 absolutely abolished all estates tail both past and future, both those where a reversion in fee remained in the settler or donor and those whereon a remainder was limited.\nThe then Chief Justice of that court, the late Sir William Young, in his elaborate judgment in that case shews that the terms \"fee simple absolute\" and \"valid remainder\" as used in ch. 112 and the sentence in which they are found were taken from a statute of the State of New York without their context in that statute, which shews the sense in which they were there used, and he proceeded as we must also now do to construe the sentence as it stands in the ch. 112, wholly apart from the omitted part of the New York statute. There can, I think, be no doubt that the ch. 112 did abolish all estates tail then existing where the reversion in fee remained in the heirs of the settler or donor, and converted the estate tail into an estate in fee simple as effectually as a fine and recovery could have done or a disentailing deed executed under the Nova Scotia statute, 55 Geo. 3, ch. 14, which was thenceforth expunged from the statutes of Nova Scotia, not being thereafter contained in the Consolidated Statutes.\nIt is certainly difficult to understand upon what principle a remainder in fee expectant upon the determination of an estate tail should be more respected than a reversion, and it was no doubt because the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia could see no good reason for it, that they held all estates tail, including those whereon a remainder was limited, to be abolished, and the estate of the tenant in tail converted into a fee simple equally as if a disentailing deed had been executed. The expunging from the Statutes of Nova Scotia of the disentailing Act 55 Geo. 3, ch. 14, as in that case no longer necessary, certainly favoured that conclusion, but with the greatest deference to the judgment of that court I cannot concur in that conclusion: The construction which I think must be put upon what the learned Chief Justice in the above case in very moderate terms designates the \"ambiguous and inartistic sentence\" which forms the ch. 112, is that only estates tail whereon no remainder was limited were abolished notwithstanding the first words in the sentence. It was argued in the case before us that the meaning of that ambiguous and inartistic sentence was to abolish the estates tail whereon a remainder was limited equally as all others, but nevertheless to preserve the remainder as valid notwithstanding the destruction of the estate tail whereon the remainder was limited; but as the remainder could not be preserved in accordance with the principles of the law of England upon the subject without preserving the estate tail whereon the remainder was limited until its determination for the want of heirs to inherit, it was then argued that what the ch. 112 effected was to convert the estate tail into a fee simple with an executory devise over in fee in the event of the person who was formerly tenant in tail dying without leaving issue him surviving, an heir or heirs competent to have inherited the estate tail if it had not been abolished and converted into a fee simple. As to this construction it is sufficient, I think, to say that the language used warrants no such violent construction, and that such, a construction could not be maintained without the establishment of some new canons for the construction of statutes. Now whatever the draftsman of this obscure statute, ch. 112, contemplated by framing into a statute what Chief Justice Sir William Young has shown to be an imperfect extract from a statute of the State of New York, it is plain, I think, that the legislature of Nova Scotia did not by it abolish estates tail having a remainder limited thereon, whatever may have been their reason, if any was considered, for preserving them. That the creation of such estates tail in the future was not prohibited or declared to be ineffectual appears sufficiently from ch. 114 of the same first series of the Consolidated Statutes, by the 26th sec. of which chapter it is enacted that:\nWhere any person to whom any real estate shall be devised for an estate tail, or for an estate in quasi entail shall die in the lifetime of the testator leaving issue, who would be inheritable under such entail if such estate existed (that is if the tenant in tail had not died before the testator), and any such issue shall be living at the time of the death of the testator, such devise shall not lapse but shall take effect as if the death of such person had happened immediately after the death of the testator, unless a contrary intention shall appear by the will.\nThis enactment is repeated and consolidated in the second and also in the third series of the Consolidated Statutes of Nova Scotia, in which third series, enacted in 1864, immediately after the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in re Simpson's Estate[79], the ch. 112 of the first and second series is consolidated as ch. 111 in language which must, I think, be construed as giving the true construction of the said ch. 112, as follows:\u2014\nAll estates tail on which no valid remainder is limited are abolished, and every such estate shall hereafter be adjudged a fee simple absolute, and may be conveyed, or devised by the tenant in tail, or otherwise shall descend to his heirs as a fee simple.\nIn the following year, A.D. 1865, the legislature of Nova Scotia passed the statute 28 Vict. ch. 2, whereby it was enacted as follows:\u2014 All estates tail are abolished, and every estate which hitherto would have been adjudged a fee tail shall hereafter be adjudged a fee simple, and may be conveyed or devised or descend as such.\nThis statute has been continued in every series of the consolidated statutes since enacted. Now in view of all those statutes it is impossible, in my opinion, to construe the above ch. 112 in the first series as having abolished estates tail having a remainder limited thereon, and in view of the enactments contained in sec. 26 of ch. 114 of the said first series consolidated in ch. 112 of the third series of the Consolidated Statutes of Nova Scotia, and in view of the above statute, 28th Vict. ch. 2, we cannot hold otherwise than that such estates tail remained in existence in full force until they were abolished and converted into estates in fee simple in the tenants in tail in possession at the time of the passing of the last mentioned Act, and that therefore upon the sale and conveyance long after the passing of the said last mentioned Act by Jonas Zwicker, the tenant in tail in possession at the time of the passing of that Act, to the appellant Ernst and his heirs, an estate in fee simple in the lands in question was vested in Ernst and his heirs, and therefore this appeal must be allowed with costs, and judgment must be ordered to be entered for the defendants in the action in the court below with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J. was of opinion that the appeal should be allowed for reasons stated in the judgment of His Lordship Mr. Justice King.\nKING J.\u2014The plaintiff in this action (and respondent here) claims the land in question as devisee under the will of Peter Zwicker.\nThe defendant claims under conveyance from Jonas Zwicker, a son of the testator to whom the property was devised, with certain limitations over, and the question is as to the nature and extent of Jonas Zwicker's interest under the will.\nThe will was made in 1857. After devise of a certain lot to his grandson Emanuel Zwicker, who was then at sea, the testator goes on as follows:\u2014\nBut should my grandson Emanuel Zwicker not return home, this last mentioned lot to revert and go to my son Jonas, together with all the remainder of my real estate as well as personal property, cattle, household furniture, etc., which I give and bequeath to my son Jonas. * * * But should my son Jonas die without leaving any lawful heirs, then I order that all my real estate now made over to my son Jonas, revert and fall back to my great-grandson Elias Peter, aforesaid, and should my great-grandson Elias Peter die before my son Jonas, or before he becomes of age, or should he die without any heirs, then I order, give and bequeath all my real estate to Samuel B. A. Zwicker and his heirs, youngest son of Benjamin Zwicker, Esq. It being my sincere wish that my real estate should remain in my name, reserving the dower to my daughter-in-law as long as she remains a widow, should she survive my son Jonas. * * * I also order that my son Jonas keep and maintain my sick son John in a kind manner and give him good treatment out of my real and personal property, made over to my son Jonas, during his life.\nThe testator died in 1859. The learned trial judge has found that Emanuel never returned home, but was lost at sea, and that Elias Peter died before he reached the age of twenty-one (21) years, and during the lifetime of Jonas without ever having been married. Jonas died in 1894, having in 1891 conveyed the land in question to the appellant.\nSamuel B. A. Zwicker, who is a son of a cousin of the testator, claims that, in the events that have happened, he is entitled to the property.\nMr. Justice Meagher, who tried the case, decided in his favour upon the ground that Jonas took an estate for life merely.\nThe Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, on appeal, maintained the judgment in plaintiff's favour, but upon another ground, viz., that Jonas took an estate in fee simple with executory devises over, which, upon the events that happened, divested the fee simple out of Jonas and vested it in Samuel B. A. Zwicker.\nIn 1851 an Act was passed relative to the abolition of estates tail[80], which appears in identical terms in the revision of 1858[81], and is as follows:\u2014\nAll estates tail are abolished, and every estate which would hitherto have been adjudged a fee tail shall hereafter be adjudged a fee simple, and if no valid remainder be limited thereon, shall be a fee simple absolute, and may be conveyed or devised by the tenant in tail, or otherwise shall descend to his heirs as a fee simple.\nIn Re Simpson[82], (1863), a case where the devise was made long anterior to the Act, the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia decided that the Act absolutely abolished all estates tail, even although a valid remainder be limited thereon.\nIn the opinion of that court the expressions of the Act, \"all estates tail are abolished,\" \"and every estate which would hitherto have been adjudged a fee tail, shall hereafter be adjudged a fee simple,\" are too comprehensive and precise to admit of the exclusion of estates tail with remainder expectant on their termination, by inference, and simply because the effect of the general clause upon one of the classes of estates tail, viz., that where there is a reversion upon the termination of the estate tail, was alone particularized. In their view the like consequences followed, by law, in the other class of cases where there was a valid remainder expectant upon the termination of the estate tail.\nBliss J., while agreeing that every estate tail was abolished and converted into an estate in fee simple, considered that the effect of the latter part of the section was this: that where there was no valid remainder limited on the estate tail, the fee simple was to be a \"fee simple absolute,\" while, if there be such a remainder, the estate tail is none the less converted into a fee simple, but it is a fee simple conditional within the common law signification of the term.\nPractically there was no substantial difference between a fee simple conditional at common law and an estate tail under the statute de donis[83], but they were, however, none the less, different estates.\nIn the view of all the learned judges, therefore, estates tail were abolished and converted into fees simple, and there was no longer such a thing as a valid remainder expectant on the termination of an estate tail.\nIt is unnecessary to decide between these two views, the divergence between which does not practically affect the question before us. It seems to me sufficient to say that we should follow the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia upon the construction of a statute affecting the tenure of real property, which was long ago pronounced, and which has not since been questioned in the courts of Nova Scotia.\nIn 1864 the legislature substituted for the then existing enactment, one which in terms was confined to estates tail on which no valid remainder was limited. This Act had a very short life, and was repealed the next year by an Act which plainly and in terms abolished all estates tail, and converted every estate which theretofore would have been adjudged a fee tail into a fee simple, without any declaration as to the effect of there being no valid remainder limited thereon.\nIn all these enactments the body of law relating to the creation of estates tail prior to the abolition of them is recognized in the expression, repeated in the successive statutes, \"every estate which would hitherto have been adjudged a fee tail shall hereafter be adjudged a fee simple.\" The courts, therefore, are required to interpret an instrument as before, and if, in the state of the law prior to the abolition of such estates there would have been adjudged to be an estate tail, it is by force of the statute to be converted into an estate in fee simple. But, equally as a result of the view of Bliss J. as of the majority of the court, there could be no valid remainder expectant on an estate tail after 1851, because there could be no valid estate tail to support such remainder. As to estates created before 1851, the remainder expectant on the termination of the estate tail was a vested estate, and at the time of the Act was a valid remainder.\nNext, as to the construction of the will: Does it purport to give to Jonas an estate tail with remainders over as claimed by appellant, or an estate for life only with remainders over as held by Mr. Justice Meagher, or an estate in fee simple with executory devises over, as held by Mr. Justice Henry speaking for the rest of the judges?\nThe devising clause to Jonas is to him without any words of limitation. Under the Wills Act this carries the entire interest of the testator, unless a contrary intention appears by the will. The will goes on to direct what disposition is to be made in case Jonas should die without leaving any lawful heirs. In that event it is to go (in the first instance) to the testator's great-grandson.\nThere appears to be no more settled rule applicable to the transmission of real property by devise than that expressed by the following passage from Jarman on Wills[84].\nWhere real estate is devised over in default of heirs of the first devisee, and the ulterior devisee stands related to the prior devisee so as to be in the course of descent from him, whether in the lineal or collateral line and however remote, as the prior devisee in that case could not die without heirs while the devisee over exists, the word \"heirs\" is construed to mean heirs of the body, and accordingly the estate of the first devisee, by the effect of the devise over, is restricted to an estate tail, and the estate of the devisee over becomes a remainder expectant on that estate. This construction is induced by the evident absurdity of supposing the testator to mean that his devise over should depend on an event which cannot happen without involving the extinction of its immediate object.\nSee also other cases cited for the appellant. Simson v. Ashworth[85]; Harris v. Davis[86]; Morgan v. Griffiths[87]; Doe d. Hatch v. Bluck[88].\nHere Elias Peter and Samuel B. A. Zwicker, the two named devisees over, are persons who might take in course of descent from Jonas Zwicker, and so the words \"lawful heirs\" in the limitation over are to be read as if they were \"heirs of his body,\" i. e., of the body of Jonas; and accordingly the estate of Jonas is, by the effect of the devise over, restricted to an estate tail, and the devisee over has an estate in remainder expectant on the termination of the estate tail. The rule of law is stated by Kent[89], to be established by a series of cases in the English law uniform from the time of the Year Book down to the date of his writing.\nMr. Justice Meagher, who recognized the rule, felt pressed by the declaration, in the will, of the testator's wish that his real estate should remain in his name, to limit the interest of Jonas under the will to a life estate, as the most efficacious way of accomplishing this object. But it would hardly seem that so general a declaration of intention could vary the sense in which words having such a settled meaning are used. The learned judge's view would also make a partial intestacy in the event of Jonas dying leaving heirs of his body. The provision as to providing during the life of John for his support, out of the real and personal property made over to him, is also against such view.\nThen, as to the contention that Jonas took an estate in fee simple with executory devise over. We are not to stop at a certain point and say: \"Here is what would, if taken by itself, make an estate in fee simple,\" and then give effect to this as if it stood alone, and then go on to construe the devise over independently. The whole is to be taken together, the words of devise and the devise over in default of leaving lawful heirs. The question is: What does the whole import, each part being allowed its fair weight, alone and together with the other?\nHere again comes in the rule of law already referred to, unless there is something on the face of the will showing a manifest intention that the words are used in a different sense.\nIf the words were \"die without leaving lawful heirs him surviving,\" this would point to a definite failure at the date of Jonas' death, and we might have an executory devise. So, if the words were \"die without leaving issue,\" or \"die without issue,\" or \"have no issue,\" or other like terms, for by statute R. S. N. S. (1854) c. 114, sec. 24, these words would prim\u00e2 facie mean a want or failure of issue in the lifetime or at the death of Jonas. But the words \"die without leaving lawful heirs,\" or \"die without leaving heirs,\" are not within the statute and import an indefinite failure, and in connection with a devise over, have a fixed and technical operation in restricting the prior estate in fee simple to an estate tail. That fixed and technical meaning is imperative unless, from something else in the will, it is evident that the words are used in a different sense, or there is some repugnancy, Here there is nothing having this effect. The word \"issue\" is a more flexible term than \"heirs,\" and yields to a secondary meaning more readily.\nUnder a like Imperial Act[90], a devise over in case the prior taker \"should die without heirs male of his body lawfully begot\" was held to refer to an indefinite failure of heirs male.\nIn Dawson v. Small[91], Sir W. M. James, L.J., there says:\nMr. Chitty argued that section 29 of the Wills Act applied, and that the gift over was in the event of John Small Lowther dying without leaving heirs male living at his death; hut I am of opinion that the Act has no reference to such a case. The legislature there deals with \"die without issue.\" \"die without leaving issue,\" and similar ambiguous expressions; hut here there is no ambiguity, the gift over is on failure of heirs male of the body.\nThen, supposing that the limitations here were to be treated as executory devises; the first (to Elias Peter) would be void as against the rule as to perpetuities, inasmuch as the contingency on which it is to become vested is the indefinite failure of heirs of the body, and this being so, the limitation might possibly not take effect within the lifetime of any person in being at the testator's death or within twenty-one years thereafter.\nTreating this then as void, how is it with the subsequent limitation in favour of the respondent? If it is an executory devise and is dependent upon the coming into existence of the prior limitation, the rendering void of the first would also invalidate the second. But if the one is not dependent on the other, or on like condition, then the nullity of the first would cause the second limitation to operate as if the void demise had never been made. In this state of things the devise to the respondent would depend upon these contingencies, viz., the death of Elias Peter in the lifetime of Jonas, his death under age, or his death without leaving heirs. As to this last contingency, it would equally be obnoxious to the rule against perpetuities, but the avoiding of this would not avoid the limitation so far as it is made dependent upon the other two contingencies. Per Lord Chelmsford in Evers v. Challis[92].\nThe other two contingencies, viz., the death of Elias Peter in Jonas' lifetime, or under age, would of course necessarily be determined during lives in existence at the testator's death. But we then should have the fee simple in the testator's son Jonas defeated during his lifetime, or notwithstanding that he had heirs of his body, and the estate in fee simple passing to Samuel B. A. Zwicker, in the event of Elias Peter dying in the lifetime of Jonas or under age.\nThis is a result that would seem opposed to what one would say must have been the real intention with regard to Jonas, viz., to give him an estate which might pass to the heirs of his body.\nUpon the whole, therefore, I think that the estate devised to Jonas purported to be an estate tail, which, by operation of the statute, has been converted into an estate in fee simple, and that therefore the appeal should be allowed.\nGIROUARD J. concurred for reasons stated in the judgment of His Lordship Mr. Justice Grwynne.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Charles W.

The rule that the \u201cheir\u201d means the \u201cheir at the testator\u2019s death\u201d is subject to the qualification \u201cunless a contrary intention appear.\u201d Here a contrary intention does appear, for a life estate is expressly given to the daughter and this is important in construing the devise. Morgan v. Thomas[3]. The fact that his daughter was his only heir points to the conclusion that by the words \u201cmy lawful heirs,\u201d the testator meant persons other than the daughter. The peculiar context distinguishes the present will from that presented for decision in Re Ford, Patten v. Sparks[4]; Wrightson v. McCauley[5]; and Bullock v. Downes[6]. The following are in point: Gibbons v. Gibbons[7]; Coltsmann v. Coltsmann[8]; Ex parte Davies[9]; Parker v. Birks[10]. The law is compendiously stated in \u201cWatson\u2019s Equity at p. 735. We also refer to the following cases as to the intention: Brennan v. Munro[11]; Keeler v. Collins[12]; Clow v. Clow[13]; Evans v. King[14]; Re Ferguson, Bennett v. Coatsworth[15]; Leader v. Duffey[16]; and to Challis on Real Property, (2 ed.) p. 154. As to the words \u201cmy lawful heirs\u201d excluding the daughter, the sole heir, see Jones v. Colebeck[17]; Clarke v. Hayne[18]; Lees v. Massey[19]; Doe d. King v. Frost[20]; Say v. Creed[21].\nEven if the daughter took a life estate only, the respondents are not entitled to a lien for improvements as directed by the judgment of His Lordship the Chancellor. The improvements of a life tenant, however substantial or lasting, are not chargeable against the inheritance. Re Smith\u2019s Trusts[22]. The daughter having an interest in the land when the improvements were made is not entitled to compensation therefor. Beatty v. Shaw[23]. But even if entitled to compensation for improvements, the judgment should be varied by directing the respondents to account for the rents and profits from the time the testator\u2019s daughter regarded herself as owner in fee. She could not claim to be at once owner in fee and life tenant, and is only entitled to compensation for improvements, if at all, as being made under the belief that she was owner in fee. McCarthy v. Arbuckle[24]; Munsie v. Lindsay[25]; Niagara Falls Park Commissioners v. Colt[26].\nRobinson Q.C. and O\u2019Gara Q.C. for the respondents. The rule of law is clear that unless a will contains a clear intention to the contrary, or \u201cdemonstration plain\u201d as explained by Baron Parke, estates vest in interest at the earliest possible period after the death of the testator in order that the right of families may be ascertained, and that the property may be properly looked after, which would not be done if the owner was not ascertained. Wrightson v. McCauley[27]; In re Rawlin\u2019s Trusts[28]; Mortimer v. Slater[29]. Words of futurity in the devise do not postpone the vesting of the remainder, but refer only to the enjoyment, the rule being that where the testator creates a particular estate, and then goes on to dispose of the ulterior interest expressly in an event which will determine the prior estate, the words descriptive of such event occurring in the latter devise will be construed as referring merely to the period of the determination of the possession or enjoyment under the prior gift and not as designed to postpone the vesting. 1 Jarman (3 ed.) 758, 764 et seq. Theobald, \u201cWills\u201d (3 ed.) 264; Wharton v. Barker[30]. Gifts to the \u201clawful heirs,\u201d or \u201cright heirs,\u201d when they occur in wills without any other explanation from the context must be interpreted, according to their strict sense, as devises to the person who would succeed in case of intestacy. 2 Jarman, p. 55. Baldwin v. Kingstone[31]; Wrightson v. McCauley[32]; Doe d. King v. Frost[33]; Smith v. Butcher[34]. If there was no devise of the remainder the daughter, as heir-at-law, would be entitled at the death of the testator. No reason can be adduced why she should be deprived of the devise to the \u201clawful heirs\u201d if she answers that description at the death of the testator. In Miles v. Harford[35], see remarks by Lord Jessel at page 698. The language used must determine the meaning and not surmise as to general intent. King v. Evans[36]. The true construction of a will depends on what the testator has said. Re Rawlin Trusts[37].\nThe judgments of Hagarty C.J. and Osler J. in the Court of Appeal for Ontario maintain the contention of the appellants. They point to Re Ford, Patton.v. Sparks[38]; and Brabant v. Lalonde[39] which were decided since the Chancellor\u2019s judgment.\nHowever, should the appellants be declared entitled to the lands, the respondents are entitled to a lien for the enhanced value by reason of the permanent improvements made, as was decided by the Chancellor. R.S.O., c. 100, sec. 30. Fawcett v. Burwell[40]; McGregor v. McGregor[41].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014On the 4th of August, 1853, one Charles Palmer Thompson made his will, the clauses in question upon this appeal being as follows:\u2014 I further will and desire that the profits of and the interests in any residue of the property or estate, real or personal, that I may be possessed of at the time of my decease shall be enjoyed solely by my beloved wife Lissy Thompson and my beloved daughter Mary Anna Thompson, the profits and interests thereof and therein to be equally divided, share and share alike between my said beloved wife Lissy Thompson and my said beloved daughter Mary Anna Thompson during their natural lives.\nI do further will and desire that in the event of the death of either of the above named Lissy Thompson or Mary Anna Thompson, the residue of my property, real or personal, shall be enjoyed by and go to the benefit of the survivor.\nI do further will and desire that at the decease of both the said Lissy Thompson and Mary Anna Thompson, the said residue of my real and personal property shall be enjoyed and go to the benefit of my lawful heirs.\nThe effect of this was to give to his wife and daughter a life estate during their joint lives, and an estate for life to the survivor with remainder in fee to the heirs of the testator whoever they might be.\nBoth devisees survived the testator, the widow dying in 1878, and the daughter in 1893, she having married the defendant Joseph Smith, but dying without issue.\nThe controversy is between the nephews and nieces of the testator claiming the property as his heirs, and the defendant Joseph Smith claiming it as the devisee of his wife, the only daughter of the testator, and the question is: Did the deceased intend to exclude and did he succeed in excluding his daughter from the class described in the will as \u201cmy lawful heirs\u201d? The contention of the plaintiffs is that those only were his \u201clawful heirs\u201d who would have been so had he survived his wife and daughter.\nI take it to be reasonably clear that this contention cannot prevail. The rule established in Bullock v. Davies[42], is that where in a case like the present the testator uses the word \u201cheirs,\u201d he must be taken to mean heirs at the time of his death unless the contrary contention is apparent from the will. This rule was subsequently followed and applied in Mortimore v. Mortimore[43], and in Re Ford; Patten v. Sparks[44].\nI do not see in this will any intention expressed or implied to exclude the daughter from the class entitled to the fee. The testator\u2019s object seems to have been to provide immediately for his wife and daughter during their lives, leaving the property upon the death of the survivor to descend to his heirs whoever they might be as in the case of intestacy.\nThere is not any indication of an intent to exclude his daughter, or to prefer his collateral relatives to her. On the contrary he seems intentionally to have been silent as to the particular persons who were to take upon the determination of the life estates.\nOn the whole I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed and with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Bradley & Wyld.\nSolicitors for the respondents: O\u2019Gara, MacTavish & Gemmell.\n[1] 23 Ont.

Court of Canada and certified to the proper officer of the court of original jurisdiction, the Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to entertain a petition (requ\u00eate civile) for revocation of its judgment on the ground that the opposite party succeeded by the fraudulent concealment of evidence.\nPETITION by way of requ\u00eate civile to have a judgment of this court, pronounced on 1st May, 1897, set aside and the proceedings in the cause re-opened.\nThe petitioner was plaintiff and appellant in the case decided on 1st May, 1897, in the report of which ([1]) will be found a statement of the matters there in issue. The petition in revocation (requ\u00eate civile) now presented asks to have the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada and of the courts below set aside on the ground that the dismissal of a petitory action brought by the petitioner had been obtained through fraudulent con cealment by the respondent of a deed of lands, which the petitioner had discovered only since the judgments were rendered. Prior to the presentation of the petition, the certified judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada, had been transmitted to the court of original jurisdiction under the provisions of the sixty-seventh section of \u201cThe Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act.\u201d\nBelcourt for the petitioner, quoted C.P.Q. arts. 505 and 1177; R.S.C. c. 135, ss. 59, 61, 96 & 98; and cited Cooke v. Caron ([2]). Geoffrion Q.C. for the respondent. So far, at least. as this court is concerned, the judgment in question is final and conclusive, between all parties and privies, as to material facts; C. C. P. arts. 505 to 509 and art. 1166; See also Law v. Hansen, ([3]); and cases cited by Mignault ([4]) at 505 C. C. P. also R. S. C. c. 135 s. 67. The petition cannot be entertained.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by :\nTaschereau J.\u2014The appellant, in 1894, brought a petitory action against the defendant. His action was dismissed by the Superior Court and the Court of Appeal in Montreal, by a judgment which was con firmed by this court in May last. The case is reported at page 363 of vol. 27, Supreme Court Reports, where the details fully appear. The appellant now seeks to set aside the judgment of this court, and the judgments against him in the courts below, by a requ\u00eate civile, under article 1177 of the new Code of Civil Procedure. The conclusions of his petition are :\nThat by the judgment to be rendered upon this present petition, he will be held and declared to be the proprietor of five-twelfths of the lot above described, and bearing the number 22 of the official plan and book of reference for St. Louis Ward of the City of Montreal, as he would have been so held and declared pursuant to the conclusions of his said action, cited in the course of the proceedings taken on the present petition, bad the defendant declared the truth at the trial, and the judgment of the Superior Court of the District of Montreal, rendered in this suit on the thirteenth of April, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-five, the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench sitting in appeal side for the District of Montreal, rendered in this suit on the twenty-ninth of October, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-six, and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada, rendered on or about the first day of May last (1897) be considered as not having been rendered, and be set aside and annulled.\nThe ground upon which this petition is based is that he has since the judgment of this court discovered a deed of the 25th November, 1867, which said deed, he alleges, was fraudulently concealed by the respondent, and that it is by fraud that the respondent obtained the dismissal of appellant's action.\nWithout entering upon the merits in law of the allegations of the petition, or upon their sufficiency or insufficiency, if proved, to support a requ\u00eate civile, we dismiss it upon the simple ground that we have no jurisdiction to entertain it.\nSection 67 of The Supreme Court Act enacts that :\u2014\u2014\nThe judgment of the Supreme Court in appeal shall be certified by the registrar of the court to the proper officer of the court of original jurisdiction, who shall thereupon make all proper and necessary entries thereof, and all subsequent proceedings may be taken thereupon as if the judgment had been given and pronounced in the said last mentioned court.\nNow, in this case, the judgment and the record have been sent back to the Superior Court at Montreal, and this court has now no jurisdiction over it of the nature of the remedy asked for by the petitioner. We do not, of course, determine whether the Superior Court has, or has not, in this case, upon the allegations of the petitioner, jurisdiction to entertain his demand. We deter mine nothing but that we have no jurisdiction.\nThere are cases in which this court has, as every court must have, power to annul errors in its own judgments, as we did for instance, in Ratrray v. Young ([5]) but this is clearly not one of them. See also Providence Washington Insuaance Co. v. Gerow ([6]); and Dawson v. Macdonald ([7]).\nPetiton dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the petitioner : Robidoux, Ch\u00e8nevert & Robillard.\nSolicitors for the respondent : Geoffriont Dorion & Alllan.\n[1] 27 Can.

The certificate given by the court is not in any way a final judgment binding upon any person, but is merely intended to advise the Provincial Secretary that in the opinion of the judges a certain statute was within the legislative competence of the Provincial Assembly. It is not in any sense res judicata; it decides no controversy. The Queen v. Robertson per Strong J.[2]. See also remarks by Taschereau J. in The Attorney General of Canada v.

We clearly have no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. There is no judgment to be appealed from. The British Columbia statute itself says \"shall be deemed a judgment.\" That is saying that it is not a judgment.

The court from which the appeal is taken is constituted under \"The Consolidated Assessment Act, 1892,\" [Ont.] and the amending Acts, 55 Vict., ch 48, and 58 Vict. ch. 47. It is presided over by county court judges who are appointees of the Government of Canada under the provisions of\" The British North America Act, 1861\" They are not persons appointed by provincial or municipal authority within the meaning of \"The Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act,\" as amended by 52 V. c. 37, s. 2. Neither is their court, as constituted by the Ontario statutes, a \"court of last resort,\" nor their judgment a final judgment within the meaning of the Supreme Court Acts refered to Re Pacquette[1]; Re Young[2]; The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. The Little Seminary of Ste. Therese[3]; Godson v. The City of Toronto[4]; The decision of the county court judges is not appealable as they are not a court of last resort and the judgment is not final nor effective under the Ontario statutes until certain formalities are complied with, when it becomes, by statute, conclusive for the assessment of the year. The statute also declares the decision to be non-appealable. Danjou v. Marquis[5]. See judgment of Lord Cairns in Th\u00e9berge v. Laudry[6]. See also Glengarry Election case, Kennedy v. Purcell[7]; McDonald v. Abbott[8]. Robinson Q.C. contra. Our appeal is a matter of right given by Dominion legislation authorized by the B. N. A. Act, 1867, sec. 101, and cannot be taken away by provincial legislation, even when legislating as to municipal institutions. Clarkson v. Ryan[9]; Forristal v. McDonald[10]; per Richie C.J., in The Queen v. Severn[11]; Attorney General of Ontario v. Attorney General for the Dominion[12].\nThere is no alteration possible in the judgment of the court on the reference to a judge of the Court of Appeal provided by the provincial Act; it is a conclusive decision binding on the parties, the result of full hearing and deliberation. The provincial legislature has created a new court vested with all the paraphernalia and attributes of a court of final resort upon the questions it is constituted to decide. Regular procedure is provided distinct from that of the county courts. The matters over which jurisdiction is given is not in any way ancillary to the county court jurisdiction, territorial or otherwise. The statute[13], provides also for the remuneration of the judges designated as the persons to preside over this court of appeal from municipal courts of revision. They are not appointed by name, but they are person\u0153 designat\u00e6 appointed by the statute to an office separate and distinct from that to which the Dominion Government appointed them, but which is made their qualification as presiding officers of the municipal appeal court. As to what forms a court, see Re Bell Telephone Co. and The Minister of Agriculture[14]. In Godson v. City of Toronto (7)[15]; the County Court Judge was not acting judicially, he was not required to decide a case but merely to report upon matters referred to him for inquiry. The case Re Pacquette[16], is not in point as it refers merely to a case of exercise of summary jurisdiction. Neither does Re Young [17] which was a special matter in insolvency nor Th\u00e9berge v. Laudry[18] where the order appealed from was in the exercise of discretion. As to the statute of 1894, ch. 51, sec. 5, the submission to the Lieutenant Governor in Council is a matter of prerogative.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This appeal is taken under the provisions of the Supreme Court Amendment Act of 1889[19] which gives an appeal to this court from the judgment of any court of last resort created under provincial legislation to adjudicate concerning the assessment of property for provincial or municipal purposes, in cases to here the person or persons presiding over such court is or are appointed by provincial or municipal authority.\nThe judgment, or decision, appealed from was rendered by the court, composed of county court judges, constituted under 55 Vict. c. 48 (Ont.), as amended by 58 Vict. c. 47 (Ont.), for hearing appeals from the Court of Revision, as to assessments in Ontario, and the respondent moves to quash the appeal on the ground, inter alia, that the county court, judges presiding over the said appeal court, are not appointed by provincial or municipal authority, and that consequently the case does not fall within the statute.\nI am of opinion that we should allow the motion, and quash the appeal. The county court judges are not appointed by provincial or municipal authority, therefore the appeal does not lie. The Ontario statute authorizes them to preside, or constitutes them the presidents of such court, but they are appointed as county court judges by the federal authority. The word \"appointed\" cannot be extended so as to mean that the legislature has appointed them. Appointed, in that clause imports an act of the executive authority.\nTo entertain this appeal would be to strike out the words \"in cases where the persons presiding over such court are appointed by provincial or municipal authority.\" The federal authority could never constitute such a court, or designate the persons who were to preside over it, and it cannot have been the intention of the legislature to provide for an impossible contingency.\nTo give effect to these words, as we must do if possible, we have to construe them as limiting the right of appealing to this court to cases where some other persons than judges appointed by the federal power are to be judges of that municipal court. Otherwise they would have no meaning.\nIf Parliament had intended to give an appeal in all cases, the words \"in cases, &c., &c.,\" would have been absolutely unnecessary, for all such municipal courts must be presided over by persons, quoad hoc, appointed or designated by provincial power.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This is a motion to quash an appeal to this court in the matter of an assessment made by the appellants upon the respondents in respect to certain property of theirs situate in the city of Toronto, which appeal the appellants claim to have a right to make under the provisions of an Act of the Dominion passed in the year 1889[20], whereby it was enacted that an appeal should lie to this court\n(j) from the judgment of any court of last resort created under provincial legislation to adjudicate concerning the assessment of property for provincial or municipal purposes in cases where the person or persons presiding over such court is or are appointed by provincial or municipal authority, and the judgment appealed from involves the assessment of property at a value of not less than ten thousand dollars.\nI am of opinion that the court contemplated by this statute as a court from whose judgment an appeal was given to this court, was a court which had yet to be created, and to which should be given, as a court of last resort, uniform appellate jurisdiction over all cases of appeal from the decision of the revision courts, and whose judgment should be conclusive, not merely as regards the particular assessment roll affected by it, but binding upon all revision courts and upon all other courts within the province in which the court should be created upon all questions of law adjudicated upon by such court, whatever might be the amount of the assessment complained of.\nBy chapter 193 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, [1887], the Act then in force in relation to assessments, an appeal was given \"to the county judge\" from all decisions of courts of revision within the county of the county court of which he is the judge, and assuming these words \"the county judge,\" by reason of the provisions of the subsections of sec. 68 and of sec. 69, to be sufficient to constitute the judge of the county court in such county a court of appeal in all assessment cases arising within the county of the county court of which he is the judge, his judgment was not made final otherwise than as regulating finally the assessment rolls of the year which must be completed within the year; nor even in that respect final in all cases, for by sec. 67 it is enacted that when the assessment complained of is of the value of $50,000 and over, although the appeal is in such case equally as in all others \"to the county judge,\" still the appellant may request in writing the said county court judge to associate with himself on hearing of the said appeal, the judge of the county court of the county whose county town is nearest to the court house of the county to the judge of whose county court the appeal is given, and these two judges were directed then to hear the said appeal; and although by subsec. 3 of sec. 76 these two judges are declared to have the powers and duties which were by the Act assigned to \"the county judge,\" acting alone, viz.: compelling attendance of witnesses, examination of all parties on oath, &c., &c., still in case they differ no judgment can be given, neither by the two conjointly by reason of their difference in opinion, nor yet by \"the county judge\" to whom the appeal is given. Special provision in such case is therefore made by subsection 4 of sec. 76, precisely similar in effect, it is true, to that which is the effect of the judgment of a court of appellate jurisdiction when its judges are divided in opinion; that subsection enacts that when two judges hear the appeal and differ in their opinion as to the allowance of the said appeal or otherwise, the assessment appealed from shall stand confirmed. In such a case, however, it must be observed that the confirmation of the judgment of the Court of Revision is effected by an express statutory provision and not by the judgment of any court, and moreover the confirmation of the judgment of the Court of Revision only affects the assessment roll of that year.\nSuch being the provisions in relation to appeal from the courts of revision when the above Dominion Act was passed, it does not appear to me that there was then any court in the province of Ontario which can be said to have been a court contemplated by the Dominion statute as being \"a court of last resort created to adjudicate concerning the assessment of property,\" from the judgment of which an appeal was given to this court.\nNow all the above provisions of R. S. O. [1887] ch. 198, still remain in force precisely as therein enacted save as hereinafter mentioned. The appeal from the decision of the Court of Revision is still \"to the county judge,\" nor has there been any alteration in the language used save as appears in 57 Vic. ch. 51, sec. 5 (1894), and in 58 Vic. ch. 47, sec. 5 (1895). By the former a new subsection was added to sec. 76, intituled 76a, whereby \"in order to facilitate uniformity of decision without the delay or expense of appeals,\" it was enacted that a county judge may after his judgment in the case or matter, prepare a statement of the facts in the nature of a case on any question of general application which has arisen under the Act to be submitted in the manner provided in the Act to a judge of the Court of Appeal whose duty is declared to be to hear the case argued as also is provided in the Act, and to certify to the Lieutenant-Governor-in-Council his opinion thereon, and the Act proceeds to enact that such opinion shall forthwith be published in the Ontario Gazette, and a copy thereof sent to every judge of a county court, or the judge may, at any stage of the proceedings, refer the case to the full court for hearing and adjudication, and the said court shall have the authority and perform the duties assigned by the Act to, or conferred upon the judge[21].\nNow, although it is provided by sec. 6 of this Act that the statement of any such case shall not delay the final revision of the assessment roll, the taxes imposed being necessary to be collected annually, yet the Act provides that the judge of the appeal court or the full court, should the matter be referred to them, shall adjudicate upon the matter and make such order in the premises and as to costs and the payment thereof as will in the opinion of the judge or of the full court, as the case may be, do justice to all parties concerned, and any such order may be enforced as an order of a judge of the High Court under the Judicature Act or otherwise. Now, although the judgment of a judge or of the full court of appeal cannot alter the assessment roll of the year in which the case is prepared by \"the judge,\" it is very obvious, I think, from the provisions enacted for the promulgation of the judgment of the judge of the Court of Appeal or of the full court, to whom the case should be referred, that their adjudication should in future be binding upon all county court judges upon all points of law by them decided, and such being the case, I am the more confirmed in my view that neither since nor before the passing of this Act was there a court in existence in Ontario which can be said to be a court of last resort created to adjudicate concerning the assessment of property.\nNow, the only alteration made by 58 Vict. ch. 47, sec. 5, was to amend the section 76 by substituting two judges instead of one, thus providing that the appellant might request in writing \"the county judge to whom his appeal from the decision of the Court of Revision was made, to associate with himself two judges of county courts instead of one as previously provided by that section, and by enacting that when these three judges hear the appeal the decision of the majority shall prevail; that, in effect, is to say that in the one case the decision of the Court of Revision shall remain, and in the other that the clerk of the municipality shall alter the roll to conform to the decision of the majority. But, as already observed, this is a provision specially ordained by the statute and not the judgment of a court. \"The county judge,\" if he is a court, is the court which is in possession of the appeal.\nIn the present case, although the judges of county courts who have been associated with \"the county judge\" to whom the appeal was made, heard the appeal which involved a very grave question of law, and although their decision was at variance with the opinion of \"the county judge\" who, upon the assumption that he is a court, constitutes the court in possession of the appeal, but is made to prevail, still such their decision cannot, as it appears to me, be said to be the judgment of a court of last resort created to adjudicate concerning assessments within the meaning of the Dominion statute. That decision, although made to prevail over the opinion of \"the county judge\" as regards the particular assessment roll under consideration, is not given any binding effect whatever upon a revision court in any other county nor upon \"the county judge\" in any other county to whom an appeal should be made wherein the same point of law should arise, nor even upon \"the county judge\" having jurisdiction in appeals from the Revision Court in the city of Toronto, who. as it appears to me, if the same question should hereafter arise before him upon an assessment under $50,000 where his judgment is made final, would not be bound by the decision the present case but might adjudicate in accordance with his own judgment unfettered hereby. And f he should entertain any doubt as the propriety of his doing so, he could prepare a case under the provisions of the statute and cause it to be submitted o a judge and eventually to the full Court of Appeal for Ontario, to adjudicate thereon, under the provisions of the statute in that behalf. The statute declaring the object of this provision being to facilitate uniformity of decision seems, I think, to show that the intent of the legislature in the directions for the publication and promulgation of such judgment was to compel conformity by all county court judges with such judgment, however imperfect the statute may be for securing such conformity. The provision shows, I think, that the legislature did not regard any tribunal in the province as a court of final resort for adjudicating concerning the assessment of property. The Court of Appeal was not, for it could only render a judgment on a case submitted at his pleasure by a county court judge, and for the reasons already given, the \"county judge\" assuming him to be a court, was not such a court.\nI am of opinion, therefore, that the motion to quash the appeal must be granted.\nSEDGEWICK J. was of opinion that the appeal should be quashed for the reasons stated by His Lordship Mr. Justice Taschereau.\nKING J.\u2014(Dissenting.) By 52 Vict. c. 37, sec. 2, an appeal is given to this court\n(j) from the judgment of any court of last resort created under provincial legislation to adjudicate concerning the assessment of property for provincial or municipal purposes in cases where the person or persons presiding over such court is or are appointed by provincial or municipal authority, and the judgment appealed from involves the assessment of property at a value of not less than ten thousand dollars.\nThe Consolidated Assessment Act of Ontario[22] establishes a Court of Revision for the trial of all complaints in regard to persons wrongfully placed upon or omitted from the roll or assessed at too high or too low a sum.\nBy sec. 68 it is declared that an appeal to the county judge shall lie against the decisions of the Court of Revision. Upon receiving notice of the intended appeals the county court judge appoints a time and place at which a court will be held to hear appeals, and notice is given to all parties to attend. The clerk of the municipality is appointed the clerk of the court, and in all proceedings before the county judge, under or for the purposes of the Act, it is enacted that he shall possess all such powers for compelling the attendance of, and for the examination on oath of all parties, &c., and for the enforcement of his orders, decisions and judgments, as belong to or might be exercised by him in the division court or in the county court. The decision of the judge is declared to be final and conclusive in every case adjudicated.\nWhere a person or corporation has been assessed to an amount aggregating $50,000, such person or corporation has the right to have the appeal from the Court of Revision heard by a board consisting of the judges of the counties which constitute the county court district, if the property assessed be in a county which forms part of a county court district, and if not, then by the county court judge and the judge of the county court of the county whose county town is nearest to the court house where the appeal is to be heard; and the said judges acting together have the powers and duties conferred upon and assigned to the county judge when acting alone under the Act[23].\nThe case before us is one where the proceedings were before a board of county court judges under the provisions last referred to. It seems manifest that what is sought to be appealed from to us is a judgment, and a judgment of a court of last resort created under provincial legislation to adjudicate concerning the assessment of property for provincial or municipal purposes, and the material question argued on the motion to quash is whether the person or persons presiding over the court (in this case two county court judges), were appointed by provincial authority within the meaning of 52 Vict. c. 37, sec. 2 of the Acts of Canada.\nThe answer to be given to this question depends upon the meaning of the word \"appointed,\" as used in the clause limiting the appeal to cases\nwhere the person or persons presiding over such court is or are appointed by provincial or municipal authority.\nThe judges presiding in the court in question had been by the Dominion Government appointed to their respective offices as county court judges of certain counties or divisions; but the court over which they were presiding in the adjudication appealed from was not a county court, nor were the proceedings declared to be as in the county court. A distinct court was set up with independent officers, and certain of the powers and authorities of the county court, as for example, for compelling the attendance of witnesses and for examination on oath, and for enforcement of orders, &c., are conferred upon the county judges when acting as judges of the court so created. The effect of this is that the county court judges act, not as such, but as person\u0153 designat\u00e6 Their being county court judges is their qualification. It is by reason of their being such that they are appointed by the provincial legislature to preside in the court created to adjudicate concerning assessments.\nNow it appears to me that the appointment that is referred to in the clause of 52 Vict. c. 37, sec. 2, already cited, means an appointment to preside over the court created to adjudicate concerning the assessment of property. The appointment of such persons to some other office, judicial or otherwise, by the Dominion Government is not a relevant fact at all, and indeed, appointment by the Dominion Government of such persons to a non-judicial office, would be quite as relevant as their appointment to a judicial office other than that of a judge of the court created for the purpose mentioned in the Act.\nIn the present case, where the court consisted of two county court judges, it is clear that no authority other than provincial authority appointed such persons to preside over the court. It is not necessary to say what might be the proper conclusion if the jurisdiction were declared to be a part of the ordinary jurisdiction of the county court. Nor is it material that, upon the view here taken, perhaps no case might arise where persons appointed by other than provincial or municipal authority should preside in such a court as that referred to in the Act.\nI think, therefore, that Mr. Robinson's contention is correct, and that the terms of the Act are fully met, and so the motion, in my opinion, ought to be disallowed.\nGIROUARD J. was of opinion that the appeal should be quashed for the reasons stated by His Lordship Mr. Justice Taschereau.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Thomas Caswell.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Laidlaw, Kappelle & Bicknell.\n[1] 11 Ont.

Is the judgment on such application a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d within the meaning of sec. 24 (a) of the Act?\nMOTION to quash an appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], dismissing the appeal of the defendant from the judgments of the Divisional Court and of Meredith J., respectively, which dismissed two appeals against the order of the Master in Chambers rejecting an application to set aside a judgment entered against him by default with costs.\nThe motion to quash the appeal was based on the grounds, first, that the order in question was not a final judgment within the meaning of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Acts; and secondly, that the order was made in the exercise of the judicial discretion of the court appealed from under rule 796 of the Supreme Court of Judicature of Ontario and was not appealable.\nLatchford for the motion cited Morris v. London and Canadian Loan and Agency Co.[2]; Martin v. Moore[3]; R.S.C. c. 135, ss. 24 (a) and 27.\nThe appellant in person contra.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This case is before us on a motion to quash, heard yesterday.\nThe respondent\u2019s action was begun on the 15th April, 1896, claiming possession, under a mortgage, of premises occupied by the appellant.\nUpon the appellant not filing any statement of defence judgment was entered against him on the 7th May, 1896.\nThe appellant then moved before the Master in Chambers to have the said judgment set aside and for leave to defend the action. On the 27th May, 1896, the master dismissed that application. The appellant then appealed from the master\u2019s order to Mr. Justice Meredith, who, on the 8th of June, 1896, dismissed the appeal. Then, a further appeal was taken to the Divisional Court and likewise dismissed on the 24th of October, 1896[4]. An appeal to the Court of Appeal met with the same fate on the 30th June, 1897[5]. From this last judgment the defendant now brings this appeal.\nThe respondent\u2019s contentions are that this court cannot entertain it, 1st. Because there is no final judgment to be appealed from, within the meaning of the words \u201cfinal judgment\u201d in the Supreme Court Act; and 2ndly. Because the judgment appealed from was an order in the discretion of the court, and consequently not appealable to this court under section 27 of the Supreme Court Act.\nThe respondent relies upon the authority of The Rural Municipality of Morris v. The London and Canadian Loan and Agency Co.[6], to support his contention that the judgment appealed from here is not a final judgment. That case, though not precisely a similar one, seems to strongly support his views. See Maritime Bunk v. Stewart[7]; In re Cahan[8]; McGugan v. McGugan[9]; Williams v. Leonard[10]. Gladwin v. Cummings[11] is more directly in point. But if there were any doubt on this branch of respondent\u2019s argument, there seems none possible under the other point, as to the judgment falling under sec. 27 of the Act, which prohibits appeals in matters of discretion. That an order of this kind is a discretionary order is unquestionable. I refer to the cases cited in Holmsted & Langton under sec. 65 of the Judicature Act, and under rule 796; also to Cusack v. London and North-Western Railway Co.[12], and to the cases cited in Snow\u2019s Practice of 1896, p. 584. The giving leave to appear or plead after judgment has always been treated as a discretionary order, using the word \u201cdiscretionary\u201d always, of course, as not at all meaning \u201carbitrarily;\u201d Nelson v. Thorner[13]; Collins v. Hickok[14]. I refer also to Mr. Justice Patterson\u2019s remarks on this point in the case of The Rural Municipality of Morris v. The London and Canadian Loan and Agency Co.[15] If the Court of Appeal had granted the defendant\u2019s motion, the plaintiff would have had no right to appeal to this court. Papay- anni v. Coutpas[16]. Now, if giving leave to defend is a discretionary order, refusing it is likewise a discretionary order. The appellant cannot contend that he has a right to have it reviewed by this court whether the judgment of the Court of Appeal was a right exercise of a discretionary power. That would be repealing the statute. It would be giving the right to appeal from every discretionary order, and the statute enacts that there shall be none, except in certain cases of which this is not one.\nAppeal quashed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Edward Meek.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Martin & Martin.\n[1] 17 Ont.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], declaring that the claimant was entitled to recover $1,366.10 and costs of suit from the Crown.\nA statement of the case is given in the judgment reported. It may be mentioned, however, that the claimant's office was established by resolution of the House of Commons of Canada, on the 28th April, 1880[2], which is as follows :\u2014\n\"Resolved. That as greater permanency in the personnel of the reporting staff would ensure a higher state of efficiency, the committee would recommend that six reporters be engaged and recognized as officers of the House, subject to such regulations as may from time to time be enacted by the Commissioners for the Internal Economy of the House, or by the Select Committee appointed to supervise the Official Report of the Debates of the House.\"\n\"That the staff so to be employed shall rank and be paid as follows:-\n1 Chief reporter, at a salary of.\n$1,500 00\n5 Assistants, one of whom to be qualified to report in both languages\n5,000 00\nTotal\n$6,500 00\u201d\n\"That the reporting staff be organized, and tenders issued for the necessary translation, printing and binding, forthwith; so that the several contracts may be entered into, and submitted for the approval of the House, during the present session.\"\nThe claimant was appointed chief reporter by resolution of the House of Commons on 6th May, 1880.\nThe respondent contended that the 51st section of the Civil Service Act did not apply to him as he was not a civil servant but an employee of the House of Commons, and his employment and service were regulated by the Act respecting the House of Commons[3] ; that he was not under the control of the Crown, but appointed by the House of Commons, and subject to be suspended or removed by the House through the agency of the Speaker ; that (in the Civil Service Act, sec. 51,) the words \" or to any other person permanently employed in the public service,\" should be read ejusdem generis with the preceding words of the section and meant some one of a like class with a deputy-head, officer or employee in the Civil Service of Canada,\" that is, persons in the employ of the executive government, not included in schedules \" A \" and \" B \" of the Civil Service Act, but permanently employed in the public service and entitled to superannuation under the Civil Service Superannuation Act[4],\u2014permanent public servants of the same grade, class or kind as those specifically enumerated in the section.\nHe asserted that he was not permanently employed in the public service but stood in the same relation to the House of Commons as the persons temporarily employed continuously in the Government service, referred to in section 11, and did not come within the definition of a permanent officer or servant of the \"Senate and the House of Commons entitled to the benefits of the Civil Service Superannuation Act[5],. or entitled to contribute to the superannuation fund.\nIt appeared that the Hansard reporters made an effort at one time to be placed on the permanent list, and for a few months deductions were made from their salaries for the superannuation fund ; but the decision of the Speaker of the House being that this could not be done, the deductions made were refunded to them. The claimant also contended that the words \"no extra salary or additional remuneration,\" in the section in question, have reference only to extra payments within the scope of the officer's duty or employment, and not for work and services done outside of his duties or to other charges ; that he had not been required to take the oath in schedule \"C\" to the Civil Service Act[6], as an employee4of Parliament, and that there was nothing in the section or oath of office making it illegal for a civil servant to receive payment from the Government for services done outside of the duties of his office for the Government, nor for the Government to pay for such services.\nNewcombe Q.C. for the appellant. The claimant was at the time of his employment, and when he performed the services in question, a person permanently employed in the public service, and he is absolutely precluded from recovering anything by the terms of the section quoted.\nHogg Q.C. for the respondent was not called upon by the court.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014This is an appeal by the Crown from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, by which the Crown was ordered to pay to the respondent the sum of $1,366.10 and costs of suit.\nThe action was brought by the respondent under a reference from the Department of Finance, to recover from Her Majesty the Queen the sum of $3,235.35, being the balance for work and services performed by the respondent and accepted by Her Majesty, which work and services consisted of the shorthand reporting during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894, of 13,599 folios of evidence in connection with the Royal Commission upon the liquor traffic in Canada, and for editing and preparing for the press the evidence so taken.\nDuring the progress of the work under the commission, the respondent was paid on account from time to time considerable sums of money, and at the close of the commission there was due and unpaid, as claimed by the respondent, for reporting work, the sum of $2,029.50, and for other work and services the sum of $1,484.35, making together the amount claimed.\nThe respondent was at the time in the employment of Her Majesty, as chief of the Hansard staff of reporters of the House of Commons of Canada, and his engagement to do the work above mentioned on the said commission was secured by the late it Joseph Hickson, who was the chairman of the commission. The-payments made to the respondent on account of the-work performed by him, were by the cheques of the chairman, but the accounts were from time to time returned to the Department of Finance in the usual course for audit, the money for the payments being supplied by the Government of Canada.\nThe Crown did not and do not deny that the work was done by the respondent and accepted by the Crown, but contended that if the Crown was legally liable for any sum, the respondent should be paid at lower rates, viz :\nFor 10 copies\n25 cents per folio.\n8\n20\n4\n15\nHis Lordship, the Judge of the Exchequer Court, decided upon the evidence at the trial, that the claimant was entitled to be paid at the rates claimed by him, and with respect to the other sums claimed, he allowed $105, and $93.60 for editing work, but disallowed the remainder. Certain other deductions were also made by the judge, the result being as set out in the following statement:\u2014\nTo total account for reporting\n$3,780 50\n\"amount for editing\n105 00\n\u201c \u201c \u201c \u201c\n93 60\n\"amount claimed for living allowance in paragraph 6 statement of claim\n1,036 00\n$5,015 10\nBy amount paid on account of reporting work\n$1,751 00\n\"amount of living allowance disallowed\n1,036 00\n\"cash from Finance Department\n28 75\n\"deduction of amount payable to other reporters\n833 25\n3,649\n$1,366 10\nfor which balance judgment was given.\nAs the judge of the court below has found upon the evidence that the respondent had been duly employed by Her Majesty to do the work aforesaid, and also held that the prices charged for the work done and accepted by Her Majesty were those claimed by the respondent, no question as to these matters arises on this appeal.\nThe Crown, at the trial sought to be relieved from liability to the respondent upon legal grounds, and urged that the respondent was not entitled to recover against Her Majesty, for the reason that he was barred in his action by the provisions of the 51st section of the Civil Service Amendment Act of 1888, 51 Vic. ch. 12. That section is as follows:\u2014\nNo extra salary or additional remuneration of any kind whatever, shall be paid to any deputy head, officer or employee in the Civil Service of Canada, or to any other person permanently employed in the public service. His Lordship the Judge of the Exchequer Court held against this contention of the Crown. That is the only point on this appeal.\nThe respondent's contention that he does not, as an officer of the House of Commons, fall under that enactment, is unfounded. But we hold, with the Exchequer Court, that the words \u201cNo extra salary, or additional remuneration,\" have reference only to payments which, if made, would be extra of those that an officer receives for his services within the scope of his ordinary duties, and additional to them. The Act intends that a civil servant who accepts an office at a fixed salary must not be paid anything extra for the duties of his office; nothing extra for that, nothing additional to that. But if he is employed anywhere else or for any other purpose than what can legitimately have been expected or intended when he accepted office, the Act does not say that he will not be paid for it. These are other duties, requiring other pay, other remuneration, not extra duties, not extra or additional pay. It is not an extra or an addition to his salary as an officer of the House of Commons that the respondent claims. And that is the only kind of claim that the Act prohibits.\nThe appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: E. L.

After his death the defendant became owner of the middle portion, the parcels at either end passing to the plaintiff, who continued to use the old roadway, as a winter road, for hauling fuel from his wood-lot to his residence, at the other end of the property. It appeared that though the three parcels fronted upon a public highway, this was the only practical means plaintiff had for the hauling of Ms winter fuel, owing to a dangerous hill that prevented him getting it off the wood-lot to the highway. There was not any formed road across the lands, but merely a track upon the snow during the winter months, and the way was not used at any other season of the year. This user was enjoyed for over twenty years prior to 1891, when it appeared to have been first disputed, but from that time the way was obstructed from time to time up to March, 1894, when the defendant built a fence across it that was allowed to remain undisturbed and caused a cessation of the actual enjoyment of the way, during the fifteen months immediately preceding the commencement of the action in assertion of the right to the easement by the plaintiff.\nThe statute (R. S. N. S. 5 ser. ch. 112) provides a limitation of twenty years for the acquisition of easements and declares that no act shall be deemed an interruption of actual enjoyment, unless submitted to or acquiesced in for one year after notice thereof and of the person making the same. Held, that notwithstanding the customary use of the way as a winter road only, the cessation of user for the year immediately preceding the commencement of the action was a bar to the plaintiff's claim under the statute.\nHeld also, that the circumstances under which the roadway had been used did not supply sufficient reason to infer that the way was an easement of necessity appurtenant or appendant to the lands formerly held in unity of possession, which would without special grant pass by implication, upon the severance of the tenements.\nAppeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, affirming the judgment on the trial of the cause in favour of the plaintiff with costs.\nThe action asserted a right of way or easement over lands in the county of Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, for the purposes of a winter road. Statements of the facts of the case and of the questions raised upon the appeal appear in the judgments of their Lordships Justices Gwynne and King, now reported.\nWade Q.C. for the appellant. As the claim is adverse to the true owner of the soil the plaintiff must clearly make out the existence of the right. He must show a strict compliance with the statute which requires user for the full period of twenty years next before action. Actual user within a year of the commencement of the action must be shown. Lowe v. Carpenter[1]; Wright v. Williams[2]; Earl de la War v. Miles[3]; Hollins v. Verney[4]. Plaintiff did not use the road for the fifteen months preceding his action; Parker v. Mitchell[5]; Bailey v. Appleyard[6]. His user was not open and as of right; Hollins v. Verney (4); Livett v. Wilson[7]; Gaved v. Martin[8]. A contentious user will not satisfy the statute; Eaton v. Swansea Waterworks Co.[9]. The interruptions by the locking of gates and erection of barriers across the way are acts showing that no right to use the way was acknowledged, and that if the way were used a trespass would be committed. Goddard on Easements (3rd ed. pp. 135-6 and 230-231).\nFrom the winter of 1894 until June 5th, 1895, the date of action, the obstruction of the way by means of the fence was submitted to by plaintiff, who thus abandoned any right he may have claimed and admitted defendant's right to obstruct the way. Tapling v. Jones[10].\nThe contention, that the way existed prior to purchase from the former owner of the whole tract, and that on the severance of the lots the way continued in existence and the prior user during unity of possession in the last grantor can be tacked on to the subsequent user, is not law. Easements are by their nature rights possessed by the owner of one piece of land in another piece of land belonging to a different person. If seisin of the two pieces be united in one owner the right must cease as an easement, for it becomes one of the rights of property to which all owners of land are entitled. The right is not merely suspended on union of seisin so as to revive again on severance of the properties, for easements have their origin in grant, and on severance the easements cannot revive without a fresh grant, and then the rights granted are not the old easements, but new easements. Goddard on Easements (3rd ed. p. 494). Sury v. Pigot[11]; Buckhy v. Coles[12].\nThe easement claimed could not exist as a way of necessity; Holmes v. Goring[13]; the tenement was not landlocked so as to imply a grant; Brown v. Alabaster[14]. There can be no distinction between an appurtenant easement and any other easement for all easements are appurtenant, and to claim an easement as being appurtenant is the same as claiming an easement because it is an easement. This does not help to ascertain how the easement was created or what the easement is appurtenant to. No easement or right passed to plaintiff by deed, for in it there is no mention of easements or appurtenances. An easement will not pass by deed to the grantee of the dominant tenement unless mentioned in the deed. Goddard (3rd ed. p. 128). Midland Ry. Co. v. Gribble[15].\nAn inchoate right which has not ripened into an easement will not pass by general words in a deed. Langley v. Hammond[16].\nIncorporeal hereditaments pass by grant, not by livery, and are to be distinguished from land the possession of which may be passed from one squatter or trespasser to another by livery and so make a claim sufficient to satisfy the statute of limitations. Hewlins v. Shippam[17].\nThis court may review the findings of fact in the trial court, where it is clear an erroneous view has been taken. Bigsby v. Dickinson[18]; Smith v. Chadwick[19]; McCord v. Cammel[20]; North British and Mercantile Insurance Co. v. Tourville[21].\nHarrington Q.C. for the respondent. We claim twenty years user and the benefit of the statute R. S. N. S (5th ser.) ch. 112, s. 27, which re-enacts E. S. N. S. (4th ser.) ch. 100, and corresponds with 2 & 3 Wm. IV., ch. 71, ss. 2 and 4.\nWith regard to the last interruption to which, it is contended, the respondent submitted for upwards of one year, it need only be said that the road or way was used in the winter time only, and for a limited purpose, and the necessity for its user after the year 1894 would not again arise until 1895. The year 1895 was the last one in which the interruption was made, and appellant could not be defeated by reason of submission unless such submission continued for a year after the winter season of 1894-95. The appellant enjoyed the easement for the year 1894, and that year is to be reckoned out of the statutory period of submission. The obstruction was really begun in January, 1895, as found by the trial judge. A cessation of user which does not exclude the inference of actual enjoyment is not fatal. Rollins v. Verney[22]. Gale on Easements, pp. 181, 182 (notes). Carr v. Foster[23].\nThe appellant cannot recover in any event, for in January, 1893, she brought \"suit or action\" against the respondent, whereby the \"matter was brought into question.\" Cooper v. Hubbuch[24].\nEven supposing that the respondent has not had the user required by the statute, still his right is absolute under the common law, the road having been used by the respondent and his predecessors in title continuously from, say 1891, back for thirty years at least. See cases in Goddard on Easements, p. 201, and Gale p. 177 (note). Before the conveyance of the lands to the plaintiff his grantors had, by continuous user, an easement as of right, subject to be defeated only by acts of interruption and acquiescence as specified in section 29 of the Act, while they continued to be the owners of the lots; and, inasmuch as they conveyed the lands after more than twenty years' uninterrupted enjoyment, the easement passed under that conveyance, and thereupon became indefeasible in the hands of the respondent. Kay v. Oxley[25]; Leonard v. Leonard[26]; Doe d. Pritchard v. Jauncey[27]; Staples v. Heydon[28]. The obstructions occurred subsequently, and, upon the authority of the cases last above cited, as an indefeasible easement had been already acquired under section 27, it passed to respondent and the interruptions are acts of trespass.\nThe respondent is entitled to the way in question as of necessity or as a way without which the premises cannot be enjoyed. There was no access to the wood lot except over the lands at present owned and occupied by the appellant. Having regard to the division of the land and also to the previous user of the road for the purpose of hauling firewood from the wood-lot to the homestead, the case comes within such cases as Pearson v. Spencer[29]; Bayley v. Great Western Railway Co.[30]. Indeed this is a much stronger case than Pearson v. Spencer (5), where there was merely unity of possession, but no necessity for the right claimed. See also Barnes v. Loach[31], per Cockburn C. J. at p. 97; Russell v. Watts[32], per Cotton L. J. 573, and Fry, L. J., p. 584. Polden v. Bastard[33]; Pyer v. Carter[34]; Thomas v. Owen[35]; Briggs v. Semmens[36].\nAs to the findings of the trial judge on questions of fact being conclusive, where the evidence is conflicting, see Webster v. Friedberg[37]; Metropolitan Railway Co. v. Wright[38]; Phillips v. Martin[39]; McCall v. McDonald[40].\nTASCHEREAU J. dissented from the judgment of the majority of the court but gave no written reasons. GWYNNE J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment recovered by the respondent in an action instituted by him for the obstruction by the appellant of a private right of way which the respondent claimed to have over certain land of the appellant as a winter road to a close of the plaintiff for cutting and hauling wood. The sole contention at the trial was whether or not the plaintiff had established a title by prescription, by actual enjoyment without interruption for the full period of twenty years next before the commencement of the action which took place on the 5th June, 1895. The obstruction of which the plaintiff in his statement of claim complained is thus alleged:\nThe defendant in or about the month of October, 1891, and on various other times thereafter wrongfully obstructed the said way by placing a fence or fences across the said way and has kept the said way obstructed by said fence or fences and she threatens that she will continue to obstruct the said way.\nAt the trial the plaintiff himself, giving his evidence on his own behalf, said that the fence was put up by the defendant in the fall of 1891 on the line between the land of the plaintiff and that of the defendant at the place where the plaintiff claimed right to enter from his land on to the way claimed on the land of the defendant. He said that the defendant thereby obstructed his right of way, and that in the winter ensuing its having been put up he asked the defendant to take it down, and told her that if she did not he would, and that she replied: \"You can take it down if you put it up,\" and that he told her that he would put it up; he then said that he took it down but did not put it up again; the defendant herself had to put it up again. Then, as to the year 1893, he said that he went with his cattle and was obliged to return, and that he was much inconvenienced and damaged, and he added, \"if I had taken the fence away I would have been sued.\" Then he said that he and his brother \"Nathan, in January, 1893, met the defendant at the place in dispute, and, in relation to what took place then, his evidence as given in his own language is as follows:\u2014\nI had just taken down the fence and was going home with a load of firewood; she said, who gave you leave to remove the fence? I said, I gave myself leave. She said, if you don't put it up I will sue you. I said, sue as quick as you like.\nPlaintiff's brother Nathan gave his evidence of what occurred on this occasion as follows:\u2014\nI was hauling with my brother across the way. We had reached this place on the way home. Defendant met us there. She said, who told you to take the fence down? He said, I gave myself leave because I have got the right of way to the road. She told him to stop hauling or she would sue. He said he would not. She said she would sue him, and she did.\nThe plaintiff then put in evidence a summons bearing date the 25th January, 1893, whereby the plaintiff was summoned to appear before a magistrate to answer an information and complaint of the defendant charging the plaintiff with having unlawfully, on the 16th January, 1893, thrown down and broken part of the line fence of the defendant. The plaintiff in his evidence stated that he attended upon this summons, and that it was dismissed.\nThere was then produced in evidence upon the part of the plaintiff two letters from the solicitors of the plaintiff to the defendant, the one bearing date the 15th November, 1893, and the other the 16th February, 1894, in both of which the plaintiff's solicitors on his behalf assert his right to the easement in question, but allude to the obstruction offered thereto by the defendant as follows: In the former letter they say:\nMr. Joseph Knock, of Second Peninsula, informs us that you have obstructed by a fence the road leading from his property to his wood and timber lands, a part of which said road passes over your land. And in the letter of February 9th, 1894, they say:\nYou will doubtless remember having last winter taken action before R. H. Griffiths, J.P., against Joseph Knock, of Second Peninsula, farmer, for taking down a fence which you alleged to be on your property, snd that after a hearing before said justice extending over a period of several days, your case was by him dismissed. As you are aware the fence in question was one erected and maintained by you across the road leading from said Joseph Knock's homestead property to his wood and timber lands and passing through your property. Notwithstanding that he is entitled to the free use of this road as well for the purpose of reaching his said wood and timber lands with teams, &c., hauling his winter wood over it, &c., &c., as otherwise, you have during the last two or three years, although requested and notified to desist therefrom, undertaken to obstruct and prevent him in the use of said road to his serious damage and detriment.\nAs to the winter of 1894-5 the plaintiff gave evidence that he had not used the road in consequence of the fence being still maintained by the defendant where it had been erected, for he says:\nThat winter I was obliged to go round the common and get bushes.\nThe defendant in relation to what took place as regards the erection of the fence by her, testified as follows:\nIn October, 1891, I put up the fence across the alleged right of way. In winter of 1892 plaintiff came to ask me if he might take down a length of fence to haul his wood. I said he could provided he put it up.. He said he would. I asked him how long it would take him to haul his wood home. He said three or four days. I said, then after you are done put it up for the winter, then in the spring put it up for good. He did not put it up. He did [not say then that if I did not take down the fence he would. I had a man to put up the fence in the spring. It stood until the winter and plaintiff knocked it down, and I met him. I asked him who gave him liberty to knock down the fence. He said, I myself. I said, you take the law in your own hands. I sued him for that and there was a trial and the magistrate dismissed the suit.\nThis suit was the complaint before the magistrate for trespass, which, when it appeared that plaintiff did what was complained of in the assertion of a right, the magistrate having no longer jurisdiction in the matter had no alternative but to dismiss the complaint.\nThe defendant's evidence was confirmed by her son-in-law, one Alexander Smith, and his wife, defendant's daughter.\nThe learned judge who tried the case gave judgment for the plaintiff with twenty dollars damages and an injunction restraining the defendant from continuing or repeating said obstruction, saying that he adopted the plaintiff's version of what had taken place between the plaintiff and defendant in the winter of 1891 and 1892, after the erection of the fence in October, 1891; but as shown above, while the plaintiff since that time has been always asserting a right to the way claimed, a right to remove the obstruction caused by the fence, all the evidence given by and on behalf of the plaintiff establishes the correctness of the allegation in the statement of claim which is made the very gist and cause of the action, namely, that the defendant in October, 1891, erected the fence which has caused the obstruction complained of by the plaintiff, and thereby wrongfully obstructed the said way, and has ever since kept up and maintained the fence which caused the obstruction. The erection of the fence in 1891 was a manifest obstruction and interruption of the right of way claimed by the plaintiff, and was plainly understood so to be by him. The continuance of it by its re-erection in 1892 after it had been taken down by the plaintiff, and the summons obtained by the defendant for trespass against the plaintiff in January, 1893, for his having then recently taken it down again, its re-erection and maintenance ever since, and the letters of plaintiff's solicitors made part of the plaintiff's evidence, show conclusively, as is alleged in the statement of claim, that in October, 1891, the defendant erected the fence, which is the obstruction complained of in the statement of claim, and has persistently maintained and still maintains that fence, and has thereby ever since October, 1891, interrupted the enjoyment by the plaintiff of the way to which he claims a right.\nThe question is not whether or not the plaintiff has abandoned a right of way which he previously had, but whether he has had the uninterrupted enjoyment of the way, to which he claims a right, for the full period of twenty years next preceding the commencement of this action, and that by the plaintiff's own allegation in the record and by his evidence given at the trial he plainly had not, however entitled he might have been to succeed in his action if it had been commenced in 1892 instead of in 1895. In that case the question would have arisen which need not now be entered upon, namely, whether the former user of the way claimed by the plaintiff was of right or permissive only. In the present action he cannot, in my opinion, succeed. The appeal should, I am of opinion, be allowed with costs, and the action in the court below dismissed with costs.\nSEDGEWICK J. was of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nKING J.\u2014This action which was commenced on the 5th of June, 1895, is in assertion of a right of way. The right claimed is that of hauling firewood in the winter season from a wood-lot belonging to plaintiff to his house-lot over intervening land of the defendant. Both parties derive title through Philip Knock who owned and occupied the entire tract for many years prior to 1858, and who in that year died, devising it in portions to his three sons, Edward, John and Henry. All the lots abut upon a public road, but Philip Knock, while in the occupation of the whole, was accustomed to use the roadway claimed for purposes connected with the convenient and practical use of it. The plaintiff in his statement of claim bases his right (a) upon lost grant; (b) upon immemorial usage; (c) as appurtenant; (d) upon continuous user for 20 years; and (e) generally under the provisions of chapter 112, sec. 27 of the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, 5th series.\nThe case was tried without a jury and the learned judge presiding came to the conclusion upon the evidence that there had been a continuous user of the way as of right for twenty years next preceding the action. He also found that\npractically the only way in which plaintiff can haul wood in the winter season from the land beyond the defendant's boundary, is across the defendant's land; that to get it off by the main road, it would be a dangerous operation by reason of the steep ground at that place.\nThe Supreme Court of Nova Scotia upon appeal (Mr. Justice Meagher dissenting) sustained the judgment, upon the grounds of sufficient proof of twenty years' user, and also of the way passing as appurtenant to the lots devised by Philip Knock to his son Edward, through whom the plaintiff claims.\nBy the Revised Statutes of Nova Scotia, (5 ser.) c. 112, sec. 27, it is enacted as follows:\u2014\nNo claim which may be lawfully made at the common law by custom, prescription or grant, to any way or other easement, or to any water-course, or the use of any water to be enjoyed or derived upon, over or from any land or water of Our Lady the Queen, her heirs or successors, or being the property of any ecclesiastical or lay person, or body corporate, when such way or other matter as herein last before mentioned shall have been actually enjoyed by any person claiming right thereto without interruption for the full period of twenty years, shall be defeated or destroyed by showing only that such way or other matter was first enjoyed at any time prior to such period of twenty years; but nevertheless such claim may be defeated in any other way by which the same is now liable to be defeated; and where such way or other matter as herein last before mentioned shall have been so enjoyed as aforesaid for the full period of forty years, the right thereto shall be deemed absolute and indefeasible, unless it shall appear that the same was enjoyed by some consent or agreement expressly given or made for that purpose by deed or writing.\nAnd by sec. 29:\nEach of the respective periods of years in the twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth sections mentioned shall be deemed and taken to be the period next before some suit or action wherein the claim or matter to which such period may relate shall have been or shall be brought into question; and no act or other matter shall be deemed to be an interruption within the meaning of this chapter, unless the same shall have been or shall be submitted to or acquiesced in for one year after the party interrupted shall have had or shall have notice thereof, and of the person making or authorizing the same to be made.\nThis enactment in terms follows the provisions of the English Act 2 & 3 Wm. IV., c. 71.\nThe state of the law thereunder and the various authorities were fully considered by the Court of Appeal in 1884 in Hollins v. Verney[41].\nAfter pointing out that actual enjoyment for the full period of twenty years may be established by evidence which falls short of proving actual user for the whole of that period without any cessation, the court say:\nIt is obvious * * that in the case of a discontinuous easement like a right of way, it is extremely difficult if not impossible, to say exactly what cessations of actual user are, and what are not, consistent with such an actual enjoyment for the full period of twenty years as the statute requires to establish the right. The statute leaves the difficulty to be solved in each case as best it may. * * * * The truth is that the question whether, in any particular case, a right of way has or has not been actually enjoyed for the full period of twenty years appears to be left by the Act to be treated as a question of fact to be decided by a jury, unless the court sees that, having regard to section 6 (as to presumption of law) and the other provisions of the statute, there is no evidence on which the jury can properly find such enjoyment.\nIt was held that while such an interruption as the statute defines, continuing for a year, is, of course, fatal, acts of interruption for less than a year are merely circumstances to be considered with the other facts of the case. So cessation of user for a year or more is not necessarily fatal, whether it occurs at the beginning, in the course of, or at the close of the twenty year period before action. It may be explained in a way that renders it consistent with an inference of actual enjoyment for the twenty years:\nAt the same time the total absence of user for any year of the statutory period will be fatal unless explained in such a way as to warrant the inference of continued actual enjoyment notwithstanding such temporary non-user.\nThis reasoning is applicable to the provisions of the statute now under consideration, and it only remains to apply it to the facts as proved.\nWhat has to be proved is an actual enjoyment by plaintiff claiming right thereto, for twenty years next before action brought, and without interruption submitted to or acquiesced in for one year after notice to plaintiff of defendant having made or authorized the interruption.\nIt is clear that there was sufficient evidence of user from which to infer actual uninterrupted enjoyment as of right for the full statutory period, provided the action had been brought in the year 1891; but it is contended that what took place between 1891 and 1895 excludes the reasonable inference of twenty years actual enjoyment as of right for the period of twenty years before the latter year, the date of the commencement of the action.\nAs to what took place prior to the year 1894, I am disposed to think that the conclusions of fact of the learned trial judge, fortified as they are by the concurrence of a majority of the judges of the court en banc, are fairly supported by the evidence given on behalf of the plaintiff which (for the purpose of this appeal) must be taken to be substantially correct. There was no interruption for a year, and no cessation for a year, and the user cannot be regarded as merely permissive, upon the hypothesis of the truth of plaintiff's account of it. But when we come to the year 1894, more difficulty arises. It is admitted that in the spring of that year the defendant put up a fence across the alleged way, and that it was suffered to remain undisturbed from that time until the commencement of the action in June, 1895, a period of about 15 months. It is clear that the plaintiff knew of the fence being there, and that it had been put up by defendant; and if, at the time it was put up, it constituted an act of interruption to plaintiff's claim of right, its continuance until the spring of 1895 would be fatal to plaintiff's right, as an interruption within the statute. But it is not possible to regard it as an act of interruption from the time that it was put up, because the winter season, during which alone plaintiff's right existed and was capable of being exercised, being at an end, the defendant had a right to put the fence there and plaintiff had no right to complain of it. It became an obstacle to and interference with the actual enjoyment of plaintiff's alleged right only when the next succeeding winter season set in, and its effect as an interruption began to run only from that time; and so there was not, at the time of action brought, an interruption in fact extending to a period of one year.\nBut there was, none the less, an entire cessation of user by plaintiff during the 12 months before action brought. This, of itself, would not be conclusive against the actual enjoyment for the twenty years before action brought, if there had appeared any explanation of the circumstance consistent with an inference, upon the whole case, of an actual enjoyment for the full period of twenty years next before action brought. But this total cessation of user for a full year of the statutory period is fatal unless explained in such a way as to warrant an inference of continued actual enjoyment for the twenty years notwithstanding it.\nIn Carr v. Foster[42], where the right claimed was a common of pasture, a non-user for two years was explained by the fact that the party claiming had at the time no commonable beasts, and the explanation was deemed not inconsistent with the inference of actual enjoyment of the right. This is said by the court in Hollins v. Verney[43], to be the strongest case in that direction In the present case the plaintiff required to use the way in 1894-95, and was, as he says, obliged, in consequence of the obstruction, to get bushes from a common for firewood. The evident reason for, and explanation of, the cessation of user for over a year was, of course, that the defendant had put up the fence. But the obstruction of the plaintiff's right, and his yielding to it, are not consistent with an inference of actual enjoyment as of right for the full period of twenty years covering such period of cessation. It is rather an enforced cessation which goes to negative the inference of a twenty years actual enjoyment next before action brought. It is true that the cessation for the twelve months covered several months when the way could not be used, viz.: during the summer season; but where a way is claimed for a limited period (as in this case for the winter season) the reasons explanatory of non-user must be germane to such user or non-user. For, as to the other portion of the year, there could be no inference drawn one way or the other from non-user, for nothing done or omitted during such period could be relevant to the question of actual enjoyment of the way during the portion of the year when alone it could possibly be enjoyed. There was, therefore, an entire cessation of user during the whole year preceding action brought, which remains unexplained, or rather, which is explained in a way that excludes reasonable inference of actual enjoyment for the full period of twenty years next before the commencement of the action. Hence the claim under the statute fails.\nThere remains the contention that the way passed to plaintiff's father upon devise of Philip Knock at a time when there was in him, as to the whole of the land, unity of possession. This is claimed as passing by simple implication upon the devise of the house lot and wood-lot, inasmuch as there are no words of grant, either general or particular, indicating an intention to pass things appurtenant or enjoyed therewith, but, perhaps, an implied intent to the contrary in the fact of the express inclusion, in respect of other lands devised by the will of rights of way.\nThen, as to easements by implication, Bowen L. J. says, Ford v. Metropolitan Railway Co.[44]:\nBy the grant of part of a tenement, it is now well known, there will pass to the grantee all those continuous and apparent easements over the other part of the tenement which are necessary to the enjoyment of the part granted, and have been hitherto used therewith.\nIt is not material whether the right claimed had its origin prior to the unity of possession, or was founded solely upon the manner of enjoyment of the several parts of his property by the person having unity of possession. Such modes of enjoyment, while not in the strict sense appurtenances to the land, are treated as quasi appendant thereto.\nThe rule above expressed as to the passing by implication of easements or quasi easements upon the severance of unity of possession is not entirely confined to easements of necessity and to continuous and apparent easements reasonably necessary to the\n[Page 681\nenjoyment of the part granted and previously used therewith. In Thomas v. Owen[45], Fry L. J. (speaking for himself, the Master of the Rolls and Bowen L. J.) says:\nBut then, it is urged that, alike in implied reservations and in implied grants, a rule exists to this effect, that whilst such an implication may arise in the case of easements of necessity and continuous easements, it cannot arise in the case of easements which are neither of necessity nor continuous; and, for this proposition, Polden v. Bastard[46] is cited, and many other authorities might have been invoked. But on this principle, as established by such decisions, there has been engrafted by other decisions an exception in the case of a formed road made over an alleged servient tenement to and for the apparent use of the dominant tenement; per Bramwell B. in Langley v. Hammond[47]; Watts v. Kelson[48].\nThe way here in question (notwithstanding the finding of the learned trial judge) was not what is known as a way of necessity. The land fronted on a highway which was a boundary common to all the parcels; there was no physical obstacle to access thereby and the cost of a new road would only be, as the evidence shows, from |25 to $100. Nor was it a continuous and apparent easement. Was it then, within the above exception, a formed road made over the alleged servient tenement to and for the apparent use of the dominant tenement? I do not think so. There was nothing upon the land to indicate its course and bounds. As a winter road it would for the most part be traced in the snow, and all traces of it would be obliterated with the disappearance of the snow. Being in no sense a formed road, and without the requisite characteristics of permanence and definiteness, it seems impossible to treat it (within the settled law on the subject) as passing, without any words of grant, but by mere implication, upon the severance of tenements previously held in unity of possession. Nor does there seem any good reason, growing out of the circumstances of the ownership of land in this country, for relaxing the rules as to the acquisition of rights of way by mere implication.\nThe result is that the action fails and the appeal should be allowed, notwithstanding the able judgements of the learned judges below.\nGIROUARD J. also dissented from the judgment of the majority of the court but did not state his opinion in writing.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Wade & Paton.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Owen & Ruggles.\n[1] 6 Ex. 825.\n[2] 1 M. & W. 77.\n[3] 17 Ch.

S. subsequently advanced the vendor a further sum and extended the time for redemption. The right of redemption was not exercised by the vendor within the time limited and S. took possession of the property, which was subsequently seized under an execution issued by V. a judgment creditor of the vendor. S. then filed an opposition claiming the property under the deed.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench, that as it was shown that the parties were acting in good faith, and that they intended the contract to be, as it purported to be, une vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9, it was valid as such, not only between themselves but also as respected third persons. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada ([1]) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court in favour of the opposant.\nThe material facts of this case may be stated, briefly, as follows '.\nIn 1894 the respondent, Vassal, obtained judgment in an action against a Mme. Planee and issued execution thereon under which the sheriff seized certain real estate and moveables in Drummondville as being property of said defendant. The appellant Salvas made an opposition to this seizure claiming to have acquired said real estate from Madame Planee by deed of sale executed in April 1893, and duly registered. The deed of sale is filed in the record, and by it Madame Planee conveyed to appellant a lot of land in Drummondville on which was a small house constructed and another building in course of construction. She also conveyed certain moveables, which are not in question on this appeal. The purchase money of the real estate was $300 and of the moveables $550 and the deed provided that the vendor might redeem the real estate by paying to Salvas the said sum of $850 within three months. He afterwards advanced to the vendor a further sum of $650 and extended the time for redemption for one month more, and subsequently granted her a delay of another mouth. The property was not redeemed and appellant took possession and leased it to one Hamel, but on account of this litigation he had to cancel the lease and pay $200 damages to the lessee.\nThe following is the text of the deed of sale of the 10th April, 1893, and of the deed extending the time for redemption of 8th July, 1893.

The Court of Queen's Bench reversed this judgment and held that the transaction was only a pledge to appellant without delivery or possession, under the form of a deed of sale (sous la forme d'unetelle.)\nThe appeal to this court was limited to the case respecting the real estate, the appeal as to the moveable effects having been refused At the argument of the appeal before this court, the good faith of the transaction and absence of fraud were admitted by the respondent.\nIt is proved and admitted by the appellant that he adopted the sale with facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9, as offering him a better security than a simple hypothec that his advances would be repaid.\nAt the time of the sale the real estate with the completed house, was worth from $2,000 to $2,500; some months afterwards, by reason of certain unforeseen events in the locality, the value was reduced to not more than $1200 or $1,500.\nGeoffrion Q. C. and Lavergne for the appellant. There has been no subrogation to the subsequent creditor, the respondent, and he has no right to demand that the contract between Madame Planee and the appellant should be declared void. Art. 1039 C. 0.\nThere is no fraud shown nor is it proved that the deed was fictitious and it should not be set aside. Salvas \"paid a full and sufficient price and notwithstanding indulgence granted to his debtor, the default to redeem made the sale absolute by lapse of time. In Bourque v. Lupien ([2]) in conformity with Rolland de Villargues and Laurent's opinion, it was decided that there being here no laws against usury in Canada we can stipulate for any rate of interest, that there can not be any question of presumption against the deed because there is no prohibitive law to be eluded. The Court of Review based its decision upon Franc\u00e6ur v. Biron, (unreported) where one of the parties alleged that the redemption deed was not a real sale but a disguised pledge, supporting his pretensions upon the meanness of the price and the want of delivery. The Superior Court was reversed in Review, but the Court of Queen's Bench established the first judgment maintaining the sale.\nIf the object was not actually put into the possession of the creditor, it was not a pledge. Arts. 1966, 1970 0. 0. The court cannot suppose that the intention of the parties was to make a pledge in the absence of delivery the essence of pledge.\nIn Church v. Bernier ([3]) the court maintained a sale where no delivery had been made. The present case offers stronger reasons to maintain the sale. By our law sale is perfected by consent alone although the thing sold be not then delivered. Art. 1472 C. 0.\nThe deed was made public by registration and the respondent was a posterior creditor; there was no fraud and the appellant acted in perfect good faith. Hunt v. Taplin ([4]) must be distinguished, for in that case the sale was only colourable. The cases of Rickaby v. Bell ([5]); Cushing v. Dupuy ([6]); Black et al v. Walker ([7]); and Carter v. McCaffrey ([8]) are evident cases of collusion and fraud. The case of Pacaud v. Huston ([9]) cited by Mr. Justice Hall is not at all similar to the present one.\nCr\u00e9peau Q. C, and Baudry Q. C., for the respondent. The contract made by Madame Planee bears marks of fraud; the price is so low as to cause that presumption and the simulation to a deed with right of redemption is evidently for the purpose of evading the Quebec Statute 55 & 56 Vict., ch. 17, sec. 1. See 16 Laurent ([10]); Bedarride Trait\u00e9 du Dol, etc. ([11]) and our courts follow this doctrine; Trahan v. Gadbois ([12]) * Wilson v. Mahon ([13]) ', Carter v. McCaffrey (6). It is a constructive fraud at any rate. The authors are unanimous in such a case in admitting a creditor, even posterior, in contesting the deed. Bedarride, Doll etc. ([14]); Marcad\u00e9 ([15]); Larombi\u00e8re ([16]).\nThe transaction was not seriously intended to be a sale, but was a disguised pledge, bad for want of delivery. See Black v. Walker ([17]). The transaction has all the defects mentioned by Bedarride, Trait\u00e9 du Dol, etc. ([18]); and Chardon Trait\u00e9 du Dol, etc. ([19]). Salvas made subsequent advances on the same security. It is only upon our judgment and seizure that Salvas claimed the ownership whilst the insurance was taken by Plante as proprietor at his request.\nThere is a resemblance between the transaction and the ''Contrat pignoratif,\" of the French law writers. In France, when the contrat pignoratif is usurious, the law declares it absolutely null and void, but when a deed of sale a r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 is declared a mere con\/rat pignoratif on account of simulation, but without usury, it is declared null as a sale, but stands good as a covenant for debt. Bedarride, vol. III, nos. 946, 947, 1181. Guyot Vo. \" Pignoratif.\" Duranton vol. 16, nos. 430,\n431. Dalozz \"Rep. Leg. Vo \"Nantissement \" Nos. 224, 233, 307, 314. Again in Dalloz Rep. de Leg. Vo \" Obligation,\" nos. 1035 and 1043, we see that third parties are always permitted to prove simulation in a deed which may affect their rights and interests, and that judges have power to decide that a sale a r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 is simulated and in reality nothing but a pledge. See also Gushing v. Dupuy ([20]); Gendron v. Labranche ([21]) per Casault J. at p. 92. The point involved was discussed and decided in our favour in Rickaby v. Bell ([22]); Pacaud v. Huston ([23]); Fairbanks v. Barlow ([24]); Hunt v. Taplin ([25]).\nThe deed violates the principle laid down by art. 1981 0. 0. that a debtor's assets are the common pledge of his creditors. The further advances, extension of time and so forth were illegal and never consented to by the vendor but by her husband alone without her authority in writing. The extension is not recorded in the registry office.\nThe Chief Justice. It is clear that no fraudulent\nintent to hinder delay or defeat the creditors of the judgment debtor can be imputed to the appellant, who paid his money in good faith. Indeed the Court of Appeal does not dispute this.\nThe question whether a particular transaction was a sale with right of redemption, or a c contrat pisgnoratif\" or an \" antichr\u00e9se \" all of which differ in their legal effects ([26]), must in every case depend upon the interpretation of the deeds passed between the parties and on proper appreciation of the evidence.\nConsidering the case in this way it appears to me free from doubt that the parties intended just what they have said in the two notarial deeds and that these deeds were not intended to disguise any other or different contracts from those expressed in them\nThis being sufficient for the decision of the appeal I need not say anything further.\nThe appeal must be allowed and the appellant's opposition maintained with costs to him in all the courts. GwynnE, Sedgwick and King JJ. concurred in the judgrnent of Mr Justice Girouard.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014Nous avons donn\u00e9 \u00e0 cette cause toute l'attention que son importance demandait, et ce n'est qu'apr\u00e8s m\u00fbre d\u00e9lib\u00e9ration que nous sommes arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 la conclusion qui suit. Nous avons s\u00e9rieusement examine les raisons qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 avanc\u00e9es \u00e0 l'appui de ce que l'on a appel\u00e9 la jurisprudence de la Cour d'Appel dans la pr\u00e9sente cause et aussi celle de Pacaud v. Huston ([27]), et Si nous avions le moindre doute sur le sujet notre devoir serait indubitablement de la confirmer; mais nous n'en avons aucun. Nous consid\u00e9rons que la jurisprudence de la Cour d'Appel est \u00e0 la fois injuste et contraire au texte m\u00eame du Code Civil. Cette injustice, M. le juge Ramsay l'a d\u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans des termes amers dans son dissentiment en Pacaud v. Huston (1).\nHis deed of sale \" disait il en r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 la vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 du cr\u00e9ancier \" is set aside and when he comes to the distribution of the money, he will have no more claim than a chirographary creditor. And all this shuffling has no other object than that. It is a false pretence on the part of the contesting party to say that he wants to leave him with his gage, the judgment to be confirmed robs him of his gage.\nM. le juge Plamondon, de son c\u00f4t\u00e9, qui avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 Pacaud v. Huston ( 1 ) en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, vient nous dire qu'il n'est pas convaincu par la decision de la Cour d'Appel, puisque dans la pr\u00e9sente esp\u0141ce, il decide comme dans la premiere. Il est evident que la jurisprudence de la Cour d'Appel n'est pas encore accept\u00e9e par le Barreau et le Banc de la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nA l'expos\u00e9 des faits qui pr\u00e9c\u0141dent, je n'ai qu'une observation \u00e0 ajouter et elle se rapporte \u00e0 la bonne foi de l'appelant. Je crois qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 finalement admise \u00e0 l'audience devant nous * elle est d'ailleurs incontestable. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure le jugea ainsi : \" Dans toute cette transaction,\" dit M. le juge Plamondon dans son jugement, l la bonne foi de l'opposant et l'absence de fraude sont \u00e9videntes.\" Le jugement de la Cour ( d'Appel ne contredit pas ce motif; il declare purement et simplement\nqu'il ressort des faits et des circonstances de cette cause que l'acte de vente \u00e0 facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 consenti par Dame L. Adoiphe Plante, autoris\u00e9e par son mari, en faveur de l'intim\u00e9, du 10 avril 1893, devant Mtre. V\u00e9ronneau, notaire, \u00e9tait un contrat de gage, sous la forme d'une vente, et que les pr\u00e9tendues vendeurs ne se sont pas d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9s ni des meubles ni de l'immeuble vendus.\nLe juge en chef Lacoste ([28]) admet implicitement la bonne foi de l'appelant.\nAinsi, dit il, un acte simul\u00e9, qui n'a pas pour objet d'\u00e9luder une loi et qui est exempt de fraude, doit s'ex\u00e9cuter comme les parties out entendu qu'il fut ex\u00e9cut\u00e9.\nPuis, le savant juge ajoute :\nNous aurions maintenu la vente si la contestation eut \u00e9t\u00e9 entre les parties au contrat.\nM. le juge Hall ([29]), est plus explicite :\nThere can be no doubt as to the good faith of the purchaser Salvas : he did not wish to buy the property, but would only provide the desired amount upon the condition of the title being conveyed to him, and he expected that Mrs. Plante would exercise her right of redemption, return his money and avail herself of the stipulated right of redemption.\nM. le juge Blanchet trouve la conduite de l' appelant pour le moins \u00e9trange ([30]); ii a des soup\u00e7ons de fraude, mais il n'ose le dire dans ses conclusions. D'ailleurs la preuve \u00e9tablit hors de tout doute que la transaction a \u00e9t\u00e9 exempt de fraude. Mme. Plante, la venderesse, n'avait pas de cr\u00e9anciers valant la peine d'\u00eatre mentionn\u00e9s, si ce n'est l'intim\u00e9 pour une somme de $200 pour mat\u00e9riaux fournis \u00e0 la maison en voie de construction, et ii fut tout de suite pav\u00e9 \u00e0 m\u00eame les deniers de l'appelant. Ce paiement aurait d\u00fb ouvrir les yeux de l'intim\u00e9 et le pousser au bureau d'enregistrement, qui est \u00e0 quelques pas de son domicile. Il ne fit rien et continua \u00e0 faire des avances de bois, s'en rapportant \u00e9videmment \u00e0 la solvabilit\u00e9 personnelle de Planee ou de sa femme.\nLes faits et circonstances de la vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e9tant \u00e9tablis, il ne nous reste plus qu'\u00e0 examiner les questions de droit. La vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e9tait-elle valide \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des tiers, \u00e9tant prouv\u00e9 et m\u00eame admis qu'elle fut pass\u00e9e dans le hut de mieux assurer le remboursement des avances de l'appelant? M\u00eame si elle n'est \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard qu'un nantissement d'immeuble, ce nantissement est-il parfait, et permet-il \u00e0 l'appelant de garder l'immeuble?\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a jug\u00e9 que la vente \u00e9tait valide. La Cour d'Appel \u00e0 l'unanimit\u00e9 ne voit dans la transaction qu'un nantissement d'immeuble, irr\u00e9gulier et sans valeur l\u00e9gale, puisque, dit-elle, il ry a pas en tradition de gage. C'\u00e9tait le principe qu'elle avait con- -sacr\u00e9 en 1877, dit M. le juge Hall, dans Pacaud v. Huston ([31]).\nPlus prudent que les hommes d'affaires l'acheteur qui n'est qu'un simple cultivateur sans instruction, demeurant \u00e0 25 ou 30 milles des lieux en litige\u2014qu'iI ne connaissait pas\u2014qui avait lhsbitude de consulter le notaire de son village dans le cours de ses transactions, s'est cru le plus s\u00fbr des pr\u00e9teurs. C'\u00e9tait en effet sa position \u00e0 l'origine, lorsque la vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9e et qu'il n'y avait pas de cr\u00e9ancier \u00e0 redouter. Mais voila que le vendeur fait des dettes; il devient m\u00eame insolvable. Des lors, d'apr\u00e9s la Cour d'Appel, la vente ne vaut plus rien et tout gage possible dispara\u00eet aussi, puisqu'\u00e0 ses yeux, il n'y a pas eu de tradition. L'acheteur est devenu un simple cr\u00e9ancier chirographaire, comme le plus impr\u00e9voyant des fournisseurs, par exemple, l'intime qui ne s\u00e9 donne m\u00eame pas la peine d'aller consulter les livres du bureau d'enregistrement. C'est bien le cas de dire, summum jus, summa injuria.\nPour decider la question m\u00eame vis-\u00e0-vis des tiers ii s'agit de rechercher non pas les motifs ou le but imm\u00e9diat ou ult\u00e9rieur ou les r\u00e9sultats possibles ou probables que les parties avaient en vue, mais la nature de la convention qu'elles avaient l'intention de faire et qu'en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 elles ont faite. Etait-ce une vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 ou un nantissement? Il suffit de poser la question pour la r\u00e9soudre. Ce n'\u00e9tait certainement pas un nantissement, puisque, s'ii faut en croire la Cour d'Appel, il n'y avait pas de tradition. Et pourquoi pas une vente? La tradition ou possession n'est pas alors n\u00e9cessaire Il suffit que l'acheteur ait fait enregistrer son titre contre des acquisitions futures. O\u00f9 est la loi qui emp\u00eache les parties de couvrir une avance, un credit, ou m\u00eame une speculation, sous la forme d'une vente d'immeuble, soit absolue, soit r\u00e9solutoire, comme une vente avec facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9? O\u00f9 se trouve ici la simulation? Les parties n'entendaienteiles pas faire une vente irrevocable, si le prix n'\u00e9tait pas rembours\u00e9?\nLa Cour d'Appel invoque dans cette cause la doctrine des commentateurs du Code Napol\u00e9on et la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise. Mais fussent-elles pr\u00e9cises et unanimes; s'appliquent-elles? Pour donner \u00e0 cette question tout le d\u00e9veloppement qu'elle exige, ii est n\u00e9cessaire de rappeler ce qu'\u00e9tatt l'ancien droit en cette mati\u00e8re et determiner le droit nouveau tant en France que dans notre province.\nLes lois en vigueur avant le Code n'offraient pas assez de libert\u00e9 pour permettre des operations de cette nature. Pour Ia vente ii fallait la tradition; l'acqu\u00e9retir avait aussi \u00e0 craindre la lesion d'outre moiti\u00e9. Puis le d\u00e9faut d'exercer la facult\u00e9 de rachat dans le d\u00e9lai convenu n'\u00e9tait pas irr\u00e9parable. Le d\u00e9lai pouvait \u00e9tre prolong\u00e9 par le juge et l'acheteur ne devenait propri\u00e9taire irrevocable de la chose vendue que par un jugement en d\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du droit de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9. D'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 l'antichr\u00e8se on le nantissement de l'immeuble \u00e9tait presque prohib\u00e9 comme suspect d'usure. On trouve dans Merlin, Quest. vo. Contrat Pignoratif, un plaidoyer complet sur le droit ancien. Il y enseigne que la vente avec facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 substitu\u00e9e en France \u00e0 l'antichr\u0141se c'est-\u00e0-dire, le nantissement des immeubles, qu'on ne pouvait plus y pratiquer ouvertement apr\u0141s qu'elle eat \u00e9t\u00e9 prohib\u00e9e par le droit canonique, et dans un temps o\u00f9 les juges ecclesiasticues connaissaient de l'usure. Des cr\u00e9anciers ne prirent plus de fonds en gage, avec pacte d'en recevoir les fruits pour les int\u00e9r\u00eats; ils adopt\u00e8rent le vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9, et comme aux termes de la loi romaine 87, la chose donn\u00e9e en gage pouvait \u00eatre lou\u00e9e par le cr\u00e9ancier \u00e0 son d\u00e9biteur ils relou\u00e8rent \u00e0 leurs vendeurs les fonds que ceux-ci leur avaient vendus.\nCes contrats furent nomm\u00e9s Pignoratifs, paree que la vente, qui y \u00e9tait stipul\u00e9e, n'\u00e9tait v\u00e9ritablement qu'une i pignoration d\u00e9guis\u00e9e. On con\u00e7oit que cette mani\u00e8re de violer indirectement la loi qui prohibait toute stipulation int\u00e9r\u00eats pour argent pr\u00eat\u00e9 ou d\u00fb\u2014l'argent \u00e9tant suppose ne rien produire\u2014ne manqua point d'\u00e9veiller l'attention des autorit\u00e9s. Aussi le Parlement de Paris rendit-il, le 29 juillet 1572, un arr\u00eat de r\u00e8glement par lequel il declare ces sortes de contrats nuls et usuraires. Cependant, les auteurs et les arr\u00eats sont unanimes \u00e0 d\u00e9cider qu'il fallait au moins le concours de trois circonstances pour que les contrats de vente fussent r\u00e9put\u00e9s de vrais contrats pignoratifs simul\u00e9s savoir la vilet\u00e9 du prix de la chose vendue la facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 et la relocation ou le bail \u00e0 louage fait au vendeur de la chose vendue.\nMais, continue Merlin, p. 309, quand m\u00eame il r\u00e9unirait les trois conditions, qui, par leur concours, faisaient autrefois, dans la jurisprudence de quelques parlements, consid\u00e9rer des actes de vente comme des contrats pignoratifs, il suffirait qu'il e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 dans un pays o\u00f9 le pr\u00eat \u00e0 int\u00e9r\u00eat et l'antichr\u00e8se ont toujours eu l'approbation des lois; il suffirait qu'il e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 \u00e0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 la facult\u00e9 de prendre des biens en antichr\u00e8se et de pr\u00eater \u00e0 int\u00e9r\u00eat, \u00e9tait l\u00e9galement \u00e9tabli dans tout le territoire fran\u00e7ais pour qu'il demeura constant a vos yeux, qu'on n'a point voulu, qu'on n'a pas Pu vouloir, dans ce contrat. cacher sous une forme licite, des conventions d\u00e9fendues; que ce qui est annonc\u00e9, par ce contrat, avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 stipul\u00e9 entre les parties, la \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9ellement, et sans aucune ombre, comme sans aucun motif de d\u00e9guisement; qu'on ne peut pas dire de ce contrat, aliud gestum, aliud scripta; en un mot, que ce contrat n'est point une antichr\u00e8se simul\u00e9e, qu'il n'est point un contrat pignoratif, qu'il est, et rien de plus, une vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9.\nLa Cour de Cassation, par arr\u00eat du 16 juin 1806, adopta les conclusions de Merlin :\nVu la loi 23, D. de regulis juris, la loi 1, par. 6, D. depositi; l'art. 46 de l'ordonnance de 1510; l'art. 30, chap. 8, de celle de 1535; et l'art 134 de celle de 1539; Consid\u00e9rant que le jugement du tribunal d'appel de Grenoble, du 11 pluviose an 12, en d\u00e9cidant qu'un contrat de vente sous facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 n'est qu'un contrat pignoratif, a d\u00e9natur\u00e9 ce contrat;\nQue la prohibition du contrat pignoratif, comme pouvant donner lieu a des int\u00e9r\u00eats plus forts que ceux que l'on retirerait d'une constitution do rente, n'a jamais eu lieu dans le resort du parlement do Grenoble.\nQue, memo dans les parlements qui avaient introduit cette prohibition. la relocation do 1 h\u00e9ritage \u00e9tait l'un des caract\u00e8res essentiels exig\u00e9s pour en induire une pignoration, circonstance qui no so rencontre pas dans l'esp\u00e8ce dont il s'agit;\nPar ces motifs, la cour casse et annule etc Voir aussi 9 Marcad\u00e9 et Pont, no. 1049 et suiv., 1215 et suiv.\nComment avant le Code du Bas-Canada une vente comme celle qui faisait le sujet du savant plaidoyer de Merlin, aurait-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 envisag\u00e9e par nos tribunaux? On ne trouve aucune decision de nos cours dans un sens ou dans l'antre, si ce n'est celle de Shaw v. Jeffery ([32]). C'est un fait remarquable one nos rapports judiciaires avant le Code ne font presque pas mention des ventes \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 on des nantissements d'immeubles. Il y a lieu de croire qu'apr\u00e8s l'abrogation des lois contre l'usure, une telle vente aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e valable, comme elle le f\u00fbt par la Cour de Cassation. Shaw v. Jeffery (1).\nLe Code Napoleon, et surtout le Code de Qu\u00e9bec, ont consid\u00e9rablement innov\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ancien droit en cette mati\u00e8re. La vente est parfaite par le seul consentement des parties, quoique la chose ne soit pas encore livr\u00e9e. Arts. 1025 et 1472 C. C. Faute par le vendeur d'avoir exerc\u00e9 la facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 l'acheteur demeure propri\u00e9taire irr\u00e9vocable de la chose vendue. Art. 1550 0.0. Les majeurs ne sont pas restituables pour cause de lesion seulement. Arts. 1001 1012 1413. C. C. Ces articles se trouvent en substance au Code Napoleon. L'article 1674 du Code Napol\u00e9on declare n\u00e9anmoins que la rescision de la vente d'un immeuble peut \u00eatre demand\u00e9e, s'il y a l\u00e9sion de plus de sept douzi\u0141mes dans le prix.\nQuant an nantissement des immeubles, les deux. codes contiennent des differences plus nombreuses et plus radicales. Le Code de Qu\u00e9bec art. 1967, declare que l les immeubles peuvent \u00eatre donn\u00e9s en nantissement aux termes et conditions convenus entre les parfies,\" et que les r\u00e8gles concernant le gage des meubles,. s'appliquent au nantissement des immeubles \" en autant que ces r\u00e8gles peuvent y \u00eatre applicables.\" Au. contraire, dans le syst\u0141me du Code Napoleon, le nantissement des immeubles forme un contrat \u00e0 part appel\u00e9 l'antichr\u00e8se comme dans l'ancien droit, (les vieux auteurs l'appelaient mortgage, 9 Marcad\u00e9 et Pont, 1056 1215), qui conf\u00e8re au cr\u00e9ancier des droits bien. diff\u00e9rents du gage. Le cr\u00e9ancier n'acquiert aucun droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou privil\u00e8ge sur l'immeuble m\u00eame, mais seulement la facult\u00e9 d'en percevoir les fruits ala charge de les imputer annuellement d'abord sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats et ensuite sur le capital de sa cr\u00e9ance. C N. art. 2085; 28 Laurent, n. 528. D'apr\u00e9s le Code Napoleon, art. 2078 et 2088, le cr\u00e9ancier ne pent jamais s'approprier le gage, soit mobilier ou immobilier * toute stipulation contraire est regard\u00e9e comme un pacte commissoire et absolument nulle; le cr\u00e9ancier ne peut que poursuivre l'expropriation du gage par les voles ordinaires. Beaudry-Lacanti\u00f1erie, dans son nouveau Trait\u00e9 du droit civil ([33]), observe que si en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 la convention que les parties ont voulu faire r\u00e9v\u00e8le le pacte commissoire prohib\u00e9 par l'art. 2088 on n'est plus en face d'une vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9, mais bien d'un contrat pignoratif.\nLa convention est nulle, ajoute-t-il; du moins elle ne peut valoir que comme simple contrat d'antichr\u00e8se. La vilet\u00e9 du prix de la vente et la relocation au vendeur sont encore ici les principaux signes qui trahiront le plus souvent l'impignoration.\nIl cite plusieurs arr\u00eats qui ont jug\u00e9 dans ce sens; mais ils n'ont aucune application dans le systeme de notre Code. L'article 1971 dit :\nLe cr\u00e9ancier peut stipuler qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9faut de paiement il aura droit de garder le gage.\nLe pacte commissoire est donc permis parmi nous, et dans le gage des meubles et le nantissement des immeubles.\nA ces diff\u00e9rences fondamentales ajoutons qu'en \"France les lois contre l'usure sont encore en force tandis qu'elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 abrog\u00e9es an Bas-Canada depuis pr\u00e8s d'un demi-si\u00e8cle. Ce qui est cause qu'en France les auteurs et les arr\u00eats sont encore \u00e0 la reclierche du taux de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat, de Ia vilet\u00e9 du prix du pacte commissoire et des autres indices du contrat pignoratif dans les ventes avec facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 et que si ces indices sont \u00e9tablis le contrat est d\u00e9ciar\u00e9 nul comme \u00e9tant en fraude de la loi. C'est ce qu'enseignent B\u00e9darride, cite par l'intim\u00e9, Duvergier et d'autres commentateurs, et ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par un grand nombre d'arr\u00eats recueillis par Dalloz, ([34]). Mais l'opinion de ces jurisconsuites et la jurisprudence de ces arr\u00eats ne peuvent faire autorit\u00e9 parmi nous, o\u00f9 l'usure, la lesion m\u00eame d'outre moiti\u00e9, le contrat pignoratif et le pacte commissoire ne sont plus reconnus comme moyens de nullit\u00e9 des conventions. C'est ce que l'arr\u00eat rendu sur le plaidoyer de Merlin que nous avons cite a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 pour le ressort du parlement de Grenoble o\u00f9 certaines lois prohibiiives du pr\u00eat \u00e0 int\u00e9r\u00eat n'\u00e9taient pas suivies ; et c'est aussi la jurisprudence de la Belgique o\u00f9 le taux de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat est libre au comme Canada ([35]).\nMais, dit l'intim\u00e9, l'acheteur n'a pas eu de tradition et n'a jamais eu la possession de l'immeuble. Supposons qu'il en soit ainsi. O\u00f9 est Ia loi qui exige la tradition ou la possession pour la validit\u00e9 de la vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 d'un immeuble? Le Code de Qu\u00e9bec et le Code fran\u00e7ais disent que la vente est parfaite par le seul consentement des parties, quoique Ia chose ne soit pas encore livr\u00e9e. (Art. 1472 C. C). Et l'article 1025 qui declare que,\u2014\nLe contrat d'ali\u00e9nation d'une chose certaine et d\u00e9termin\u00e9e rend. l'acqu\u00e9reur propri\u00e9taire de la chose par le seul consentement des parties, quoique la tradition actuelle n'en ait pas lieu.\nLe Conseil Priv\u00e9 a sembl\u00e9 conceder (sans cependant decider) dans la cause de Gushing v. Dupuy, ([36]) qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des tiers la tradition n'\u00e9tait pas une cause de nullit\u00e9 de la vente de meubles. A plus forte raison, doit-il en \u00eatre ainsi de la vente d'un immeuble qui doit \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9e pour valoir contre les tiers inscrits. Sans doute, le d\u00e9faut de tradition sera toujours un \u00e9l\u00e9ment important de Ia fraude Gushing v. Dupuy; mais hors ce cas la tradition n'est d'aucune importance m\u00eame vis-\u00e0-vis des tiers; parce que loin d'\u00eatre precrite par la loi, elle est d\u00e9clar\u00e9e etrang\u00e8re au contrat. Tout ce qu'il suffit c'est que la vente soit faite de bonne foi et exempte de toute fraude. La jurisprudeuce fran\u00e7aise s'est prononc\u00e9e dans ce sens par plusieurs arr\u00eats. Poteau v. Caillaut Cass. 23 d\u00e9cembre 1845 ([37]); Grassin v. Ravion 22 avril 1846 ([38]); Bont\u00e9Barbe v. Mazurier, 2 juillet 1856 ([39]); Mazet v. Barrab\u00e9, 26 d\u00e9cembre 1892 ([40]); Rougeron v. Chabot, 20 mars, 1888 ([41]); Lamoureux v. Sous-Comptoir, 13 juillet 1891 ([42]). Qu'il nous suffise d'attirer l'attention sur les motifs de ces deux derniers arr\u00eats Celui de 1888 d\u00e9clare :\u2014\nQue cette vente \u00e9tait exempte de toute fraude, mais que dans les circonstances o\u00f9 elle a eu lieu, Chabot, loin de soustraire le gage \u00e0 ses cr\u00e9anciers, n'y a eu recours que pour le leur conserver dans la mesure de ce qui lui \u00e9tait possible.\nPar l'arr\u00eat de 1891 la Cour de Cassation declare vu les art. 68 de la loi du 25 vent\u00f4se an XI et 1382 C. Civ. (C.N.); Attendu que\nla convention par laquelle lune des parties vend \u00e0 l'autre, sous condition de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9, une quote-part d'un immeuble, tout en lui conf\u00e9rant sur cet immeuble une hypoth\u00e8que pour s\u00fbret\u00e9 d'une cr\u00e9ance, n'est interdite par aucune loi; que rien n'autorise \u00e0 appliquer par analogie \u00e0 une convention de cette nature les dispositions do l'art. 2088 C. Civ., qui r\u00e9gissent exclusivement le contrat d'antichr\u00e8se.\nPuis les annoteurs observeront \u00e0 la note :\nLa jurisprudence et Ia majorit\u00e9 des auteurs consid\u0141rent comme \u00e9tant parfaitement valable, malgr\u00e9 l'art. 2088 C. Civ. dont les dispositions r\u00e9gissent exciusivement le contrat d'antichr\u00e8se, ainsi que le d\u00e9clare la Cour de Cassation dans l'arr\u00eat recueili au texte la convention par laquelle un d\u00e9biteur, en hypoth\u00e9quant des immeubles \u00e0 son cr\u00e9ancier, consent \u00e0 ce que les immeubles ainsi affect\u00e9s deviennent et demeurent la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de ce dernier \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de remboursement de l'emprunt \u00e0 l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance.

Comp. notre Rep. alph. v\u00b0 \" Antichr\u00e8se,\" n. 35 et suiv.)\nNos tribunaux ont eu maintes occasions de consid\u00e9rer les articles du Code an sujet des ventes avec facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 et des nantissements de biens, tant mobiliers qu'immobiliers. Comme cette cause ne pr\u00e9sente qu'une question de validit\u00e9 d'une vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 on du nantissement d'un immeuble, ayant en lieu de bonne foi et sans fraude nous devons \u00e9carter toutes les d\u00e9cisions o\u00f9 il s'agissait de transactions fausses on frauduleuses, par exemple Cushing v. Dupuy ([43]), et Rick by v. Bell ([44]), et m\u00eame celles qui, comme dans Hunt v. Taplin ([45]), n'avaient en vue que la validit\u00e9 des ventes on nantissements entre les parties contractantes on de choses mobili\u00e8res \u00e0 moins que les principes qui v sont d\u00e9clar\u00e9s ne soient \u00e9galement applicables \u00e0 la vente on an nantissement de l'immeuble vis-\u00e0-vis des tiers. Nous n'avons done qu'\u00e0 confronter les d\u00e9cisions suivantes :\n1er. Burland v. Moffatt ([46]).\nSemble\u2014The plaintiff, being a second purchaser in good faith and for value acquired a valid title to the property in question which he could set up even against an action brought directly by the creditors.\n2e. Church v. Bernier ([47]). Held, that although M. acting as agent for appellants, purchased the bark in his own name, and it remained in his possession, yet the whole transaction being in good faith and there being no suspicion of M's insolvency at the time of the transaction in question, appellant's right of property in the bark so measured and identified, was perfect without delivery.\nLe juge en chef Lacoste disait :\nSuivant l'ancien droit, ces ventes (de choses mobili\u00e8res) n'auraient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 parfaites sans d\u00e9livrance. Le l\u00e9gislateur a vu des inconv\u00e9nients graves dans l'application de la loi telle qu'elle existait, il a cru y rem\u00e9dier en d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant que la vente serait parfaite par le consentement des parties, non seulement entre elles mais vis-a-vis des tiers. Pour l'interpr\u00e9tation de cet article 1027, il faut donc \u00e9laguer la question de fraude.\nEn rendant jugement dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, le savant juge a exprim\u00e9 son \u00e9tonnement \u00e0 la vue de la decision de cette cour dans Hunt v. Taplin ([48]) qui n'a cependant aucune analogie avec le cas present, puisqu'il s'agissait de la validit\u00e9 d'une vente entre les parties contractantes. La Cour d'Appel avait jug\u00e9 que la convention liait les parties contractantes; mais la Cour Supreme renversa son jugement.\nCette d\u00e9cision, dit le juge en chef, bouleverse notre jurisprudence. Si cependant la Cour Supr\u00eame persiste il sera de notre devoir d'accepter sa propre jurisprudence.\nIl n'entre pas dans les attributions de cette cour de reviser ses propres decisions. On nous pardonnera si, en passant, nous signalons \u00e0 l'attention un arr\u00eat tout recent de la Cour de Cassation, rendu le 22 janvier 1895 Spezzechine v. Culot ([49]);\n10. La nullit\u00e9 d'une vente peut \u00eatre demand\u00e9e et prononc\u00e9e pour cause de simulation, \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l'h\u00e9ritier du pr\u00e9tendu vendeur, lorsque ce dernier \u00e9tablit, par des pr\u00e9somptions appuy\u00e9es d'un commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit, que l'acte de vente dress\u00e9 en vue de frustrer les cr\u00e9anciers de son auteur n'avait jamais d\u00fb recevoir, dans l'intention commune de ceux qui l'avaient souscrit et n'avait re\u00e7u en fait aucune execution\nLes annotateurs observent en note : La jurisprudence a quelque temps h\u00e9sit\u00e9 sur 16 point de savoir si la nullit\u00e9 d'une convention pour simulation de cause peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e par les parties contractantes elles-m\u00eames. La negative, admise par plusieurs arr\u00eats, s'appuyait sur l'adage : Nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans, et pr\u00e9tendait refuser d'une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u00e0 ceux qui avaient pris part \u00e0 la fraude all\u00e9gu\u00e9e le droit d'en tirer parti pour se d\u00e9rober \u00e0 leurs engagements.

Mais l'opinion contraire semble avoir d\u00e9finitivement pr\u00e9valu. (V. notamment, Cass. 19 janvier 1830, S. et P. chr. Lyon, 21 mars 1832, S. 32, 2. 391. Cass. 7 mai 1832, S. 36, 1, 574.

Les parties elles-m\u00eames peuvent donc se pr\u00e9yaloir de la nullit\u00e9 de l'acte simul\u00e9; et ce qui est vrai des contractants ne l'est pas moins de leurs h\u00e9ritiers, qui succ\u0141dent \u00e0 leurs droits et actions\n3e Pacaud v. Huston ([50]), d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par la Cour d'Appel compos\u00e9e de Monk, Ramsay, Sanborn et Tessier JJ., M. le juge Ramsay dissident.\nHeld that the deed of sale was simulated and void for total want of consideration and the property never passed under it.\nIl est \u00e9vident que cette cause n'a gu\u00e8re d'analogie avec celle qui nous occupe. M. le juge Sanborn, qui rendit le jugement de la majorit\u00e9, observa :\nAppellant appears to have had an intimate knowledge of his affairs, and there is much reason to believe that he considered him insolvent at the time. It is unnecessary to pronounce positively on this point to determine this issue. The first thing to be noticed as bearing upon the case, and in fact of determining the relations between appellant and Nault, is that appellant accepted a mortgage upon the property now in question at the same time as he took a deed. He could not really be at the same time owner and mortgagee of the same property. (La Cour de Cassation a cependant d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le contraire par arr\u00eat du 13 juillet 1891, cite plus haut). .. It is argued that this is a deed with a right of redemption, and that appellant became absolute proprietor till the right of redemption is exercised by offering him the money. This is not so. A deed with right of redemption is one where there is a price paid and the right of redemption is stipulated by the deed. See art. 1546 C. C. In this case no such right is stipulated, and according to appellant's evidence, Nault could not have the property back by paying the stipulated price $400, but only upon paying the $1,300 mortgage and the notes. There was in fact no consideration for the deed treated as a sale.\n4e. Bourque v. Lupien ([51]), o\u00f9 ii s'agissait de la validit\u00e9 d'une vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 entre l'acheteur et l'acqu\u00e9reur du vendeur, qui s'\u00e9tait cependant charg\u00e9 de ses obligations, Larue J., disait pour Ia Cour de Revision de Qu\u00e9bec c\nEn France o\u00f9 les contrats usuraires \u00e9taient d\u00e9fendus, et o\u00f9, dans le contrat d'antichr\u00e8se (c'est-\u00e0-dire de nantissement des immeubles comme s\u00fbret\u00e9 d'un pr\u00eat) il \u00e9tait d\u00e9fendu de pr\u00eater au-dessus du taux legal les auteurs enseignaient qu'un contrat d'antichr\u00e8se d\u00e9guis\u00e9 sous le titre de vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait rien autre chose qu'un acte pignoratif. 3 B\u00e9darride, no. 1179; Chardon, n. 512.\nLaurent, vol. 28, no. 543, apr\u00e8s avoir mentionn\u00e9 Que sous l'empire de la loi du 3 sept. 1807 qui impose aux parties l'int\u00e9r\u00eat legal comme limites qu'elles ne peuvent pas d\u00e9passer, ajoute ce qui suiit : 'Il va de soi qu'il n'est pas permis aux parties de faire indirectement ce qui leur est d\u00e9fendu de faire directement \u00e9luder la loi et surtout une loi d'ordre public Les tribunaux ont donc le droit et le devoir d'annuler pour cause d'usure les contrats antichr\u00e9tiques qui cachent des conventions usuraires, quels que soient le nom et Ia forme que les parties leur donnent Il r\u00e9sulte de l\u00e0 des difficult\u00e9s d'interpr\u00e9tation Ces difficult\u00e9s ne se pr\u00e9sentent plus d'apr\u00e8s notre l\u00e9gislation qui laisse aux parties pleine libert\u00e9 de stipuler tel int\u00e9r\u00eat qu'elles veulent. Il ne peut plus \u00eatre question de contrat d\u00e9guis\u00e9, puisq u'il n'y a plus de pro hibition \u00e0 \u00e9luder\nCes derni\u00e8res remarques s'appliquent \u00e0 nous qui n'avons pas de loi contre l'usure.\nChez nous Ia vente est parfaite par le seul consentement des parties, (C. C. 1025, 1472), et le r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 n'est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement stipul\u00e9 que pour donnrr une garantie plus s\u00fbre au cr\u00e9ancier qui a pr\u00eat\u00e9 son argent et qui ne veut pas courir le risque d'en perdre une partie en faisant les frais n\u00e9cessaires pour vendee l'immeuble en justice. Ce contrat est l\u00e9gal, pourvu qu'il n'y alt pas fraude, et cc, lors m\u00eame que le prix de vente serait bien inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la valeur de l'immeuble, car l'annulation d'un contrat pour l\u00e9sion d'outre-moiti\u00e9 n'existe plus\nLa cause qui a le plus de ressemblance \u00e0 Ia pr\u00e9sente est celle de Franc\u00e6ur v. Biron, jug\u00e9e par la Cour d'Appel en 1887, et non rapport\u00e9e. Franc\u00e6ur avait achet\u00e9 de Biron deux immeubles avec facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9. Le d\u00e9lai expire sans que Biron e\u00fbt exerc\u00e9 son droit, Franc\u00e6ur poursuivit le possesseur Gigu\u00e8re. Biron. poursuivi en garantie, all\u00e9guait .que l'acte n'\u00e9tait pas une vente r\u00e9elle, mais bien un nantissement d\u00e9guis\u00e9; il s'appuyait sur la vilet\u00e9 du prix et le d\u00e9faut de tradition. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a maintenu Ia vente. Ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvers\u00e9 par la Cour de Revision. La Cour d'Appel a infirm\u00e9 le jugegement de la Cour dc Revision et r\u00e9tabli celui. de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, qui avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que Franc\u0153ur \u00e9tait devenu propri\u00e9taire en vertu de l'acte de vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 et que ce droit lui \u00e9tait rest\u00e9 par suite du d\u00e9faut du vendeur d'exercer son droit de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9 dans le d\u00e9lai stipul\u00e9, et qu'aux termes des arts. 1549 et 1550 C. C. il \u00e9tait d\u00e9chu du droit de i'exercer\nEnfin, comment decider autrement en face de l'article 1027 de notre Code Civil qui ne se trouve pas au Code Napoleon, bien que le principe en soit reconnu par des commentateurs comme consequences de l'article 1583 C. N. (art. 1472 de notre Code), qui declare Ia vente parfaite par le seul consentement des parties, quoique la chose n'ait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 livr\u00e9e, 24 Demolombe p. 467. L'alin\u00e9a ler de l'art. 1027 dit :\nLes r\u00e8gles contenues dans les deux articles qui pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, s'appliquent aussi bien aux tiers qu'aux parties contractantes), sauf, dans les contrats pour le. transport d'immeubles, les dispositions particuli\u00e8res de ce code quant \u00e0 l'enregistrement des droits reels.\nEn supposant que la doctrine des auteurs et la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise seraient unanimes contre la validit\u00e9 de l'acte de vente \u00e0 r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9, \u00e0 titre de vente, comment en pr\u00e9sence d'un texte aussi formel peut-on decider que cette vente faite de bonne foi et sans fraude valide entre les parties ainsi que l'admet la Cour d'Appel, ne le serait pas \u00e9galement \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des tiers, simples cr\u00e9anciers chirographaires du vendeur? C'est ce que l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas m\u00eame tent\u00e9 de d\u00e9montrer\nNous sommes done d'opinion que l'acte du 10 avril 1893, consenti par Mme. Planee dans le but de mieux assurer le remboursement des avances d'argent que lui faisait l'appelant constituait une vente avec facult\u00e9 de r\u00e9m\u00e9r\u00e9, valide non seulement entre les parties contractantes, mais aussi \u00e0 l'\u00e9grard des tiers et que, faute par la venderesse d'avoir exerc\u00e9 cette facult\u00e9 dans le terme prescrit, l'appelant demeure propri\u00e9taire irr\u00e9vocable de l'immeuble vendu m\u00eame vis-\u00e0-vis des tiers et en particulier de l'appelant.\nCe premier point d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en faveur de l'appelant et\nsans contredit c'\u00e9tait le plus important\u2014nous consid\u00e9rons qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de nous prononcer sur le second, savoir Ia validit\u00e9 de l'acte du 10 avril 1893 comme nantissement d'immeuble, et particuli\u00e8rement la nature de la possession requise en pareil cas.\nEnfin nous sommes unanimement d'avis d'infirmer le jugement dont est appel, et de r\u00e9tablir celui de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure quant \u00e0 l'immeuble.

In the trial court the decision in favour of the defendant was based on the ground that the assignment had been made under pressure and was therefore valid.

Macdonald, (represented in the action, since his death in 1889, by the appellant, par reprise d'instance,) the plaintiff recovered $19,716 partly for a moiety of the balance of a judgment debt paid by him to the Merchants Bank of Canada for which he and Macdonald were declared to be equally liable, as between themselves as joint sureties by their indorsements on notes of the Saint Johns Stone China-ware Company, by a judgment of the Privy Council in 1883, ([1]), and a further sum of $5,234.10, amount of a dividend of 15 per cent on the full amount of the bank's claim against the insolvent estate of the com pany for which Macdonald had become liable on purchasing the assets by undertaking to pay, as part of the price, a dividend, at that rate, on the claims of all unsecured creditors.\nThe circumstances which led to the litigation between the parties may be briefly stated as follows:\nThe St. Johns Stone Chinaware Company carried on business in the Town of St. Johns, P.Q., and among the directors were the late Edward C. Macdonald, the said George Whitfield, Isaac Coote and James Macpherson. In July, 1875, the company made a promissory note for $10,000, payable on demand to the order of Mac donald, which was indorsed by him and by Whit field, Coote and Macpherson, and discounted for the company by the Merchants Bank at St. Johns. On 21st March, 1877, the company made another note for $8,500, payable three months after date, to the order of Macdonald, which was indorsed by Whitfield and Coote, and also discounted for the company by the Merchants Bank. On 26th March, 1877, the company made a third note for $4500 payable three months after date to the order of Macdonald, which was also indorsed by him and by Whitfield and Coote, and discounted by the same bank for the company.\nThe notes were not paid at maturity and were duly protested, and in December, 1877, the bank instituted an action in the Superior Court, for the district of Iberville, against Macdonald, Coote and Whitfield for the amount of the three notes, with costs of protest and interest. Whitfield alone pleaded, and the action was maintained as against him for the amount of the two last notes, the court holding that the bank had lost its recourse against him on the first note by delay in presentation for payment. The action was maintain ed as against the other defendants for the full amount. Whitfield had, in the meantime, instituted an action in warranty, against Edward C. Macdonald as prior indorser. This action was dismissed by the Superior Court. In the Court of Queen's Bench, however, on appeal, both judgments were reversed, the bank thus obtaining judgment against the three indorsers, Macdonald, Whitfield and Coote, jointly and severally, for the full amount of the three promissory notes, Whitfield's action in warranty being maintained, and Macdonald condemned to protect Whitfield against the claim of the bank. Macdonald appealed to the Privy Council, and his appeal was allowed ([2]), the judicial committee deciding that the three indorsers were equally liable, as between themselves, as the joint sureties of the company for whose benefit and accom modation they had indorsed. This judgment of the Privy Council finally established the position and rights of the indorsers as between themselves.\nDuring this litigation the company had become insolvent, as had also Macpherson and Coote, leaving Whitfield and Macdonald to satisfy the judgment in favour of the Merchants Bank. In the course of the winding up of the affairs of the company Macdonald purchased from the assignee all the assets agreeing to pay as part of the price a dividend of fifteen per cent on all the unsecured claims against the company.\nThe claim of the bank under its judgment as claimed by plaintiff amounted at the date of the action, in principal, interest and costs, to $34,894, and deducting $400 received by the bank from the insolvent estate of Macpherson, with accrued interest, left a balance of $34,350 as the claim of the bank. Whitfield paid the bank $29,740.50 which was more than sufficient to pay the claim of the bank less the fifteen per cent dividend payable by Macdonald, and instituted the present action, claiming $19,792.10, being fifteen cents on the dollar on the $34,894, which by the terms Of purchase of said assets Macdonald was bound to pay and which had not been paid, and $14,557.95 being one-half of the balance of the claim of the bank after deducting the fifteen per cent and the $400 received from the estate of Macpherson.\nThe defendant admitted liability to a certain extent for the principal debt, but denied the claim for the interest and costs and for the payment of the 15 per cent dividend, claiming that he had finally settled with the bank for all claims they held against him by an agreement made on the 12th October, 1878. The agreement contained a clause to the effect that the bank reserved its rights against all other parties, except Macdonald, liable on the notes made by the company as indorsers, and specially declared that it gave no warranty against claims Whitfield or others might seek to enforce against Macdonald by reason of the exercise of the recourse reserved. After the filing of defendant's pleas the plaintiff took action against the bank en garantie asking to have the bank made a party to the cause to warrant him against the consequences which might result from the dealings with the defen dant disclosed by the pleas. The cases were united and tried together, the judgment in the trial court being as above stated. The Court of Queen's Bench affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court, and from this latter judgment Macdonald appeals to have the judgment against him set aside, so far as it decreed payment of the dividend, Whitfield also appealing on the ground that his action in warranty against the bank was justified and consequently he should not have been mulcted with costs.\nMacdonald v. Whitfield. Geoffrion Q.C., and Fleet for the appellant. The settlement made with the bank by Macdonald not only released him but all other co sureties as well and had the effect of satisfying the bank's judgment against the indorsers of the notes. The judgment consequently was discharged by the payment of the consideration mentioned in the deed of release and if the respondent for any cause saw fit afterwards to make a payment thereon to the bank he did so at his own risk and can have no recourse in any event for the 15 per cent dividend. Possibly the Privy Council judgment is conclusive as to the balance.\nHis suretyship was at an end, for the creditor had by the deed extinguished the power of subrogation Art. 1959 C. C.\nUnder any circumstances there could be no reservation of recourse against co-sureties as to the amount of the 15 per cent dividend, for which there had been novation by the bank's concurrence in the sale of the insolvent company's estate on those terms, thereby accepting a new obligation to the extent of the pro missed dividend. Abbott Q.C., and Taylor for the respondent. The reservation in the deed still left the appellant Macdonald responsible for his share of all payments eligible from his co-sureties by the exercise of the re course which the bank specially retained. It was impossible for the co-surety to claim any benefit for the amount of the 15 per cent dividend which the bank has in fact never received, consequently leaving that amount still exigible although funds were in Macdonald's hands specially applicable towards payment of the creditor to that extent on account of their mutual debt.\nWhitfield v. The Merchants Bank. Taylor for the appellant. If we succeed in having the appeal by Macdonald dismissed the present appeal is merely as to the question of costs. We contend that instead of contesting our action en garantie the bank ought to have made common cause with us against Macdonald by becoming a party to our action against him. We were entitled to have them in the suit as warrantors. Archbald v. deLisle ([3]). We consequently ought not to pay costs.\nAbbott Q.C. for the respondent. The relations between the co-sureties amongst themselves in this case result from the provisions of article 1156 C. C. and can have no possible effect upon the bank which is fully pro tected in the deed as to recourse and by the absence of any warranty. As to costs the court below has followed Archbald v. deLisle (1). It would have been improper for the bank to come into the original action and admit a warranty which did not exist in fact.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014These two cases are separate appeals from a judgment applying to both the actions. I am of opinion that this judgment was in all respects free from error and must consequently be affirmed.\nWhitfield was never a party to any arrangement or convention which in any way prejudiced his right to contribution from his co-surety Macdonald, and there was therefore no defence to his action to compel Macdonald to indemnify him to the extent of a moiety of the amount paid by him to the bank.\nAs regards the sum of $5,234.10 it is clear that that amount ought to have been paid over by Macdonald to the bank and applied in part payment of the amount due upon the three promissory notes. Under the arrangement by which Macdonald became the pur chaser of the assets of the principal debtor\u2014the China-ware Company\u2014as embodied in the notarial deed of 4th March, 1878, this amount of $5,234.10 being 15 cents in the dollar on the amount of the debt to the bank, was part of the purchase money realized by the sale of the assets of the company, the principal debtor, and as such must be considered as funds in the hands of Macdonald, lodged with him by the principal debtor for payment to the creditor.\nIt cannot be successfully contended that in point of law one of two co-sureties who has in his hands moneys of the principal debtor, deposited with him for the express purpose of paying the creditor, cannot be compelled by the other co-surety to pay such money to the creditor, or if the latter has already been paid by the surety seeking relief, then to pay over the amount to the latter. Then this is all the judgment decrees.\nThe action in guarantee brought by Whitfield against, the bank had no legal foundation whatever, inasmuch as the bank had manifestly entered into no agreement which created an obligation in guarantee towards Whitfield. The action was therefore properly dismissed. Both appeals are dismissed with costs.\nGwynne, Sedgewick and King JJ. concurred.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014From the admissions of the parties of the 7th of May, 1894, I find that the respondent, Whitfield, paid to the bank, at various times, from the 6th of August, 1885 to the 8th of May, 1889, a total sum of $36,534.19, for one-half of which the appellant was liable to him as co-surety, altogether $18,267.09\u00bd. But this sum included some costs incurred by Whitfield and more than two years' interest accrued from the day of the institution of the action to the day of the last payment in 1889, and consequently the trial judge fixed the amount paid by Whitfield to the bank at $34,288, or $17,144.35 for Macdonald's one-half, with interest from the day of the institution of the action. Adding to that amount $2,571.65, being one half of the dividend of $5,143.30, which the insolvent estate of the principal debtor, the St. Johns Stone Chinaware Company, realized, as admitted by both parties, and which Edward C. Macdonald undertook to pay as purchaser of the estate, but did not in fact pay, I find, although by a different process of calculation, that the total amount due by the heirs of the said Edward C. Macdonald to Whitfield, in consequence of his co-surety ship and purchase of said insolvent estate, is exactly the amount which they were condemned to pay, namely $19,716.00, with interest as mentioned in the judgment. The bank not having received more than its due the action en garantie was also rightly dis missed, I am therefore of opinion that both appeals should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for Macdonald: Robertson, Fleet & Falconer.\nSolicitors for Whitfield: Taylor & Buchan.\nSolicitors for The Merchants Bank of Canada: Abbotts, Campbell & Meredith.\n[1] Macdonald v.

The questions raised in the present action differ from any which have been before the court in the various actions heretofore passed upon under the drainage clauses of the Municipal Acts of the Province of Ontario. Upon the 14th of October, 1881, the corporation of the township of Chatham, professing to act under the provisions of the drainage clauses of ch. 174 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario of 1877, passed a by-law for the construction of a drain along the northerly or Sombra side of the town line, between Sombra and Chatham, from the north branch of the River Sydenham on the east to a stream called the Channel \u00c9cart\u00e9 on the west, according to a plan and specifications which were mentioned in the by-law, which was entitled:\nA by-law to provide for draining parts of the township of Chatham by the construction of the Whitebread drain, and for borrowing on the credit of the municipality the sum of $6,109 for completing the same.\nThis sum was the contribution of the municipality of the township of Chatham and of the owners of lands therein to the construction of the drain. The municipality of the township of Sombra and the owners of land therein contributed the sum of $6,042, which sum was raised by the township of Sombra and was paid over to the municipal corporation of the township of Chatham. By the by-law it was enacted that one W.G. McGeorge should be, and he was by the by-law, appointed commissioner of the township of Chatham to let the contract for constructing the said drain and works connected therewith by public sale to the lowest bidder (not exceeding the estimates), but that every such contractor with good and sufficient sureties should be required forthwith to enter into bonds for the due performance and completion of his contract according to said plans and specifications and within the time mentioned in such bond (unless otherwise ordered by the council) and that it should be the duty of the said commissioner to cause the said drain and works connected therewith to be made and constructed in accordance with such plans and specifications and not later than the 31st day of December, 1881, (unless otherwise ordered by the council), and it was enacted that the drain when completed should be kept in repair by the municipality of the township of Chatham, and at the joint expense of the municipality of the township of Sombra and of the lands in the said municipalities assessed for the construction of the drain, said municipalities and said lands paying in the same relative proportion as for construction.\nThe township of Chatham lies immediately south of the township of Sombra, and is a very low lying marshy township, the lands therein being lower than the township of Sombra, and so the natural fall and drainage of all water in Sombra flowing southerly is into the township of Chatham, where, by reason of that township being so low, there was a difficulty in providing an outlet for water flowing in and through it. Prior to the passing of the above by-law for the construction of the Whitebread drain there had been constructed in Sombra in the years 1876, 1878 and 1879, three drains, known as Grape run or Government drain No. 1, which was in a natural watercourse from 10 to 15 rods wide, the Pacific drain and Buckingham drain, which, after crossing the town line between Sombra and Chatham had their outlet in Chatham and there discharged their waters brought from various parts of Sombra; and the object of the said Whitebread drain was, and the scheme for the construction thereof as adopted by the above by-law was designed, for the purpose of cutting off all waters coming down from Sombra into Chatham by the said three drains so as aforesaid constructed, and in fact of preventing any water whatever from flowing either naturally or by artificial means from Sombra into Chatham. Now, this having been the object of the drain the township of Chatham appears to have been mainly interested in its construction and the corporation of that township having been the devisers and originators of the work, and having charge of its construction, must be held to have been bound to take care in its construction that the three drains above mentioned which had been previously constructed by the township of Sombra should not be cut off and their waters let into the Whitebread drain until it should be so constructed as to be able to carry off into the River Sydenham on the one side and into the Channel \u00c9cart\u00e9 on the other all water coming down those drains into the Whitebread drain, the waters in which when completed were, by the scheme designed, to have a continuous easterly to westerly flow at the rate of from two to three miles per hour. In the month of November, 1887, the present appellants commenced an action in the High Court of Justice in Ontario against the respondents, the corporation of the township of Chatham and, therein, after alleging the passing of the said by-law by that corporation and that they had commenced to construct the drain but had never yet completed it, and that they had proceeded so negligently and unskilfully in what work they did in the premises that while they dammed up the said three drains and let their waters into sections of the new Whitebread drain which they were constructing before that drain had been so constructed as to be able to carry such waters to the Sydenham River on the one side, or to the Channel \u00c9cart\u00e9 on the other, whereby the waters coming down the said three drains respectively, having no outlet, were forced back, and were still kept forced back, and the waters of some or one of them overflowed on to the land of the plaintiff Murphy, in the statement of claim mentioned and on to the roads of the municipality of Sombra to the damage of the said Murphy, and of the said municipality respectively, and they prayed\nthat the defendants, the corporation of Chatham, might be restrained by injunction from interfering with or stopping up the outlets of the said three drains so as aforesaid previously constructed in Sombra, or any of them, and from causing the waters coming down by them to be penned back and thrown upon the roads and lands of the plaintiffs, and that the defendants in the action should be ordered to complete the said drain in accordance with the provisions of the said by-law, and that the said defendants should be ordered to pay to the plaintiffs and each of them damages for the wrongful acts complained of, and the costs for the action, and for further relief.\nThe defendants in their statement of defence to that action insisted that the drain was completed from end to end, from the River Sydenham to the Channel \u00c9cart\u00e9, in accordance with the provisions of the said by-law of the said defendants in that behalf,\nthe earth excavated therefrom being placed (as they alleged) upon the town line, forming thereby a road and preventing the waters of Sombra from flowing upon the lands in Chatham, as it was intended to do. They alleged further, that the drain did not at any point intersect the township of Chatham, or receive or carry any water from the lands of Chatham, and that it only benefited the lands and roads in the township of Chatham by cutting off and carrying away waters brought down from Sombra upon the lands and roads in Chatham, and they denied that the plaintiffs or either of them had sustained any damage through any defect in the construction of the drain, or negligence on the defendants\u2019 part, and finally, they submitted that having, as they alleged they had, constructed said work under the authority of the said by-law, the plaintiffs if entitled to any relief whatever, should seek the same by arbitration under the provisions of the Acts in that behalf. In this statement of defence the plaintiffs joined issue and the case came down for trial in the month of April, 1888. The only issues to be tried were whether or not the plaintiffs, or either of them had received damage caused as they alleged by the wrongful, unskilful and negligent conduct of the defendants in the construction of the drain, and by suffering the waters coming down from Sombra in the said three drains constructed in Sombra, or in any of them, to be penned back and let into the new drain before that drain had been constructed so as to carry off such waters to the River Sydenham or Channel \u00c9cart\u00e9 as designed by the by\u2011law, and whether the said drain had never yet been completed, as alleged by the plaintiffs. The learned judge who tried these issues after a long and exhaustive trial, found among other matters of facts as follows:\n2nd. That the said Whitebread drain was negligently, unskilfully and improperly constructed and does not accomplish what it was intended for, but on the contrary by reason of such negligent, unskilful and improper construction the waters which have a natural flow from and off Sombra into Chatham were prevented from passing off and are forced back and overflow lands in Sombra, amongst those of the plaintiff Murphy. 3rd. That prior to the construction of the said drain there were and still are three other drains running in a southerly direction through Sombra into Chatham, known as Government drain No. 1, Pacific drain, and Buckingham drain, across which three drains the Whitebread drain has been dug and constructed on the county line between the two townships of Sombra and Chatham, whereby the original outlets of the above mentioned three drains have been stopped and the waters coming down the same made to flow into the Whitebread drain which I find has not sufficient capacity in its unfinished state to carry off said waters, whereby and by reason whereof the said waters are made to flow back on the Sombra lands, and among them on the lands of the plaintiff Murphy, as well as the roadways in Sombra.\n4th. The said Whitebread drain was never completed according to the original plans and specifications, owing to the negligence of the defendants or those employed by them to do and perform and superintend the work, and has been left in such a state of incompleteness that the waters which flow into the same do not wholly flow out but back up and flow over the lands in Sombra, to the damage of the plaintiffs.\n5th. That there was undue and unnecessary delay in the construction of the said drain, the same having been allowed to extend over several years, during which the ratepayers in Sombra and among them the plaintiff Murphy, were greatly injured pecuniarily by reason of the said Government drain, the Pacific drain, and the Buckingham drain being stopped during all that time, thereby preventing the waters of Sombra flowing away as they would have done, and of right should have done had it not been for the unskilful and negligent manner of constructing the said Whitebread drain.\n6th. The learned judge found further, as matter of fact, that the proper bed of the Whitebread drain is indicated by the red line on the plan prepared by Mr. John Jones, Civil Engineer and P.L.S., put in by the plaintiff and marked exhibit 7.\nAnd he ordered that judgment should be entered for the plaintiffs, and he assessed the damages sustained by the plaintiff Murphy by reason of the negligence of the defendants in the premises at the sum of $150, and he ordered that judgment for that sum with full costs of suit should be entered against the defendants. And he further ordered that the defendants be required to complete the said drain within the period of twelve calendar months in accordance with said plan marked exhibit 7. And the learned judge further found that the amount assessed for and levied for the construction of the said drain and paid for by several ratepayers in Sombra and Chatham who were liable to be assessed for the same, was sufficient to complete the said drain as originally intended, and would have done so had the construction thereof been properly attended to and managed by the defendants, and he therefore ordered and declared that the plaintiffs were entitled to a declaration that the said drain be properly and efficiently completed as aforesaid, at the proper costs and charges of the defendants, and not at the cost and charges of those of the ratepayers who had already by special assessment, as aforesaid, contributed funds sufficient to have so constructed the same, with liberty to the plaintiffs to move if the same be not completed within the said period of twelve months.\nIn pursuance of these findings and directions of the learned trial judge, formal judgment was pronounced by the court in which the said action was pending whereby it was ordered and adjudged by the court:\n1st. That the defendants do forthwith pay to the plaintiff Peter Murphy the sum of $150 for his damages in respect of the injuries complained of by him in the proceedings mentioned.\n2nd. That the defendants do within one year from the 23rd day of October, 1888, complete the Whitebread drain in the pleadings mentioned, to the width and depth and in the manner provided by the plans and specifications upon which the said work was undertaken, the depth being that indicated by the red line on the plan prepared by John Jones, provincial land surveyor, put in by the plaintiffs at the trial and numbered Exhibit 7, and with proper and sufficient outlets to carry off the waters which enter the same from time to time.\n3rd. That the amount provided for by the by-law for the construction of the said Whitebread drain, and which came to the hands of the defendants, was sufficient to complete the said drain in accordance with the said plans and specifications, and would have so completed the same but for the want of skill, negligence and unnecessary delay of the defendants in proceeding with and carrying on the work, and the court did order and adjudge that the works necessary to the completing the drain as ordered in paragraph 2, be defrayed by the defendants, and that they should not be at liberty to levy or assess the same, or any part thereof, as a special rate against the lands and roads by the said by-law assessed for the cost of the construction of the said drain.\n4th. And the court further ordered and adjudged that the defendants do pay to the plaintiffs their costs of the action after taxation thereof.\n5th. And the court further ordered and adjudged that the plaintiffs, in addition to any other remedy to which they might be entitled, should be at liberty in the event of the defendants failing to complete the said drain as directed by paragraph 2, within the time thereby limited to apply to the court for such other relief in the premises as the plaintiffs might be entitled unto.\nFrom this judgment the defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nThat court regarded the claim of the plaintiff Murphy in the action to be one merely for the damages alleged to have been sustained by him by the alleged wrongful, unskilful and negligent conduct of the defendants and the judgment in his favour to be one for the recovery merely of the damages sustained by him by reason of such wrongful, unskilful and negligent conduct, and the residue of the judgment directing the completion of the drain in accordance with the plan and specifications adopted by the by-law, etc., they regarded as being the relief granted and adjudged in favour of the corporation of the township of Sombra, and as regarding the said judgments it was ordered and adjudged by the said court upon the said appeal that the appeal should be, and it was allowed, as to the relief granted to the plaintiffs the township of Sombra, and that the action as to the plaintiffs the township of Sombra should be dismissed, and that neither the said appellants nor the said respondents the corporation of the township of Sombra should pay to, or receive from the other of them any costs of the said action or of the said appeal.\nAnd it was further ordered and adjudged by the said court that as regards the plaintiff Murphy the said appeal should be and the same was dismissed with costs to be paid by the appellants to the respondent Peter Murphy forthwith after taxation thereof.\nThe Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal in giving his judgment used the language following:\u2014\nI think there was ample evidence of negligence in the execution of this public work sufficient to support the judgment in favour of Murphy. In the execution of an authorized public work a large amount of inconvenience and possible loss may result to individuals without any remedy.\nIf, as a necessary result a legal injury is caused, the only remedy would be the statutable compensation on reference.\nBut for clear palpable negligence on behalf of those entrusted with its performance, for an absurd and unnecessary process of construction certain to cause injury and extending the inevitable inconvenience of property owners which need not extend over a year, to a period of four or five years and allowing the whole work to fall into a state of inefficiency, I cannot but think that a cause of action is given to the injured party.\nBut the learned Chief Justice expressed himself as unable to agree with the learned trial judge in his direction as to levying the moneys required for completion or due execution of the work.\nMr. Justice Burton thought the judgment in favour of the Township of Sombra should be reversed, and the relief asked by them refused, and the action in so far as it related to the relief asked by them should be dismissed.\nMr. Justice Osler entered very fully into the facts as they appeared in evidence and in the findings of the learned trial judge. Dealing with the claim of the plaintiff Murphy, he draws attention to the fact that although the time limited by the by-law for the completion of the work was the 31st December, 1881, the contracts for construction were not made until some time into the year 1882, and that then the work was let piecemeal to several small contractors, farmers, along the line of the drain, and then adds: The natural consequence was that the work instead of being promptly and expeditiously done, extended over a number of years, and the drain was not accepted by the commissioner until the fall of the year 1886; at this date, however, he certified it to be complete.\nAgain he says:\nMuch evidence was given as to the condition in which the drain had been actually left by the contractors when accepted by the defendants, whether it had ever really been completed in accordance with the plans and specifications or whether its then condition was owing to its having got into a state of disrepair after actual completion.\nUpon this question he says:\nThere is I think, abundant evidence in support of the learned judge\u2019s finding that the drain never was completed in accordance with the engineer\u2019s plan, report and specifications. In one part of it near the eastern end it had not been excavated to the depth required, by as much as three feet, and this for a distance of 47 feet. At the west end there was said to be a deficiency in depth of two feet. At other places in its course there were irregularities in the depth more or less serious, and the contractors had in some instances during the execution of the work left dams for the purpose of keeping water out of the cuttings which they omitted to remove.\nAgain he says:\nThe learned judge expressly finds that it was in consequence of this unfinished and incomplete condition of the drain that it proved of insufficient capacity to carry off the waters brought into it by the three Sombra drains, and that those waters were thereby caused to back upon and flow over the plaintiff\u2019s property. In that state of things, and upon these findings the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages against the defendants in an action. They have obstructed the outlets of the drains which formerly carried water from his land, and have so negligently constructed the Whitebread drain in the execution of the work, and in not completing it to the original design and stipulated depth as to fail in providing another outlet for the waters thus obstructed by them.\nAnd again:\nThey have negligently failed to do what the by-law authorized them to do, and the result of their negligent interference was that the condition of things has been altered to the plaintiff\u2019s damage.\nHe then points out that the judgment is not for a mandamus under section 538 of the Act, chapter 174 R.S.O. of 1877, but a judgment directing defendants to complete the drain to the width and depth and in the manner required by the plans and specifications upon which it was undertaken. He then expressed the opinion that the plaintiffs were not precluded from contending that the drain had not been completed as required by the by-law, by the fact that the corporation of Chatham had accepted the work as completed upon the report to that effect by the commissioner appointed by the by-law to superintend the work. Upon this point he says:\nThough he was appointed commissioner by the by-law to superintend the construction, that was a mere matter of convenience. The council was not bound to appoint him. His legal position was simply that of a servant or agent of the corporation, and they cannot, as I respectfully think, be heard to say that an incompleted drain is the same thing as a drain which has become out of repair. The drain never having been in fact completed the case does not come as one of non-repair within sub-section 3 of section 583 which is confined to the deepening, extending and widening of a work which has been fully made and completed in the language of that section.\nThen, in relation to the third paragraph in the judgment which relates to the mode of defraying the necessary expenses attending the completion of the work as directed by the judgment, he says:\nThis limitation, imposed by this clause of the judgment, is of a most unusual character.\nAnd again:\nThis judgment casts the whole of the loss upon that part of the township which is outside of the drainage area and exempts the latter from sharing in it though quite as much a part of the corporation as the former.\nFor this reason and for others which it is not necessary to state here because they are the reasons upon which is rested the judgment against which the present appeal is taken and must needs therefore be considered later on, the court not only expunged from the judgment the said third paragraph but also the second paragraph by which it was ordered that the defendants should complete the drain in accordance with the original plan and specifications notwithstanding that the court was of opinion that in truth, as had been found as a fact by the learned trial judge, the drain had never been completed as required by the by-law, and the judgment was by the said Court of Appeal rendered accordingly, as above set forth.\nFrom this judgment the corporation of Sombra alone appealed to this court, and this court was of opinion that that corporation had good right under the facts appearing in the evidence and the findings of the learned trial judge thereon to maintain that learned judge\u2019s judgment for the completion of the drain, but that as there had been no issue raised upon the record as to the sufficiency of the amount which had been provided for the construction of the drain the corporation of the township of Chatham should not have been deprived as they were by the third paragraph of the learned trial judge\u2019s judgment of the power of availing themselves of the clauses of the statutes enabling them to raise further funds if the amount which had been raised was in truth insufficient for the purpose, and this court therefore maintaining the judgment of the trial judge as to the completion of the drain did by its judgment made the 28th June, 1892, order and adjudge that the defendants (the corporation of Chatham) should complete the said Whitebread drain in the pleadings mentioned to the width and depth in the manner provided for by the plan and specifications adopted by the by-law upon which the said work was undertaken, or do provide some substitution therefor under the provisions of the statute in that behalf, and that they should pay to the appellants, the corporation of Sombra, the costs incurred by them as well in the Court of Appeal at Toronto, as in this court. The defendants duly paid to the plaintiff Murphy the damages and costs recovered by the judgment in his favour in the former action, and they also paid to the plaintiffs, the corporation of Sombra, the costs adjudged to be paid to them, but they did nothing towards the completion of the said drain, as directed by the said judgment, until after the commencement of the present action. Upon the 27th day of February, 1894, notwithstanding the said judgment had conclusively adjudged and determined that the said Whitebread drain had never been completed in accordance with the plans and specifications as required by the by\u2011law of the 14th October, 1881 and had ordered and adjudged that the same should be completed by the defendants in accordance with the said plans and specifications, the said corporation of Chatham by its municipal council purporting to act under the clauses in the Acts in force in relation to drainage which authorize municipal corporations to pass by-laws for repairing and defraying the expense of repairing a drain already completely constructed under the Act, provisionally passed a by-law intituled,\na by-law to provide for the repair of the Whitebread drain and for borrowing on the credit of the Township of Chatham the sum of $3,105.78 to defray that portion of the expense of such repairs, and of the damages and costs payable by the Township of Chatham.\nThe total amount specified in the by-law as necessary for making what the by-law called repairs, was the sum of $4,742.80, and the damages and costs mentioned in the by-law consisted of the damages and costs paid to the said plaintiff Murphy under the judgment recovered by him in the said action amounting to the sum of $2,102.76, and these two sums together made the sum of $6,845.56, of which amount the sum of $3,105.70 mentioned in the by-law, was appropriated as the contribution of the municipal corporation of Chatham, and the lands assessed therein, and the balance or $3,739.86 was appropriated as the sum to be contributed by the municipal corporation of the township of Sombra and the lands in that township assessed as being by the said by-law to be chargeable therewith. The said by-law so provisionally passed recited the passing of the said by-law of the 14th October, 1881, and also (notwithstanding the said judgment) recited that the said drain had been duly constructed and had become out of repair; it then recites the judgment recovered in the said action as above set out, and that the damages and costs recovered therein amounted to the sum of $2,102.76, and then proceeds thus:\nAnd the said council desires to charge the same as provided by law, and for that purpose has desired the engineers to add the same to the cost of making said repairs, and to assess the same against the lands and roads liable for the construction and repairs of the said drain.\nThe by-law then purported to enact that the said sum of $4,742.80, as for repairs of the said drain, and the said sum of $2,102.76 as for said damages and costs so by the said judgment recovered, amounting together to the said sum of $6,845.56, should be assessed against the lands and roads specified in a schedule annexed to the said by-law, which schedule comprised all the lands and roads in the said townships of Chatham and Sombra which had been previously assessed for the construction of the said drain, and also certain other lands and roads in the township of Sombra which had not been assessed for the construction of the drain.\nUpon the 11th day of April, 1894, the present action was commenced in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice for Ontario, and immediately thereupon the plaintiffs caused the defendants therein to be served with a notice of a motion to be made to the said court for an order to be made limiting the time within which the defendants should complete the said Whitebread drain as required by the said judgment in the said former action and for an order restraining the said defendants from proceeding to assess for the repair or maintenance of the drain any of the lands or roads assessed for the construction thereof until the said drain should be completed as required by the said judgment. An order was made upon the motion made in pursuance of such notice, by which order bearing date the 9th day of May, 1894, it was ordered by the court that the said motion should stand over to be heard and disposed of by the trial judge at or after the trial of the action in the Chancery Division so as aforesaid commenced on the 11th April, 1894, and that the costs of the application should be costs in the cause unless the new trial judge should otherwise order.\nThereupon the plaintiffs upon the 22nd day of May, 1894, filed their statement of claim and therein alleged the passing of the by-law of the 14th October, 1881, by the defendants, and the raising by them thereunder of the said sum of $6,109 as the contribution of that township towards the construction of the work in the by-law mentioned; and the contribution and payment by the corporation of Sombra of the sum of $6,042 to the corporation of the township of Chatham as the contribution of the township of Sombra towards the construction of the work. It then charged that the said two sums of $6,042 and $6,109 constituted a trust fund in the hands of the defendants for the purpose of the construction of the said work and that the plaintiffs and the other owners of lands assessed for the said work were and are interested therein and cestuis que trustent thereof and that the said moneys were amply sufficient to have constructed and completed the said drain in accordance with the plans and specifications thereof and the terms of the said by-law. It then alleged the commencement of the work by the defendants, but that they had proceeded therewith so negligently and improperly that it had never yet been completed. It then alleged that the moneys in the hands of the defendants and applicable to the construction of the work were wore than sufficient to have completed the same, but that owing to the negligence and improper conduct of the defendants the same was wasted and misapplied. It then charged certain acts of the defendants as constituting the negligence and improper conduct whereby the said funds were so wasted and misapplied. It then alleged the former action and the judgment recovered therein and claimed further damages as sustained by the plaintiff Murphy and the municipality of Sombra respectively since the recovery of the said judgment from the same cause as had been alleged in the said former action. It then alleged in the 14th paragraph as follows:\nOn or about the 1st day of December last past the said defendants disregarding the said judgment and in contempt thereof caused one W.G. McGeorge to make a survey of the said drain and an estimate of the cost of alleged repair to be made thereof and an assessment of the costs thereof upon the lands and roads assessed for the original cost of the said drain, and on the 27th day of February last provisionally passed a by-law adopting the said report and assessment imposing upon the lands and roads in the said two townships an assessment for the amount of the estimated cost of the said pretended repairs according to the said report, such cost amounting to the sum of $4,742.80, and they by the said by-law assumed to assess upon the said lands and roads the amount of the judgment recovered by the plaintiff Murphy against them, as aforesaid, and the costs of the said action.\nAnd the plaintiffs in their said statement of claim submitted that until the defendants should complete the said drain in accordance with the said judgment they could not assess nor charge the roads and lands aforesaid with the cost of repairs to the said drain, and that no duty to repair was imposed by law until the drain should be fully made and completed, and further, that the damages and costs recovered in the said action having been recovered by reason of the negligent acts of the defendants could not be charged upon the said lands and roads within the area assessed for the cost of the construction of the said work but must be borne by the defendants, and further, that the moneys provided for the construction of the drain having been sufficient to have completed the same but for the negligence and breaches of trust of the defendants as in the statement of claim set forth, the defendants could not assess or charge upon the said lands and roads the cost of completing the said work, and the plaintiffs claimed, if necessary, an account of the moneys so received by the defendants and of their application thereof, and the plaintiffs in their prayer for relief claimed amongst other things:\n1st. Damages for the wrongs and losses in the statement of claim set forth.\n2nd. That the defendants should be restrained from passing and adopting the by-law of the 27th February, 1894.\n3rd. That the defendants should be restrained from assessing or charging on the roads or lands of the plaintiffs any moneys for repairs to the said drain until the same should be fully made and completed in accordance with the said judgment, and from charging the said roads and lands with the damages and costs recovered in the said action.\n4th. That the said defendants should also be restrained from assessing or charging the said lands and roads with the cost of the said work, and that if necessary an account might be taken of the moneys which had come to the hands of the defendants and which were applicable to the construction of the said work, and of the amount thereof properly expended in such construction, and of the amount remaining or which ought to have remained in their hands for that purpose.\n5th. That the defendants might be decreed to make good so much of the moneys so received by them as had been wasted or misapplied by them, and for further relief.\nThe defendants in their statement of defence alleged that the amount raised under the by-law passed for the original construction of the said drain was not sufficient for the construction thereof, and they denied all the negligence with which they were by the statement of claim charged and averred that the work of constructing said drain was carried on with all necessary diligence and without unnecessary delay, and that all the funds raised for the construction of said drain were properly applied and expended by the defendants in the construction of the drain, and that said funds were insufficient for that purpose, and that the defendants were compelled to pay and did pay $300 over and above the amount raised for said drain in completing the same. They then pleaded and averred the institution of the said former action and the recovery of judgment therein by the plaintiffs, and they said that in pursuance of the said judgment they took the proceedings in the statement of claim mentioned and provisionally passed the by-law in the statement of claim mentioned, which they did for the purpose of raising the funds necessary to comply with the said judgment by completing the said drain and paying the damages and costs ordered to be paid by the defendants which they contended that they had a right to do under the provisions of the Municipal Act. They then alleged that the plaintiff had appealed from the assessment adopted by the by-law to the referee under the Drainage Act of 1891, who, as they submitted, has full power and authority to determine all questions and issues arising upon said appeal, and that the plaintiffs were estopped from proceeding with the trial of the present action pending the hearing and disposing of said appeal by said referee. They then denied that the plaintiffs had sustained damage, as alleged by them in their statement of claim, and they submitted as matter of law that the plaintiffs had not in their statement of claim shown any cause of action against the defendants. The plaintiffs upon the 9th June, 1894, joined issue upon this statement of defence and the case came down for trial upon the 20th April, 1895.\nIt thus appears that the defendants had provisionally passed the by-law of the 27th of February, 1894, as a by-law professedly for the purpose, in so far as the sum of $4,742.80 is concerned, of raising funds alleged to be required for making necessary repairs in the Whitebread drain, as a drain previously completely constructed under the provisions of the municipal Act in that behalf; whereas, in truth and in fact it had been conclusively adjudged and determined against the defendants by the judgment in the previous action that the drain had never been completed and the defendants were therefore adjudged and directed to complete it in accordance with the provisions of the by-law in that behalf; now in their statement of defence to the present action, abandoning the ground stated in the by-law in justification of it, they allege by way of justification for passing it that the amount raised for the construction of the drain was not sufficient for that purpose and upon this allegation the only material issue of fact to be tried in the present action is joined.\nTrue it is that the defendants in their statement of defence deny that they had been guilty of any negligence or improper conduct in the construction of the work with which they were charged and that the plaintiffs or either of them had sustained any damage occasioned by any negligence or improper conduct of the defendants, but upon these matters the judgment in the former action must be held to be conclusive against the defendants.\nUpon this issue joined as to the sufficiency or insufficiency of the amount which had been raised for the construction of the drain much evidence similar to that given in the previous action was entered into, not for the purpose of establishing negligence and improper conduct of the defendants in the mode adopted by them for constructing the work, but for the purpose of establishing the contention of the plaintiffs that the funds raised had been abundantly sufficient for the complete construction of the drain in accordance with the by-law and that therewith the drain could have been completed but for the wrongful, negligent and improper mode of construction adopted by the defendant and not authorized by the by-law, whereby, as the plaintiffs contended, the defendants had wasted and misapplied funds raised and placed in their hands sufficient for the complete construction of the work.\nIt appeared in evidence at the trial and was found as matter of fact by the learned trial judge that upon the 21st day of December, 1885, the corporation of the township of Chatham passed a by-law professedly by way of amendment of the by-law of the 14th of October, 1881, whereby the lands and roads in Chatham which had been assessed by the by-law of 14th October, 1881, were assessed and charged with a further sum of $1,500 in addition to the $6,109 which had already been raised, as necessary to be provided by Chatham for the completion of the work; and wherein it was recited that an agreement had been entered into between the said corporations that an additional sum should be raised and levied against the lands and roads in Sombra settled at and limited to the sum of $300, which the township of Sombra had agreed to pay; and the learned trial judge further found that as matter of fact the corporation of the township of Sombra had paid to the corporation of the township of Chatham the said sum of three hundred dollars, and that the amount raised under the two by-laws of October, 1881, and December, 1885, was amply sufficient to complete the work; that the evidence before him upon this point was of the most conclusive character; that, as matter of fact nothing had been done by the township of Chatham towards carrying out the judgment of this court in the former action until after the present action had been commenced; that what was then done was to remove the small dams left by the several contractors between the different sections and to clean out the silt that had been washed down while the work was progressing; that this removal of dams and clearing out of the silt was not work of repair but work which was necessary to the completion of the drain namely, as to 47 rods near the eastern outlet that had never been dug out to within two feet of the bottom according to the plan as designed for the construction of the drain.\nAnd he held that until the drain should be completely finished in accordance with the by-law authorizing its construction no by-law could be passed assessing the drainage area for repair of the drain. The evidence showed that the drain had never been completed in accordance with the original plan and specifications until about the month of January, 1895. Upon the 30th of that month one A. McDonell, C.E., acting as a provincial land surveyor for and on behalf of the township of Chatham, and one John H. Jones, C.E., acting in like capacity for and on behalf of the township of Sombra, gave their joint certificate signed by them respectively and addressed to the municipal councils of the townships of Chatham and Sombra whereby they certified that they had made an examination of the drain from the Chenel \u00c9cart\u00e9 to the Bear Creek and that said drain was then completed in accordance with the original design reported by Mr. McGeorge, C.E., in 1882.\nUpon the evidence as taken before the learned trial judge and his findings of matters of fact thereon he pronounced judgment in favour of the plaintiffs, and by a decree of the Chancery Division of the said High Court bearing date the 7th day of August, 1895, it was ordered and adjudged:\n1. That the defendants be and they were thereby restrained from passing and adopting the by-law so provisionally passed by the defendants on the 27th February, 1894, and from proceeding with or prosecuting the appeal to the drainage referee from the assessment made in the said by-law.\n2. That the defendants should be and they were thereby restrained from assessing against, or charging any of the lands in the township of Sombra with any moneys for repairs of the Whitebread drain in the pleading mentioned until the said drain should have been fully made and completed in accordance with the judgment in the pleadings mentioned.\n3. That the said by-law provisionally passed on the 27th day of February, 1894, should be and the same was thereby quashed.\n4. That the defendants should account to the plaintiffs for the moneys which came to the hands of the defendants, and which were applicable to the construction of the said Whitebread drain and as to the amount thereof properly expended in such construction, and as to the amount remaining or which ought to have remained in the hands of the defendants for the said purpose, and that it should be referred to the local master of the court at Sarnia to take the said account.\n5. And the court reserved further directions until the taking of the said account.\n6. And the court did further order and adjudge that the defendants should pay to the plaintiffs their costs of the action.\nBy an order bearing date the 8th day of August, 1895, made in pursuance of the order of the 9th of May, 1894, upon the motion in that behalf as aforesaid, it was ordered by the learned judge before whom the issues in the said action were tried that the defendants should on or before the 1st day of January, 1896, at their own costs and charges, complete the Whitebread drain to the width and in the manner provided for in the plans and specifications adopted by the by-law upon which the said work was undertaken, or provide some substitution therefor under the provisions of the statute in that behalf, and further, that the defendants should pay to the plaintiffs the costs of the said motion and the orders made thereon.\nFrom the above decree and judgment so made in the said action upon the 7th day of August, 1895, and from the said order bearing date the 8th day of August, 1895, the corporation of the township of Chatham instituted an appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and upon argument thereof, it was ordered and adjudged by the said Court of Appeal as follows:\u2014\nThat the said appeals should be and the same were allowed with costs of the said appeal in the action in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice, to be paid by the respondents to the appellants forthwith after taxation thereof, and it was further ordered that judgment should be entered in the court below dismissing the said action in the said Chancery Divison, with costs to be paid by the plaintiffs to the defendant, and that there be no costs to either party of the said order pronounced on the 8th day of August, 1895 or of the appeal therefrom.\nFrom this judgment the plaintiffs in the action have instituted the present appeal.\nIn the argument before us the appeal was argued and rested upon so much only of the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario as related to the disposition of the action.\nAs to the order of the 8th of August, 1895, it had been proved in the action and was admitted by the appellants that the drain had been completed in January, 1895, in accordance with the original plans and specifications, so that the order of the 8th of August, 1895, that it should be completed in accordance with such plans and specifications on or before the 1st of January, 1896, was plainly erroneous, and could not be supported. When that order was made there was nothing then that could have been adjudicated upon by it but the costs of the motion and of the order of the 9th May, 1894, and incident thereupon, as to which the appellants did not press, and we do not think that under the circumstances it would be proper to make any variation from the disposition made by the Court of Appeal for Ontario as to those costs. The main question argued before us and which alone has to be disposed of, was the judgment of the Court of Appeal in respect to the action in the Chancery Division of the High Court.\nThe question so raised is a novel one and apparently of the gravest importance to all parties concerned. It is to be observed that the former action was not instituted by the plaintiffs for any injury alleged to have been sustained by them or either of them as consequential upon the construction of the drain as authorized by the by-law passed by the defendants for its construction. Had the action been framed claiming relief in respect to any such damage it could not have been maintained. The contention of the plaintiffs was that although the defendants had undertaken to construct the drain in the manner authorized by the by-law, yet that what they had done was done in such a manner as in point of fact to defeat the plan as designed and adapted by the by-law for its construction; that in point of fact the drain had never been completed, but that the defendants in violation of the provisions of the by-law had committed acts of tortious misfeasance whereby instead of constructing the drain as authorized by th\u00e9 by-law, they had created a public nuisance which caused to the plaintiffs the particular damage of which they complained, and had thereby given to the plaintiffs a good cause of action as for a wrong committed by the defendants for which no law afforded any justification, and the plaintiffs prayed compensation in damages for the injury already sustained, and that the defendants should be decreed to complete the drain and thereby to abate the nuisance they had created. The defendants on the contrary insisted that what they had done was authorized by the sections of the municipal Act relating to drainage, and that they had completed the drain in accordance with the provisions of the by-law. Issues having been joined upon the above matters of fact the learned trial judge determined those issues wholly in favour of the plaintiffs. The design of the work authorized by the by-law was to prevent any water entering the township of Chatham from the township of Sombra, although such was the natural course for Sombra waters to flow in, by the erection of a permanent dam or embankment on the Chatham side of the town line between Sombra and Chatham, to be constructed of the earth to be taken out in digging a continuous drain wholly on the Sombra side of the said town line and in the township of Sombra, whereby all the waters obstructed by the dam or embankment should be conveyed to the outlets specified in the by-law. Without such a continuous drain there was no justification whatever for obstructing, by the embankment, the waters flowing from Sombra into Chatham, but what the defendants in fact did was, that they constructed the embankment efficiently so as to prevent all waters from flowing from Sombra into Chatham, thereby accomplishing perfectly Chatham\u2019s object in passing the by-law, but they wholly failed in con- structing the drain, as designed and adopted by the by-law which constituted the sole foundation in justification of the erection of the embankment, for instead of digging the drain as required by the by-law, and giving a continuous flow to the waters made to enter it to the outlets provided by the by-law, they dug it in sections with solid earth between the sections constituting dams which prevented the waters entering any section from flowing to the outlets, as designed by the by-law, and thereby forced all the waters flowing from Sombra into Chatham back upon Sombra, thus defeating the whole object of the by-law as regarded Sombra and creating a manifest nuisance, giving a good cause of action to all persons suffering particular injury therefrom. The learned trial judge held this mode of procedure to have been utterly unjustified by the municipal Act or by any law, and in this particular his judgment was sustained by the Court of Appeal for Ontario. The learned Chief Justice was of opinion that there was ample evidence to support the judgment of the learned trial judge in favour of the plaintiff Murphy. He was also plainly of opinion that the defendants in the discharge of the trust reposed in them for performance of the work specified in the by-law were guilty of clear palpable negligence, and that the process adopted by them for the construction of the work was absurd, unnecessary and certain to cause injury, as appears by the extract already quoted from his judgment.\nThe language of Mr. Justice Osler was equally emphatic and to the like effect. He was of opinion that there was abundant evidence in support of the learned judges finding that the drain never was completed in accordance with the original plans and specifications adopted by the by-law. The learned judge very plainly points out, what the evidence had clearly established and what the learned trial judge had affirmed by his judgment, that the plaintiffs had rested their cause of action upon the fact that the defendants in direct violation of the provisions of the by-law had erected the embankment which efficiently obstructed the waters whose natural flow was into Chatham and had thus effectually served the object which Chatham had in view without providing the drain designed by the by-law for the purpose of carrying off the obstructed waters, and the providing of which was the sole justification relied upon for the erection of the embankment and the prevention of the flow of water from Sombra into Chatham.\nThis court, while concurring with the Court of Appeal for Ontario in their affirmation of the judgment of the learned trial judge in favour of Murphy, restored, upon the appeal of the corporation of Sombra, the relief which had been given by the learned trial judge but which had been expunged by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, by directing the defendants to complete the drain as originally designed and adopted by the by-law, thus decreeing the abatement of the nuisance of which the plaintiffs had complained as being particularly injurious to them. The right of the courts to make that adjudication in the exercise of their undoubted jurisdiction cannot be questioned and the judgment so rendered in the former action must now be taken to be a conclusive adjudication between the parties that the amount recovered by Murphy in the former action for his damages and costs was recovered in a cause of action against the defendants for their tortious misfeasance not justified in law, in their wrongful obstruction of the waters flowing from Sombra into Chatham, and not for damages arising from anything done by them under the authority of the by-law mentioned in the action, or of the drainage clauses in the municipal Act, ch. 174 Revised Statutes of 1877, the Act in force at the time of the passing of the by-law, and that the costs incurred by the unfounded defence set up to so much of the action as averred that the defendants had never completed the drain as authorized by the by-law, and prayed that they should be decreed specifically to execute and complete the work in accordance with the original design, and with the plans and specifications adopted by the by-law whereby alone the design and purpose of the by-law could be accomplished, were incurred wholly by the wrongful and untrue defence urged by the defendants in answer to the just and reasonable demand in the plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim in that behalf. These matters having been so conclusively adjudicated upon, there remains to be considered the present action which at the time of its commencement appears to have been well founded in every particular, but the work having been completed after the commencement of the action but before it came down for trial, and the plaintiffs having abandoned all claim for damages subsequent to the former recovery, all that remains now to be considered is the question whether or not the defendants have the right in law which they claim to have, to repay themselves by the by-law provisionally passed on the 27th February, 1894, the amount recovered against them in the former action for damages and costs which amount has been paid by them, or the sum of $4,742.80 alleged in the by-law to be for necessary repairs, but which in point of fact if expended were expended by them in removing the nuisance wrongfully erected by them by the construction of an embankment which cut off all waters lawfully flowing from Sombra into Chatham without constructing the drain designed by the by-law for the carrying off the waters so obstructed, which erection of the embankment in the manner aforesaid the judgment in the former action had conclusively determined to have been the wrongful act of the defendants, and which was not justified by any law.\nThe only question of fact involved in the present action is as to the sufficiency of the funds placed in the hands of the defendants for the construction of the drain by the contributors to the funds subscribed for that purpose, the plaintiffs alleging, and the defendants (notwithstanding the recitals in the provisional by-law that the drain had already been completed) denying, that the funds which had been provided for the construction of the drain and placed in the hands of the defendants were sufficient for the complete construction of the drain in accordance with the plan adopted by the by-law passed for its construction. Upon the issue joined between the parties upon this question the learned trial judge has found as matter of fact that it was proved before him by the most conclusive evidence that the amounts raised under the by-laws of October, 1881, and December, 1885, and placed in the hands of the defendants for the complete construction of the drain in accordance with the plan and specifications adopted by the by-law authorizing its construction were amply sufficient for that purpose. In effect he found that the deficiency, which the defendants alleged, arose wholly by the unjustifiable manner in which they, the defendants, had wasted those funds in the wrongful erection by them of the embankment obstructing the flow of waters from Sombra into Chatham without constructing the drain necessary to carry off the obstructed waters as designed by the plan and adopted by the by-law which alone authorized the construction of the embankment; all of which wrongful conduct of the defendants had been the subject of and had been conclusively adjudicated upon in the former action. The correctness of the finding of the learned trial judge upon this matter of fact has not been called in question; we must therefore now regard it as a fact conclusively established that the amount placed in the hands of the defendants (for the complete construction of the drain as authorized by the by-law passed for its construction was amply sufficient for that purpose, and that any deficiency, if any there was, arose by reason of the wrongful, wasteful, unjustifiable misappropriation by the defendants of the funds in a manner not authorized by the by-law or the statutes relating to the construction of drainage works, and the question becomes resolved into this, viz.: where a sum amply sufficient to complete the work as designed and authorized by the by-law for the complete construction of the drain was placed in the hands of the defendants to be applied by them in the construction of the drain and was wrongfully used and applied by them in a manner and for a purpose not authorized by the by-law which the defendants themselves had passed for the construction of the drain, whether the defendants can now by another by-law levy or cause to be levied from the persons who had contributed the sum so amply sufficient for the completion of the work a sum sufficient to reimburse to the defendants the amount supplied by them to replace the amount which they had so wrongfully wasted and misapplied.\nThe contention of the defendants is that they have by law such right, and the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario has maintained such their contention. It is not contended that there is anything in support of this contention in chapter 174 R.S.O. of 1877, the Act in force at the time of the passing of the by-law of October, 1881, in virtue of which that by-law purports to have been passed, but the contention is rested wholly upon section 31 of the Municipal Amendment Act of 1886 whereby section 592 of the Consolidated Municipal Amendment Act of 1883 was repealed and in substitution therefor it was enacted that:\nWhere, on account of proceedings taken under this Act or the Ontario Drainage Act or other Acts respecting drainage work and local assessment therefor, damages are recovered against the corporation or parties constructing the drainage works; or other relief is given by any judgment or order of any court, or any award, made under this Act, all such damages, or any sum of money that may be required to enable the corporation to comply with any such judgment, order or award made in respect thereof shall be charged pro rat\u00e2 upon the lands and roads liable to assessment for such drainage works; provided always that if to enable the corporation to comply with any such judgment, order or award it shall be necessary or expedient to change the course of any drain or to make a new outlet, or otherwise improve or alter any drain or drainage works, the same shall for all purposes and in all respects be dealt with, and all works and operations in respect thereof shall be executed and performed as if the same were alterations and improvements within the meaning of section 586 of this Act and all provisions of this Act applying to or in respect of any work, alteration or improvement provided for by said section 586 shall apply to any work alteration or improvement intended to be provided for by this section.\nNow, whatever may have been the reasons for which the legislature made this alteration in the phraseology of this section 592, it is, I think, sufficient for the purposes of the present action to say, and I must say it appears to me to be very clear upon consideration of the frame of the former action and the proceedings and judgment therein as above detailed, that the damages and costs recovered therein were not damages which, within the meaning of the section so substituted by the Act of 1886, can be said to have been recovered on account of proceedings taken under any Act respecting drainage works, etc. Had the action been framed for the purpose of recovering any such damages it could not, as already shown, and as appears by the extract taken from the judgments of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, have been maintained, but quite on the contrary the damages and costs recovered in that action were recovered on account of acts done and proceedings taken by the corporation defendants in contravention of the by-law which was the sole authority upon which they relied in support of their acts and proceedings, which acts and proceedings were of a nature plainly to constitute a nuisance causing to the plaintiffs the special injury of which they complained and were not justified by any act of the legislature; and the section cannot be construed so as to give to the corporation defendants power to indemnify themselves by assessing the property of persons injured by the nuisance for reimbursement of the damages recovered against the corporation for injuries occasioned by means of the nuisance.\nIt would have been quite sufficient for persons injured by the acts of the defendants which were the subject of the former action to have alleged in their statement of claim that the defendants had wrongfully obstructed the natural and lawful flow of the waters from Sombra into Chatham by erecting an embankment whereby all such waters were forced back and prevented from flowing in their natural and legal course and thereby caused the damages complained of. To an action so framed it is clear upon the evidence in the former action that the defendants could not have succeeded in establishing any justification under the section 592 or otherwise. The grounds of recovery in the former action were clearly the tortious acts of the defendants not justified by any law, and damages recovered upon such ground cannot be damages within the meaning of section 592 which the corporation can recoup themselves for, by levying the amount under the provisions of that section. So neither, and for the like reason, can the relief granted by way of compelling the corporation to abate the nuisance of their creation by constructing the drain in accordance with the provisions of the by-law of October, 1881 without which drain they had no authority whatever to construct the embankment which obstructed the natural and legal flow of the waters from Sombra into Chatham, be said to have been relief given on account of proceedings taken under any act of the legislature; it was, on the contrary, relief given in the exercise of the ordinary jurisdiction of the courts to redress a wrong for committing which the defendants had no justification whatever in law.\nThe judgment in the former action being conclusive that the conduct of the defendants which constituted the ground of that action was wholly wrongful and unjustified by any law, nothing contained in that judgment can be held to come within the section 592 of the Act of 1886. It has been argued that the policy of the clauses of the Acts relating to drainage works is that the lands assessed under the by-law authorizing the construction of such works should bear and pay all charges attending the construction and maintenance of the works. That undoubtedly is so, as shown by the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in the former action, in so far as all necessary expenses are concerned and all expenses which are required to compensate parties injured by the works from causes consequential upon and incidental to the construction of this work in accordance with the by-law authorizing its construction, but neither the policy of the law nor the language of any Act goes any further, and in the present case the acts of the defendants which constituted the ground of the former action were acts which were not authorized by such by-law but were in fact acts done in actual contravention of it and upon no principle of law can those who, as has been conclusively found by the learned trial judge in the present action, supplied the defendants with all the money necessary to complete the work as authorized by the by-law be charged with the damages, costs and liabilities incurred by the defendants as wholly consequential upon their own wrongful acts. Upon the whole, therefore, it appears to be established that the by-law provisionally passed on the 27th of February, 1894, cannot be supported as a by-law for making repairs, as it purports on its face to be, in a drain then already completed, nor consistently with the findings of the learned trial judge, upon the issues joined in the present action could any by-law be maintained under the clause of the Act authorizing the corporation defendants to raise a further sum as necessary to complete a work when a sufficient sum for that purpose had not been raised under a previous by-law passed for the purpose, so neither can it be supported, as already shown, as a by-law for reimbursing the defendants for damages and costs recovered against them in the former action for injuries occasioned by their own wrongful acts. Under these circumstances the judgment of the learned trial judge of the 7th August, 1895, with the exception of what is contained in the 2nd, 4th and 5th paragraphs of this judgment, must be restored. The account directed, no longer insisted upon as the issue upon the question whether the funds which had been placed in the hands of the defendants for the completion of the work in accordance with the original design adopted by the by-law authorizing the construction of the drain, was sufficient for that purpose, has been conclusively found in the affirmative, and the drain has been completed since the commencement of the present action. The appeal must therefore be allowed with costs in this court and in the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and the judgment of the learned trial judge varied as above indicated must be restored.\nIt was not argued in the former action that the by-law of October, 1881, was ultra vires of the municipality of the township of Chatham. From the frame of the statement of claim in that action it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to raise any question upon that point, for their contention was that, assuming the by-law to be, as they no doubt did assume it to be valid, the defendants of their own wrong and without the by-law having conferred any authority upon them to act as they did, committed the injuries complained of. The point was, however, casually referred to by Mr. Justice Osler in his judgment, but no question having been raised upon the point no judgment has been given upon it in any of the courts. It may be well, however, for the parties to consider whether in October, 1881, or at any time the municipality of the township of Chatham had jurisdiction to pass a by-law which, as plainly now appears upon the record in the present case, and upon the evidence, was not passed for the purpose of constructing a drain at any point within the township, nor for draining thereby any lands in Chatham, but for the construction of a drain wholly within the township of Sombra and with the earth excavated from such drain of erecting on the Chatham side of the highway between the townships an embankment for the purpose of thereby preventing any water flowing naturally or in an artificial channel, from flowing into Chatham from Sombra. It may be open to question whether the sections 594\u20135\u20136 and 7 of the Act of 1883, referred to by Mr. Justice Osler, gave any jurisdiction to the municipality of Chatham to initiate for such a purpose the construction of a drain wholly within the limits of Sombra. It is to be noted that in the by-law of October, 1885, which was passed, as appears on its face, for the purpose of raising further funds as necessary for the completion of the work designed under the by-law of October, 1881, the lands and roads in Sombra assessed under this latter by-law were not charged with the funds required for the completion of the work in the manner provided by the drainage clauses of the Municipal Act, but that in lieu thereof an agreement appears to have been entered into between the councils of the respective municipalities as to the amount to be paid by the municipality of Sombra by way of contribution to the further amount required to complete the work. We think it right to draw the attention of the parties to these points without pronouncing any opinion much less judgment upon them, our judgment being rested upon the grounds which have been taken throughout the litigation involved in the case, that the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief granted even upon the assumption of the by-law of October, 1881, being valid.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Kittermaster & Gurd.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Pegley & Sayer.\n",

C.\nA condition in a policy of life insurance by which the policy is declared to become incontestable upon any ground whatever after the lapse of a limited period, does not make the contract binding upon the insurer in the case of a wagering policy.\nJudgment of the Court of Queen's Bench reversed, Sedgewick J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) reversing the judgment of the Superior Court sitting in Review at Quebec, and ordering judgment to be entered for the plaintiff with costs.\nThe action was tried in the District of Kamouraska, before Mr. Justice Cimon and a jury, and upon the answers by the jury to the questions submitted both the plaintiff and the defendant moved for judgment, the defendants also moving alternately for a new trial, before the Superior Court sitting in Review at Quebec, where judgment was rendered by the majority of the court (Cimon J. dissenting), dismissing the plaintiff's motion for judgment, and granting the defendants motion for a new trial. On appeal the Court of Queen's Bench reversed the Superior Court judgment and ordered a judgment to be entered upon the verdict for $2000 in favour of the plaintiff with costs. From the latter judgment the defendant appealed.\nThe case is sufficiently stated in the judgments reported.\nCasgaain Q.C. for the appellant. Combining the findings of the jury with the admissions, it appears that at the time of the application for insurance and afterwards, the insured was without means, and unable to pay the premiums s that he was not related to the respondent, but only very remotely a connection of the latter's wife; he owed the respondent nothing at the time he made the application; and the respondent had then no pecuniary or other interest in his life; he never had the intention of insuring his life and paying the premiums, but executed the application upon being assured that the respondent would pay the premiums as agreed previously on condition that the policy should be made payable to him. The respondent participated in the application by entering into a contemporaneous agreement to give Pettigrew what he needed, provided the policy should be so issued, and never regarded the policy otherwise than as a speculation. The undertaking by the insured to pay the premiums was therefore only colourable, and devised to mask the fact that the respondent intended to pay the premiums in return for the benefit of the policy, and that he was the sole party interested. Compare The North American Life Assurance Co. v. Craigen ([1]) and remarks by Strong J. at pages 291-292. See also Imperial Statute, 14 Geo. III, c. 48, Arts. 2474 2480 2590 C. C. and V\u00e9zina v. The New York Life insurance Co. ([2]). The facts that the insured lent himself to the device of ostensibly insuring his life and undertaking to pay premiums that he knew were far beyond his means and position in life, and that the company's agent connived at the contrivance, cannot alter the essence of the policy. From its inception it was a wager by the respondent on the length of another person's life. The respondent's interest was not in Pettigrew's life but in his death. We also refer to Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Schaefer ([3]); Bloomington Mutual Benefit Association v. Blue ([4]); Crawley on Life Insurance, p. 26; Waine-wright v Bland ([5]) Shilling v. Accidental Death Insuranee Co. ([6]).\nThe Court of Queen's Bench, considered that the effect of the clause declaring the policy to be indisputable, was to require proof of moral fraud, or intentional concealment, contrary to the doctrine laid down in Venner v. The Sun Life Insurance Co. ([7]) a case of an unconditional policy effected by a debtor on his life in favour of a creditor. Here however the policy was void ab initio; there never was any valid existing contract which could be declared indisputable and the consent of the appellants to the insurance was fraudulently obtained upon warranties subsequently proved to be false. The case of Wheelton v. Hardisty ([8]), is easily distinguished. Here the falsity of the warranties goes to the very essence of the undertaking, and makes the insurance void from the beginning. 3 Bedarride, Dol et Fraude, \u00a7 1287; Ruben de Couder, Dict, de Droit vo. Asssurance sur la Vie,\" nos. 295, 305, 369, et seq.; Crawley on Life Insurance, p. 119; Bliss, (2 ed.) \u00a7 36; Porter, (2 ed.) 146, 197; 24 Laurent, no. 254. Fitzpatrick Q.C. and. Lafleur for the respondent. The jury have found that there was no fraud or material misrepresentation or concealment, and these findings on matters of fact were adopted by the Court of Queen's Bench and ought not to be disturbed in a second appellate court. Demers v. Montreal Steam Laundry Co. ([9]). There is an important distinction between false declarations innocently made and those fraudulently made; Wheelton v. Hardisty ([10]); Wood v. Dwarris ([11]). The answers of the insured were given in good faith and they must consequently he favourably interpreted ([12]), and the clause providing that the policy shall be indisputable after a lapse of one year must be given its fullest effect. The Court of Review was unanimous in considering this clause as decisive. and the jury found that whatever errors may have been made, the answers in the application were given in good faith without intent to deceive. The Court of Queen's Bench unanimously adopted the same view. The respondent s relations to the insured were merely of a benevolent character and could of course give him no interest of an insurable nature in the life but the insured could insure his own life ([13]), and this is what he did for the benefit he might receive in obtaining the tontine endowment or other advantages at the end of the fifteen years, the term of the policy, incidentally making his benefactor a beneficiary in case he died before that time. There is nothing illegal in this. The jury found no fraud, and the verdict should not be disturbed on this point either * Metropolitan Railway Go. v. Wright ([14]); 2 Graham & Waterman, New Trials, (2 ed.) 1283-7 and 1290 et seq. There was evidence to support the findings of the jury. The company is also estopped from pleading its own turpitude, even if the contract be held to be a wagering policy and voidable on that account for they accepted the premiums and hold them still and ought not to be allowed to benefit by their own fault The jury have found that the company was fully aware of the relations existing between the insured and the respondent, and that with this knowledge they issued the policy. The observations of henry J., at page 45, in V\u00e9zina v. New York Life Insurance Co. ([15]) are in point, so also those of Ritchie C.J., at page 289, in The North American Lije Assurance Co. v. Graigen ([16]). The true principles are laid down in The Ph\u00e6nix Insurance Co. v. McGhee ([17]).\nTaschereau J.\u2014This appeal must be allowed and the action dismissed. I have had communication of my brother Gwynne's opinion, and I could not add anything to it. I concur in every word of it. The clause by which the company stipulated that this policy would not be disputed after one year does not help the respondent's case. \" Pactis privatorum juri publico non derogalur \" ([18]). Private interests must give way before public interests The stipulation itself is contrary to law and public order. The company, appellant's, position in this case is certainly not a deserving one, but a defence like theirs to an action of this natute is allowed not for the sake of the defendant, but of the law itself. There can be no waiver of such an objection. Coppell v. Hall ([19]); 2 Solon, Nullit\u00e9, no. 345. \" La partie qui a contract\u00e9 une obligation en fraude de la loi est recevable \u00e0 en demander la nullit\u00e9.\" Dalloz, '46, 2, 195; S. V.

The appeal will be allowed with costs\nGwynne J.\u2014This is an action upon a policy of insurance issued by the defendants upon the life of one Antoine Pettigrew, deceased. The plaintiff in his declaration alleges that the defendants by a policy of insurance by them issued upon the 12th day of May, 1894, upon the life of Antoine Pettigrew, promised the plaintiff to pay him the sum of $2,000 upon his furnishing proof of the death of the said Pettigrew. It then avers the death of Pettigrew upon the 9th of October, 1895. It then avers fulfilment of all conditions of the policy and that the plaintiff \" en sa qualit\u00e9 de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire du montant de ladite police d'assurance\" has in accordance with the regulations of the company and the conditions of the policy made application for the payment of the said sum of two thousand dollars To this declaration the defendants pleaded eighteen pleas with three of which only, the 11th, 14th, and 16th we propose to deal the rest contain various statements which are alleged to have been falsely and fraudulently made in the application for the insurance. The three pleas with which we are dealing taken together set up but one defence which if established is in law a complete bar to the action and in substance is that the plaintiff never has had any insurable interest in the life of the said Antoine Pettigrew, and that the plaintiff was the person really assured; that the contract of insurance is one really by the plaintiff for his own profit upon the life of the said Antoine Pettigrew; and that the said policy of insurance is simply a wagering policy obtained with a view of making an illegal speculation. Upon issue being joined on these pleas, a long list containing twenty questions, each containing several subdivisions, was directed by the court in accordance with the practice prevailing in the province of Quebec, to be submitted to the Jury.\nAt the trial, upon the policy sued upon being produced and its execution admitted, and upon its being admitted that Pettigrew died on the 9th of October 1895, as alleged in the declaration the defendants entered upon the defence and commenced by calling the plaintiff himself upon whose examination it appeared beyond controversy that he had no insurable interest in the life of Pettigrew. His account of the steps taken in the initiation and procuration of the policy was as follows: He said that the defendant's agent Michaud first spoke to him about taking a policy on the life of Pettigrew; that Michaud at first asked plaintiff to take a policy on his own life which plaintiff refused to do; that shortly afterwards on a subsequent day, Michaud told witness that he had seen Pettigrew, and that he had said that he had no money; that Michaud then asked the plaintiff if he would pay for a policy on the life of Pettigrew to which the plaintiff replied that he would if the policy should be made payable to himself; that he preferred paying premiums for another to paying premiums on his own life; that this was a way to manage well, \" que c'\u00e9tait un moyen d'\u00e9conomiser.\" He again repeated that it was the defendant's agent Michaud who made to him the proposition that he should insure Pettigrew. He further said that he was present when at his own house the application for the policy was prepared by Michaud and signed by Pettigrew with a [ x ] cross, the plaintiff himself having written Pettigrew's name to it. It was he said Michaud who inserted therein the words describing the plaintiff as Pettigrew's \" protector \" if he ever should be in want. It was then that he said that he would provide for Pettigrew if ever he should be in want \" pourvu \" to use the plaintiff's own language, \"pourvu que Ia police serait donn\u00e9e en mon nom. \"\nHe further said that Michaud and the plaintiff's wife, in her maiden name, by Michaud's direction, signed as witnesses; that Michaud took away the application and some few days afterwards brought to plaintiff a policy on Pettigrew's life and made payable to Pettigrew and his representatives which the plaintiff refused to receive because it was not made payable to himself. He had, he said, exacted that if the company should wish to issue a policy payable to himself directly he would pay the premiums, but that otherwise he would not take it. Thereupon the policy was returned to the company by Michaud and another policy in place of the first, (the one now sued upon) ras sent to Michaud who delivered it to the plaintiff, who accepted it and paid the premiums upon it Here it is to be observed that Michaud when returning the first policy to the company gave the company to understand that it was Pettigrew who refused to take the policy in the shape in which it was, whereas it appears that Pettigrew had no knowledge whatever of the proceeding. Michaud in his letter dated the 16th May, 1894, to the defendant's agent at Montreal says:\u2014\nJ'ai re\u00e7u les trois derni\u00e8res polices envoy\u00e9es dont je vous en retourne une pour correction, celle de M. A. Pettigrew au lieu d'\u00eatre payable \u00e0 ses ex\u00e9cuteurs administrateurs &c. il vent l\u00e9guer dans sa police pour le montant de la dite police \u00e0 M. Joseph Napoleon Anctil et il vous demande s'il vous pla\u00eet d'en faire faire la correction et aussi j'esp\u00e8re que la compagnie voudra bien faire ce changement; dans son application c'\u00e9tait M. Anctil qui \u00e9tait l'h\u00e9ritier b\u00e9n\u00e9fic\u00e8ire.\nMichaud having been called as a witness by the plaintiff declared himself to be l'instigateur of the policy sued upon. He gave a somewhat different account from that given by the plaintiff as to the circumstances attending its initiation. He agreed with the plaintiff that he had first asked the plaintiff to insure his own life which the plaintiff declined but he says that Pettigrew was present at this conversation between him and the plaintiff and that he took an interest in it and joined in it and he then relates a long conversation which he says then took place between him and Pettigrew in relation to life insurance and the insurance of Pettigrew's own life. It is singular, to say the least, (although what he says took place between him and the dead man is not very material upon the point in issue) that all that Michaud says took place between him and Pettigrew in the plaintiff's presence should have so taken place and that the plaintiff in his evidence should not have said a word upon the subject. Michaud however says that he had another conversation a few days afterwards with Pettigrew, in consequence of which he returned to the plaintiff and asked him \" if he would not himself take Pettigrew? \" and that plaintiff then asked what it would cost to insure him? That Michaud told him the price whereupon the plaintiff said:\nSubmit it to him. See him and if he wishes perhaps I will take the risk, but upon one condition, that the policy shall be made payable to myself.\nThis is plainly the occasion upon which Michaud in his cross-examination tells how he overcame plaintiff's objection to taking the risk which Michaud was pressing him to incur. There he said that Anctil at first refused saying that he thought it would cost too much, whereupon Michaud told him how much it would cost and that the plaintiff in reply said:\nVoyez-vous, le p\u00e9re peut vivre encore dix \u00e0 quinze ans, et s'il vivait dix ans, et encore quand bien m\u00eame qu'il vivrait rien que sept ans, je perdrais de l'argent, \u00e7a c'est un coup de des, on ne sait pas. It thus appears that the plaintiff knew very well that what Michaud proposed to him was that he should enter into a gambling speculation, which in the \u00a1 plaintiff's opinion was attended with considerable risk of loss rather than with hope of profit. Michaud then tells how he overcame the plaintiff\u2019s scruples. He says that he told him that there is a condition in the defendant's policies which provides that after three years, when a person has paid three years if he wishes to give up the policy the company is obliged to give \" une police accept\u00e9e \" and that he, Michaud, thought that one would lose nothing, \" avec une police accept\u00e9e.\" He says that to this information and opinion given by Michaud, the plaintiff replied by asking, \" c'est inclus dans la police cela? \" to which Michaud replied by showing plaintiff one of the company's policies which he says he had with him and he adds that the plaintiff took cognizance of it and after examining it said \"Faites l'examiner et s'il consent je le ferai assurer.\" Thus it appears that the plaintiff was satisfied that if poor Pettigrew should unfortunately live for three years he, the plaintiff, would be safe enough if the company should enter into a policy with himself directly in his own name upon Pettigrew's life with such a condition in it. Michaud then says that up to this time not a word had been said about the plaintiff giving anything to Pettigrew for his support, and he proceeds to say that after the above conversation with the plaintiff he went to Pettigrew and told him that he, Michaud, had found a person to pay the premiums, and that it was the plaintiff, and that he said to Pettigrew \" Je pense qu'il payera les primes; entendez-vous avec lui\" This he says took place on the 5th or 6th of May. Now it does not appear that Pettigrew ever had any interview with the plaintiff in relation to the policy or made any arrangement with him in respect thereof. Nothing appears to have passed between them save that when the application was being prepare 1 by Michaud in the plaintiff's house for Pettigrew to sign, the plaintiff, apparently to give colour to the statement put into the application by Michaud as Pettigrew's answer to a question required to be answered by the person whose life was proposed to be insured that the plaintiff was Pettigrew's \" protector.\" The plaintiff said that he would provide for Pettigrew if ever he should be in want provided that, as the plaintiff says in his own language, \"pourvu que la police serait donn\u00e9e en mon nom.\" This proviso so frequently insisted upon by the plaintiff appears to be a very explicit expression of the plaintiff's determination to have nothing to do with a policy upon Pettigrew's life unless the company should choose to issue to himself as sole beneficiary a policy to be made in his own name on Pettigrew's life. In fact the proviso attached to the making of the promise and the time when it was made seem rather to indicate that the sole object of the making the promise was to get Pettigrew to sign the application as prepared by Michaud for the purpose of assisting the plaintiff in his project of procuring a policy upon Pettigrew's life to be issued to the plaintiff in his own name.\nPettigrew's presence at the plaintiff's house where the application was prepared and signed, is thus explained by Michaud. He says that upon the 8th of May, as he was returning to Anctil's house he met Pettigrew on the street and asked him if he would come into Anctil's saying to him, \" on va terminer cela.\" He adds;\nAlors je suis entr\u00e9 .' J'avais une plume et du papier sur moi et j'ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 monsieur Anctil s'il voulait me permettre d'\u00e9crire; il a dit * Ecrivez tout ce que vous vondrez. Je lui ai dit que je voulais assurer le p\u00e9re Pettigrew. Je lui ai dit. L'acceptez-vous s'il passe. Je lui ai dit il peut \u00eatre refus\u00e9 par l'examinateur de la compagnie aussi. Et M. Anctil a dit: C'est votre affaire, si la compagnie accepte e payable \u00e0 moi, alors je paierai les primes.\nThen as to the policy as first issued, he said that the plaintiff refused to accept it when he took it to him, because it was made payable to Pettigrew's representatives and not to himself, and that he told Michaud that he might return it to the company to do as they liked with it for that he would not accept it. Thereupon Michaud (no doubt in his admitted character of \"instigateur\" of the policy), wrote to the company's agent at Montreal (their head office being in Toronto), the disingenuous and untrue letter of the 16th May, 1894; and he admits that he never spoke to Pettigrew upon this matter, and that this transaction of the return of the first policy by the plaintiff's direction and the substitution therefor of the one now sued upon took place without the knowledge or consent of Pettigrew. Now if Pettigrew was ever intended to have any interest in the policy which Michaud was thus promoting; if as Michaud alleges in his letter to the company's Montreal agent of the 16th May, 1894, Pettigrew's object in signing the application, which he did sign in manner aforementioned, was that he might bequeath a policy to be issued upon the application to the plaintiff whom he intended to make his \" herelier beneficiare,\" the policy as first sent to Michaud was framed in the precise shape which would have enabled Pettigrew to fulfil such intention. He could have transferred the policy had it been delivered to him in its original shape in his lifetime to the plaintiff, or he could have bequeathed it to him by will, but that, as we have seen, was not what the plaintiff had intended. He had exacted that the policy should be entered into by the company directly with himself in his own name and for this reason he refused it an it directed Michaud to return it to the company to do what they liked with it for that if they did. not choose to enter into a policy with himself in his own name he would have nothing to do with it. When then Michaud brought to him the policy now sued upon in substitution for the one he had refused, he accepted it as being in precise conformity with the terms he had exacted. It is thus established by the terms of the policy itself which is sued upon and by the evidence of the plaintiff himself and of his witness Michaud that Pettigrew never had and that it never was intended by the plaintiff that he should have any possession of the policy, any interest in it or control over it, and that the plaintiff is the sole person who ever was or that the plaintiff ever intended should be the holder thereof or who should have any interest therein otherwise than by title derived from himself. Such being the undisputed facts appearing in evidence, and it appearing also that the plaintiff had no insurable interest in Pettigrew's life, the law pronounces the policy to be null and void and under the circumstances appearing in evidence no verdict whether general or special which should be rendered by a jury in favour of the plaintiff in respect of the issue under consideration could ever be sustained in law The plaintiff's evidence and the terms of the policy itself left in point of fact nothing for a jury to entertain as regards the issue under consideration, and the questions assigned before the trial to be submitted to the jury on the trial became in truth inappropriate having regard to the undisputed facts which appeared in evidence.\nThere were two arguments pressed upon us to which it is only necessary to allude briefly. First, that assuming the policy to be a wagering policy as entered into by the defendant with the plaintiff who had no insurable interest in Pettiigrew's life. still that as the policy was initiated and investigated by\nthe company's agent who knew all the circumstances attending its initiation and promotion the defendant's should be held to be in pari delicto and estopped from urging this defence; but as it is the law which, upon grounds of public policy, pronounces the policy to be void under the circumstances the doctrine of estoppel has no application. It certainly seems strange that the suspicions of the company's agent at Montreal should not have been awakened when he saw on the application the statement in answer to a question submitted to the person whose life was proposed to be insured that the only relationship existing between the plaintiff and Pettigrew was that the former was the latter's \" protector.\" Michaud's-letter of the 16th May 1894 seems to have been written in terms calculated if not intended to mislead and perhaps it did mislead the Montreal agent, and so the defendants can not be said to be in pari but in no case can they be held to be bound to the plaintiff by a contract entered into under circumstances which the law upon grounds of public policy pronounces to be null and void, and for the same reason, to a policy so made null and void the clause in the policy that it shall be indisputable after the expiration of one year can have no application. Secondly, it was argued that by the tontine provisions of the policy Pettigrew, if he should live for fifteen years and the policy should be kept in force so long, would derive substantial benefit from the policy but this argument ignores the following facts, namely: that without the plaintiff's consent that policy could not continue in force for fifteen years: that the plaintiff took special care that the policy should be entered. into with himself directly in his own name: that before consenting to accept it he satisfied himself that he could at the expiration of three years terminate it advantageously, under the condition in the policy in that behalf, if Pettigrew should so long live: that by the express terms of the tontine provisions it is the lawful holder of the policy who alone becomes entitled to the benefit of those provisions; and lastly, that the plaintiff himself with whom the policy was entered into 'or his personal representative in case of his death, or some person claiming lawful title under him, could alone be such lawful holder if the policy should be in force at the expiration of fifteen years.\nIt being then impossible that upon the facts in evidence judgment could ever be recovered by the plaintiff upon the issue under consideration, it remains now to be considered how that issue, in presence of the incontrovertable facts established in evidence, should be dealt with. It would be unfortunate if for any technical reason a new trial should be ordered of an issue the trial of which has already cost so much, and which if tried again must, as the evidence shows, eventuate in judgment for the defendants. The trial having taken place upon an assignment of facts answered by the jury, both plaintiff and defendants moved for judgment before the Court of Review, each claiming to be entitled thereto, and the defendants moved also in the alternative for a new trial. The Court of Review rejected plaintiff's motion for judgment and ordered a new trial. From this judgment the plaintiff, insisting still that he was entitled to judgment in his favour, appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench at Quebec. By this appeal the case was again, we think, at large before the Court of Queen's Bench which court should have pronounced the judgment which should have been pronounced by the Court of Review on the original motions. That court reversed the judgment of the Court of Review and granted the plaintiffs motion for judgment. From that judgment the defendants now appeal to this court, and we are bound to give the judgment which, we are of opinion, should have been given by the Court of Queen's Bench and by the Court of Review upon the original motions for judgment in that court; and for the reasons already given we are of opinion that judgment cannot be rendered in favour of the plaintiff.\nThen as to the defendants' motion for judgment there are only three questions of the jury the answers to which appear to require consideration; the answers of the jury to the other questions relating to the issue under consideration are in perfect accord with the evidence as given by the plaintiff and releed upon by the defendants. As to these latter questions the jury in substance say '.\u2014\n1. That the policy sued upon was issued by the defendants and that the plaintiff is the Joseph Napoleon Anctil mentioned in the policy:\u20142. That the said policy was issued upon an application signed by Pettigrew with his mark:\u20143. That the plaintiff wrote the name of Pettigrew to the application:\u20144. That Pettigrew's name was written by the plaintiff with the consent of Pettigrew:\u20145. That Pettigrew at the time of setting his name to the application was a poor man not having any means whatever: \u2014 6. That plaintiff paid all the premiums which were paid:\u2014 7. That before the issuing to the plaintiff of the policy sued upon the defendants had upon the said application issued a policy payable to Pettigrew or his representatives, and that the plaintiff refused to accept that policy and in substitution for it had exacted the policy sued upon. All these answers are in perfect accord with the contention of the defendants and with the evidence as given by the plaintiff himself and on his behalf by Michaud in support of defendants' contention. The only questions, the answers to which require any consideration, are the 6th, 8th and 9th in the assignment of facts prepared before the trial for submission to the jury. The first of these is a question submitted to the jury immediately after and in close context with questions relating to the signing of the application which elicited the answers of the jury to the effect that the application was signed by Pettigrew with his x mark, his name having been subscribed thereto by the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff's wife had subscribed as a witness in her maiden name and that at the time of its having been so signed Pettigrew was a poor man without any means whatever. Then is put the 6th question for the purpose plainly of eliciting the opinion of the jury upon the question whether, from the manner of procuring the signature of Pettigrew to the application it was or was not the plaintiff who was applying for an insurance to himself for his own benefit upon Pettigrew's life; the question is\u2014\nEst-il vrai que c'est le demandeur lui-m\u00eame qui a fait ainsi assurer la vie du dit Antoine Pettigrew?\nWas it the plaintiff who \u201c ainsi \u201c that is, who thus by this mode of getting Pettigrew's signature to the application who was for his own benefit proposing to insure Pettigrew's life; to which the jury answer:\nNon, c'est Antoine Pettigrew lui-m\u00eame qui s'est fait assurer.\nThe plain meaning of which answer appears to he that it was Pettigrew himself who was applying for a policy of insurance to be issued to himself upon his own life. We are not concerned at present to inquire whether that answer so relating to the time of the application being signed by Pettigrew could be supported upon the whole of the evidence, for it has no relation to the policy sued upon, as plainly appears by the answer of the jury to another question wherein they have found as a fact, as already mentioned, that although the defendants prepared a policy intended to be issued to Pettigrew in pursuance of the application and purporting to be entered into with him and his representatives, yet upon its being brought to the plaintiff he refused to accept it and exacted the issuing of the policy sued upon, to himself alone, thus in very substance adopting the evidence of the plaintiff himself, who, when Michaud brought to him the first policy (because it was entered into with Pettigrew and his representatives he refused to accept it), adding in his own language,\nJ'ai exig\u00e9 que si la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse voulait \u00e9maner une police payable \u00e0 moi directement Que je paierais les primes autrement que je n'en voulais pas.\nThe jury have thus substantially found as a fact that (whatever may have been Pettigrews intention in signing the application) that intention was never carried into effect but was frustrated by the plaintiff insisting that a policy should be issued upon Pettigrew's application entered into with the plaintiff himself alone in his own name for his own benefit, which ras accordingly done as appeared by the policy sued upon, and such policy must in law be held to be null and void unless the plaintiff had an insurable interest in Pettigrew's life. The answers of the jury to questions 8 and 9 relate to the insurable interest which the plaintiff had, if he had any, on Pettigrew's life. The 8th inquires whether there was any family relationship existing between Pettigrew and the plaintiff, and if yea, what relationship? To which the jury, answer: \"Yes; a remote affinity.\" The 9th question was plainly put upon the assumption that the policy sued upon was entered into with the plaintiff himself for his own benefit, upon Pettigr\u00e9w's life. It is: \"Had the plaintiff an interest other than that of affinity to insure for his own benefit the life of Pettigrew as he has done?\" to which the jury answer, \" Yes; as protector.\" As to these answers it is sufficient to say that they do not establish that the plaintiff had an insurable interest in the life of Pettigrew and the evidence plainly showed that he had not.\nUpon the whole therefore we are of opinion that as by the terms of the policy it plainly appears that it was entered into with the plaintiff in his own name for his own benefit, and by the plaintiff's own evidence that it was never intended by him that it should be otherwise, and as it appears that the answers of the jury to all the questions submitted to them bearing upon the issue under consideration are in perfect accord with such terms of the policy and such evidence of the plaintiff himself, and as it appears by the evidence and the finding of the jury upon the questions submitted to them that the plaintiff had no insurable interest in the life of Pettigrew the law pronounces the policy to be null and void, and the appeal must be allowed with costs in this court and the Court of Queen's Bench and judgment entered in the Superior Court for the defendants.\nSedgewick J.\u2014I regretfully find myself obliged to differ from the conclusions arrived at by the majority of the court in this case My opinion as to the soundness of the judgment appealed from is so strong that I feel it to be my duty to give expression to it, but under the circumstances very shortly.\nThe insurance company has set up two defences, namely, (1), misrepresentation in the application for the policy, and (2), its wagering character. The instrument sued on contains this clause:\nAfter this policy has been in force one full year it will be indisputable on any ground whatever, provided the premiums have been promptly paid, and the age of the insured admitted.\nThe death occurred after the year had expired.\nThis provision has an important bearing upon both branches of the defence, affording, as I think, in the first branch, a conclusive answer to it.\nIt is of recent origin, having in principle been first accepted by a company in England less than twenty years ago, the period of attack however being there limited to three!! years, the leading companies of Canada and the United States subsequently adopting it. In several cases the prescriptive limit has since been reduced to two years. The defendant company, more public spirited, enterprising and benevolent than its competitors has made it one. There can be no difference of opinion as to what was intended by it and as to what it really means. It was intended to preclude an insurance company upon the trial of an action against it by the holder of a policy from setting up after the death of the assured any defence except non-payment of premium, age being admitted. The defence of innocent though inaccurate representation or of wilful misrepresentation or of any species of fraud on the part of the assured was alike included, the object being to make a policy after a prescribed. lapse of time the premiums being paid, an equivalent of money; a promise to pay absolutely and at all events.\nThere have been no decisions, so far as I know in England or Canada except the one appealed from dealing with this clause and we are at liberty to consider it untrammelled by authority. Thinking as I do that it means what it says\u2014and it being admitted that it means what it says\u2014let me discuss for a moment the only answer that is set up in respect to it That answer is that any contract stipulating whether directly or indirectly that the question of fraud shall not be raised is against public policy and therefore void. Take a policy like the present where this particular clause has not been inserted. The statements made in the application for the policy form the basis of it. Any deviation from the most exact and scrupulous accuracy in answering the questions contained in the application or in the medical certificate voids the policy, no matter how long and to what amount the premiums have been paid. A representation though innocently made, if untrue, is as fatal as if wilfully made, and it has often happened that policies after having been many years in force have been defeated upon the company showing after the death of the assured that some harmless or innocent mistake had been made. Absolute accuracy of statement is a prerequisite to the indefeasibility of an insurance policy, otherwise it cannot avail in the holder's hands A security of this kind is therefore of a most precarious nature. The fact that such defences had often succeeded the possibility that such defences might still be raised, no matter the length of time during which the assured had paid his premiums was not calculated to advanee either the interests of the insurers or the insured and insurance companies began to feel the necessity of removing this manifest hindrance to the development of their business. The plan adopted was to declare that policies three years old should be incontestable for any cause whatever. The idea was that this was not taking a great risk inasmuch as no man was likely in advance to contemplate and purpose suicide at the expiration of so long a period as three years, nor was he likely to live for that length of time if he had made serious misstatements regarding his health which had also escaped the scrutiny of the company's medical officers. From their point of view the risk was indefinite, while the gain by making policies incontestable was very clear indeed. Policies for very large amounts were being taken out both in the United States and Canada, and the complaint was made that in the hands of a third party they constituted no certain security as in the event of the death of the assured the claim might be contested on any ground, good or bad, evidence being forthcoming to prove it. By making them incontestable after three years, they became an absolute security at least to the extent of their surrender value and in the event of the continuous payment of premiums for its full amount, provided the company was financially sound. It was doubtless under the influence of these considerations that the plan of inserting in life policies this kind of stipulation was generally adopted. Then as to the way the assured would view it: He doubtless would be required to pay an increased premium in consideration of what was in fact an increased risk and the inducements operating upon his mind justifying such increased payment would be the incontestability of the policy after the prescribed time, and its consequent largely increased value whether to himself in his lifetime, as a negotiable security for money, or in the event of his death to his representatives, by reason of its payment without dispute. It does not appear to me that any principle of public policy is violated by the making of such a contract. I may enter into any contract of insurance I like with an insurance company providing for the payment of a sum of money at my death. I may say: \" I will make no representations as to my age or as to the state of my health I do not propose to give you any information as to my personal habits or as to the character of my life as a risk, or as to whether in my view I shall live or die within a certain date. Find that out for yourself. All I propose to do is to pay you so much money while I live in consideration of your paying my estate so much money when I die.\" If a company chooses to enter into a contract upon those terms there is nothing to prevent them from doing so. They can make any e bargain they please. I may know that my life will not be a long one; I may not as a business man upon the terms I propose be willing to insure myself against my own death, but I am not under any obligation (legally, at all events), to make disclosure of any fact. They may or may not take the risk, and if they do take it they must abide by it. Uberrima fides not being required in this species of insurance no defence of fraud or misrepresentation would be available, for the reason that there was none.\nThen may I not say to an insurance company: \"I will pay you annually during my life such a sum of money in consideration of your paying upon my death another sum of money? In my application I have answered certain questions you have put to me. These answers may be true, or they may be untrue, but I want you to fix a time beyond which you will not go in making the inquiry. You may make it one year, or three years, or any period you like, the shorter you make it the more I will pay you; but whatever the limit is I want a certain definite time fixed so that after that I may know that my life is in fact and truth assured\" The company asks: \" Why this unusual request? \" My answer is: \" When you are called upon to pay this policy many years may have intervened. I will be dead and my executors may have to sue you. I cannot give evidence; I cannot then prove the accuracy of the statements I have now made, but you may then bring witnesses against me to show that either in some material or immaterial fact I have made a mistake or even a misstatement, and you may be able in my absence to convince the jury or the court that your allegation, though false, is true. I want to be assured that such a thing is impossible. I will not take the risk of fallible memory or of incorrect or even perjured testimony which may be produced against me when I am gone. You will be as anxious then to escape liability as you are now to secure my premiums, and I want you now to take these risks.\" And the insurance company assenting, issues the policy upon these terms. How can a contract of that kind possibly be against public policy? The company has the period specified, one, two or three years, as the case may be, within which to make inquiries as to fraud or any matter of defence, and may bring their action within that period to set the policy aside. In the event of death within that period the policy may be found void. The ordinary law during the prescribed period as to the absolute accuracy of the application and of the statements made therein has full effect. But after that period it is just is if no formal application had been made at all leno representations true or false had been made\u2014but as if the policy had been issued without them. After the lapse of the term of prescription they are all swept out of the bargain. The policy is a tabula rasa as far as they are concerned the contracting parties understanding that thereupon it has become indisputable. Can there be anything against public policy in such an arrangement? Nay, rather is it not much more against public policy to allow a company that has entered into such a contract, that has year after year taken the premiums of the assured and has allowed him to act upon the faith of it, he borrowing, and third parties lending money upon the faith of its being what the company has in express terms said it was, \"indisputable,\" after his death to repudiate it altogether by resurrecting these stipulations which had fulfilled their office and become extinct it may be half a century before\u2014and one, two or three years after the issue of the policy? If public policy permits this, it becomes an aider and abettor in the most flagrant dishonesty.\nPublic policy much less requires it when we consider that from 1886 to the present time, as public statistics show, the sum total of life insurance in Canada has risen from one hundred and seventy-one millions to three hundred and twenty-seven millions, such rapid increase being no doubt largely brought about by the introduction of this very stipulation and that upon the strength of it hundreds of millions of money, on this continent at least have been loaned and borrowed. To hold it void would be by one blow to inflict a fatal wound upon the value of these securities imperilling at the same time the whole insurance interests of the continent.\nAn additional consideration leads me to the same conclusion. Suppose this policy did not contain the indisputability clause and that there had been as a matter of fact misrepresentation on the part of the assured. Let us suppose that one, two, or three years after the issue of the policy the idea forced itself upon the assured that his representatives could not recover, and he went to the insurance company and informed it of his fraud and suggested the payment of an increased premium if the stipulation in regard to it were eliminated altogether and in consideration of the increased premium the company agreed to keep the policy alive; could it under these circumstances set up the original fraud as a defence? The present is substantially a similar case. The company says: \"Upon the faith of your statements being true, and for the money you now pay us, we will insure you for one year. If within the year you die and your statements are untrue, we pay nothing, but if you live beyond the year we will insure you until you die for the annual premium, whether your statements are true or not.\" Is such an agreement contrary to public \"policy? I do not believe that in the Province of Quebec freedom of contract is handicapped by any such doctrine or that life insurance companies, or even individuals, labour under any such obnoxious disability, or that the value and security of an insurance policy whether to the assured or to a money lender is less in Quebec than in the other Provinces of Canada Another consideration influences me. According to the Code (article 993) fraud is a cause of nullity only when the party against whom it is practised would not have contracted had there been no fraud. That is elementary and natural justice. But this policy was issued and an increased premium exacted upon the assumption that there was or might be fraud on the part of the applicant. There was a time limit within which it was stipulated that advantage might be taken of the fraud, but it was also stipulated that if death occurred beyond that limit\u2014 fraud or no fraud\u2014the company would be liable. Besides I am not sure that had there been no misrepresentation\u2014had the applicant stated that he recently had had for the first time an attack of appoplexy, brought on by his intemperate habits, this company would have refused the risk. That is a question upon which there is absolutely no evidence. Successful competition, the immediate possession of premium money, and the new business, these and other considerations relating to the chances of death within the time limit might one or all have influenced the company, had accurate answers been made, and for all I know and as far as the evidence goes, the policy might nevertheless have issued. It has not conclusively been proved that the alleged \" artifices s came within the principle of \u201c dans locum contractui\u201d\nI have not expressed any opinion as to whether or not the finding of the \"jury upon the question of misrepresentation was so unreasonable that justice required that it should be set aside. Of course there was uncontradicted evidence that an untrue statement had been made but I think there is sufficient evidence to support the finding that it was not wilfully untrue. Then as to the question of this being a wager policy. With all possible respect for my brother Gwynne's carefully prepared judgment, I differ from him absolutely in his treatment of this point. There is no difference of opinion as to what a wager policy is, or as to the fact that courts of justice will not enforce it. Divergence of view, however, occurs as to the application of facts to the admitted law. I think the evidence here conclusively proves that Pettigrew insured his own life for his own benefit, obtaining from Anctil money to pay the premium, and Anctil advancing it induced to do so by the fact that he, being made the beneficiary would be comparatively secure, as he was assured that in the event of three annual payments a paid-up policy would be issued. Prima facie, upon the documentary evidence, Pettigrew insured his own life. It is not the case of a man having no interest in the life of another insuring that life for his own benefit. If Anctil had been the original mover in this matter, if he had gone to the insurance agent and had instituted the negotiations which eventually led to the execution of the contract, that would have been important in showing that Pettigrew was a mere tool or instrument for the purpose of carrying out his design. But the application was made by Pettigrew after the company's agent had asked him to insure and he had come to Anctil and had his promise\u2014based upon what consideration is immaterial\u2014that he would see that the premium was paid. The security which Anctil took for the repayment of the insurance moneys was the provision that in case of death the policy should be paid to him, an ordinary and common thing in case of life insurance. There is nothing to prevent one from insuring his life, making the policy payable in the event of death to an absolute stranger, as is common in many places making it payable to a university or a public charitable institution. The fact that Anctil was named the beneficiary is in itself of no consequence in determining the character of the policy. It is not in my view arguable that the contract was in the present case, as a matter of law between Anctil and the company. The contracting parties were Pettigrew and the company, Anctil being, in the event of death, the beneficiary. The contention that Anctil alone was interested in the policy is absolutely refuted by the provisions of it. It is true that in the event of death the money was payable to Anctil, but in the event of the assured living until the 5th of May, 1909, then the tontine provisions of the policy took effect, and he, Pettigrew, then being the legal holder of the policy, as he was at the time of his death, would be entitled to the cash, or the paid up insurance, or the annuity or other benefits provided for thereby.\nIn Pettigrew's application for insurance (made a part of the policy) he says that in the event of death the policy is to be paid to Anctil, but he is equally explicit in his statement that the payment is to be made to himself at the expiration of the tontine period. The finding of the jury upon this point was in my view justified by the evidence, and even if I thought the weight of evidence was the other way, under the circumstances, we should not disturb it. But I am also of opinion that this defence is not such a defence as, having in view the indisputability clause, this company can set up. It is one of the grounds which insurance companies frequently raise as a defence, but it is equally a ground which the company has precluded itself from setting up under the clause in question. If the policy was subject to this vice, it was a vice into which they were bound to inquire within the prescribed period. Not having made that inquiry then they are precluded now from making it, and all the more so since it is undisputed that the company's agent was perfectly familiar with all the facts relating to this branch of the case and communicated these facts to the head office of the company before the policy issued. I admit that a court of justice will not enforce a wagering policy, no matter what agreement may be come to between the parties. Courts will not enforce immoral or illegal contracts and if such appears to be the character of the transaction from evidence properly adduced in the course of a trial then they ought to refuse to give effect to it, leaving the parties in statu quo. In the present case upon proper principles of pleading the plea in relation to wager should have been struck out as well as the plea in respect of misrepresentation, and all the evidence on both points was irrelevant. Had the evidence been excluded the court would have had no material in the present case upon which they could find upon the question of wager, the documentary evidence all being the other way and therefore could not on its own motion dismiss the action upon that ground. Circumstances might arise at a trial justifying a court in making a special inquiry as to the real character of a suspicious contract; but I do not think that in a case like the present the conduct of the insurance company being as it was, the court should be too astute in finding reasons to support a suggestion that possibly the instrument sued on was a wagering policy\nIn Quebec under a practice unknown in other parts of Canada, one not a party to but beneficially interested in a contract may enforce it, our English doctrine of privity not prevailing. It is by virtue of this that Anctil is plaintiff in the present action. I do not however understand that it necessarily follows that he becomes entitled to the amount of the judgment irrespective of the claim of the legal representatives of Pettigrew and they may still be entitled to call him to account, allowing him to retain thereout his advances and reasonable interest.\nIn dealing with this case I may perhaps have gone beyond the record in discussing the i indisputability \" clause, but I have referred generally to its object and history as courts have frequently done in discussing stipulations crystalized by usage into definite shape, the \" sue and labour \" clause in marine policies, for example, or the \" restraint upon anticipation \" clause in marriage settlements.\nOne other observation I may make. I have assumed in this discussion that there was a policy an actual contract both in law and in fact\u2014an agreement or consensus of thought between the parties of which the instrument in question was but the written expression and evidence, and it is only to such a case that this opinion applies.\nIn my view the judgment of the court appealed from should be sustained.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court of Lower Canada sitting in Review at Montreal ([1]), which affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Ottawa, maintaining the plaintiffs action with costs.\nThe plaintiff claimed title and possession of certain mining rights and also 40 tons of mica, excavated by the defendant and lying at the pit's mouth. The defendant alleged that plaintiff was a purchaser in bad faith of litigious rights; that defendant owned by good title and by prescriptive possession; that the deeds on which plaintiff relied were absolute nullities, and that the defendant held in good faith, and, if evicted was entitled to retain the mica extracted, as representing fruits and revenues, on paying a rate per ton. A last plea made the usual claim for improvements made under mistake of title.\nThe defence of litigious rights was accompanied by a tender and deposit of $1,000, the amount paid by plaintiff, and prayed that defendant might be subrogated in all his rights. This plea was dismissed and by the final \"judgment the trial court declared plaintiff owner of the mining rights and entitled to possession of the mica, on paying the cost of output.\nBoth parties claimed title through the late Maurice Foley, the Crown patentee. Plaintiff relied on the following chain of title:\u20141. Original indenture under private seals before one witness executed 14th November, 1872 at Hull, Province of Quebec, and registered on the 16th of the same month, whereby Maurice Foley leased to T. P. French the mining rights in question for 99 years. The consideration was a yearly payment of one shilling and a royalty of six per cent on the output. The signatures of the parties were attacked that of Maurice Foley being made with a ( X ) cross:\u2014 2. An indenture under private seals before one witness executed 25th November, 1873 (registered 31st December, 1873), at Ottawa, in Ontario, whereby Maurice Foley leased the same mining rights for ninety-nine years on somewhat modified terms to T. P. French. The original of this document was lost, but the signatures were also attacked, that of Maurice Foley appearing to have been made with a ( X ) cross:\u20143. Maurice Foley died on the 16th of April,1874, Michael Foley being his sole heir; T. P. French died on the 18th November, 1890, and his son and daughter succeeded to his title: \u20144. An original indenture, under private seals, in presence of two witnesses, executed October 28th, 1892, at Toronto and Ottawa, registered 28th September, 1893, whereby the heirs French sold all their rights to plaintiff.\nThe defendant relied upon 1\u2014An indenture of sale under private seals before one witness from Michael Foley as sole representative of his father, conveying the same mineral rights to Pierce Mansfield, dated 9th January, 1875,. registered 1st February, 1875, the original also said to be lost; and 2\u2014An indenture, under private seals, dated 26th September, 1892, at Ottawa whereby Pierce Mansfield sold said rights to defendant, signed and sealed in the presence of two witnesses, and registered in due course.\nThe farm on which the mines exist always remained the property and residence of the Foley family, who only parted with the minerals, but neither Maurice nor his son Michael ever prospected for minerals subsequent to the purchase by T. P. French. French worked a baryta mine in 1874, 1875, and 1877 and claimed the mineral rights from 1872 until his death in 1892 and this active exercise of title was continued by his heirs. In 1878 there appeared to have been a contract made whereby Michael Foley agreed with T. P. French to get out 100 tons of phosphate. The defendant's vendors do not appear to have exercised continuous or even isolated acts of ownership but there was some proof of an indefinite character that T. P. French was present at the passing of the deed by Michael Foley to Mansfield, although it does not appear that he assented to the deed. On the other hand at a later date French appeared to have warned Mansfield not to buy from Michael Foley as the mines were not his to sell. Defendant however took possession of the mines and got out the mica which was seized on the institution of the plaintiff's action.\nThe $1,000 deposited with the plea as to purchase of litigious rights was seized while in court for costs due the plaintiff's attorney (par distraction des frais), and a portion paid to him under an order of the court.\nGeoffrion Q.C. for the appellant. The plaintiff's title rests on two indentures which do not bear the signature of the vendor, but only his alleged cross, and executed in presence of but one witness. These deeds do not constitute a commencement de preuve par ecrit, capable of supplement by parol evidence of identification or execution; they are absolute nullities incapable of legal registration which, having nevertheless been registered, were properly ignored by defendant. Arts. 2134, 2137 0. C.; C. S. L. C. c. 37 ss. 56-58; McKenzie v. Jolin ([2]); Neveu v. de Bleury ([3]); Querette dit Latulippe v. Bernard ([4]). Cross-marks are not valid as signatures in deeds of land. The defendant's open and adverse possession was notice of the litigious character of the claim of French's heirs which plaintiff bought at his risk, and the latter at best can demand only restitution of the price tendered with defendant's plea. Arts. 1582 & 1583 C. C. Brady v. Stewart ([5]). The vilet\u00e9 de prix shows that the plaintiff was speculating on the disputed title, trusting by litigation to secure a valuable mine with an output, in mica alone, of several thousand dollars per year for a few hundred dollars risked to obtain a colourable title. French abandoned his possession to Mansfield and acquiesced in the deed by Michael Foley to him, tacitly ratifying it by his presence at its execution without making objections.\nLafleur and Aylen for the respondent. There is no law in the province of Quebec requiring a documert, otherwise available as a private writing or as a commencement of proof in writing, to disclose the presence of two subscribing witnesses, on pain of nullity. The statute, 19 V. c. 15, s. 4 (Can.) authorizes signatures of illiterate persons by a cross-mark. The lex rei sit\u00e6 rules, art. 6 C. C. See also Trudeau v. Vincent ([6]), and cases there collected in the judgment of Mr. Justice Davidson. The indenture of the 14th of November, 1872, between Maurice Foley and the late T. P. French, followed by registration, and by effective acts of possession and ownership, was a commencement of proof in writing, and is fully supplemented by the evidence. Arts. 1225, 1233 C. C. The seizin of heirs operates by law alone in the province of Quebec ([7]).\nThe appellant and his vendors had constructive notice of a prior title on file in the registry office at the time of their purchase as well as actual notice of French's title. They were in bad faith from the beginning and no indemnity for improvements can be allowed. They were usurpers holding by violence; trespassers against the true owner of the mines. The plea of litigious rights is based on defendant's own bad faith and violence, and there is no longer any deposit under the control of the court available to support the tender. The title was not in question in any pending litigation when plaintiff purchased The trespasses and usurption by defendant and his vendors cannot form the basis of a plea setting up a purchase of litigious rights. Arts. 1583, 1584 C. C. Chartrand v. City of Sorel ([8]). After issue had been joined the appellant asked that the plea of litigious rights should be first heard. His motion was granted a special trial had and the plea was dismissed on the ground that the title was clear being only two removes from the Crown grant. The court ordered that the evidence taken at that trial should apply to the whole case, Other witnesses were then examined and the case heard upon the merits, the judgment on the plea of litigious rights approved and the action maintained.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.\u2014The controversy in this case is upon the title to certain mines and minerals in the Township of Hull. The Superior Court and the Court of Review both held that the plaintiff, present respondent, is the rightful owner. The defendant now appeals.\nThe respondent's declaration alleges that by deed executed and registered on the 28th day of October, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-two, John McLean French and Anna Montague French sold to him the said respondent all the mines and minerals in question of which the said John McLean French and Anna Montague French had inherited from the late Thomas Patrick French, their father, who had acquired them by two deeds, one of the fourteenth day of November, 1872, and one of the 25th November, 1873, (registered respectively 16th November, 1872, and 31st December, 1873,) from Maurice Foley, the Crown's grantee. He then alleges possession under these conveyances, and trespass by appellant with usual conclusions au p\u00e9titoire.\nThe appellant met this action, first by a plea of litigious rights with tender and deposit, and second by a plea claiming title under a sale to him of 26th September, 1892, registered 4th October, 1892, by one Mansfield, who had purchased on 9th January, 1875, (registered on 1st February, 1875) from Michael Foley, the universal legatee of Maurice Foley, who died in 1874, the same Maurice Foley who had sold to French. These deeds of both parties are all in evidence or admitted.\nIt is found by the two courts below that up to his death in 1890, from the time of his purchase from Maurice Foley in 1872, or soon thereafter Thomas Patrick French had been in open and undisturbed possession of these mines; that his heirs had continued in possession up to appellant's trespasses in 1892; that neither Michael Foley nor Mansfield were ever in possession as owners, and that the pretended sale by said Michael Foley to said Mansfield in 1875 had never been acted upon. There is ample evidence to support these findings, and we cannot be expected here to reverse the concurrent determination of the two courts below thereupon, though the evidence is not all one way. 1 see that it is proved by Michael Foley, and not contradicted by Mansfield, that there was no consideration, nothing whatever, paid to him by Mansfield for that sale of 1875. This is strong corroborative evidence that the parties thereto did not themselves consider their dealing as a serious sale, or as a sale at all. Mansfield would then have got these mines as a gift an assertion which I could not believe. French's presence at that dealing, whatever name be given to it and whatever may have been the reasons for it in the parties' mind, is not by itself alone, unexplained though it be, evidence that he assented to it. There is direct, though negative, evidence to the contrary in the very fact that he was not a party to it. He may very well be assumed to have been asked to agree to it and to have refused, since he was, to the knowledge of the parties (presumed in law, if not actually), the registered owner, and he continued to claim ownership as he had always done since 1872 and remained in possession. That is far from an acquiescence, or a ratification which would entail a renunciation to, or a relinquishment of his rights, which as held in the courts below, it would be unlawful to presume.\nThen the sale by Maurice to French, leaving aside the registry laws, was perfectly valid without any writing at all, even as to third parties. Arts. 1025, 1027, 1472 C. C.; Sirey, Tables Dec. [1881-1890] \" Vente,\" nos. 2 4 21 80 to 84; Sirey, Code Ann. sous art. 1582, nos. 9, 60, 98 et seq. That being so, how could Michael Foley sell or cede to Mansfield that which he never had? His father, Maurice, cannot have left in his succession, or have bequeathed, what he had parted with in his lifetime. Michael Foley, then, sold what clearly did not belong to him. And such a sale is, in law, not only voidable, but void, radically null, of a nullity of non esse. Art. 1487 C. C. This is, no doubt, as to third parties, subject to the registry laws, art 1480 C. C. But these do not add to Mansfield's title, as the sale to French is registered before his purchase.\nIf it was the land itself that had been sold by Maurice to French, and the sale registered, could Michael have hypothecated it in 1875 to Mansfield? Could Mansfield if it had been done, have brought an hypothecary action against French? It seems to me impossible to contend that any such action could have been maintained. This is the same question or very nearly so, in another form, but I think it helps to show how groundless are appellant's pretensions to a title from Mansfield. Another form of testing appellant's rights: If Mansfield had bought this lot himself from Maurice or from Michael would not the duly registered charge upon it created in favour of French have remained in full force and effect? Would he not have acquired subject to French's duly registered rights?\nFurther as at the time of this pretended sale in 1875 by Michael Foley to Mansfield, French was the registered owner. Article 2089 C.C., as to preference from priority of registration, has full application. Article 2098 C. C. also necessarily implies that when a deed conveying an immovable is registered, this conveyance may be invoked against any third party who has purchased the same from the same vendor. Now here French and Mansfield derive their titles from the same person, for, in law, Maurice and Michael are one and the same person. Michael is by the law of the province, the continuation of Maurice's personality, and, as such, the garant of French. If French and Michael Foley, or French and Mansfield, had gone to law about this title it seems to me unquestionable that French's claim would have prevailed. And if so, the respondent, who holds under French, has a good title, and, a converso, the appellant has no title, because Mansfield had none. Girault v. Zuntz (), Verdier, Transc. Hyp. nos. 306 307 308 323 326 364, 365. As to appellant's technical objections to the sales by Maurice Foley to French, they should have been specially pleaded, and it is because they were not, we must assume, that they are not noticed in the judgement of the Superior Court. However they were noticed in the court appealed from to be dismissed, after an elaborate review by Davidson J for the court of the questions raised thereby. We do not think it necessary to add anything to it. It would require a very strong case indeed, one stronger than the appellant has been able to make, to justify us in upsetting a well settled jurisprudence, and one upon which it is obvious the validity of a large number of titles must depend. If not by themselves complete, these private writings certainly amount, by the law of the Province, to a commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit, as held by the Court of Review, and that is sufficient, upon the further evidence adduced, to uphold the sale to French. His vendor's legal representative admits the sale, and the registration with the possession completes the evidence.\nIf it had been necessary to pass upon the second of French's purchases from Maurice Foley that of 25th November, 1873, of which the original writing is lost, I would probably have found more legality in the proof of it by the copy from the Registry Office, than the Court of Review seems to have. Arts. 1218 1233 C. C. nos. 6, 7; Sirey, Code Ann art. 1325, nos. 52 54 60 77. However, both courts have rested the respondent's title upon the sale of the 14th November, 1872 and that being sufficient to dispose of the controversy between the parties, it is unnecessary for us to go further than the courts below have done.\nAnother ground perhaps upon which these objections to the sales by Maurice Foley to French might be disposed of is that they are not open to the appellant because he holds under Michael Foley through Mansfield, and Michael Foley is, as representative of Maurice, French's garant, and respondent's arri\u00e8re garant. Michael could not, any more than Maurice could have done in his lifetime be admitted to invoke irregularities of a title of which he is the garant. \u201cQuem de evictione tenet actio eumdem agentem repellit exceptio.\u201d Pothier, Vante, 165 et seq. French and the respondent, if attacked by him on that ground, would meet him by the demand of a valid deed if one was necessary. Can the appellant be in a better position than his vendor? Non debeo melioris conditionis esse quam actor meus a quo jus ad me transiit.\nWhen sued en garantie by appellant (as he has been) could Michael Foley plead that French's purchase from Maurice of which he, Michael, is the garant, is not valid because of the irregularities upon which these objections are based? Or, take up the fait et cause of appellant, and plead these irregularities in answer to the respondent's action? Compare Troplong, Hypotheques nos. 524, 527, 580.\nAs to the plea of litigious rights, it does not seem to me to be a serious one, and it was rightly dismissed three times in the courts below. I am not sure if it comes up at all upon this appeal. To call Judge Grill's judgment rejecting it an interlocutory judgment seems to be a misapplication of that term. Was that not a final judgment on that issue? A final judgment upon the merits of that plea? If the court had maintained the plea, that would clearly have been a final judgment. Why a judgment dismissing it is not as final as to that issue is not evident to me. This is not the ordinary case of an interlocutory judgment. If it was given on a part only of the issues in the case it is due to a singular intervertion of the appellant's pleas. Instead of pleading to the merits of the action first and his plea of litigious rights as a subsidiary one to be adjudicated upon only if he did not obtain the dismissal of the action upon his first pleas, he pleaded litigious rights first, and his answers to the merits of the action as subsidiary pleas. Then, upon his special application, by order of the court, the issue on the plea of litigious rights was first tried. No doubt, the respondant cannot complain if his adversary, diffident perhaps of his chances to get the action dismissed was \"willing to pay him one thousand dollars without entering on the merits. But I do not see that by applying for a separate trial on this plea, the appellant got the right not to treat the judgment upon it as a final one on that issue when adverse to him. After that judgment, the case went on to trial on the action, and that the same court could be asked again to pass upon an issue it had already tried and determined would certainly seem an anomaly. And if that could not be done, the merit of that plea is not now before us. If the Superior Court had dismissed the respondent's action upon the merits would, upon an appeal by him, the judgment in his favour upon the plea of a litigious right have been reopened? However, assuming the point to be still open to the appellant, there is nothing in it. He cannot be admitted to controvert a right theretofore uncontroverted, and upon the only ground of his own litigation which in law, is without any foundation, defeat the respondent's unquestionable rights. There was no controversy no litigation spoken of, before the appellant's purchase from Mansfield. French's rights were neither uncertain and disputed, nor disputable, and they did not become uncertain, or disputed, nor disputable in law till the appellant disputed them in this case. It was he who bought for the purpose of litigation, as held by the Superior Court. His own purchase shows this by the fact that Mansfield, his vendor, specially stipulated no warranty, and that he would not even be obliged to refund the price if appellant did not get the property.\nAccording to appellant's theory, any trespasser might, by his sole act of trespass, hinder the sale of a property by one who has been in open and undisturbed possession as owner for ten, twenty, or more years. Then by Art. 1583, C. C. it is by the debtor that a right must be disputed or disputable to give it the litigious character necessary to oblige its assignee to surrender it. Is there any such thing in this case as a right disputed by the debtor? Has the law as to litigious rights any application, even if under the Quebec Code it applies to anything else than sales of debts and rights of action? Huc, Transmission des cr\u00e9ances, nos. 615, 618.\nI would hold this plea to be untenable Further the deposit of $1000 made with it is not now in court. The appellant, in his factum says that it has been paid to the respondent himself for costs to which the appellant had been condemned. But that is an error, though I do not see that it would make any difference; it has been paid over to the third party, the procureur distrayant. 3 Baudry-Lacantinerie, Droit Civil, no. 650. However, this is without importance in this case. We are of opinion that the appeal must fail on the merits of both issues.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs\nSolicitor for the appellant: W. R.

The cases were consolidated after joinder of the issues in the trial court and were heard together in both courss below and on the appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nAtwater Q.C. and Duclos for the appellant. The ship was chartered for the voyage in question by the Columba Steamship Company. The charter party is produced and it is proved that the ship was being operaedd for the benefit of the Columba line and not for the Grlengoll Steamship Company, who though owners of the vessel had parted with her possession and control for this voyage. The Columba Company were, for the purposes of the voyage, pro hac nice owners, and the captain was subject to their orders and control. The Glengoil Steamship Company did not contract with the respondents, nor were they the carriers. The bills of lading were issued by the Columba Steamship Company for the carriage of goods ostensibly by their ship, and were signed by their own agents at Antwerp. Even presuming they had signed as agents for the captain, the captann himself, for the purpose of this voyage, was agent of the Jolumba line The Columba line secured the freight, contracted for the carriage of the goods, received the con sideration for this carriage, issued its own bills of lading. Arts. 2391, 2408 C.C.; Frazer v. Marsh ([3]);\nGolvin V. Newberry ([4]) * Marquand V Banner ([5]);\nBaumwoll Manufactur von Scheibler v. Furness ([6]).\nThe conditions in the bill of lading constitute an express contact and do not fall within art. 1676 C. C. which applies merely to noticss. The conditions are reasonabee and can be validly stipulated; Mongenais v Allan ([7]) ' Moore v. Harris ([8]); Trainor v. The Black Diamond Steamship Co. ([9]); Ohrloff v. Briscalt ([10]); Shuw v. North Pennsylvania Railroad Co. ([11]); Pollard v. Vinton ([12]); see remarks by Lord Usher, M. R., at page 479 in Leduc v. Ward ([13]). I tis a self-evident fact that glass is an extremely difficult cargo to handle, and one which carriers will only accept under express and special conditions. We contend that the stowage was sufficient but that the cases in which the glass had been packed bythe shippers were too slight, being made of thin soft wood, and no precautions were taken to keep it from moving within these cases. The stowage was done by competent stevedores at Antwerp, and was as well done as it could be under the circumstances and having regard to the natuee of the goods. Soem question was raised as to the propriety of putting sand at the bottom, and the breakage was attributed to the sand sinking, and thus allowing the cases of glass to fall beneath the bottom of the combings of the hatch; but according to the evidence of the Port Warden of Montreal, who made the examination of the cargo as soon as the hatches were taknn off and gave a certificats of the breakage, the sand had not shifted. and sand is a first-class foundation. The shippers were aware of the method of stowage adopted and were satisfied with it.\nEven if the loss or damage were caused by negligence or fault of any persons for whom the appellants are responsible, there is a valid contract exempting them from liability and the respondents are estopped from complaining of improper stowage. There was no improper stowage nor any fault nor negligence, and the damage was due to the perils of the sea, and there is no liability. Art. 1072 C. C. Packard v. The Canadian Pacific Railway Co. ([14]). It is true that the Quebec courts have held against the validity of contracts for exemption from liability for negligence, but in this case the law of the flag rules, and as the \" Glengoil \" is a British ship the rules of the English law must prevail.\nMacmaster Q.C. for the respondents (Farquhar Mac-lennan with him). As to the liabiltty of the ship, not-withstanding the charter party, we refer to Baumwoll Manufactur von Scheibler v. Furness ([15]); Manchester Trust v. Furness ([16]); Hayn v. Culliford ([17]); Sandenan v. Scurr ([18]); Leary v. United States ([19]). This charter-party did not give the charterers \" exclusive control and navigation \" of the ship. Art. 2391 C. C. It was a contract to render a particular servcee for a fixed amount in money, the owners retaining the control and possession of the ship, and we had no notice of charter-party.\nThe action arose in the Province of Quebcc where the delivery of the goods was contracted for. Arts. 1674, 1675, 2383 (8) 2390; 2409, 2413 C. C. declare the law and there is no proof of any foreign law applicable to the case. The master is obliged to stow and care for the cargo, arts. 1672, 1675, 2424 & 2427 C. C, and to deliver the goods, art. 2428 C. C. The owneRs are responsible for the acts of the master, arts. 2389 & 2390; Steel v. State Line Steamship Co. ([20]). The Dominion Act ([21]) founded upon 37 Vict. ch. 25, does not interfere with the provisions ot the Civil Code. The mere notice by conditions indorsed on the bill of lading does not bind the shippers; art. 1676 C. C. Carriers cannot stipulate against responsibility for faults of themselves or their employees. Chemin de fer d'Orl\u00e9ans v Barbezat ([22]); Chemin de fer de l'Ouest v. Savaglio ([23]) and references in note. No one can free himself from responsibility for his own faullt see Sirey & Gilbert Code de Commerce, art. 98, nos. 79-84. Such a contract is forbidden by law and contra bonos mores arts. 989 990, 1062, 1064 C. C. No fortuitous event occurred in this case the fault of the defendants alone caused the damages, arts. 1200-1202 C. C. A condiiion of non-warranty does no more than to shift the burden of pro\u00f3f. Chemin de fer Paris-Lyon, etc. v. Abegy ([24]); see also authorities cited in Dalloz, Table Dec. 1877-1887 vo. \" Commissionnaire,\" nos. 79-85, and Sirey, Table Dec. 1881-1890, vo. \" Chemin de fer.\" ([25]); Cheminde fer del'Est, etc. v. Chuchu, etc. ([26]); Compagnie Anonyme de Navigation v. Akoun ([27]); Vatin Blanchard-Ducheene ([28]).\nThe jurisprudence of the Province of Quebec is uniform and unbroken that the carrier cannot contract himseff out of this liability, and it is quite in line with the French jurisprudence. Samuel v. Edmonstone ([29]); Hutton v. Grand Trunk Railway Go. ([30]); Allan v. Wood-ward ([31]) ' Watson v. Montrell Telegraph Go ([32]); Riche-lieu or Ontario Navigation Co. v. Fortier ([33]); Great North-Western Telegraph Co. v Laurence ([34])i Mow-genais v. Allan ([35]); Gauthier v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co. ([36]). Even supposing that there could be such exemption from liability, that exemption would have to be made in the most express terms. The general exemption in favour of the \" ship\" is altogether too indefinite in this bill of ladino?. The \" ship \" does not mean the owners, and certainly it does not mean the master and employees of the vessel. The law, in the Untted States; (Liverpool and Great Western Steamship Co v. Phoenix Insurance Co. ([37]) * New York Central Railrodd Co, v. Lockwood ([38]);) in France and in the Province of Quebec, is that the clause exempting the carrier from liability for his faults or those of his employees, is contrary to public order and cannot be invoked as an exemption from liability where fault is proved.\nThe cases of Peek v. The North Staffordshire Railway Co. ([39]); Doolan v. The Midland Railway Co ([40]); Robertson v. The Grand Trunk Railway Co. ([41]);\nThe Grand Trunk Railway Go. v. Vogel ([42]); and in Re Missouri Steamship Co. ([43]) were decided under different circumstances and. laws from those prevailing in the Province of Quebec, which govern the present case\u2014lex loci contract\u00fbs not being pleaddd or proved.\nThe cases in which the glass was shipped were sound and sufficient and were the ordinary cases for shipping glass. The captain failed to carefully arrange and stow the glass ana aia not attena to its stowage but left it to his mate who knew nothing about the stowage of glass, and who never carried a cargo of glass before. The glass on arrival was found to have sunk down from eighteen inches to over three feet which sinking, in the absenee of sufficintt bracing, allowed the glass to fall down and get broken The surveyors all condemned the stowage. The respondents in both cases submit that even if the burden of proof of negligence should be upon them, it is clear that there was gross neglect of duty on the part of the master and crew in respect of the stowing and arranging of the cargo, and that the injury can only be attributed to that cause.\nThe judgment of the court, in both cases, was delivered by:\nTaschereau J.\u2014The plaintiffs, present respondents, allege that the appellants are respectively owners and master of the steamship \" Glengoil;\" that on 14th May, 1898, appellants received at Antwerp, in Belgium, in good order and condition, for carriage to Montreal certain cases of plate glass, the property of the respond ents; that the appellants took the glass on board the steamer, and acting through their duly authorized agents, issued bills of lading therefor to the respondents' order; that the master, Gray, and the crew and men under him were guilty of fault, negligence and want of care in arranging and stowing the glass, and did not safely, properly or sufficinntly stow it; that owing to the improper and insufficient stowage, and to the fault of the appellants the glass was damaged during the voyage to the extent of $3,667.11 *; and that the respondents had a privllege upon the steamer for this sum and were entitled to a conservatory attachment on tne vessel to secure it.\nThe appellants severed in their defence, but each pleaded four similar pleas:\nFirst\u2014A general denial;\nSecondly\u2014That there was no privity of contract betwenn the parties inasmuch as the steamer had been chareered for the voyage in questinn to the \" Columba Line, \" and the contratt for the carriage of the goods was with the \" Columba Line;\"\nThirdly\u2014That by the terms of the bills of lading, it was provided that the glass was carried only on condition that the ship was not liable for breakage whether from negligence, rough handling or any other cause whatever; and, further, that it was a condition of the bill of lading that the owness were exempt from perils of the sea and from damage arising from the nature of the goods or accidenss of navigation even when caused by the fault of the master or other servanss of the owners;\nFourthly\u2014That the glass was properly stowed and the stowage was approvdd by the respondents, shippers and representatives in Antwerp; that the damage was due to the insufficiency of the cases or packages containing the glass, and to accidents of navggation caused by tempestuous weather during the voyage.\n[Reporter's Note.\u2014The claim for damages in the Pilkington case was $3,667.01 and in the Ferguson case $3,830.] The trial judge found as a matter of fact that the damage suffered by the respondents was due to negligent and insufficient stowage of the glass, as alleged in the statement of claim. The Court of Appeal has concurred in that finding. There is evidence to support it and in accordance with a well settled jurisprudence the appellants cannot expect us to reverse it There is nothing in the case to take it out of the general rule as to appeals from conflicting evidence.\nAs to the appellants plea of no privity of contract, on the ground that the ship had been chartered by the \" Columba Line,\" we disposed of it at the hearing. The courts below rightly held that the appellant com\"-pany had the exclusive control and navigation of the ship during this particular voyage ([44]), and that the respondents had contracted with them, and with them only Sandeman v. Scurr ([45]); Manchester Trust v. Furness ([46]).\nAs to appellants' contention that the stowage had been approved of by the respondents' agents, it is not supported by the evidence, and the judgment appealed fron rightly rejected it. In law, the mere fact that the shipper knew how the goods were being stowdd does not alone excuse the shipowner from negligence. Hutchison v. Gulon ([47]).\nThe judgment appealed from also rejected the third of the appellants' pleas, based upon the stipulation in the bill of lading that the glass was carried only on the condition that the ship was not liable for breakage whether from negligence, rough handling or any other cause whatever, and on condition that the owners were exempt from the perils of the sea and from damage arising from the nature of the goods or accidents of navigation, even when caused by the fault or negligence of the pilot or master, or other servants of the owner. As to this part of the judgment we think that there is error in the reason given by the court.\nThis special plea is grounded, on the stipulations of the bill of lading that:\u2014\nGlass is carried only on condition that the ship and railway companies are not liable for any breakage that may occur, whether from negligence, rough handling or any other cause whatever.\nand that:\u2014\nOwners to be exempt from the perils of the seas * * * * and not answerable for damage and losses by collisions, stranding and all other accidents of navigation, even though the damage or loss from these may be attributable to some wrongful act, fault, neglect or error in judgment of the pilot master, mariners or other servants of the ship owner; * * * * nor for breakage or any other damage arising from the nature of the gooss shipped * * * *.\nThe considerant of the Court of Appeal overruling this plea is that:\u2014\nConsidering that the appellants could not limit their responsibility in this matter by notices of conditions known to the shippers nor stipulate by contract immunity from their own fault or that of persons for whom they are responsible, such an agreement being prohibited by law. Art. 1676 C. C.\nThe learned judge who, for the court, gave the reasons for the judgment, holds that the stipulation in question is illegal, because it is immoral and contrary to public interest. Such, he says, is the uniform jurisprudene in the Province of Quebec. Assuming that to be so though in some of the cases cited at bar the distinction between notices and express contracts would appear to have been lost sight of, for us to blindly follow that jurisprudence here, though more pleasant and far less onerous, would be to forget our duties. We have to scrutinize and review it mindful always I need not say, of the high consideration it is entitled to. It strikss one as an astounding proposition, to say the least, that what is undoubtedly licit in England, under the British flag, which covers over two-thirds of the maritime carrying trade of the world, should be immoral and against public order in the Province of Quebec and that what is sanctioned by law in six of the Provinces of this Dominion should be prohibited in the seventh because of its immorality. Compare, In re Missouri Steamship Co ([48]); and Trainor v. The Black Diamond Steamshpp Co. ([49]). As well said by a learned writer in France in an elaborate review of the questonn:\u2014\nLa libert\u00e9 laiss\u00e9e aux parties contractantes, en ce qui touche la responsabilit\u00e9 des armateurs, n'a pas emp\u00each\u00e9 le commerce Anglais d'envahir le monde entier et d'\u00eatre pour notre pays un trop juste sujet d'envie. ([50])\nIs a condition in a bill of lading, stipulating that the owners will not be responsible for the negligent acts of the master, illegal and void? The Court of Appeal answers in the affirmative on the ground, as appears from their formal judgment, that such a stipulation is immoral and illegal because, being prohibited by article 1676 of the Civil Code, it is unlawful under article 990 which enacts that the consideration of a contract is unlawful when it is prohibited by law, or contrary to good morals or public order. We have come to the opposite conclusion. Far from prohibiting such a contract, this article 1676 implies that it is a perfectlv licit one- It certainly does not take away the right to expressly agree to a limitation of this liability On the contrary it impliedly admits it for if it did not exist, this enactment as to notices would altogether be a superfluous one. It merely enacts that there will be no implied contract from a notice limiting the carrier's liability even when that notice is known to the shipper, so that, without an express contract, the full liability of the carrier must be given effect to, notwithstanding such a notice and knowledge thereof by the shipper. It is not given as a new law, and nothing in the report of the codifiers gives room for the contention that an express contract of this nature was intended to he prohibited by this enactment The jurisprudence in France, though perhaps formerly not uniform, now sanctions the validity of such a contract. However, as we have come to the conclusion that the appeal tails upon another ground 1 will not here dwell more at length upon this question, nor on the issue with Grray, the captain, upon the more difficult question, under the law of the Province of Quebec of the stipulation by him of non-liability for his own negligence, though both were extensively and ably argued before us. I merely refer to the following, as containing almost all that can be said or quoted on this subject. Dalloz, 1877, 1, 449; 1877, 2, 68; Sirey, 1876, 1, 337 and note; Sirey, 1879, 1, 422, (note 1\u20142,) and 423; Dalloz, 1884, 1,121 and note; Sirey, 1887, 2, 136; Sirey, 1888, 1, 465, and note by Lyon-Caen; Dalioz, 1894, 1, 441 and note; Pandectes Fran\u00e7aises, 1896 1, 388. An elaborate commentary on the question by Sarrut, is to be found in Dalloz, 1890, 1, 209. I refer also to Dalloz, Repertoire (Supplement), v. \"Droit Maritime\" no. 314, and to Sirey, Code de Commerce, nos. 79 et seq. under article 98 and nos. 23 et seq. under article 216; also to Lyon-Caen et Renault, Droit Commerciale, vol. 3, nos. 623 et seq.\nIn Louisiana, it was held by the Supreme Court that\nall contracts may be made, except those reprobated by law or public policy, and a contract by which one stipulates for exemption from responsibility for loss occasioned to another from the negligence of his agents or servants is not against public policy, or forbidden by law. Higgins v. New Orleans etc. Railroad Co. ([51]).\nAnd in Scotland, such a stipulation is also lawful. Henderson v. Stevenson ([52]); Gilroy v. Price ([53]).\nIn Italy it was likewise held by the Cour de Cassation at Florence ([54]) that:\nLa clause du connaissement par laquelle le propri\u00e9taire est decharg\u00e9 de la responsabilit\u00e9 des fautes du capitaine est valable.\nIn Germany and in Belgium the law on the subject is the same. Therefore, it may be fairly asked, can there be anything immoral or against public order in a law that rules not only England but also Scotland, Italy Belgium and Louisiana, where the laws are dervved from the same sources as those of the Province of Quebec?\nOn this point the appellant would be entitled to a judgment allowing the appeal and dismissing the action, as they are not liable for the neglect of their captain.\nAs to the issue with Gray, the captain, it involves the question of his right to stipulate that he would not be liable for his own negligence; on that point we do not decide, as the appeal on both issues must be dismissed, as I have intimated, upon a ground common to both, taken by the respondents, which is, that the conditions in question in the bill of lading in this case do not cover or apply to the act of negligence of the captain charged and found, the defective stowage. The stowage of goods forms part of the obligation which the carrier takes upon himself when no agreement to the contrary appears. It is a duty to be discharged by the master and the crew and one which arises upon the mere receipt of the goods for the purposes of carriage ([55]). And it is a duty which it would require an express contract to supersede or excuse. Art. 2424 C. C.; Sirey, Code Commerce, under article 222; Sandeman v. Scurr ([56]); Rayn v. Culliford ([57]) Dalloz, 1890, 1, 197.\nThen conditions of this natuee limiting the carrier's liability or relieving him from any, are to be construdd strictly and must not be extended to any cases but those expressly specified; Phillips v. Clark ([58]); Trainor v. The Black Diamond Steamship Co. ([59]). Here the condiiion that glass is to be carried without liability for breakage must be read as assuming that the glass had been properly stowed. It cannot be read as covering a defective stowage. \"Carried\" means \" during carriage,\" \" during navigation,\" \" in the course of the voyage,\" and does not cover the stowage done, of course, before the carriage begins \" The Accomac \" ([60]); Hayn v. Culliford (3); \" The Ferro \" ([61]); \" The Glenochil ([62]). The damage here, it is true, was caused during the voyage, whilst the goods were being carried, but the captain's negligence which caused this damage was prior to the voyage. The shipper relieved the ship from negligent acts of the captain or crew during the carriage, during the navigation, but on the implied condition that his goods had been properly stowed. It was unnecessary for him to stipulate expressly for a proper stowage; the law does so in such contracts. In Hay v. La Compagnie Havraise ([63]) the Cour de Cassation held in accord with the English cases I have cited, that a condition as to negligence by the captain \" en navigant le navire \" did not extend to a defective stowage of the goods. Now the word \" carried \" in this bill of lading means nothing else but \" eu navigant le-navire.\"\nThe other conditions as to \" wrongful act, fault, neglect or error in judgment, of the pilot, master, mariners or other servants\" clearly applies only to damage or loss from accidents of navigation. An accident during navigation, the result of defective stowage, is not an accident of navigation.\nAll the perils and acts covered by these two conditions in the bill of lading are subsequent to the stowage. Steel v The State Line ([64]) For in the words of RitchIe C.J. in Trainor v. The Black Diamond Steamship Co. ([65]):\u2014\nThe terms of the bill of lading, relate to the carriage of the goods on the voyage, and not to anything before the commencement of the voyage.\nI refer also to Tattersall v. The National Steamship Co. ([66]).\nA question might have arisen in the case as to which law applied to this contract, hut as no other law has been pleaded or proved, the law of the Province of Quebec governs the case, or more correctly perhaps, should I say, the law of Belgium on the subject, if that governed, must be assumed to be the same as the Quebec law.\nThe appeal will be dismissed, but, as the appellant succeeds on the principal point of law argued before us, we give no costs upon this appeal.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Atwater, Duclos & Mackie.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Macmaster & Maclennan.\n[1] Q.

C. P. Art. 427 C. P. Q. Inconsistent findings\u2014Misdirection\u2014New trial\u2014Pleading.\nIn an action to recover damages for injuries alleged to have been caused by negligence, the plaintiff must allege and make affirmative proof of facts sufficient to show the breach of a duty owed him by, and inconsistent with due diligence on the part of, the defendant, and that the injuries were thereby occasioned; and where in such an action the jury have failed to find the defendants guilty of the particular act of negligence charged in the declaration as constituting the cause of the injuries, a verdict for the plaintiff cannot be sustained and a new trial should be granted.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), ([1]) affirming the judgment of the Superior Court sitting in Review ([2]) -at Montreal, which granted the plaintiff's motion for judgment in his favour for four thousand dollars damages with interest and costs, and rejected the defendants' motion for a new trial.\nA statement of the case appears in the judgment now reported.\nLajoie for the appellants. The declaration charges the defendant with negligence under three specific heads, and that an explosion was thereby occasioned whereby the plaintiff lost the sight of both his eyes for life. The pleas were that the risk was voluntarily undertaken by the plaintiff in the nature of the work for which he had engaged and which he was accustomed to perform in the course of his trade as a mechanic, that he met with the accident through his own imprudence and direct disobedience of orders, and denial of any fault by defendants. The jury rendered a general verdict of negligence and special verdicts of no negligence on the facts in issue, except on the principal fact of the case, whether certain oakum had become wet through the negligence of appellants, to which they did not answer either affirmatively or negatively. See Thompson on Trials, ss. 2670, 2681; Faulknor v. Clifford ([3]); McQuay v. Eastwood ([4]).\nThe appellants ask for a new trial on grounds of misdirection by the trial judge in his address to the jury, and that the verdict is contrary to evidence, defective and incomplete. Art. 413 C. C. P.; Co. Litt. 227a. The trial judge's charge was in such terms as to lead the jury away from a proper appreciation of the special facts and direct their attention only to the general question of negligence, and his advice to the jury was erroneous as to facts and as to law. The verdict is exorbitant and unjust.\nTrenholme Q. C. and Ryan for the respondent. Two courts and a jury have found the prime fact of this case in the same sense, and this court should decline to re-open questions of fact so settled by both courts below: Bellechasse Election Case ([5]); Warner v. Murray ([6]); Black v. Walker ([7]); Allen v. Quebec Warehouse Co ([8]). In a matter of procedure like this, the judgment of the lower courts are not properly reviewable by this court. Gladwin v. Cummings ([9]); Grant v. \u00c6tna Ins. Co. ([10]); Dawson v. Union Bank ([11]); The Quebec Bank v. Maxham ([12]). Appellate courts will not interfere unless the verdict is unreasonable and unsupported by evidence. Art. 501 C. P. Q.; Metropolitan Railway Co. v. Wright ([13]); Paterson v. Wallace ([14]). This case depends on the question of negligence or no negligence. All other questions are of a minor or subsidiary nature Brossard v. The Canada Life Insurance Co. ([15]); Cannon v. Huot ([16]).\nThe jury, unable to find all the facts in favour of either party, made an applicaiion of the French doctrine of \"faute commune\" or comparative negligence. The court should uphold the jury. See remarks by Hall, J. rending the judgment of the court below ([17]), and cases cited in 28 Am. & Eng. Enc, pp. 386 and 419. The verdict is consistent and sufficient in form. The sub-divisions of the questions were not material to the main issues in this case. In Quebec the courts accept answers which are not affirmative or negative, if the facts to which they refer are merely upon subordinate issues. Lambkin v. The South Eastern Railway Co. ([18]); The Royal Canadian Insurance Co. v. Roberge ([19]). Negligence is a question of fact and not of law, and should be disposed of by thejury. The assignment of the fourth question went upon that assumption, and appellants acquiesced in that position by going to trial. Cannon v. Huot (6); Brossard v. The Canada Life Assurance Co. (5); Tobin v. Murison ([20]); The Canadann Pacific Railway Co. v. Robinson ([21]).\nThe issue as to contributory negligence in a jury trial is covered by a general question as to the defendant's negligence, without its being necessary to ask whether the plaintiff also was negligent. The Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Godbout ([22]). Weight should be accorded to a finding of negligence in a case of accident to an employee. The Canadian Colored Cotton Co. v. Talbot ([23]). See also Chicago and Northwestern Railway Co. v. Dunleavy ([24]) at page 143.\nInstructions by the trial judge as to burden of proof are not regarded as of law, but merely as questions of practice. Painchaud v. Bell ([25]) at page 381. When the general verdict is for the plaintiff with special findings not inconsistent therewith, the judge may set aside the special findings and allow the general verdict to stand. Monies v. Lynn ([26]); Roche v. Ladd ([27]); Billings Slate & Marble Co. v. Hanger ([28]).\nThe court should interpret the verdict as a whole, and when ambiguities seem to exist choose that interpretation which is most consistent witb the rest of the verdict, and the circumatances of the case. Sheen v. Rickie ([29]); France v. White ([30]); Emmons v. Elderton ([31]); Kempe v. Crews ([32]); Goodhue v. Grand Trunk Railway Co. ([33]); Wilson v. Grand Trunk Railway Co. ([34]); Schneider v . Boissot ([35]); The \"Alice\" v. The \"Rossita\" ([36]).\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGWYNNE J.\u2014The respondent instituted this action against the appellants for injuries sustained by him when employed as a machinist in the service of the defendants, caused, as he alleges, by the negligence of the defendants. In such an action it was necessary for the plaintiff to allege in his declaration the act or acts, whether of omission or commission, relied upon by him as the cause of the injury sustained by him, and that such act or acts constituted negligence of the defendants or of their servants for whom they were responsible. Accordingly in his declaration, after certain prefatory allegations to the effect that he had been employed to carry out the junction of the casing of a tank which the defendants were constructing in connection with the Montreal waterworks, and that he proceeded with the work inside the tank by bolting the iron work together, and that when the work was sufficiently advanced to be ready for the lead to be poured into the strip between the tank and the casing he applied to the defendants for two pounds of lead and that they only gave him one pound, which as the plaintiff alleges was insufficient, and that the defendants told the plaintiff to work upon the bolting of the sides of the junction at the outside, he then proceeds to allege the acts relied upon by him as the cause of the injury which happened to him, and the nature of the injury as follows:\n7. In obedience to such orders the plaintiff immediately began work on the outside, and while he was so employed the defendants without in any way warning the plaintiff sent other workmen to finish the pouring of the boiling lead on the unfinished part inside, although they and their managers knew that the plaintiff was working in an exposed position on the outside.\n8. The person so sent to pour the lead on the inside began to do so, when some of the boiling lead so poured came into contact with part of the oakum filling which was in a wet condition owing to the negligence of the defendants, their managers and workmen, and also to the fact that the water had penetrated to it from the water gates constructed by the defendants at the head of the said tank, the said water gates being in a defective, improper and dangerous condition due to the unworkmanlike way in which they had been put in by the defendants. 9. An explosion immediately occurred and the steam and lead therefrom in a momenss time rushed through the apperture connecting the casing with the tank and struck the plaintiff's eyes before he could save himself.\n10. After suffering excruciating pain and being confined to the hospital and to his house for a long time the plaintiff now finds himself blind in both\neyes for life as a result of the said accident.\n11. The said accident was in no way due to any act or omission on the part of the plaintiff, but was on the contrary due to the negligence of the defendants, their managers, and representatives.\n12. The defendants were in particular negligent and blameable in three important respects, to wit:\u2014\nFirst, in not supplying the plaintiff with two pots of lead so as to finish the inside work, as he himself had requested them to do upon commencing that part of the work.\nSecondly. in sending the plaintiff to work in an exposed place and in directing other persons to finish the work without informing him.\nThirdly, in allowing the oakum to be in a wet condition.\nThe plaintiff claimed fifteen thousand dollars.\nThe defendants in their pleas in substance denied that the explosion which was the cause of the injuries sustained by the plaintiff was occasioned by any negligence of theirs and averred that the plaintiff sustained the injuries of which he complains by reason of his own negligence and imprudence.\nTo this defence the plaintiff answered by denying that he sustained the injuries by any negligence of his own, and he re-asserted that, on the contrary, the said accident was wholly owing to the negligence of the defendants.\nThe trial took place upon questions submitted to the jury upon an assignment of facts under the provisions of arts. 353 and 414 C.C.P.\nIn consequence of the manner in which these questions were answered by the jury and for alleged misdirection in the charge of the learned judge before whom the case was tried, the defendants moved for a new trial which was refused by the Court of Review. They thereupon appealed to the Court of Queen's Bench in Montreal, a majority of which court the Chief Justice Sir Alexander Lacoste dissenting, dismissed the appeal. Hence the appeal to this court.\nConcurring as we do in the dissentient judgment of the Chief Justice, which shows very clearly, as we think, that if the judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal should prevail the statutory provisions contained in the Code of Civil Procedure of the province in relation to trial by jury would be wholly set aside, it might be quite sufficient for us to express our concurence in that judgment, but the argument pressed very earnestly upon us by the learned counsel for the respondent calls for some few remarks Ihe argument pressed upon us was that paragraph 11 of the declaration of the plaintiff above set out in full contained an averment of an independent cause of action which rendered all inquiry into the acts of negligence charged in the 8th paragraph and specially designated in the 12th paragraph wholly unnecessary and irrelevant, and that the effect of the plaintiff's answer pleaded to the defendants' pleas was that the plaintiff abandoned the particular acts alleged in the declaration as the acts of negligence complained of and rested wholly on the charge of negligence generally as contained in the 11th paragraph. This argument, if not based upon appears to be sanctioned by, the charge of the learned judge who tried the case to the jury, for he appears by it to have told the jury that the 4th question which is,\nwas the said injury, loss of sight, pain and suffering caused by the negligence of the defendants, their managers or workmen?\nwas the important question, and that if they should answer either affirmatively or negatively then that the 5th, 6th and 7th questions became absolutely unnecessary. However, as the questions were put, he submitted them to the jury, observing however that if he had prepared the questions he would have omitted them altogether. Now, from this contention that the 11th paragraph of the declaration contains an independent cause of action and that the plaintiff's answer to the defendants' pleas had the effect claimed, we must dissent wholly. The 11th paragraph, as is very plain from its terms and context, contains simply an allegation that the \" said \" accident namely, the accident caused by the explosion mentioned in the 9th paragraph, which explosion was caused by the acts mentioned in the 8th paragraph, was in no way due to any negligence of the plaintiff, but was on the contrary due to the negligence of the defendants, which had already been charged in the 8th paragraph. This 11th paragraph in fact contains nothing more than a redundant repetition of the allegations in previous paragraphs\u2014that the explosion was caused by the acts of negligence already alleged; it did not in any respect render it unnecessary for the plaintiff to prove in order to succeed in his action the particular acts of negligence relied upon by him as those which caused the explosion Then in the 12th paragraph the plaintiff alleges three particular acts which he avers to be important and which he charges to have been acts of negligence of the defendants, one of which is mentioned in the 8th paragraph namely\u2014\" in allowing the oakum to be in a wet condition.'' Then as to the plaintiff's answer to the defendants' pleas it is simply a denial of the negligence imputed by the defendants' pleas to the plaintiff as the cause of the injuries he had sustained and a repetition of the allegations in the declaration that they were due to the negligence of the defendants. This mode of pleading is, in effect, simply equivalent to a \" joinder of issue \" pleaded by a plaintiff to a defendant's plea of like nature according to the form of pleading in use in the other provinces of the Dominion. But the principles of pleading in an action of this nature must not be lost sight of and it has not been suggested as regards them, that there is any difference between the jurisprudence of the Province of Quebec and that of the other Provinces of the Dominion and of England, although there is a difference between their forms of pleading and in procedure, and in the effect of what is called contributory negligence.\nIt is an established principle that a plaintiff can succeed in an action only secundum allegata et probata, and that in an action like the present for negligence causing an injury to the plaintfff he must allege and prove facts sufficintt to shew a duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff and a breach of such duty, and that such breach of duty occasioned the injury complained of; affirmative proof of the facts relied upon as constituting the negligence complained of must be given by the plaintiff, and such facts must be inconsistent with due diligence on the part of the defendant, and therefore if the evidence should be equally consistent with the existence or non-existence of negligence the plaintiff cannot succeed. Bullen and Leake on Pleading p. 9 and precedents of declarations passim Cotton v Wood ([37]); Hammack v. White ([38]); Montreal Rolling Mills v. Corcoran ([39]). In Wakelin v. London and South Western Railway Co. ([40]), an action by the representatives of a deceased person alleged to have been killed by the negligence of the defendants, Lord Halsbury, L. C., says at page 44:\nIt is incumbent on the plaintiff to establish by proof that her husband's death has been caused by some negligence of the defendants, and negligent act or some negligent omission to which the injury com- plained of * * is attributable. That is the fact to be proved,. If that fact is not proved the plaintiff fails, and if in the absence of direct proof the circumstances which are established are equally consistent with the allegation of the plaintiff, as with the denial of the defendants, the plaintiff fails for the very simple reason that the plaintiff is bound to establish the affimative of the proposition\nIn the same case, at page 47, Lord Watson held that it lay on the plaintiff to prove affirmatively some negligent act or omission on the part of the defendants or their servants which materially contributed to the injury complained of; that the burden of proof lies on the plaintiff does not admit of dispute, and he adds:\nMere allegation or proof that the company were guilty of negligence is altogether irrelevant, * * * the plaintiff must allege and prove not merely that they were negligent but that their negligence caused or materially contributed to the injury.\nThe case of Montreal Rolling Mills v. Corcoran ([41]), was decided upon the same principles recently in this court. Now in the case before us the plaintiff in his declaration alleges that the cause of the injury complained of was the explosion mentioned in the 9th paragraph. That this is an undoubted fact is not disputed. He also alleges that this explosion took place from the facts alleged in the 8th paragraph. These allegations and that charged in the 7th paragraph constituted the whole of the negligence complained of in the declaration and to the acts so charged as constituting the negligence complained of the plaintiff's action and his proof therein are confined. See the observations of Lord O'Hagan in Metropolitan Railway Co. v. Jackson ([42]), at page 202. It is to these matters that the question No. 5 in the assignment of facts was applied. That question is divided into four parts, as follows:\n5th, Were the defendants negligent,\n1st, In not furnishing plaintiff with two pots of lead? To which the jury answer that there was no evidence. As to this question it must be admitted that it was on an immaterial point for it could not be held that such neglect if it had been established in evidence is what the law regards an act which was a cause, of the explosion. However, the jury have by their answer substantially found that this alleged act of omission was not established.\n2ndly. In sending the plaintiff to work in an exposed place?\nto which the jury answer that the place was \" not considered exposed.\" Thus substantially also finding that the alleged act of negligence was not established.\n3rdly. In directing others to finish the work of pouring lead into the joint inside unawares to the plaintiff?\nto which the jury answer \" No.\" They thus negative the negligence charged in that respect.\n4thly. In allowing the hemp or oakum in filling the joint to be in a wet condition?\nto which the jury answer \"not wet when put in.\" Now the evidence showed that the immediate cause of the explosion was the wet condition in which the oakum was when the lead was poured in, and the answer of the jury to this question certainly wholly fails to find that such wet condition was attributable to any act of omission or of commission of the defendants or for which they are responsible, and that they were so responsible was the most material fact in the case for the plaintiff to establish; indeed, in view of the other answers of the jury to the 5th question, the sole point upon which the question of the liability of the defendants rested. The 6th, 7th and 8th questions related to that part of the defence which charged the accident to the plaintiff to be attributable to the plaintiff's own negligence and imprudence, and as to this the jury have by their answers to the questions submitted to them found that \"to a certain extent\" the accident was attributable to the plaintiff's own imprudence and want of care, and for this reason they have deducted from the total sum of $7,500 as the amount of plaintiff's damages the sum of $3,500. The result If all this appears to be that the jury have attributed to the plaintiff himself nearly half of the injury which he has suffered and. they have failed to find that the defendants are guilty of the only act of negligence charged against them in the declaration and of which any evidence was offered as constituting the cause of the explosion which was the very gist of the matter in issue as affecting the defendants' liability; for these reasons we are of opinion that the judgment for the plaintiff cannot be sustained, and that the defendants' application for a new trial should have been granted. The appeal must therefore be allowed with costs in this court and also in the Court of Queen's Bench, and we order a new trial and without costs, as we are of opinion that the contention of the appellants that the learned judge's observations to the jury in relation to the 4th question and the matters upon which the learned judges directed them that that question turned, is well founded.\nAs the new Code of Civil Procedure, Art. 427 enables the judge presiding at a trial to add to strike out or amend any of the facts assigned to be submitted to the jury if he considers that by so doing a more perfect trial of the issues will be secured, it will no doubt be a subject of special consideration that the questions submitted to the jury shall be so framed as to avoid confusion and contradiction in the answers of the jury and to arrive at the truth of the cause of action which the plaintiff has affirmed and which the defendants have denied, namely, that the defendants are responsible for the explosion which is alleged by the plaintiff to have caused him the injury of which he complains.\nWhile juries naturally feel deep sympathy with the plaintiff, as indeed every one must do, for the very serious injury he has suffered, the defendants have a right to insist that they shall not be made responsible therefor unless their responsibility shall be established in accordance with the principles of law applicable to the case with which they are charged by the plaintiff in his declaration.\nAppeal allowed with costs.

In the trial court the learned judge, (MacMahon J.), who dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action, held that upon the construction of the mortgage the property had been mortgaged as a \u201cgoing concern.\u201d and that all the articles in the factory premises incident to and necessary for the manufacturing business of the company were covered by the mortgage, and that the plaintiff\u2019s claim did not extend to certain other articles to which he would otherwise have been entitled to recover by the judgment. The judges in the Divisional Court, although divided in their opinions, agreed with the principle of construction laid down by the trial judge but granted to the plaintiff the other articles which had been refused him in the trial court. The plaintiff appealed from the Divisional Court judgment in so far as it had allowed the defendants the articles claimed by them as fixtures, but as he only partially succeeded in the Court of Appeal he took the present appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada as to all machinery and other chattels for which judgment had not already been delivered in his favour and which were not permanently affixed in May, 1891, when the company went into liquidation, or, at the latest, which were not so affixed on the 15th of January, 1894, when the respondents, the Town of Brampton, took possession of the mortgaged premises.\nAylesworth Q.C. and Justin for the appellants. The security is expressly restricted to the freehold \u201cincluding all machinery annexed to and known in law as part of the freehold.\u201d Some of the machinery although slightly attached to the floor for the purpose of steadiness in working could not be operated if permanently fastened down, it being necessary to shift them when reversed. The appellant has made out at least a Prima facie case that the machinery was not attached at the time possession was taken by the town, and the burden of proof was thus shifted upon the respondents to show that the machinery had been attached by some person with the authority of the insolvent company. No such proof was given, and the conclusion is inevitable that it was attached by some person without such authority and as a mere wrongdoer, and therefore that such annexation in no way affected the character of the property as chattels.\nIn considering the intention of the parties in giving the mortgage, the learned trial judge seems to start with the view, that, because the mortgagors were then carrying on, and intended to continue carrying on the manufacture of engines, threshing machines and agricultural implements in the mortgaged premises, they were mortgaging their factory premises, machinery, tools and business, treated as one \u201cgoing concern.\u201d This is an entirely erroneous idea. The company was mortgaging nothing but its lands and buildings, including therewith, of course, all machinery which in law would be deemed part of the freehold. The grant in the mortgage is of the land only. What this grant carries with it, defendants are entitled to, but the interpretation of the grant cannot be widened. The learned trial judge treats this mortgage as including all the machinery in question because all of it was \u201cnecessary to the carrying on of the business and operations of the company;\u201d but that circumstance, even if the evidence established it, cannot afford any indication whether or not the company, when the various pieces of machinery were put into the buildings, intended them to become parts of the buildings, or to still remain chattels.\nAs to the specific articles claimed upon this appeal, the safe is clearly shown not to have been fastened. The fact that \u201cpigeon holes\u201d were built around it is not material. This was not done with the intention of fastening the safe, but as a matter of convenience. It is merely in the position of a chattel placed in a room, and subsequently the room or doorways, so changed that the articles will not come out without being taken apart, or the doorway enlarged. The character of the property is not changed. See Longbottom v. Berry[1], at pages 129 and 139, and Park v. Baker[2]. The lathes, bending machine, Bradley forges, iron wheel clamp, Daniels planer, band sawing machine, platform scales, anvils and other similar machines rested in position by their own weight only; they were not permanently affixed in any way. See Ex parte Astbury; In re Richards[3]; Mather v. Fraser[4]. The scales in connection with the dynamometer are simply a pair of ordinary weigh scales, and they do not become a fixture from the circumstance that it may have been customary to use them with a fixed machine, when in fact they have never been in any way attached to, or made part of that machine, any more than a chisel becomes a fixture by the circumstance of a workman using it in turning a piece of wood upon a turning machine which is fixed; it may be taken away and used for any other purpose, and is not a part of the machine, though it may be impossible to use the machine itself for any purpose without using the other article as well.\nAppellant is entitled to damages for illegal detention of the machinery; Dreyfus v. Peruvian Guano Co.[5]; Cockburn v. Muskoka Mill and Lumber Co.[6]; and the difference between the value of the property at the time of the demand made therefor, or, the time of the commencement of the action, and the value at the time of delivery thereof. Henderson v. Williams[7]; Blakely v. Dooley[8]; Auger v. Cook[9]. We also refer to La Banque d\u2019Hochelaga v. The Waterous Engine Works Co.[10]; Hobson v. Gorringe[11]; Joseph Hall Manufacturing Co. v. Haslitt[12]; Stevens v. Barfoot[13].\nThe case of Keefer v. Merrill[14] explains Crawford v. Finlay[15], and shows it to have no application in this case.\nBlain and Cameron for the respondents. The articles, though loose, belonging to the fastened or fixed machinery, belong to the freehold, and the annexation may be actual or constructive. Constructive annexation arises when the thing is fitted for use in connection with the premises and is more or less necessary to their enjoyment. On this principle not only the machines but even the patterns and tools belonging to the fixed machinery pass with the realty, as they were essential to the profitable user of an agricultural implement factory. Such effect must be given to the language used in the mortgage as to include all things which were annexed to the freehold with their essential parts whether fixed or loose. Hobson v. Gorringe11; 8 Am. & Eng. Encyclop\u0153dia of Law, 8, p. 43.\nThe evidence shows that there is a countershaft to each of the machines consisting of a short piece of shafting on which are fitted two or more pulleys. Each counter-shaft runs in cast iron hangers, which are firmly bolted to the joists and beams of the ceilings. Each counter-shaft is connected by belting, both with the line shafting and with the machine below to which the counter-shaft belongs. Power is conveyed to the line shafting then through the counter-shaft to the machine on the floor. Another function of the counter-shaft is to enable the machine below to run at varying speeds. This is effected by what are called cone pulleys, which are really groups of pulleys of different sizes; the counter-shaft is firmly annexed and is as much a part of the machine as the rudder is of a ship. See judgment of Brett L.J. in Sheffield, &c., Building Society v. Harrison[16]. The machine, its belting and its counter-shaft form one fixed piece of machinery.\nThe respondents rely on the following authorities: Longbottom v. Berry[17]; Holland v. Hodgson[18]; The Sheffield &c. Building Society v. Harrison16; Ewell on fixtures p. 21; Keefer v. Merrill[19]; Rogers v. Ontario Bank[20]; Sun Life Insurance Co. v. Taylor[21]; Dickson v. Hunter[22]; Crawford v. Finlay[23].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nKING J.\u2014The question is whether certain things were rightly adjudged to be fixtures in a case between mortgagor and mortgagee. The mortgage recited that the Haggert Bros. Manufacturing Co. had applied to the town of Brampton for a loan of $75,000 upon certain undertakings to carry on all their manufacturing business in the town, during a period of twenty years, and it was agreed that the company should give in security their bond in double the amount and a mortgage for the amount of the loan, and interest \u201cupon all the real estate of them the mortgagors, including all the machinery there was or might thereafter be annexed to the freehold, and which should be known in law as part of the freehold.\u201d The mortgaged premises were conveyed by description of the several parcels or tracts of land.\nThe articles in question are pieces of machinery and other articles used on the premises in connection with the manufacturing.\nA mortgagor in fee has not the same right as against the mortgagee, nor a grantor as against his grantee, that a person having a limited interest only, as a tenant, has to remove things annexed for the purposes of trade or domestic convenience.\nIn Holland v. Hodgson in 1872[24], it is said:\nThere is no doubt that the general maxim of the law is that what is annexed to the land becomes part of the land, but it is very difficult, if not impossible, to say with precision what constitutes an annexation sufficient for this purpose. It is a question which must depend on the circumstances of each case, and mainly on two circumstances, as indicating the intention, viz. the degree of annexation, and the object of annexation.\nThe circumstances indicating the intention are such as are patent for all to see, and not such as rest in mere agreement with the third party. In Hobson v. Gorringe[25], an assignee of a mortgage was held to be entitled to treat an engine affixed to the building by bolts and screws as part of the land, notwithstanding that it was brought upon the land under a contract with the maker of the engine, by the terms of which contract the engine was, under the circumstances that existed, to continue the property of the seller (as between vendor and vendee).\nArticles no further attached to the land than by their own weight may become fixtures if the circumstances are such as to show that they were intended to be part of the land, though of course the onus of shewing that they were so intended lies on those who assert that they have ceased to be chattels. Holland v. Hodgson[26].\nIn a number of cases were articles were held to be affixed to the land, the affixing was by means of bolts and screws. In Holland v. Hodgson26, already referred to, looms were so held which were attached to stone floors of a mill by means of nails driven through holes in two of the four legs of each loom, in some cases into beams built into the stone, and in other cases into plugs of wood driven into holes drilled in the stone for the purpose.\nIn Hellawell v. Eastwood in 1851[27], spinning machinery fixed by screws to the floor in much the same way were held not to be fixtures, the court considering that they were attached slightly so as to be capable of removal without the least injury to the fabric of the building or to themselves, and the object of the annexation being in their opinion not to improve the inheritance, but merely to render the machines steadier and more capable of convenient use as chattels. In recent cases it is questioned whether the principles of law laid down in this case were correctly applied to the facts.\nThe circumstance that the fastening is merely to steady the machines when in use is now held not to be inconsistent with the inference that the object was to permanently improve the freehold. Longbottom v. Berry[28].\nThe court in that case says:\nThis fixing was clearly necessary, for they (the machines), could not otherwise be effectually used; as for the same reason the fixing was obviously not occasional but permanent. It is no doubt said in this case (referring to Mather v. Fraser[29],) that the object of fixing was to ensure steadiness and keep the machines in their places when worked; but the same thing could probably be said of most trade fixtures from a steam engine downwards; and if the effect of this fixing is to cause the whole set of machines to be effectually used in the manufacture of wool and cloth, it seems very difficult to avoid coming to the conclusion that a necessary conveyance is to cause the mill to be put to a more profitable use as a wool mill than it otherwise would be. It is also equally difficult to conceive that a machine which at all times requires to be firmly fixed to the freehold, for the purpose of being worked, could truly be said never to lose its character as a movable chattel.\nSo also in Holland v. Hodgson[30], where the looms were attached by nails for the purpose of steadying them and keeping them in a true direction.\nIn passing upon the object of the annexation, the purposes to which the premises are applied may be regarded; and if the object of setting up the articles is to enhance the value of the premises or improve its usefulness for the purposes for which it is used, and if they are affixed to the freehold even in a slight way, but such as is appropriate to the use of the articles, and showing an intention not of occasional but of permanent affixing, then, both as to the degree of annexation and as to the object of it, it may very well be concluded that the articles are become part of the realty, at least in questions as between mortgagor and mortgagee. See the cases already referred to, and also Walmsley v. Milne[31], and Wiltshear v. Cotterell[32].\nIt was contended that, as to a number of articles, an inference upon the evidence ought to be drawn that the affixing did not take place until after the mortgagee went into possession, but the inference is by no means a necessary one, and the conclusions of fact should not be disturbed upon this account.\nCertain articles (as the watchman\u2019s clock), are instances of constructive annexation. Certain other articles (as the dynamometer scales) are necessary parts of fixed machines, neither being practically available for the purpose for which it was used without the other.\nAs to machines not themselves affixed at all, but connected with fixed countershafting, we do not think the machines became thereby affixed where they were not parts of the one article.\nAs to the safe, the learned judges of the Court of Appeal were evenly divided, and it is impossible to feel confident on such a question. But considering that the safe was put in a place structurally adapted for it, and was so enclosed in it by a wooden structure subsequently built that it could not be taken out without destroying what was a portion of the realty, and that it was put there not for a temporary purpose but to be permanently there, it would seem reasonable to conclude that it was so affixed as an adjunct to the building, to improve its usefulness as such, considering the purpose to which the building was applied.\nApplying the principles enunciated to the several classes of articles in question, those which are considered to remain chattels are as enumerated hereafter, and the rest were affixed to and formed part of the realty. The chattels which were not annexed to the realty, nor became part of the realty, are as follows: In the office, one copying press and table; in the blacksmith\u2019s shop, No. 7, anvil; No. 9, four anvils; in the boiler shop, No. 11, two anvils; in the long wood shop, iron clamp for making engine wheels; in the wood finishing shop, the band sawing machine, and saws in connection therewith, also belting; in the outside yard, the platform scale on wheels. Amongst the miscellaneous articles, the fire hose, fire hose reel with all its hose, tools and couplings, including brass nozzles and branches. The variations here indicated should be made in the judgment entered in the court below. The appeal is dismissed without costs.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: B.F.

Grand Trunk Railway Co. of Canada, (1897) 28 S.C.R. 184\nDate: 1897-12-09\nEdward Washington (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada (Defendants) Respondents.\n1897: October 21, 22; 1897: December 9.\nPresent: Taschereau, Gwynne, Sedgewick, King and Girouard JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nRailways\u2014Statute, construction of\u201451 V. c. 29, s. 262 (D.)\u2014Railway crossings\u2014Packing railway frogs, wing-rails, etc.\u2014Negligence.\nThe proviso of the fourth sub-section of section 262 of \u201cThe Railway Act\u201d (51 V. c. 29 (D).) does not apply to the fillings referred to in the third sub-section and confers no power upon the Railway Committee of the Privy Council to dispense with the filling in of the spaces behind and in front of railway frogs or crossings and the fixed rails of switches during the winter months.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario (24 Ont. App. R. 183) reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] reversing the judgment of Mr. Justice Street in the High Court of Justice and dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action with costs.\nThis action was tried before Mr. Justice Street and a jury at Hamilton on the 11th of May, 1896. The jury answered the questions submitted favourably to the plaintiff and assessed damages at $2,500. The learned trial judge reserved judgment on the findings of the jury, and on the motion of the defendants\u2019 counsel for a non-suit until the 29th day of May, 1897, when he directed judgment to be entered for the plaintiff for $2,500 and costs. On an appeal by the defendants the Court of Appeal for Ontario set aside the judgment and verdict and dismissed the action with costs.\nThe plaintiff was a yardman in the employ of the defendants and on the morning of the 16th January, 1896, was engaged in coupling cars forming part of a freight train in defendants\u2019 yard at Hamilton. While coming out from between two cars which he had just coupled his foot caught in a frog or between a wing-rail and frog-rail and he was thrown down, a car passing over and severing his right arm. The grounds of negligence alleged so far as material to be stated, are:\u2014That the defendants had neglected to pack the space between the rails in the railway frog over which the cars were passing and in which plaintiff\u2019s foot was caught, as required by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation for Injuries Act[2], and the Railway Act[3], thus permitting a defective condition or arrangement of the ways, works, machinery, plant or premises connected with or intended for or used in the defendants\u2019 business. The defendants denied negligence and pleaded that the Railway Committee of the Privy Council, in pursuance of the powers conferred by section 262 of The Railway Act, by an order made in November, 1889, allowed them to omit the packing or filling of frogs and of the spaces between wing-rails and frogs and between guard-rails and fixed rails from the month of December to the month of April in each year and directed that such order should be permanent, and that the order was in force at the time that the accident happened between the months of December and April when the packing was lawfully left out of the frogs, etc. The plaintiff contended that the Railway Committee had no power to dispense with the filling of the frogs, etc., during the winter months.\nAt the trial the following questions were left to the jury:\u20141. Was the plaintiff\u2019s foot caught in the frog or between the wing-rail and the frog-rail? 2. Were the defendants guilty of any negligence which led to the accident? 3. If so, in what did such negligence consist? The jury answered that the plaintiff\u2019s foot was caught in the frog; that defendants were guilty of negligence in not having the frog packed or protected; and they assessed the damages at $2,500, for which sum judgment was entered. A verdict entered for appellant was affirmed by the Divisional Court but set aside by the Court of Appeal.\nStaunton for the appellant. The respondents are required to have their frogs filled with packing all the year round by section 262 of the Railway Act. The Railway Committee had no authority to dispense with the packing required by sub-section three in the spaces behind and in front of frogs or crossings, and between the fixed rails of switches where such spaces are less than five inches in width. The application of the proviso of the fourth subsection is limited to the filling specially mentioned in that clause, namely, in the spaces between any wing-rail and any railway frog, and between any guard-rail and the track-rail along the side of it at their splayed ends. These words must be read in their ordinary sense as written. Grey v. Pearson[4]; Thelluson v. Rendlesham[5], at page 519; Lowther v. Bentinck[6], at page 169; Leader v. Duffey[7] at page 301; Re Hamlet[8], at page 435. Beale, Legal Interpretation, p. 236; Abbott\u2019s Railway Law of Canada, p. 394.\nMcCarthy Q.C. for the respondents. The sub-sections of the statute must be read together as paragraphs relating to a common subject. Maxwell (3 ed.) pp. 59, 74; Hardcastle (2 ed.) 238. Even sub-heads have been doubted to create distinctions. Union Steamship Co. v. Melbourne Harbour Trust Commissioners[9]; Hammersmith Railway Co. v. Brand[10]; Eastern Counties, etc., Railway Co. v. Marriage[11].\nThe respondents have neglected no duty under the Dominion Railway Act, and there is no right of action against them here under that Act. The order of the Railway Committee in any event affords a good defence. Rex. v. Newark upon Trent[12]; Cohen v. The South Eastern Railway Co.[13], at page 260; United States v. Babbit[14]. Ex parte Partington[15].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nSEDGEWICK J\u2014The only question involved in this appeal is as to whether the proviso at the end of subsection 4 of section 262 of the Railway Act (Canada), 51 Vict. ch. 29, applies not only to the sub-section in which it is placed but to sub-section 3 as well. If the proviso is confined to sub-section 4 alone then the appeal must be allowed and the trial judgment restored, otherwise the appeal fails.\nThe whole section above referred to is as follows: 262. This section shall apply to every railway and railway company within the legislative authority or jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada.\n2. In this section the expression \u201cpacking\u201d means a packing of wood or metal, or some other equally substantial and solid material, of not less than two inches in thickness, and which, where by this section any space is required to be filled in, shall extend to within one and a half inches of the crown of the rails in use on any such railway, shall be neatly fitted so as to come against the web of such rails, and shall be well and solidly fastened to the ties on which such rails are laid.\n3. The spaces behind and in front of every railway frog or crossing, and between the fixed rails of every switch where such spaces are less than five inches in width, shall be filled with packing up to the underside of the head of the rail.\n4. The spaces between any wing-rail and any railway frog, and between any guard-rail and the track-rail alongside of it, shall be filled with packing at their splayed ends so that the whole splay shall be so filled where the width of the space between the rails is less than five inches, such packing not to reach higher than to the underside of the head of the rail: Provided however that the Railway Committee may allow such filling to be left out from the month of December to the month of April in each year, both months included.\n5. The oil cups or other appliances used for oiling the valves of every locomotive in use upon any railway shall be such that no employee shall be required to go outside the cab of the locomotive, while the same is in motion, for the purpose of oiling such valves.\nThere can be no question but that in Canadian legislation the numbers of sections and sub\u2011sections are constituent parts of an Act. It often happens that one section of an Act refers to another section by its number, and it would in that case be absurd to say that the numbering formed no part of the Act. It must necessarily be deemed a part of the Act, otherwise no effect can be given to a provision of that kind. Notwithstanding the general rule that the title of an Act forms no part of it, we were compelled in a case in this court to hold that owing to the form which the enactment took in that particular case, even its title was part of it. O\u2019Connor v. Nova Scotia Telephone Co.[16] A Bill passing through the legislature is invariably divided into sections. These sections are before Parliament during every stage of legislation and must be taken to have a legislative effect.\nThe question then is, does the \u201cfilling\u201d mentioned in the proviso extend to the \u201cfilling\u201d referred to in sub-section three as well as in sub-section four?\nThere can be no doubt that according to the grammatical construction of sub-section four the proviso is confined to that sub-section alone. It is in fact admitted that prim\u00e2 facie the proviso is so limited, but it was agreed that the legislature must necessarily have intended that it should take a wider scope and include all kinds of filling prescribed by the whole section. Now, it is an elementary principle that the grammatical or ordinary sense of words used in a statute are to be adhered to unless that would lead to some absurdity or some repugnance or inconsistency with the rest of the statute, in which case the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words may be modified so as to avoid that inconsistency and absurdity, but no further. Grey v. Pearson[17]. In order therefore to extend the proviso beyond its prim\u00e2 facie limits, giving its words a secondary and extended meaning in order to give effect to the presumed intention of the legislature, clear and conclusive reasons must be shown to compel us to put such a construction upon it.\nReading the whole section any one would naturally suppose that the legislature intended to distinguish between that class of filling mentioned in sub-section three, and the class mentioned in sub-section four, and that the first filling was to be a permanent fixture, and that the second might, under certain circumstances, be dispensed with during the winter months. There was no evidence on this point before us; it was only suggested why such a distinction should be made. I am no expert, but I can readily understand why the spaces behind and in front of a \u201cfrog\u201d should at all times be kept filled, in consequence of its permanently dangerous character, while the intervening spaces between a guard-rail and the track-rail alongside of it may not be so dangerous, and that it may be convenient during the winter time for the purpose of more easily keeping the track free from ice and snow to permit such spaces to be open during the winter months. It is not clear to me why a distinction should be made in the case of the spaces between the fixed rails and a switch and the spaces referred to in sub-section four, but that is no reason why I should assume there is no distinction. Whatever the reason may be, if the enactment, as a matter of fact, makes it we must give effect to it. No reason has been presented which forces us to depart from the ordinary meaning of the terms employed, or to extend the proviso beyond its grammatical meaning. Clearly in a case like the present the burden of sustaining the claim for a wider construction is upon him who claims it. The burden in the present case has not been sustained.\nWith great deference we have to dissent from the view taken by the Court of Appeal. The error in their judgment seems to have been in the assumption that the Legislature intended to give a wider meaning to the proviso and that the whole argument was to show that there was no insuperable obstacle by reason of the words themselves to prevent that wider meaning from being given to it. In our view, in dealing with a case like the present we must begin with the words themselves giving them their grammatical, primary, and ordinary meaning. If it is, however, made clear that they are susceptible of a broader scope and of taking in a wider range that must be proved by circumstances and considerations imperatively forcing that conclusion upon us. These circumstances have not been shown to exist. The appeal must therefore be allowed and the original judgment restored. The appellant is entitled to costs in all the courts.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\u2014\nSolicitors for the appellant: Staunton & O\u2019Heir.\nSolicitor for the respondents: John Bell.\n[1] 24 Ont.

It appeared that by orders issued either through error or by inadvertence the balance so deposited had been paid out to a person who was not entitled to receive the money, and the Receiver General for Canada, as trustee of the residue, intervened and applied for an order to have the money repaid in order to be disposed of under the provisions of the Winding-up Act.\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, that the Receiver-General was entitled so to intervene although the three years from the date of the deposit mentioned in the Winding-up Act had not expired.\nHeld, also, that even if he was not so entitled to intervene the provincial courts had jurisdiction to compel repayment into court of the moneys improperly paid out.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], which allowed the appeal of the Receiver- General from the order of Street J., refusing an application to compel repayment by the executors of the Hogaboom estate of moneys which had been paid to them out of court, under two orders made by Armour C.J., and rescinding and setting aside the two last mentioned orders with costs.\nThe liquidators of the Central Bank of Canada had paid the money in question into court as part of the balance remaining in their hands at the time of the passing of their final accounts on their discharge, after having paid to the creditors of the bank, out of the assets realized, ninety-nine and two-thirds cents on the dollar of their claims. Prior to this deposit being made, the liquidators, having exhausted every other effort to realize the assets of the bank, had, in 1891, offered the then unrealized assets for sale by tender as per schedule made up to the 22nd July of that year. The tenders were not opened until September, when Hogaboom\u2019s tender for $44,500 was accepted, but as some of the assets included in the schedule had been realized in the interval, a deduction was made in respect of those sums, computed at $2,500, and it was agreed that he should be entitled to all other moneys realized from the assets described in the schedule, and in a book containing a list of the unrealized assets, until they were actually transferred to and vested in him. This transfer was effected by an order of the Master in Ordinary, on 3rd October, 1891, containing language which his executors contend is wide enough to include other assets beyond those referred to in the schedule and list. The clause in question is in the following words:\u2014\u201cAnd every real and personal and heritable and movable property, effects and choses in action of the said bank, if any, of what nature and kind soever and wherever situated and existing to which the said bank was or appeared to be entitled or which was in the custody or under the control of the said liquidators and as the same existed on the 22nd July, 1891,\u201d save and except one or two claims especially mentioned. An application was made to the Chancellor on the 23rd day of October and an order made by him in the same terms.\nUpon the 8th June, 1892, the Master-in-Ordinary had made an order upon the application of the liquidators for a final dividend, payable upon the 2nd July following, which recited that $2,197.50, which had been reserved for dividends upon notes of the bank outstanding and in circulation, and upon which no claims had been made during the time limited by the Act, should now form part of the funds applicable to a final dividend of 6\u2153 per cent. which was as much, in view of outstanding matters, as in the opinion of the liquidators could be safely paid out of the assets without incurring risk. The liquidators were also required to deposit in the Canadian Bank of Commerce a schedule setting forth the names and addresses (so far as known) of the payees and the several amounts payable to them in respect of said dividend, and all dividends previously declared but unclaimed, and to make special deposit of the gross amount of the said dividends to be held by the bank subject to the provisions of Section 94 of the Winding-up Act, and the order then provided that by the 2nd July, 1892, the liquidators should deliver into the custody of the Master all the books of the bank, and all claim papers, and file their final accounts as liquidators and pay into court to the credit of the matter any balance remaining in their hands, including the amount reserved to pay dividends.\nOn the 14th October, 1892, the Master reported that at the date of the report there had come into the liquidators hands since a previous report $118,171.92. That after deducting various sums amounting to $110,758.01, there remained in their hands $7,413.91, which was deposited in the Canadian Bank of Commerce, and which deposit was exclusive of $801.45 for outstanding cheques credited and allowed to the liquidators in their final account; that against the sum of $7,413.91 there were dividend cheques unclaimed amounting to $2,588.04, leaving in the bank $4,825.87 to be paid into court in pursuance of the order of the 8th June, 1892. The liquidators were then discharged, and the respondent Holmested, Accountant of the Supreme Court of Judicature, appointed liquidator without salary, and he has, from the sum so paid into court, paid by order of the court various small sums, but there remained in court on the 3rd January, 1895, $3,635.13, which was claimed, after Hogaboom\u2019s death, by his executors as part of the assets which vested in him under his purchase in 1891.\nOn 4th January, 1895, Armour C.J. made an order for payment out to the trustees of the Hogaboom Estate of the sum of $2,994.88, part of the moneys in court at the credit of the liquidation proceedings, and on the 16th May, 1896, he made a further order for payment out of $606.36, the balance to the credit of the same account. The Receiver-General and Finance Minister for Canada then applied to Street J. for leave to appeal from the orders of Armour C.J., and for a substantive order for the repayment of the moneys, and his applications were dismissed. He then applied to Meredith J. and obtained leave to appeal on both branches of his application to the Court of Appeal[2]. The Court of Appeal on the 30th June, 1897, allowed the appeal and reversed the orders of Armour C.J. It is from the judgment of the Court of Appeal that this appeal is taken. S.H. Blake Q.C. and W.R. Smythe for the appellants. The transfer order of 3rd October, 1891, entitled Hogaboom\u2019s Estate to the money, as it was part of the unrealized assets and the order confirming the sale vested all the bank\u2019s property in Hogaboom and covered such a residue as that in question. There are no special circumstances to justify interference with the orders made by Armour C.J. See Marsh v. Joseph[3]; Slater v. Slaler[4]; Dangar\u2019s Trusts[5]; Re Ward[6]; Todd v. Studholme[7]; Re Spencer[8]; Brydges v. Branfill[9]. Summary jurisdiction is not exercised except against solicitors and then only when their negligence has permitted a successful crime. This case is not within the class in which a summary jurisdiction is exercised. In re Opera, Limited[10]; In re Thorpe; Vipont v. Radcliffe[11]. The court has no right to interfere in this case ex mero motu.\nThe Receiver-General has no locus standi to complain or interfere on the ground that he should have had notice of the application to Chief Justice Armour or that the orders were ex parte in respect to him. Compare secs. 40 and 41 of the Winding-up Act, and 55 & 56 Vict. ch. 28, sec. 2, which did not come into force until a month after the order of 8th June, 1892. The deposit of the money in court under the latter statute cannot be substituted for the provision requiring the deposit in a bank. There had been no escheat or forfeiture to the crown and he consequently had no beneficial interest in the moneys. The liquidation was still going on with Mr. Holmested as liquidator; he got notice and the rule respecting ex parte applications cannot be invoked. The order of Meredith J.[12] giving leave to appeal from the orders of Armour C.J., after such leave had been refused by Street J. was made without jurisdiction, and therefore no effective appeal came before the Court of Appeal for Ontario.

If so the court should insist on their restoration, as in that case the Receiver-General is entitled to any part of it remaining unclaimed for three years, and entitled to have it put in such a position as to allow of the declaration of the dividend.

Croston Urban District Council[51], and authorities mentioned in Holmested & Langton, Ont. Jud. Act, under sec. 782[52].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nGWYNNE J.\u2014I retain the opinion which I held during the argument that this appeal should not have been entertained. It simply calls in question the jurisdiction of the High Court of Justice for Ontario to rescind certain orders made by a judge of one of the divisions of the court, whereby monies paid into court in the matter of the Winding-up of the Central Bank in favour of the scheduled creditors, were paid out of court to parties not entitled to such trust funds. The parties who had so received such trust funds out of court have in obedience to the order now appealed from repaid the monies back into court where they now remain subject to the trust purposes for which they were originally paid into court, and this court could not order that money to be repaid to the appellants without committing the error with which the Court of Appeal in Ontario have adjudicated that the orders under which the monies were paid out of court were affected; and so this court would become advisedly instrumental in causing a repetition of the breach of trust which had originally been committed inadvertently or in error. The only foundation upon which the argument for the appellants has been rested was that the Receiver-General, by a petition in whose name Her Majesty\u2019s Attorney-General, the Minister of Justice for the Dominion, informed the court of the breach of trust which had been committed and prayed the court to rescind the orders by which the breach of trust had been effected, and to order the Hogaboom estate to refund into court the monies erroneously paid out to it, had no locus standi in court, and secondly that the orders complained of were not appealed against within the terms of the seventy-fourth section of the Winding-up Act, nor had the proceedings to set aside the orders been taken in the form prescribed by the rules of practice established under the Ontario Judicature Act to regulate the practice of the court in the conduct of litigious proceedings inter partes. It would be useless to attempt to add anything to the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of Ontario for the purpose of establishing, as he has done most incontrovertibly, that the court had held the monies so paid out to the Hogaboom estate, subject to a certain trust purpose in which that estate had no right or shadow of right whatever, and we need only say that we entirely concur with the learned Chief Justice in his amazement that any one could have supposed that Hogaboom or his estate ever had any such claim, and in the conclusion reached by him that, by the payment of the money out of court to that estate, a great miscarriage of justice had taken place which it was incumbent upon the court as soon as apprised of the error to correct. In the argument before the Court of Appeal for Ontario the appellants, impressed no doubt with a conviction of the impossibility of maintaining any right to withdraw any part of the fund upon a motion made in the manner in which they did, or upon the material supplied by them in their motion for the orders, set up a claim to retain the monies so received by them, in virtue of a cause of action which they claimed to have against the liquidators of the estate in liquidation, upon an allegation that the said liquidators had not delivered to Hogaboom or his estate the whole of the unrealised assets of the estate which Hogaboom in his lifetime had purchased from them and paid them for. Mr. Justice Maclennan in his exhaustive judgment has dealt with this contention in a much fuller manner than we think was at all necessary for the determination of the matter with which alone the court were dealing, for if the estate of Hogaboom had any such claim, before they could obtain satisfaction of it they must needs establish their claim by a judgment pronounced upon it in their favour, and in order to obtain such a judgment, it was necessary for them to proceed against the liquidators charged with having committed the wrong complained of, either in an ordinary action, or at least, it may be, by proceedings instituted against them under the winding-up order, as nearly as may be in the same manner as an ordinary action, suit or proceeding within the jurisdiction of the court[53]. Mr. Justice Maclennan has pointed out in his judgment that in January, 1892, Hogaboom made an application to the court to commit the liquidators for non-delivery to him of certain mortgages, bills, notes and other securities which he claimed to be entitled to by virtue of his purchase of the unrealised assets of the bank, and which he had not received. This contestation was carried on by Hogaboom into the Court of Appeal for Ontario; in that contestation, if there were other assets which Hogaboom claimed to be entitled to, then was the time to present his claim, when it could have been disposed of in the presence of the persons from whom he hadf purchased the unrealised assets of the bank, as they stood on the 22nd July, 1891, and who were the parties responsible if the claim was well founded.\nThe learned judge has also shewn that after much litigation that claim was finally disposed of by an agreement concluded between Hogaboom and the liquidators upon the 3rd March, 1893, after the liquidators had been discharged from their office, and after a final close of their dealings with the estate in liquidation and after the payment into court in trust for the creditors of the estate under the provisions of 55 & 56 Vict. ch. 28, of the monies which have been paid out of court to the appellants, in the manner complained of, and by an order made by the court upon the application of Hogaboom in the matter upon the 19th June, 1893, whereby that settlement was approved and confirmed and so finally adjudicated upon. By that settlement Hogaboom released and discharged the liquidators from all claims whatsoever and accepted the sum of fifty dollars in full of all claims against the liquidators and the bank in respect of the assets purchased by him and not handed over. In the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and before us, it was argued that this settlement is not open to the construction put upon it by the respondents\u2019 counsel, or rather that it is open to a different construction. We are not here concerned at present with an inquiry whether this be so or not, for if the estate of Hogaboom had, and has still, any claim for assets of the estate in liquidation purchased by Hogaboom, and not handed over to him, that claim must needs be determined and adjudicated upon in a proceeding duly instituted asserting the demand. When that proceeding shall be, if it ever shall be, instituted, will arise some important questions which must be decided in favour of the appellants before they can obtain a judgment in their favour, namely: 1st. Whether the liquidators who are charged with having committed the wrong of which the appellants complain, must not be the parties against whom the proceedings must be instituted: 2ndly. Whether the estate of Hogaboom is or is not barred and estopped by the settlement made upon the proceedings instituted in January, 1892: 3rdly. If not so estopped, whether there is any foundation for the claim to any, and if any, to what amount: And 4thly. Whether such amount, if any there should be found to be, can now, after the final discharge of the liquidators and the payment by them into court in trust for the creditors who had proved in the liquidation, of the monies remaining in their hands the property of the estate in liquidation, can be charged against such monies.\nIn the argument before us it was expressly admitted upon behalf of the appellants, indeed it could not be contended to the contrary, that the claim which the appellants assert in argument here has never yet been established in proof, but their learned counsel contended that as the appellants obtained the orders which the Court of Appeal for Ontario have pronounced to have issued upon insufficient material inadvertently and in error it must be assumed that the claim had been established, that in fact it must be so assumed contrary to the manifestly apparent facts. The statement of this contention carries in itself its own refutation. But all these matters are irrelevant upon the present appeal, as indeed also is the following to which, nevertheless, I must add a few words because of the contention of the appellants\u2019 counsel that inasmuch as the order of the 8th June, 1892, was made before the passing of 55 & 56 Vict. ch. 28, which took place on the 9th July, 1892, the appointment of Mr. Holmested as liquidator for the special purposes named in the order of the 21st November, 1892, had the effect of continuing the estate in liquidation notwithstanding the passing of the final account of the liquidators on the 14th October, 1892, and the order of that date, and notwithstanding anything contained in 55 & 56 Vict. ch. 28. Mr. Justice Maclennan in his judgment points out that unless the liquidators were discharged under the Act they have never been discharged; that the court had no power except under the authority of that Act to discharge them, nor to appoint a liquidator in their place; and he concludes that the naming of Mr. Holmested, the financial officer of the court, as a \u201cliquidator\u201d for the purpose of distributing the balance paid into court by the liquidators, who in passing their final accounts had been discharged, did not make Mr. Holmested a liquidator in the sense in which a statutory liquidator representing the creditors of an estate in liquidation is regarded. The naming of Mr. Holmested \u201cliquidator\u201d for the special purpose named in the order had no more effect than if the purpose for which he was so named had been entrusted to him as an officer of the court, without adding to him the appellation of liquidator; and Mr. Justice Maclennan says that the order of the 8th June was made in anticipation of the passing of the Act. He might indeed have added as an historical fact known to the court, that the Act was framed for the purpose of enabling the liquidation of the Central Bank to be closed; that it was framed by the present Chief Justice, Sir William Meredith, then solicitor of the liquidators in the liquidation matter; that it was revised by the learned Chancellor, and so revised was introduced into Parliament and passed, and that the Master in Ordinary, before whom the proceedings in liquidation were conducted, had urged the Minister of Justice to expedite its passing. Mr. Justice Maclennan\u2019s judgment on this point was well founded, but apart from this, the order of the 8th June was provisional only, it authorized accounts to be taken, but gave no effect as yet to their being taken\u2014they were not taken until after the passing of the Act, and the order did not obtain effect until the 14th October, when the accounts having been finally taken, and the amount to be paid in court having been ascertained and paid into court, the order of the 14th October, 1892, finally discharging the liquidators was made, and that order then constituted the finality given to the liquidation by the statute and the money paid into court became by the statute money in court upon the trust purposes named in the statute. But to advert to the only matters which are material on the present appeal, which affect merely the regularity of the proceedings adopted for the purpose of obtaining a rescission of the orders complained of, I desire to say that in my judgment the jurisdiction of the court to rescind orders which like those in the present case have been issued as is clearly demonstrated inadvertently and through error, and which constituted a breach of trust committed by the court itself, is not fettered in any respect either by the rules of practice established by the Judicature Act for regulating proceedings in litigious matters inter partes, or by the 74th section of the Winding-up Act, or in fact by any rule other than that compliance with which natural justice requires, namely, that the party to be affected by the order should have notice of the application for it so as to enable him to answer such application I am of opinion that the error in the issuing of the orders which the court below has rescinded, is so conclusively apparent, that the application to the Divisional Court should have been granted as soon as it was made. As to the objection that the Receiver General had no locus standi in curi\u00e2, while I concur in Mr. Justice Maclennan\u2019s judgment that under the statute he had, I must repeat that in my judgment it is quite immaterial whether he had or not. Her Majesty\u2019s Attorney General gave the court information of the error and breach of trust through, it is true, the form of a petition signed by the Receiver General, but that was sufficient information to call the court into action whether the person signing the petition had or had not an interest in the fund. The court, indeed, upon being informed of the error and breach of trust as it was by its own financial officer, might have ordered the issue of a rule nisi or any other mode of calling upon the appellants to show cause why the orders should not be rescinded. And finally, I am of opinion, that in a matter of this peculiar character, alleged irregularity in the procedure adopted in the court below, is not a matter to be entertained in this court upon appeal.\nThe appeal, therefore, must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Charles Millar & Co.\nSolicitors for the respondent, the Receiver General: F.E.

(1887.) c. 124\u201454 V. c. 20 (Ont.)\u201458 V. c. 23 (Ont.)\nIn order to give a preference to a particular creditor, a debtor who was in insolvent circumstances, executed a chattel mortgage upon his stock in trade in favour of a money\u2011lender by whom a loan was advanced. The money, which was in the hands of the mortgagee\u2019s solicitor, who also acted for the preferred creditor throughout the transaction, was at once paid over to the creditor who, at the same time, delivered to the solicitor, to be held by him as an escrow and dealt with as circumstances might require, a bond indemnifying the mortgagee against any loss under the chattel mortgage. The mortgagee had previously been consulted by the solicitor as to the loan, but was not informed that the transaction was being made in this manner to avoid the appearance of violating the acts respecting assignments and preferences and to bring the case within the ruling in Gibbons v. Wilson (17 Ont. App. R. 1).\nHeld, that all the circumstances, necessarily known to his solicitor in the transaction of the business, must be assumed to have been known to the mortgagee and the whole affair considered as one transaction contrived to evade the consequences of illegally preferring a particular creditor over others and that, under the circumstances, the advance made was not a bon\u00e2 fide payment of money within the meaning of the statutory exceptions. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, affirming the judgment of the Honourable the Chancellor, by which the plaintiffs\u2019 action was dismissed with costs.\nA statement of the case appears in the judgment now reported.\nGibbons Q.C. for the appellants. The person who lent the money to the insolvent was acting as an instrument of a particular creditor, the respondent company, which through him obtained an illegal preference over other creditors. He was not a bon\u00e2 fide lender, and the transaction does not come within Gibbons v. Wilson[1]; he was a trustee for the company to assist in a scheme to cover up the illegal transaction; Clarkson v. McMaster[2]; Molson\u2019s Bank v. Halter[3]. It was a transfer to the company, who got the proceeds and should be made to account for them for distribution amongst creditors.\nThis is a clear case for setting aside, as a preference, the transfer to the Sanford Company of the proceeds of the chattel mortgage. Wilson gave his cheque to the solicitors of the Sanford company, who had taken an order providing for the handing over of the same to the company. No money passed. If, in relation to the transfer of moneys, the solicitor is to be taken as representing The Sanford Company then there was a delivery to them of the cheque of a third party, Wilson, clearly a security transferred within the sixty days and subject to attack. If he is to be taken as representing Wilson, then the cheque given to the Sanford Company was the cheque of a third party and not cash or money and was the proper subject of attack as a pre- ference. Davidson v. Fraser[4]. Creditors, whose debts were maturing due, had a right to participate in the assets as they were, and the giving of the chattel mortgage would prevent them enforcing any portion of their claims. It was just as much a transaction with intent to defeat, delay and hinder as an absolute disposal of the stock. Gottwalls v. Mulholland[5]; Merchants Bank v. Clarke[6]; Mulcahy v. Archibald[7].\nRitchie Q.C. for the respondent, Wilson. Wilson had no knowledge that the money was intended for his co-respondents and did not know that they were creditors of the debtor. He did not know what the money was wanted for and had no right to ask. Had he known of the intention to pay a creditor in full, even if such payment would not leave sufficient to pay the other creditors in full, he had still a perfect right to make the advance and take the security, because the statute expressly favours payments in money. He had no knowledge whatever that the money was wanted to pay creditors, that his co-respondents were creditors, or that the debtor was insolvent, and the learned chanceller has found all these facts in his favour. Gibbons v. Wilson[8]. The debtor did not give the security to get under the cover and protection of the mortgage, and the learned chancellor refused to impute to this respondent knowledge of any understanding between his co-respondents and the debtor by which the latter was to get the support and assistance of the company. This respondent had no knowledge until the trial of this action that his co-respondents had executed and delivered in \u201cescrow\u201d a bond or guaranty, and this respondent had no communication of any kind with the person to whom it was delivered. He actually made a present bon\u00e2 fide advance of money and is entitled to hold the security he took.\nJohn J. Scott for the respondents, the W.E. Sanford Manufacturing Company. The chancellor\u2019s finding upon the facts are favourable to these respondents and against the appellants and should not be disturbed. The security was for a present actual bon\u00e2 fide advance of money and within the protection of the third section of the \u201cAct respecting Assignments and Preferences by Insolvent Persons.\u201d These respondents were not aware of any fraudulent intention, if any such existed, on the part of the mortgagor, to whom the money was actually paid, and the payment cannot be disturbed. The indemnity bond was left with the solicitor and delivered only as \u201can escrow.\u2019\u2019\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\u2014\nSEDGEWICK J.\u2014In the spring of the year 1895 one Eliza Barnet Cheyne commenced the clothing business in Toronto, and by the first of the month of November in that year had become indebted to the W.E. Sanford Company of Hamilton in the sum of about $4,700, and had also become indebted to the firm of Burns & Lewis, of London, and to other merchants in an amount exceeding $3,000. This indebtedness was to a considerable extent overdue at the time that the mortgage, which is now in controversy, was given. About the end of October the Sanford Company, hearing that Miss Cheyne was about to be proceeded against by some of her creditors, sent an agent to her and suggested that she should make an assignment for the general benefit of her creditors, the object being to have the assets divided ratably among the creditors. She refused to execute such an assignment, but it was agreed that her father, who all through appears to have been her business manager, and who alone on her side gave evidence in the case, should go to Hamilton for the purpose of entering into some arrangement looking to the liquidation of the Sanford Company indebtedness. He accordingly came to Hamilton and met there the principal officers of the company. These gentlemen retained the services of a firm of solicitors (Scott, Lees & Hobson) in the matter, which firm were, and had been for years previously, the solicitors of Mr. James D. Wilson, a retired merchant and money lender of Hamilton, who had frequently before advanced money to various parties, and upon such securities as were recommended to him by his solicitors. At the meeting between Cheyne and the company it was apparent that Miss Cheyne could not pay her debts as they become due and that it was an absolute necessity, if her business was to continue, that she must get by some means or other a very considerable extension of time. It was present also to the minds of the parties that she could not give an assignment of her property to the Sanford Company by way of security or by way of preference, because that would be in violation of the statute respecting assignments and preferences; but it was known that under a recent decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in the case of Gibbons v. Wilson[9] it was held in effect that it was not contrary to law that a debtor in insolvent circumstances might legally give a mortgage upon the security of his property to a third party and with the proceeds pay a single creditor in full to the detriment of his other creditors, and that too, even although the lender of the money were aware of the fact that such was his purpose and object in obtaining the loan when giving the security. It was then also ascertained that Mr. Wilson would be willing to advance whatever money the solicitors wanted upon the securities mentioned by them. It was further understood that in the event of Miss Cheyne giving a chattel mortgage to a third party he would advance her money sufficient to pay the Sanford debt. That security would enable her to hold her other creditors at bay so far as her assets exigible in execution were concerned until the moneys due under the security were paid. It was thereupon agreed that Miss Cheyne should give a chattel mortgage to Mr. Wilson upon her stock in trade, he advancing the amount of the Sanford debt, $4,775, and that the mortgage should be payable with interest at eight per cent per annum by weekly instalments of $100 each, the final instalment to be paid on the 11th of November, 1899 It was agreed further that the money received from Wilson should be handed over to the Sanford Company, thereby wiping out their indebtedness; further, that the Sanford Company should execute an instrument of indemnity guaranteeing to Wilson the amount of his loan, the solicitor to hold this security and to deal with it as the necessities of the case might require. There was in addition some kind of an indefinite understanding that the Sanford Company should continue to supply Miss Cheyne with goods to enable her to carry on her business (this promise on the part of the company forming to a very considerable extent the inducement under the influence of which Miss Cheyne became a party to the transactions), and that she should at once give to the Sanford Company a second chattel mortgage upon her stock, including subsequently acquired property, in consideration of the sum of $916, the amount of the value of the goods which they were then to advance, the money secured under such instrument to be paid forthwith. Previous to this final arrangement Mr. Scott, the partner of the solicitor, Mr. Lees, had a personal interview with Mr. Wilson and had in effect informed him that he wanted this money upon the security of a chattel mortgage covering the stock and goods owned by one Miss Cheyne in Toronto. Mr. Scott, who was aware of all the circumstances, had not given Mr. Wilson any further information upon the subject than I have stated, Mr. Wilson having the fullest confidence that so far as he was concerned, Mr. Scott\u2019s assurance that he would be fully protected was all that was necessary. He had never known or heard of Miss Cheyne before. In fact he did not know whether she was single or married, but as already stated he knew from his experience that he might place the most implicit reliance upon the advice of his solicitor, Mr. Scott. In pursuance then of this arrangement, Miss Cheyne executed the chattel mortgage in favour of Wilson, and Wilson gave the money to the solicitors; the solicitors gave the money to the company, the company gave the bond of indemnity in favour of Wilson to the solicitors, and within a week the Sanford Company sent goods to the extent of $916 to Miss Cheyne, and on the 5th of November she gave the chattel mortgage above referred to, to the company payable forthwith. Two weeks afterwards the Sanford Company, without Wilson\u2019s knowledge, took possession of the whole of the property covered by the mortgages, advertised the same for sale, and realized a sum not quite sufficient to pay off the two mortgages, leaving nothing whatever for the appellants, Messrs. Burns & Lewis, nor for any of her other creditors. An action was commenced on the 15th of November, 1895, a fortnight after the date of the mortgage, to set it aside, the defendants being Miss Cheyne, Mr. Wilson and the company. Upon the trial the learned Chancellor for Ontario de- cided, although with very great doubt, that the transaction was valid, and his finding was sustained by the Court of Appeal upon the authority of Gibbons v. Wilson[10], and it is from that judgment that this appeal is taken.\nThe law upon the subject is contained in the Act Respecting Assignments and Preferences of Insolvent Persons, (Revised Statutes of Ontario, ch, 124) and the Amending Acts, 54 Vict. ch. 20 and 58 Vict. ch. 23. Section 2 of the principal Act (R.S.O. Chap. 124) was repealed by the Act of 1891, a new section of that Act being substituted therefor, and it enacts, among other things:\nFirst\u2014\nThat every assignment of property made by a person at a time when he is in insolvent circumstances, or is unable to pay his debts in full, or knows that he is on the eve of insolvency, with intent to defeat, hinder, delay, or prejudice his creditors, or any one or more of them, shall as against his creditor or creditors injured, delayed or prejudiced, be utterly void.\nSecondly\u2014\nThat every such transfer to or for a creditor with intent to give such creditor an unjust preference over his other creditors or over any one or more of them, shall, as against the creditor or creditors injured, delayed, prejudiced or postponed, be utterly void.\nAnd further that a transaction of that kind shall be presumed to be made with intent and to be an unjust preference if made within sixty days previous to the time when any action is taken to impeach it. These provisions are, however, subject to section 3 of the principal Act, which enacts, among other things, that nothing in the preceding section, to which I have referred, should apply to any bon\u00e2 fide assignment of property which is made by way of security for any present actual bon\u00e2 fide advance of money. The Act of 1895 above referred to only affects this case in so far as it adds to the existing rights of the attacking creditors. In order to arrive at a conclusion as to whether this case comes within the statute the case must be looked at from three points of view, viz.: First, from the view of the debtor; secondly, from the view of the creditor; and thirdly, from the view of the lender. I do not think there can be any question here, but that Miss Cheyne, as a matter of fact, was a person in insolvent circumstances and unable to pay her debts in full at the time she executed the instrument impeached. There is a question, however, as to the intent with which she did it. Did she do it with the intent to delay her creditors, or with the intent to give a preference to the company, or only with the intent of enabling her to carry on her business? While this latter intent no doubt did exist there can be no question but that such intent was to be carried out by so protecting her property that her other creditors could not by any means avail themselves of it for the payment of their claims. In other words, her desire to carry on her business was to be attained by setting her other creditors at defiance through the medium of this chattel mortgage which for four years at least was to remain in existence against them. There was therefore clearly an intent on her part to hinder, delay, and prejudice her creditors.\nNow, from the point of view of the company: It was admitted at the argument, and it is unquestionably correct, that they could not have taken this mortgage in their own names. Had they done so it would at once have come within the statute and been void as an unjust preference.\nThe principal question in controversy is as to Wilson. Was this mortgage, so far as he was concerned, by way of security for a \u201cpresent actual bon\u00e2 fide advance of money?\u201d Now I admit that an insolvent debtor may sell or mortgage his property for money and then pay that money to one of his creditors, even though in doing so, he should give a preference to that creditor over all of the other creditors, and further that such a transaction cannot be successfully attacked under the statute, even though the lender knows of the debtor\u2019s intent to effect such preference, and we have so held in Campbell v. Patterson[11]. The payment of money to a person in exchange for property of that person does not per se affect in any way the quantum of his assets available for his creditors generally, and there is no principle of law which compels any man bargaining for or taking security upon goods to make any inquiry either before or afterwards as to what disposition it is intended to make of the money or property transferred. He is none the less debarred from completing the transaction even although aware of its purpose. Is Mr. Wilson in that position here? He endeavours to shield himself by setting up his ignorance. It was at first contended at the argument before us that Mr. Scott was not his solicitor, and even if it were held that he was, the solicitor\u2019s knowledge was not his knowledge. The first contention was abandoned, but the other was pressed. So far as this point is concerned we are of opinion that his solicitor\u2019s knowledge necessarily acquired in connection with these same transactions was his knowledge, and that he must be held to have known what his solicitor knew. It was in our view the same as if the solicitor had Mr. Wilson\u2019s money in his hands for the purpose of investing it in such a way as the solicitor might think expedient, he having a power of attorney to carry on the business in the same way and to the full extent that his principal might have done. Under such circumstances, the defence of ignorance on the part of the principal would be of no avail as against the knowledge of the attorney. Now, in our view all of these transactions must be viewed as one transaction. Each of its constituent facts had relation to every other in connection with it, and all must stand or fall together. The defendant company were rightly desirous of payment or security for their debt. They called in the aid of a solicitor to advise as to how this desire might be accomplished. The solicitor had, in substance, in his possession funds of his principal with full powers of investing them. Both he and the company knew that the debtor could not give a security direct to the company. That would undoubtedly be a violation of the statute, but the solicitor suggests: \u201cIn your interest I can get over the statute. I have read Gibbons v. Wilson[12]; I will take my client\u2019s money and pay you and get Miss Cheyne to give a chattel mortgage to me, you at the same time giving me a bond of indemnity that I will eventually get back my money.\u201d It was a happy suggestion, is immediately adopted, and the transaction was completed upon these lines. I may have drawn too strong inferences from the admitted facts, but it is clear that substantially the transaction was just as I have stated. I do not think that under these circumstances the money, even although it was Wilson\u2019s money, was given in good faith to Miss Cheyne. The whole intent and object of the scheme, so far as the company was concerned, and so far as its solicitor (he being Wilson\u2019s solicitor as well) was concerned, was to secure the payment in full of the Sanford claim, the necessary consequence of which was, and was known to be, that all the other creditors would be, at all events, hindered and delayed in their remedies, if not, as matters subsequently turned out, defeated altogether. The money was not money paid to Miss Cheyne at all. The chattel mortgage was a mere instrument taken by the company to secure the object they had in view. Wilson himself was a like instrument used by them to aid in the same purpose, nothing more than a mere portion of the machine devised by the solicitor to work out his ingenious plan. It was not upon the security of the Toronto goods that the solicitor paid the company, but it was because he knew, whether by verbal promise or by reason of the written indemnity of the company, they would protect him and Wilson from all loss in the matter, and under these circumstances it seems to me an impossible task to show that there was a bon\u00e2 fide payment of money by Wilson to Miss Cheyne. On the contrary it was a mal\u00e2 fide payment to the company for the purpose of avoiding the statute under the guise of a colourable or fictitious payment to Miss Cheyne.\nIt is satisfactory to know that all the money due to Wilson has been realized from the sale of the proceeds, the same having been paid over to him since the commencement of this action, by the company.\nWe are of opinion that this appeal should be allowed. The result will be that the money received by the company from Wilson, instead of being devoted exclusively to the company\u2019s benefit, will now be divided pro rat\u00e2 among themselves and their fellow creditors.\nThere will be judgment for the appellants, and they will have judgment in the court below as asked in their statement of claim, with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Gibbons, Mulkern & Harper.\nSolicitor for the respondent, Wilson: T.B.

Thompson, (1897) 28 S.C.R. 219\nDate: 1897-12-09\nCatherine Frances Small (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nMary Callendar Thompson (Defendant) Respondent.\n1897: October 27, 28; December 9.\nPresent: Taschereau, Gwynne, Sedgewick, King and Girouard JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nMortgage\u2014Married women\u2014Implied covenant\u2014Disclaimer.\nWhere a deed of lands to a married woman, but which she did not sign, contained a recital that as part of the consideration the grantee should assume and pay off a mortgage debt thereon and a covenant to the same effect with the vendor his executors, administrators and assigns, and she took possession of the lands and enjoyed the same and the benefits thereunder without disclaiming or taking steps to free herself from the burthen of the title, it must be considered that in assenting to take under the deed she bound herself to the performance of the obligations therein stated to have been undertaken upon her behalf and an assignee of the covenant could enforce it against her separate estate.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversing the judgment of Armour C.J. in the High Court of Justice which ordered and adjudged that the plaintiff should recover $4,891.96 out of the separate property of the defendant Mary Calendar Thompson, with costs.\nThe action was brought against the respondent, a married woman, and Robert Cameron Sinclair for the purpose of enforcing against her and her separate estate a covenant contained in a deed of lands by him to her made under the following circumstances. The plaintiff had conveyed the lands to Sinclair by deed, whereby the said Sinclair assumed a mortgage thereon and covenanted with the plaintiff that he would pay the same. Sinclair afterwards conveyed the lands to the respondent by a deed made in consideration of the assumption by her of the said mortgage and a sum of money (the receipt whereof was by him acknowledged), and in the said deed there was contained a covenant with the vendor therein and his assigns by the said respondent that she would assume and pay off the said above mentioned mortgage when it fell due and to indemnify him and his assigns from all payments on account thereof. The respondent did not sign the deed which contained her covenant in favour of Sinclair, but she took possession and enjoyed the lands thereunder until the mortgagees took possession in default. The plaintiff obtained from Sinclair, before action, an assignment of all his rights against the defendant under the covenant in question. Subsequently Sinclair executed a release of the covenant by an instrument in writing which declared that there had been no intention at the time of the conveyance that the defendant should assume any personal liability to pay the mortgage although according to the deed she appeared to be liable therefor. The plaintiff appeals from the judgment of the Court of Appeal reversing the decision of the trial judge and directing judgment to be entered for the defendant Thompson. The issues raised on the appeal are set out in the judgment of His Lordship Mr. Justice King.\nArmour Q.C. for the appellant. The defendant was clearly liable on the documents, and parol evidence is inadmissible to contradict them, and inadmissible and insufficient to reform the deed, and the Court of Appeal was wrong in giving effect to such evidence. The defendant must now, retaining, as she does, the land, pay the balance of the consideration for which it was purchased. Cherry v. Heming[1]; Willson v. Leonard[2]; Webb v. Spicer[3]; Rex v. Houghton-le-Spring[4]. The conditions on which the deed was delivered are binding on the grantee as an essential part of the contract and germane thereto; Mackenzie v. Coulson[5], per James V.C. at page 375. She knew of the obligations charged upon her title; Eaton v. Bennett[6], and there was no error as to the agreement; McNeill v. Haines[7] per Ferguson J. at page 485. See also Hart v. Hart[8]. There has been no disclaimer either by deed or matter of record although she took possession as grantee and for years received the rents, issues and profits. Fraser v. Fairbanks[9] per Gwynne J. at page 87, and per Sedgewick J. at page 89; Smith v. Cooke[10]; Blair v. Assets Company[11] at page 418; also re Dunham[12]; and re Defoe[13]. This is not a case of dealing between husband and wife and McMichael v. Wilkie[14] cannot apply. See also Williams v. Balfour[15].\nAylesworth Q.C. for the respondent.\u2014The uncontradicted testimony shows that respondent\u2019s purchase of the property was upon the express condition and stipulation that she was not to assume or become liable for the mortgage thereon, but that Sinclair alone was to be liable for the mortgage without any right of indemnity, and that, by inadvertence and mistake, the alleged convenant sued on was inserted in the deed. The parol evidence was admissible to prove these facts; and, therefore, neither Sinclair nor any assignee from him could maintain an action on the supposed covenant. Story\u2019s Eq. Juris, sects. 153 and 155. Price v. Ley[16]; Wake v. Harrop[17]; Fraser v. Fairbanks[18]; British Canadian Loan Co. v. Tear[19]; Beatty v. Fitzsimmons[20]; Corby v. Grey[21].\nThe appellant, as assignee of the alleged covenant, stands in no better position that the assignor Sinclair, for the covenant is merely a chose in action, and the assignee takes it subject to the equities existing between the parties. Patterson v. McLean[22]; Davis v. Hawke[23]; In re Natal Investment Co.[24] The respondent is not bound by the deed from Sinclair to her, or by the covenant therein, as she did not execute the deed nor assent to it, and was never at any time in receipt of the rents and profits of the property conveyed by the deed. See Shep. Touchstone, 177; Com. Dig. tit. \u201cFait\u201d A2; Co. Litt 231a; 2 Roll Rep. 63. See also Webb v. Spicer[25]; Rex v. Houghton-le-Spring[26]; Burnett v. Lynch[27]; a party to a deed, who does not execute it, assent to it or take the benefit of it, is not bound by the deed or the covenant contained in it. Even though she had accepted the benefit of this deed, she would not be liable to the appellant in an action of covenant, for such an action cannot be maintained on a deed conveying land, executed by the grantor, and purporting to contain a covenant by the grantee to pay a mortgage on the property, but which deed has not been executed by the grantee. Credit Foncier Franco-Canadien v. Lawrie[28], and cases therein cited. The land in question was conveyed to the wife as the husband\u2019s nominee by deed absolute in form, but for the purpose of security only, and consequently she is not liable to indemnify the vendor. Walker v. Dickson[29]; Gordon v. Warren[30]; Fraser v. Fairbanks[31]. Sinclair acted as agent for the purchase of the property, and the respondent is not bound to pay off the mortgage or indemnify him, as this equitable obligation arises only between vendor and purchaser, and not between an agent and his principal. Even if she was under any implied obligation to Sinclair, such obligation was not one which could be assigned, and therefore, nothing passed to the plaintiff. Campbell v. Robinson[32]; Oliver v. McLaughlin[33]. See the language of the Lord Chancellor in Jones v. Kearney[34], at p. 155. See also Campbell v. Morrison[35].\nThe respondent being a married woman, the obligation to pay off the mortgage is not enforceable against her, as such obligation cannot be said to be a contract made by her in respect of her separate property; McMichael v. Wilkie[36]; especially as the liability, if any, arises wholly by implication of law and in the absence of contract, It can no more operate now than before the \u201cMarried Women\u2019s Property Act, 1884[37].\u201d We refer also to Wright v. Chard[38], A plaintiff who seeks to charge the separate estate of a married woman must make out at least some contract or engagement with him on her part. Jones v. Harris[39]; Johnson v. Gallagher at page 514 [40]; Aguilar v. Aguilar[41]; Ambrose v. Fraser[42].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by: KING J.\u2014Sinclair entered into a written contract to purchase, and expressly agreed to indemnify his vendor, Mrs. Small, against personal liability for the mortgage debt charged on the property and which formed part of the purchase money, but was suffered to be retained by the purchaser to protect him against the mortgage charge. It is claimed that he purchased for and on account of Thompson, the husband of the female defendant. In such case the principal on taking over the property would ordinarily be bound to the agent to assume any obligations for the purchase money which the agent had entered into with the consent of the principal.\nBut it is claimed that Sinclair, in consideration of $50 agreed with his principal to take upon himself the obligation to the vendor to assume payment of the mortgage debt without recourse against his principal.\nBoth Sinclair and Thompson swear to this, but the learned Chief Justice who tried the case did not give credit to their statements. First, as to Sinclair, Against his statement there is to be placed the clear statements of the deed to the contrary effect. And the deed was written by him, copied, he says, from the deed given to him by Mrs. Small. But is it not well nigh incredible that a person should make an express bargain to assume the responsibility for the mortgage debt himself, and then, having made such an agreement for a purpose which he swears was well known to him, viz., that his transferee should be free from all liability in respect of it, should immediately afterwards, in the course of carrying out the transfer, state in plain English what was palpably inconsistent with such agreement, viz., that Mrs. Thompson was to assume responsibility for the mortgage debt and to indemnify Sinclair against liability therefor? The explanation put forward, that the deed was copied by him from the original deed to him, is no explanation at all. In view of this and of Sinclair\u2019s assignment to Mrs. Small of his claim for indemnity against Mrs. Thompson, and then of his still later attempt to release the same to Mrs. Thompson, it is little wonder that the learned Chief Justice preferred to give effect to the terms of the deed as against Sinclair\u2019s attempt to cut it down.\nThen as to Thompson: There is the fact that he had the deed from 1890 to 1895 in his possession. He says that he never read it, but kept it in his safe all the time. But it seems to me (as it probably seemed to the learned Chief Justice) that one who contrives a plan of hiring a man of straw to place between the vendor and himself, so that in certain events he may not have to pay what they all suppose is the fair value of the property, and who then trusts so implicitly to the man of straw as to take a transfer from him without looking at it, ought not to be surprised if there is found some difficulty in acting upon his view of the transaction.\nThe action is, however, against Mrs. Thompson, who is sought to be made liable in respect of her separate estate, and this can only be done upon a contract by her. That she had separate estate is manifest upon the evidence. The question then is: Did she contract?\nIt is contended for the plaintiff that she was the real principal for whom Sinclair was acting, and that this was unknown to Mrs. Small at the time of the agreement. I think, however, the proper conclusion upon the evidence is that the consideration was paid by Thompson out of his own moneys.\nThen as to making out the deed to Mrs. Thompson. His account of it is that he did this in order to keep the property free from execution in a suit that he anti- cipated relative to the Princess Theatre. But Mrs. Thompson speaks of this theatre as being her separate property. As it appears that Thompson fell himself under a pre-nuptial obligation to transfer to his wife all property that he should become entitled to, and in pursuance of this did in fact transfer to her a number of properties, the more reasonable view is that in this case he was acting in the like manner, and so the transfer was in the nature of an advancement by Thompson to his wife. But in either case, and equally, the question is: Was there in fact a contract by her?\nThe indenture contained what purports to be an express covenant that she shall pay the amount of the mortgage debt and idemnify Sinclair against liability therefor.\nIt is also stated in the recital as part of the consideration that the grantee is to assume the obligation to pay the mortgage debt. Mrs. Thompson did not execute the deed, and the question is whether she has taken the benefit of it and adopted it. Upon execution of a deed the estate is divested out of the grantor and put in the party to whom the conveyance is made, although made in his absence and without his knowledge, until some disagreement to take the estate appears[43]. While, prim\u00e2 facie, every estate is supposed to be beneficial to the party to whom it is given, the party himself is the best judge of whether it is so or not, and he cannot be forced to take an estate against his will; accordingly he may renounce or refuse the gift. Townson v. Tickell[44]. \u201cHe is supposed to assent until he does some act to show his dissent,\u201d per Holroyd J.\nMrs. Thompson appears not to have known of the deed until action brought. However, there came a time when she did know of it; and so far (as appears to me), she has done no act since and down to the present time, to free herself from the burden of the title. She does indeed seek to free herself from obligations, whether express or implied, contained in the deed, contending that she did not execute it, and that she never authorized Sinclair or her husband to enter into any contract for the purchase, or to bind her in any way to pay the amount of the original consideration, or to accept the deed; and she claims that she cannot be held liable in respect of her separate estate upon any implied agreement to indemnify or save Sinclair harmless from payment of the mortgage. A person may indeed set up inconsistent defences in his pleading, but while some of the defences here imply an intention to hold to the transfer, there is, so far as I observe, nowhere a sufficiently distinct, or in fact any, disclaimer of all benefit and advantage under the deed, and no act or disclaimer proved in evidence. On the contrary, by pleading Sinclair\u2019s release of her covenant she adopts the conveyance of the property to her. This being so, and the deed upon the face of it showing a clear expression of intention that the grantee is to assume the obligation of the grantor to pay the mortgage debt as part of the original consideration, it would seem that Mrs. Thompson, in assenting to take under the deed, binds herself to the undertakings expressed in it on her part to be performed and fulfilled. She has therefore contracted in a way that binds her separate estate. Unfortunately owing to the speculative values placed upon the property at the time of purchase, the amount of the mortgage debt exceeds the present value of the property. Were it not so, this suit would not have reached this stage.\nAnother objection to plaintiff\u2019s claim is that it was not competent for Sinclair to assign, or for plaintiff to take an assignment of a liability of the nature of that alleged. This point comes specially up in an appeal argued next after this,[45] and is decided adversely to the objection here taken.\nUpon the whole case therefore, the appeal is to be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Henderson & Small.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Canniff & Canniff.\n[1] 4 Ex. 631.\n[2] 3 Beav. 373.\n[3] 13 Q.B. 886.\n[4] 2 B. & Ald. 375.\n[5] L.R. 8 Eq. 368.\n[6] 34 Beav. 196.\n[7] 17 O.R. 479.\n[8] 18 Ch.

No right of action could arise against the appellant until the mortgagor was damnified; Jacoby v. Whitmore[7]; Campbell v. Robinson[8]; Eddowes v. Argentine Loan and Mercantile Co.[9]; Hughes-Hallett v. Indian Mammoth Gold Mines Co.[10] A purely personal right of this kind cannot be assigned; Canham v. Rust[11]; Milnes v. Branch[12]; Haywood v. Brunswick Permanent Benefit Building Society[13]; In re Law Courts Chambers Co.[14]; Aldous v. Hicks[15].\nThis is not a case of a covenant to the covenantee or his assigns, and as such is distinguishable from Werderman v. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rate d\u2019Electricit\u00e9[16]. A mere possibility is not asssignable. Robinson v. Macdonell[17], at page 236. A mere naked right to be indemnified is not assignable. Smith v. Teer[18]; as to the effect of the assignment of the implied covenant, see Sutherland v. Webster[19], at page 227. The appellant refers to Walker v. Dickson[20]; Canada Landed and National Investment Co. v. Shaver[21]; Williams v. Balfour[22], per Strong J. at pp. 479-481, refering to Campbell v. Robinson[23].\nMcPherson and Clark for the respondent. The cases of Eddowes v. Argentine Loan and Mercantile Co.[24]; and Hughes-Hallet v. The Indian Mammoth Gold Mines Co.[25] are clearly distinguishable when read in the light of Hobbs v. Wayet[26]; Irving v. Boyd[27]; British Canadian Loan Co. v. Tear[28]; Davidson v. Gurd[29], and Ball. v. Tennant[30]. The right of action is complete against the purchaser of the equity of redemption who must be treated as a surety See Wooldridge v. Norris[31]; Cruse v. Paine[32]; Leith v. Freeland[33]; Boyd v. Robinson[34]; Smith v. Pears[35] at p. 86; Brig v. Dame, and Mathers v. Helliwell[36]. The appellant was bound to indemnify the mortgagor, Waring v. Ward[37]. He was liable both under the agreement and as purchaser of the equity of redemption, Thompson v Wilkes[38]; Boyd v. Johnston[39]; Fraser v. Fairbanks[40]; Canavan v. Meek[41]. The right amounted to a chose in action and is assignable. See R.S.O. (1887) c. 122, s. 7; Walker v. Dixon[42]. The amount of the mortgage debt having been withheld as part of the consideration gave plaintiff a right of action; Re Cozier, Parker v. Glover[43]; Canavan v. Meek[44], per Haggarty C.J. at pages 745\u2013746. See also Wolmershausen v. Gullick[45].\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nKING J.\u2014Upon an agreement for exchange of properties, Morrison conveyed certain premises in Toronto to Maloney subject to a mortgage for $2,500 given by Morrison to Campbell, the assumption of which mortgage was expressed in the deed from Morrison to Maloney to be in part consideration of the conveyance.\nSubsequently Morrison assigned to Campbell all liability or obligation of Maloney to him in respect of the mortgage debt. And in the present suit for foreclosure Campbell seeks as well a personal judgment against Maloney as against Morrison for the amount due on the mortgage. This was allowed by Robertson J., and affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, per Osler and Maclennan JJ.A. Burton C.J.O., dissenting.\nThe main contention by the present appellant in the court of first instance was that there were circumstances connected with the carrying out of the contract of exchange which rendered it inequitable for Morrison (and also for Campbell his assignee) to seek to enforce the alleged obligation to indemnify Morrison against the payment of the mortgage debt.\nThis was found against Maloney both by Mr. Justice Robertson and by the Court of Appeal, and we see no reason for reversing the conclusion come to upon the point.\nIn the Court of Appeal a re-argument was, however, directed upon the question whether such an obligation on the part of Maloney to indemnify Morrison was assignable either at all or before suit had been brought by Campbell against him for recovery of the amount of the mortgage debt. Upon this point the court decided in the affirmative, per Osler and Maclennan JJ.A. Burton C.J.O. dissenting.\nIt is admitted by the learned counsel for the appellant that the decisions in Ontario have been uniformly to this effect. Chief Justice Burton refers also to his agreement therewith in Ball v. Tennant[46]. But having occasion to dig around the foundations, he now finds them too weak to bear the superstructure.\nThe earliest expression of opinion noted on the point is that of Vice Chancellor Spragge in Irving v. Boyd[47], who says:\nI have no doubt that the equity of the mortgagor to compel his assignee to pay would pass by express assignment to the mortgagee * * It would simplify the remedy for the recovery of the mortgage money, giving a direct right of suit between the party to receive and the proper party to pay. It would create a privity which alone was wanting to make such a suit sustainable.\nIn British Canadian Loan Co. v. Tear[48] Mr. Chancellor Boyd says of this dictum:\nIt is intrinsically weighty and in my opinion correctly sets forth the law on this head.\nAnd in Ball v. Tennant45 already referred to, the present learned Chief Justice of Ontario says:\nIt has always appeared to me that an assignment to any one but the person for whose benefit it could be enforced was an idle proceeding, but that the equity of the mortgagor to compel his assignee to pay would pass by express assignment to the mortgagee. It would, as in this case, simplify the remedy for the recovery of the mortgage money and create the privity which alone was wanting to make such an action maintainable.\nThe ground upon which the same learned judge now comes to an opposite conclusion, is that the obligation which is raised by the transaction to indemnify the vendor against his personal obligation to pay the money due upon the vendor\u2019s mortgage, is an obligation which is personal in its nature, and that until the vendor is himself damnified by payment, or at least by action brought against him for the amount, there is nothing assignable.\nAgreements are said to be personal in this sense when they are based on confidences, or considerations applicable to special personal characteristics, and so cannot be usefully performed to or by another. An agreement to indemnify against payment of a possible money demand is no more personal in this sense than is one to indemnify against payment of a definite and matured liability or an agreement to pay a sum of money for another.\nThen as to there being nothing to assign until the vendor is himself damnified by payment or action brought to recover payment; supposing it to be the case that there is nothing for the assignment to operate on until then, it would still leave the formal assignment good as an agreement to assign, which would become operative and effectual as an assignment immediately upon the circumstances arising which create the occasion for the indemnity being made. The assignability of the obligation and the existence of circumstances necessary to support an action upon it are distinct things. The cases cited in appellant\u2019s factum, Eddowes v. The Argentine Loan and Mercantile Agency Co.[49], and Hughes-Hallett v. The Indian Mammoth Gold Mines Co.[50], relate to the latter matter.\nAs to the suggested distinction between an assignment to the mortgagee and to one not interested in the payment of the mortgage debt, suppose the mortagor to have paid such debt, it would be competent for him to assign to any one his claim over against his vendee. And this being so, there would seem to be no good reason for any such distinction in case of assignment prior to his discharge of the mortgage debt, assuming such to be a good assignment if made to the mortgagee. An assignment to a stranger to the mortgage debt in such case could, however, scarcely be conceived because he would get but a barren title.\nThe vendee is entitled to have his obligation enure to the discharge of the mortgage debt, so as to free the land from the charge, and consequently the assignee, if not interested therein, could derive no benefit, and the case is therefore one that would be little likely to arise.\nThe authorities referred to by Mr. Justice Maclennan also show that the vendor, becoming, as between himself and his vendee, a surety for the payment of the mortgage debt, is entitled, upon the debt becoming due and payable, to call upon the vendee to appropriate the balance of the consideration money suffered to remain in his hands to the relief of the vendor as surety.\nAs to settling the several rights in the one action, this is a matter of procedure, and certainly (as already observed), it simplifies the remedy and avoids circuity of action, and at the same time appears consistent with legal principle.\nThe appeal should therefore be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Macdonell & Bland.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McPherson, Clark, Campbell & Jarvis.\n[1] Campbell v.

App. R. 152) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] affirming the judgment in the Common Pleas Division of the High Court of Justice[2] which maintained the plaintiff\u2019s action with costs.\nThe plaintiff as assignee for the creditors brought the action to set aside three assignments by Z\u0153llner, an insolvent, upon his stock-in-trade made in form C to the Bank Act, dated respectively the 1st April, 1895, the 29th May, 1895, and the 23rd July, 1895, and purporting to secure the respective sums of $4,000, $4,000 and $3,670. On 5th December, 1894, Z\u0153llner was indebted to the bank and they had obtained from him and then held an assignment purporting to secure $4,000, given to replace a prior security of the same character and amount upon the renewal of the note secured by the prior assignment. A new arrangement was then entered into and that day Z\u0153llner wrote a letter embodying in part the terms of the agreement, as follows:\n\u201cMOUNT FOREST, Dec. 5, 1894.\n\u201cTHE AGENT, Bank of Hamilton, Mt. Forest.\n\u201cDEAR SIR,\u2014I hereby authorize you to place the proceeds of all drafts made by me and handed to you for discount or collection to the credit of a special account to be held by you as general collateral security for any advances the Bank of Hamilton have made or may at any time hereafter make to me, and you are further authorized to apply the proceeds at credit of this special account towards the the payment or reduction of any advance or advances as you may from time to time deem expedient.\u201d\n\u201cYours truly, E.F.R. Z\u0152LLNER\u201d\nIt was part of the arrangement that Z\u0153llner should pay off the debt which the assignment then held by the defendant was intended to secure, and a special account (called account No. 2) was opened in the defendant\u2019s books, to the credit of which were placed from time to time the proceeds of drafts or notes which Z\u0153llner discounted or left for collection, and to it were debited the drafts and notes dishonoured at maturity. There then was at the credit of Z\u0153llner in his general account (account No. 1, as it was afterwards called), a balance of $31.49, but he was indebted in a considerable sum, as security for which they held the assignment referred to, and after that date account No. 1 was not drawn on to pay any indebtness of Z\u0153llner to the bank.\nOn the 24th Jan., 1895, Z\u0153llner wrote a letter authorizing the bank to place ten per cent of the proceeds of drafts handed in for discount and collection, to the credit of a guarantee account to be held as general collateral security for past or future advances made or to be made, and to be applied as the bank might deem expedient towards the payment or reduction of the account in respect to these advances. This third account was then opened and credited with ten per cent of the bills from time to time discounted or left for collection by Z\u0153llner, and on the 5th of August, 1895, the balance at Z\u0153llner\u2019s credit was $2,014.06, and so remained at the time of the assignment to the plaintiff for the benefit of creditors.\nThe three assignments in question originated as follows:\n1st. On the 10th Dec., 1894, $4,000 was placed to the credit of Z\u0153llner, in account No. 1, and he gave the bank his note for $4,000 and an assignment securing it. On the 29th May, 1895, the note was charged to account No. 2, and a new note for $4,000 and a new assignment to secure it were taken from Z\u0153llner, and $4,000 were placed to his credit in account No. 1:\u2014\n2nd. On the 4th Feb., 1895, a note for $4,000 and an assignment were received by the bank from Z\u0153llner, and $4,000 placed to his credit in account No. 2. On the 25th June, 1895, he paid the bank $330. On the 23rd July following, the balance of the note was charged to his account, No. 2, and he gave a new note and a new assignment to secure it, on the following day $3,670 being placed to his credit in account No. 1.\n3rd. On the 1st April, 1895, Z\u0153llner gave to the bank a note for $4,000 and an assignment to secure it and $4,000 were credited to him in account No. 1. On the following day the amount of Z\u0153llner\u2019s note for $4,000 held by the bank and secured by the assignment held when the new arrangement of the 5th Dec., 1894, was charged to his account No. 2.\nThe result of the new arrangement and the manner of keeping the three accounts that were thus opened and kept with Z\u0153llner was that, at the end of March 1895, the general account (No 1) was balanced by the withdrawal by Z\u0153llner of $3, the amount then remaining at his credit, and there was at his credit in the special account (No. 2), $7,961.93, and in the guarantee account (No. 3), $727 85. On the 1st April, 1895, after giving credit for the $4,000 which were on that day entered in account No. 1, there was at the credit of Z\u0153llner in that account $4,000 and on the following day by the debit of the $4,000 and a further debit of $92.80 for interest entered in account No. 2, the balance at his credit in that account which was then $8,215.18 was reduced to $4,122.38. On the 29th May, 1895, after giving credit for $4,000 that day entered in account No. 1, the balance at Z\u0153llner\u2019s credit (the debits and credits up to that time being equal to one another), was $4,000, and by the debit of the $4,000 entered in account No. 2 on the same day his then credit balance in that account was reduced from $7,544.01 to $3,544.01. On the 24th July, 1895, after giving credit for the $3,670 on that day entered in account No. 1 (the debits and credits up to that time being equal to one another) the balance at Z\u0153llner\u2019s credit in that account was $3,670, and by the debit of the same amount entered in account No. 2, and on the 23rd of that month the balance then at his credit in that account was reduced from $7,820.96 to $4,150.96.\nAt the time the assignments were made the respective sums, for which promissory notes were taken payable on demand, were placed to Z\u0153llner\u2019s credit in account No. 1, but though the amounts of these advances were so credited, and there were sums standing to his credit in accounts Nos. 2 and 3, he was not in a position to draw any part of the moneys, because under his arrangement with the bank the moneys at the credit of those accounts were held by the bank as security for his indebtedness, and he could draw nothing from account No. 1 unless he brought bills or notes for the amount he desired to obtain. At the date of the assignment to the plaintiff he had nominally $3,228.56 at the credit of account No. 1, $4,454.78 at the credit of account No. 2, and $2,014.06 at the credit of account No. 3, subject to these arrangements with the bank.\nThe judgment of the trial court declared the three assignments void as against the plaintiff as assignee of the estate of Z\u0153llner and that the defendants had not any lien on the goods mentioned in them. The Bank now appeals from the decision of the Court of Appeal by which the trial court\u2019s judgment was affirmed.\nJohn J. Scott for the appellant. The renewal of a note and taking of a new assignment, giving up the old assignment which was good until surrendered is clearly a \u201cnegotiating\u201d within the meaning of the Bank Act. Bank of Hamilton v. Noye Manufacturing Co.[3] at page 637; Foster et al v. Bowes[4]. See also McCrae v. Molsons Bank[5] per Spragge V.C. at page 522; In re Carew\u2019s Estate Act[6]; and Daniels on Negotiable Instruments (4 ed.) ch. VII. We also refer to Robertson v. Lajoie[7] at page 199; Larocque v. Beauchemin[8]; Marthinson v. Patterson[9]; Martin V. Sampson[10]; Merchants Bank v. Smith[11] per Taschereau J. at page 543; Tallman v. Smart[12]; Banque d\u2019Hochelaga v. Merchants Bank[13]. Gibbons Q.C and Henderson for the respondent. A security taken in form \u201cC\u201d in order to be valid must be for present advances made at the time it is given. The only actual advance made to the insolvent was at the time of the original assignment in 1893 when the first loan of $5,000 was negotiated. No cash was advanced in consideration of the assignments in force at the time the insolvent assigned to plaintiff for the benefit of creditors. See Bank of Hamilton v. Shepherd[14]. The methods adopted, even for that evasion of the statutes, are wholly inoperative. We refer to Clarkson v. McMaster[15]; and as to the definition of a \u201cdiscount\u201d see London Financial Association v. Kelk[16] at page 134.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nGIROUARD J.\u2014The appellants from time to time during the years 1893, 1894, 1895 advanced large sums of money to one Z\u0153llner, furniture manufacturer at Mount Forest, upon what they understood to be security upon all his furniture on hand and the materials procured for manufacture, and also upon the paper of his customers. It is admitted that no money was advanced by the bank at the time the security was taken except at the time the first transaction took place when the first assignment was made for $5,000, but that security was abandoned by several renewals and more particularly three made in 1895, which are alone claimed to be in force. Z\u0153llner has become insolvent and his assignee claims the articles assigned as part of the assets of the estate. The appellant contends that their security is valid under the 74th section of the Bank Act.\nChief Justice Meredith, who tried the case, held that was invalid in an elaborate and clear opinion both as to facts and law, and this judgment was unanimously confirmed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nWe are likewise of opinion that the Bank Act, secs. 74, 75, contemplates only cash advances made at the time the assignments are acquired, and that a renewal of notes or bills is not a negotiation within the meaning of section 75. The bills or notes may be renewed, but not the security. The Act does not authorize the substitution of one assignment for another. Any assignment made under section 74 for advances already made or to be made is illegal and confers no lien or security. The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs for the reasons given by Chief Justice Meredith as reported in 27 O.R. 435.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Scott, Lees & Hobson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Gibbons, Mulkern & Harper.\n[1] 24 Ont.

Carson et al.[2], and Re Ferguson, Bennett v. Coatsworth[3], for the construction of the will and administration of the estate of the late Edward Ferguson, deceased, which forms the subject of the controversy in this case.\nThe proceedings in this matter commenced by an order of the master in chambers on 3rd May, 1893, for the administration of the estate of the late Edward Ferguson, who died on the 9th January, 1874, having made his last will on 30th July, 1870, and leaving him surviving, his only child Jane\u201d who died a spinster on the 1st January, 1892, and his widow who died on 1st February, 1893, without having re-married.\nThe testator had two sisters, Eliza Purdy, who predeceased him, and Jane Ball, who died in 1878. At the time of the death of his daughter there were nephews and nieces of the deceased testator alive, namely, three of the children of the late Jane Ball and a son and three grandchildren of his other sister, the late Eliza Purdy, besides a number of grandnephews and grandnieces on the side of the Ball family.\nThe testator by his will, after sundry special bequests, devised all his other real and personal property to executors to be held for the use of his wife and daughter jointly, so long as they both survived and his widow remained unmarried; and in the event of the widow remaining unmarried and surviving the daughter, for her use for life, and in case the daughter survived her mother then for the use of the daughter as her separate estate with power to dispose of the same by will in case she should marry; and he then directed that in case his daughter died without leaving issue \u201cand without having made a will as aforesaid,\u201d that his trustees should (after the death of his widow, should she survive the daughter) sell all his estate real and personal and divide the same \u201cequally\u201d amongst his \u201cown right heirs\u201d who might prove relationship within a stated period.\nAn action, entitled Coatsworth et al. v. Carson et al.[4], was commenced in May, 1893, for the construction of the words \u201cmy own right heirs,\u201d in the will, and by the judgment therein the Chancellor held that these words signified such persons as would take real estate upon an intestacy and that the children of the heirs at law of the deceased were entitled to share per stirpes, and holding further that the testator\u2019s daughter was not empowered, by the clause in the will limiting her testamentary power, to devise the property in question, as she had predeceased the widow without issue. This judgment was amended on a petition presented by the appellants and thereupon the master-in-ordinary made his report. On an appeal therefrom, entitled Re Ferguson, Bennett v. Coatsworth[5], by some of the present respondents, the Chancellor held, having regard to his former judgment in Coatsworth et al. v. Carson et al., that the \u201cright heirs\u201d were to be ascertained at the death of the testator\u2019s daughter, and that the whole estate was to be divided amongst them equally, share and share alike, and also that the expression per stirpes in the former judgment was im- providently used, due weight not having been given to the word \u201cequally.\u201d\nOn appeal from this judgment the Court of Appeal for Ontario reversed both judgments of the Chancellor[6] and held that the testator\u2019s daughter was entitled to take as the \u201cright heir\u201d of the testator. From this latter judgment the present appeal is asserted.\nThe judgment appealed from, while reversing the Chancellor\u2019s decision, gave the appellants herein, who were respondents in the Court of Appeal, certain costs which were taxed and paid to the appellants out of moneys in court to the credit of the action.\nMacklem on behalf of the respondents, moved to quash the appeal on the ground that the appellants by accepting payment of these costs had acted upon the judgment now under appeal and taken a benefit thereunder, and cited Hayward v. Duff[7]; Pearce v. Chaplin[8]; Ball v. McCaffrey[9]; International Wrecking Co. v. Lobb[10]; Re Smart Infants[11]. After hearing counsel on both sides, the court reserved judgment until after the hearing upon the merits of the appeal.\nMcCarthy Q.C., McCullough Q.C. and Lobb for the appellants. If it is possible the court should give effect to the will as a whole; Jodrell v. Seale[12]; Leader v. Duffy[13]; and it is submitted that the scheme of the testator\u2019s will was to give certain lands to his daughter absolutely; to give his other property to his trustees to be held for the joint lives of his wife and daughter; if his wife married, one-third for his wife for life, and subject thereto for his daughter absolutely for life; if his wife did not marry and survived the daughter, for his wife for life; after the death of his daughter without issue, for his wife for life; if his wife survived his daughter, and his daughter should leave issue, one-third for his wife for life, and at his wife\u2019s death all for his daughter\u2019s issue equally; if his daughter should survive his wife, all for his daughter absolutely; then (clause four) if his daughter should survive his wife, all for his daughter, and if she should marry a special power to her to make her will; and (clause five) if his wife survived his daughter and his daughter died without issue, (this event happened) or if his daughter survived his wife and died without issue, and without having made the will, his trustees should, (at the death of his wife, if she survived his daughter) sell and divide all equally among his \u201cown right heirs\u201d who proved relationship within six months from the death of his wife or daughter, whichever last took place.\nThe words \u201cafter the death of my wife if she survive my said daughter\u201d can only apply to one event, the death of his daughter without issue before his wife, for his daughter might survive his wife and die without issue and, by clause four expressly, his daughter must survive his wife to be able to make a will. The ownership of the wife cannot apply if his daughter survives his wife. The first event may arise before his wife\u2019s death, but two events may arise after. The survivorship of the wife can only apply to the one event before his wife\u2019s death. If the daughter have issue and die before his wife, such issue take by his will; if she survive his wife, his daughter takes absolutely, and may then make her will. Nothing remained to be considered but the events:\u2014What would happen if his wife survived his daughter and his daughter had died without issue; or if his daughter survived his wife and died without issue; and with- out having made the will spoken of? The testator directs that in these events his trustees shall sell all his estate. But his wife\u2019s life estate must be protected, therefore, the trustees can only sell after his wife\u2019s death if it should happen that she survived his daughter. In re Wroe, Frith v. Wilson[14]; Pond v. Bergh[15].\nFull effect must be given, too, to the words \u201cas aforesaid,\u201d in the phrase \u201cwithout having made a will as aforesaid.\u201d By clause three, the daughter takes if she survives his wife; clause four re-declares this and gives his daughter power then to make a will. Until clause five came to be drawn, the testator had not provided for the death of his daughter without issue before his wife. If his wife survived his daughter and his daughter died without issue she could not have made a will, for by clause five he provides for that event. The words \u201cas aforesaid\u201d point to the survivorship of the daughter, then her will, and if her will could only be made \u201cas aforesaid\u201d she had not a general power to dispose of the property by will unless she survived her mother. As far as they go, the trusts in Lees v. Massey[16] are identical with those in this will, but that will had no such context to control the last trust.\nThe testator could not mean to describe an only daughter as \u201cmy relations,\u201d and direct also the residue to be distributed among those relations; the words \u201cmy own right heirs who may prove their relationship\u201d are equivalent to \u201cmy relations.\u201d Jones v. Colbeck[17].\nWhere the gift over is contained in the direction to pay and divide, the class is to be ascertained at the period of distribution. In re Mervin, Mervin v. Crossman[18]; In re Stevens, Clerk v. Stevens[19].\nThe testator did not mean to die intestate; intestacy is not to be presumed, and his words \u201cin case my daughter shall have died without issue,\u201d show that when his daughter and her issue can no longer take, his trustees are to find his own right heirs by proof of their relationship within six months after the death of his wife or daughter, whichever may last take place. Wharton v. Barker[20]; In re Rees, Williams v. Davies[21]; Doe d. King v. Frost[22]; In re Taylor, Taylor v. Ley[23]; Pinder v. Pinder[24]; Clark v. Hayne[25].\nAs to right to give devisee power to make a will without husband\u2019s consent, see Powell v. Boggis[26].\nAs to the daughter inheriting under the last clause of the will, see Bullock v. Downes[27]; Thompson v. Smith[28]; Wharton v. Baker[29]. It would go to the daughter without this clause and it was not intended for her benefit. Long v. Blackall[30].\nMortimer Clark Q.C. and Macklem for the respondents Carson, Bennett, Ball and Purdy, and the trustees and executors. The property goes to the daughter\u2019s representatives; it passed to her as property not specially disposed of by the will, or at least it passed to her as the right heir, and the clause in question contains an implied power to the daughter to dispose of the property by will, as she did. As to implication from use of words \u201cright heirs\u201d see Humphreys v. Humphreys[31]. The devise to the daughter and on her death without issue then over implies that if she left issue they would take. Houghton v. Bell[32].\nThe fact of the daughter having devised the property by her will absolutely prevented the possibility of the occurrence of the events upon which the devise to the right heirs depended. Between the years 1859 to 1873, there was doubt as to a married woman\u2019s right to will property unless empowered by the instrument under which she acquired it. See Armour on Titles (2 ed.) pp. 314\u2013315; Re Weekes\u2019s Settlement[33]. This provision can only have the purpose of removing any disability by reason of marriage to dispose of the property by will, and the words \u201cas aforesaid\u201d in the last clause are there used to continue in that clause the removal of any such disability. This final clause therefore means \u201cin case my daughter shall have died without having made a will, which I empower her to make notwithstanding her coverture, etc., etc.\u201d The only other words the testator could have intended the words \u201cas aforesaid\u201d to stand for would be the words \u201cof all or any part of the said property,\u201d immediately following the word \u201cwill\u201d in the fourth clause of the will. In this case the clause would read \u201cin case my daughter shall have died without leaving issue her surviving and without having made a will of all or any part of the said property.\u201d\nAs to construction of devise see Doe v. Lawson[34]; Mortimore v. Mortimore[35].\nThe law favours early vesting and since 1860 the rule in similar cases is that the property goes to those who were the testator\u2019s heirs or his heir at his death, and that immediately upon his death the estate vests in the heir notwithstanding any particular intervening limited estates, whether the same were in favour of the heir or of any other person; Bullock v. Downes[36]; and the rule applies although the tenant for life be the sole next of kin or one of the next of kin at the death of the testator and at the date of the will[37]. The rule can only be overcome by a clear declaration that the heirs are to be ascertained at some future time to that of his death, which has not been done in this case. The fact of the testator having left a life estate or other limited estate to his heir on the determination of which the estate is to go to his heirs is not sufficient to take the case out of the general rule. The fact that, at the time his will is made and at his death, his heir is only one individual to whom he has given a life estate and on whose death the estate shall go to \u201chis heirs\u201d is not sufficient to deprive his sole heir under the ultimate devise of the fee. Re Ford, Patten v. Sparks[38]; Re Nash, Prall v. Beaven[39]; Brabante v. Lalonde[40]; Re Barber\u2019s Will[41]; Wrightson v. McCauley[42]; Jarman on Wills, 8th ed., pp. 86 and 136; Thompson v. Smith[43]; R.S.O. cap. 109, sec. 31; Grundy v. Pinniger[44]; Holloway v. Holloway[45]; Tylee v. Deal[46].\nOn a perusal of the whole will, it seems clear that the daughter takes everything subject to a life estate and it is only if his daughter dies childless and without having disposed of the property by will, that the property goes to the \u201cright heirs.\u201d There is no benefit to any particular persons or intention to exclude any one by this last devise, but if all the limitations fail, he allows the law to give the property to those who would be entitled if he had died intestate.\nThe property vested in the daughter at the time of his death; Mays v. Carroll[47]; there is no other definite period indicated in the will, and there is no excuse for speculating as to any fictitious class of heirs to be ascertained at any other time. Re Bradley, Brown v. Cottrell[48]; Druitt v. Seaward[49]; Clark v. Hayne[50].\nThe ordinary legal meaning must be given to the words used in a will, and the court cannot speculate as to the testator\u2019s intention, but should construe the will according to the meaning of the words which the testator has actually used. Houghton v. Bell[51]; King v. Evans[52]; Grey v. Pearson[53].\nHodgins for the respondents, the trustees under the will of E. Ferguson and the executor of the will of Jane Ferguson submitted their rights to the court, and asked that provision should be made for their costs out of the estate in any event.

TASCHEREAU J.\u2014The motion made at the hearing to quash this appeal must be dismissed with costs as stated in the written judgment to be delivered by my brother Gwynne, and also for the reasons stated therein the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nGWYNNE J.\u2014This appeal must be dismissed with costs. The case appears to be free from doubt. A testator devised his residuary, real and personal property, to his executors upon trust after payment of his debts, &c., to hold the same to the use of his wife and daughter Jane, jointly, as long as they should both live, and his wife remain unmarried, but if his wife should marry again during the daughter\u2019s life, then upon trust to pay the wife during her natural life one-third of the net income arising from the property so devised in trust and, subject to such provision for the wife, to the use of the daughter for her life as her separate estate. But in case the wife should not marry again during the lifetime of the daughter and should survive the daughter, then upon the death of the daughter without leaving issue her surviving, upon trust to hold the property to the use of the wife for life, but if the daughter should have died leaving issue her surviving then upon trust to hold one-half of the property to the use of the wife for life, and subject thereto to hold all the property so devised to the use of such issue in equal shares. And in case the daughter should survive the wife then upon trust to hold all the said property to the use of the daughter, her heirs and assigns forever as her separate estate. The will then contained a clause the precise object of a part of which it is difficult to perceive, seeing that it relates expressly to the case only of the daughter surviving her mother when the whole estate becomes vested in the daughter who would then have no need for the power of making a will professed to be granted to her by the clause.\nThe clause is as follows:\u2014\nAnd I declare that the provision herein made for my said wife is in lieu of dower and all other claims upon my estate, real or personal, and that if she elects to take her dower in place of such provision she shall take nothing of my estate, real or personal, and further that in the event of my daughter surviving my said wife, in which case my property becomes hers, as aforesaid, I empower her notwithstanding her coverture in case she shall marry to dispose by will of the whole or any part of the said property.\nNow by the above will it appears that the testator had provided for every possible contingency except one, namely, what disposition should be made of the capital of the residuary real and personal property, so devised in trust in the event of the daughter dying without issue in the lifetime of the wife; and a clause was inserted for no other apparent purpose than for providing for such a contingency, and it must, in my opinion, be construed as having been introduced for that purpose for without it the capital in the event which has happened must have passed to testator\u2019s daughter as his sole heiress and next of kin. It is as follows:\u2014\nI direct that in case my daughter shall have died without leaving issue her surviving and without having made a will as aforesaid, my trustees shall after the death of my wife, if she survive my said daughter, sell all my estate, real and personal, and divide the same equally amongst my own right heirs who may prove to the satisfaction of my said trustees their relationship within six months from the death of my wife or daughter, whichever may last take place.\nNow, the contention of the appellants upon this clause is that, the words \u201cwithout having made a will as aforesaid\u201d must by force of the words as aforesaid be construed as relating to the clause professing to empower the daughter to make a will in the event of her surviving her mother, and to a will made in that event; but so construing the clause it is sufficient to say, that as that event has not happened the devise in the event of its happening can never take place. The only possible way to enable the devise over to take effect in the event of the daughter dying without issue in the lifetime of the mother, which is the event which has happened, is to construe the clause as providing for that event; that is to say, in case the daughter should die in the lifetime of the mother without leaving issue her surviving and without having made a will as aforesaid, that is as already provided in the case of her dying after the death of the mother, then over\u2014but as this event has not happened either the devise over can never take effect, and it is quite unnecessary to inquire who would be the persons competent to take the testator\u2019s bounty under the clause if the event upon the happening of which the devise to them was to take effect had happened. In the events which have happened there can, I think, be no doubt that the devisees under the daughter\u2019s will take the whole.\nIt only remains to dispose of the costs of the motion to quash which was heard at the same time as the appeal, for having given judgment on the merits in the appeal, it is scarcely necessary to say that we think the reception by the appellants of the costs mentioned in the affidavits in support of the motion was in no way inconsistent with the appeal against the judgment upon the construction of the will. We give no counsel fee on opposing the motion, but simply order that the solicitor\u2019s costs in opposing the motion be set off against the respondents\u2019 costs on dismissal of the appeal.\nSEDGEWICK J. concurred.\nKING J.\u2014The testator provides that in certain events which the appellants claim to have happened (but which, upon their construction of the will, respondents do not admit to have happened) the property in question is to go to his \u201cown right heirs.\u201d The question is, who are meant? The rule of law is that the expression \u201cright heirs\u201d or a similar term, means the heirs in the ordinary sense, namely, the person or persons who would be entitled to take at the testator\u2019s death in case of his dying intestate, unless the contrary sufficiently appears from the will, and the contrary does not sufficiently appear merely from the fact that by the will a prior particular estate is limited to a particular person, who presumably would, and in fact did, turn out to be the person filling the character of right heir. The law was so settled in Bullock v. Downes[64], and acted on in Mortimore v. Mortimore[65] and Re Ford[66], and recently in this court in Thompson v. Smith[67], the observations in which latter case are applicable to this case as well. The clause in question here is not indeed free from doubt, but upon the whole there does not appear in the will to be any sufficient indication that the words are used in a non-natural sense. It is consistent with what is expressed that the testator meant that, in certain contingencies, he would leave his property to those whom the law should deem his right heirs, be they whom they might. The observations of Bowen L.J. in Re Rawlins\u2019s Trust[68] are not inapplicable on the question of particular intent.\nIn the result I agree with Hagarty C.J.O., and also concur in his reasons.\nGIROUARD J. agreed that the motion should be dismissed with costs as stated in the judgment of His Lordship Mr. Justice Gwynne, and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McCullough & Burns.\nSolicitor for the respondent, Wm.

C.\nIn 1831 the owners of several contiguous farms purchased a roadway over adjacent lands to reach their cultivated fields beyond a steep mountain which crossed their properties, and by a clauee inserted in the deed to which they all were parties they respectively agreed \" to furnish roads upon their respective lands to go and come by the above purchased road for the cultivation of their lands, and that they would maintain these roads and make all necessary fences and gates at the common expense of themselves, their heirs and assigns.\" Prior to this deed and for some time afterwards the use of a road from the river front to a public highway at some distance farther back, had been tolerated by the plaintiff and his auteurs, across a portion of his farm which did not lie between the road so purchased over the spur of the mountain and the nearest point on the boundary of the defendant's land, but the latter claimed the right to continue to use the way. In an action (n\u00e9gatoire) to prohibit further use of the way:\nHeld, affirming the decision of the Court of Queen's Bench, that there was no title in writing sufficient to establish a servitude across the plaintiff's land over the roadway so permitted by mere tolerance; that the effect of the agreement between the purchasers was merely to establish servitudes across their respective lands so far as might be necessary to give each of the owners access to the road so purchased from the nearest practicable point of their respective lands across intervening properties of the others for the purpose of the cultivation of their lands beyond the mountain. Appeal from a judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]), reversing the decision of the Court of Review ([2]), and restoring the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Kamouraska, which maintained the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe plaintiff brought his action (actio negatoria servitutis) to prohibit the user of a roadway which the defendant claimed over certain of his lands by virtue of a title by deed and long usage, the plaintiff con\ntending that the title claimed applied only to certain other lands and not to the particular strip of land in question in this case. In the trial court the action was maintained, but this judgment wasreversed in the Court of Review by a majority of the judges, Larue J. dissenting. On appeal to the Court of Queen's Bench, the judgment of the Court of Review was reversed, the judgment of the trial court affirmed and the plaintiff's prayer granted with costs in all courts. From this decision the defendant appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. A full statement of the case is given in the judgment of His Lordehip Mr. Justice Gwynne now reported. A diagram of the lands affected by the dispute also appears in the judgment of His Lordship Mr Justice Grirouard.\nLangelier Q.C. (Choquette with him,) for the appellant. The conduct of the parties in permitting the user of the way shows the construction placed by them upon the deed, and that the intention was to establish the servitude. The city of Quebec v. The North Shore Railway Co.([3]); Les Pr\u00e9sident, etc., de la Commune de Berthier v. Denis ([4]).\nPelletier Q.C. (Riou with him,) for the respondent.\nThe strip of land in question was used at all times as a roadway by mere tolerance of the owner and was never affected by the agreement between the purchasers to furnish roadways to permit of passage round the mountain by the road purchased from Martial Riou. No title has been proved. Art. 549 C. C The extent of servitude established by the deed was no greater than might be required to get round the foot of the mountain and back again over the lands contiguous to the mountain side and in rear of it. It cannot be aggravated. Arts. 541, 545, 558 C. C.; 8 Laurent no. 261, 263; 12 Demolombe 849, 854, 926; 40 Dal. Rep.

Jur \"Voirie, par terre \" nos. 145-7; 12 Demolombe no. 644.\nTaschereau J.__I concur with my brother Girouard and for the reasons stated by him I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nGwynne J. __The present action was instituted by the respondent against the appellant to have it declared that certain land of the respondent in the first concession of the parish of Trois Pistoles, in the province of Quebec, situate between an old road which was in existence prior to 1831 along the River St. Lawrence in front of the said concession, and a new road constructed and opened across the said concession in 1850 at the distance of about twelve and three-quarter arpents south of the said old road, and in substitution there for, is not subiect to a servitude in favour of certain land of the appellant in the same concession and parish giving a right to the appellant as claimed by him, of passing and repassing on foot and with carriages, &c. It is only to this land of the respondent situate betwenn the said old road and the road constructed in 1850 that the present action relates.\nThe Superior Court maintained the contention of the plaintiff the now respondent, and rendered judgment in his favour. A majority of the Court of Review (Mr. Justice Larue dissenting) reversed that judgment and rendered judgment for the defendant; the Court of Queen's Bench in appeal unanimously reversed the judgment of the Court of Review and restored the judgment of the Superior Court, from which judgment the defendant in the action now appeals.\nFor some time prior to the year 1831, but for how long did not appear, Etienne Riou the great-grand father of both the plaintiff and the defendant owned and occupied the lands now owned and occupied by the plaintiff and the defendant respectively, and also other adjoining lands. Upon which part of the tract owned by him he had his dwelling-house did not appear, but it would seem to have been, or at least probably was, on the land occupied now by the plaintiff for he had on that a farm road extending from the river bank in a southerly direction for the cultivation and enjoyment of his land. When Etienne Riou died did not appear. He had three sons named respectively Ignace, Ger main and Julien, to each of whom the old man (whether by deed in his life time or by will did not appear) gave equal portions of his land. This must have taken place prior to 1831, for in that year they Were in occupation of their several portions, that of Ignace being situate west of and adjoining to land owned and occupied then by one Martial Riou, that of Germain being situate west of and adjoining to the land of Ignace, and that of Julien west of and adjoining to the land of Germain. West of and adjoining to the land of Julien was land occupied by one Her m\u00e9n\u00e9gelde Boucher; whether he was or was not a relation of the brothers Riou did not appear. In and prior to 1831 the three brothers Riou and Herm\u00e9n\u00e9gelde Boucher lived in houses on their respective lands built near the river, and Julien's brothers, Ignace and Germain, and Herm\u00e9u\u00e9gelde Boucher, not in virtue of any title whatever, but by the mere permission of Julien, were allowed to use the road on his land for the purpose of thereby reaching the rear of their respective lands. The reason for this permission being granted by Julien, apart from relationship and a neighbourly disposition, appears to have been that, at about the distance of five or six arpents from the river, the lands rose to a considerable height forming a ridge which crossed all the lands, and that upon the lands of Julienalone had a road as yet been made to ascend that height, and it was argued upon behalf of the defendant that it was so made in consequence of the height being of much greater difficulty to ascend upon any of the lots than upon that of Julien, but the evidence does not support that contention. On the contrary there does not appear to have been any greater difficulty attending the making of a road to ascend the height on the land now owned by the defendant than there was on the land now occupied by the plaintiff. The question is only one of cost, which one of the plaintiff's witnesses, and one witness also of the defendant, places it at about $50, while another of defendant's witnesses places it at about twice that amount; but what the cost would really be, or what the motive of Julien was in giving such permission for the use of a road on his land, are matters of no importance, for it is not alleged or pre tended on behalf of the defendant that his auteurs had any right whatever to use the road in question otherwise than by the favour and mere permission of Julien Riou (who was grandfather of the plain tiff), prior to the execution of a deed of the 10th May 1831, in virtue of which the defendant now asserts title to the servitude on plaintiff's land, now claimed by him; and the simple question therefore before us, is as to the construction of that deed.\nIt will be convenient, however, to state here that at the distance of about eighteen arpents south of the old road there was a great mountain which crossed all the lands west of the land of Martial Riou, and extended over the line between the lands of Ignace and Martial into the land of Martial where it abruptly terminated. It was impossible to cross this mountain for farm purposes from the lands on its north side to the lands on its south side, so that the parties owning land on the north side could not cultivate the lands on the south side although their lots extended over the mountain to the distanc\u00e9 of twenty arpents from the foot of the mountain on its south side. South also of the new road which was opened in 1850, there extended \"un petit rocher,\" across the lands of Ignace and Germain which terminated abruptly on the lands of their brother Julien, just across the line between the lands of Germain and Julien.\nNow, upon the 10th of May, 1831, by deed of that date, Martial Riou conveyed a strip of his land to Ignace, Germain and Julien Rion, and Hem\u00e9n\u00e9gelde Boucher, their heirs and assigns, purchased by them for a road round the mountain from the line separating the land of Ignace from the land of Martial on the north side to the same line continued on the south side of the mountain. This deed contained a clause that:\nIt has been expressly agreed between the purchasers that they shall furnish respectively roads upon their respective lands to go and come by the said above purchased road for the cultivation of their lands and that they will maintain these roads and make all necessary fences and gates at the common expense of themselves, their heirs and assigns forever.\nNow here it is observed that no particular locality or line for the roads upon the respective farms of the purchasers for the purpose of giving access to the road purchased from Martial is specified or indicated. The defendant however contends that this clause in the deed constituted a grant of a servitude imposed upon the land of Julien in favour of the lands of Ignace and Grermain Riou and Herm\u00e9n\u00e9gelde Boucher respectively, giving to them respectively and to their respective heirs and assigns forever, owners and occupiers of said lands, a right to pass and repass on foot and with carriages, &c., over the farm road so as aforesaid being on the land of Julien from the old public road in front on the bank of the river to and from all parts of their respective lands. This contention is not rested upon any express provision in the deed to that effect, but simply upon this, that as all the purchasers of the strip of land from Martial were living in 1831, when the deed was executed, on their lands abutting on the old public road in front, on the bank of the river, it must be assumed to have been intended that each should have access from his dwelling-house in front to all parts of his land above the height near the front for the culture of all his land, as well that lying nortk as that lying south of the mountain, and that it was but reasonable to hold that the road on Julien's place which all had been in the habit of using before the execution of the deed of May, 1881, should be continued to be used as formerly and should be the road to be furnished by Julien under the terms of the deed; but granting such an expectation to have been entertained, as there is not a word in the deed having any reference whatever to such previous user the use of the road after the execution of the deed if continued must be attributed to the same origin as before, namely, the mere favour and permission of Julien and not to any other authority whatever, much less to a title sufficient to create a servitude within art. 549 C. C.\nIf this contention were well founded the servitude would still continue even though the respective purchasers of the road on Martial's land, or any of them, or their or any of their heirs or assigns, should sell to other parties the portions of their respective farms which lie south of the mountain; such a construction is in direct opposition to the express term of the agreement in the deed which is relied upon as creating the servitude, for all that the agreement provides for is that each of the purchasers of the road from Martial shall have free access to such road from their respective farms across the intervening lands. This appears to me to be the plain natural construction of the language used. No place is stated in the deed where any of the purchasers shall enter on the land of his adjoining neighbour for the purpose of obtaining access to the purchased road round the mountain, but the natural construction of the deed is that each should enter from his own farm on to the road to be given on the land of his neighbour lying in the direction of the purchased road, not, as is contended by the defendant, that the purchasers of the road from Martial (whose lands lie east and west of Julien's land) and their respective heirs and assigns forever should have a common right of passing and repassing from the front of their respective farms, on to the old public road, on the river's bank, and to travel along such road, some more, some less than a quarter of a mile until they should reach the point where Julien's farm road entered upon such old public road and then travel up Julien's farm road to the point where he should enter upon Germain's land on the way to the purchased road. There is no suggestion offered in the deed, or outside of it indeed, why such a servitude should be imposed upon Julien's land without any consideration given to him therefor, a servitude liable to be inceaased in the event of any of the parties to the deed their heirs or assigns, dividing their respective farms, as has already been done in respect of Germain's farm, the west half of which is now owned by the defendant, and east half by one Prudent Belanger. The deed suggests no reason why each party should not enter from his own farm directly on to the roadway across his farm to be given by him under the provisions of the deed of May, 1831, to provide access for his adjoining neighbour to the west reaching the purchased road. The deed does not suggest any difficulty necessitating a different provision nor in point of fact does there appear to have been any other than that attending the providing of a small sum of money which would be necessary in each case. There is nothing contained in the deed, nor has any reason been offered outside of it, which would justify the imposition of such a servitude upon Julien's land for the purpose of relieving the other parties to the deed from making farm roads through their own farms for the purpose of reaching the road across their farms to be given by them respectively under the deed of May, 1831, for the convenience of their next adjoining neighbour.\nThe plaintiff, however, appears to have always acted in the same liberal and neighbourly spirit as governed the acts of his auleurs in the old times, before the execution of the deed of May, 1831, by giving permission to his neighbours to use his farm road, and the defendant might still have enjoyed that privilege but for the abuse of it in which, in the estimation of the plaintiff, he has indulged in recent years. What the plaintiff is insisting upon now merely is that there is nothing in the deed of May, 1831, which would justify the construction that it converted a user which had previously been enjoyed as a mere favour by the permission of plaintiff's auteurs into a servitude imposed upon the plaintiff's land forever.\nThe new road opened in 1850 crossed the plaintiff's farm road near the place where the \" petit rocher \" terminates on the plaintiff's land just across the line which separates the land of the defendant from that of the plaintiff. Upon the road having been opened in 1850 the parties formerly residing near the river removed to the new road where they now reside, having built houses for themselves on the new road. The defendant's house is situate on the north side of the road and his farm buildings on the south side on the west half of the land formerly owned by Germain Riou. One Prudent Belanger resides on the east half of the same lot, upon which he has constructed a way for himself across the \" petit rocher \" to the road across the lot furnished for access by the plaintiff and the owner of Herm\u00e9n\u00e9gelde Boucher' land to the purchased road. There is nothing to prevent the defendant making a similar roadway for himself upon his half of the Germain lot, but nevertheless the plaintiff's auleurs and he himself ever since 1850 have kept and maintained, on the land now the plaintiff's, a road leading from the public road of 1850 round the \"petit rocher\" to the road across the defendant's land on the south side of the \"petit rocherr leading to the purchased road round the mountain; by this route the defendant has had and still has access to and from the road round the mountain, and this, as the plaintiff insists, affords complete compliance with all that under the agreement in the deed of 1831 he can be required to give even if the deed can be construed as relieving the defendant from making on his own land communication with the road made across his land for giving access from the plaintiff's land to the purchased road; but as the present action relates only to the plaintiff's farm road, extending from the public road of 1850 in a northerly direction, wholly away from the purchased road, all that it is necessary to say is that as to this road the defendant has not by the deed of 1831 or otherwise acquired any servitude over the plaintiff's land and the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench in appeal should therefore be affirmed and this appeal therefrom dismissed with costs.\nSedgwick and King JJ. concurred.\nGIROUARD J. Le plan suivant explique la situation\ndes lieux et sert consid\u00e9rablement \u00e0 l'intelligence du litige entre les parties: (Voir croquis, page 64.)\nLe demandeur JulienRiou, nie au d\u00e9fendeur, Charles Riou, tout droit de passage entre le vieux chemin et le chemin public actuel. Le but du contrat de 1831 \u00e9tait d'assurer aux propri\u00e9taires qui y sont d\u00e9nomm\u00e9s un acc\u00e9s \u00e0 la partie de leurs terres qui se trouvait en arri\u00e8re de la montagne au sud. Pour l'\u00e9viter ils ach\u00e8tent un chemin de Martial Riou et puis il conviennent:\nIl a \u00e9t\u00e9 express\u00e9ment convenu entre les acqu\u00e9reurs qu'ils se fourniront respectivement des ehemins sur leurs terres respectives pour aller et venir par le dit chemin ci-dessus vendu pour la culture de leurs terres et qu'ils entretiendront ces chemins et feront toutes les cl\u00f4tures et barri\u00e8res n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 frais communs entr'eux ainsi que leurs hoirs et ayants cause \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9.\nCette convention est claire, et il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire d'examiner la conduite des parties pour en d\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e; le faire serait contredire, l'acte authentique. Or cette convention n'\u00e9tablit pas une servitude d'un chemin sur toutes les terres qui y sont indiqu\u00e9es [Page 65]\nen faveur de toutes les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es \"pour la culture de leurs terres. \"Ces chemins n'existent que \"pour aller et venir au chemin ci-dessus vendu,\" c'est-\u00e0-dire, le chemin de Martial Riou. La convention ne permet pas, par exemple, \u00e0 Charles Riou de monter sur Ia terre de Julien Riou pour se rendre au chemin achet\u00e9 de Martial Riou; elle l'autorise simplement \u00e0 passer sur Ia terre de P. B\u00e9langer et de Benjamin Riou, en montant sur sa propre terre jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il arrive au chemin de la Montagne, qui n'existe chez lui que pour son utilit\u00e9 et celle de T. Belanger et Julien Riou. Ce dernier ne lui conteste pas n\u00e9anmoins le droit de passage au sud du chemin public actuel. Ce n'est qu'entre le vieux chemin et le chemin actuel au sud, qu'il lui nie cette servitude. M\u00eame lorsque Charles Riou et ses voisins avaient leurs residences sur le vieux chemin, ils n'avaient pas le droit d'user de la terre de Julien Riou comme ils le faisaient \u00e0 titre de pure tol\u00e9rance et bon voisinage de la part de Julien Riou et de ses auteurs, auquel il peut mettre fin quand il lui plait. A plus forte raison, doit-iI en \u00eatre ainsi, depuis qu'ils ont transport\u00e9 leurs b\u00e2tisses et leurs r\u00e9sidences sur le chemin nouveau, pr\u00e9s de l'Intercolonial. On ne peut pas certainement pr\u00e9tendre que quand Charles Riou se dirige vers l'ancien chemin, c'est \" pour aller et venir par le dit chemin ci-dessus vendu,\" c'est-\u00e0-dire, le chemin de la Montagne. L'appel est renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: P. A. Choquette.\nSolicitor for the respondent: S. C. Riou.\n[1] Q. B. 5 Q. B. 572.\n[2] Q .

C.\nAn action to revendicate a strip of land upon which an encroachment was admitted to have taken place by the erection of a building extending beyond the boundary line, and for the demolition and removal of the walls and the eviction of the defendant, involves questions relating to a title to land, independently of the controversy as to bare ownership, and is appealable to the Supreme Court of Canada under the provisions of the Supreme and Exchequer Courts Act.\nWhere, as the result of a mutual error respecting the division line, a - proprietor had in good faith and with the knowledge and consent of the owner of the adjoining lot, erected valuable buildings upon his own property and it afterwards appeared that his walls encroached slightly upon his neighbour's land, he cannot be compelled to demolish the walls which extend beyond the true boundary or be evicted from the strip of land they occupy, but should be allowed to retain it upon payment of reasonable indemnity.\nIn an action for revendication under the circumstances above mentioned, the judgment previously rendered in an action en bornage between the same parties cannot be set up as res judicata against the defendant's claim to be allowed to retain the ground encroached upon by paying reasonable indemnity, as the objects and causes of the two actions were different.\nAn owner of land need not have the division lines between his property and contiguous lots of land established by regular bornage before commencing to build thereon when there is an existing line of separation which has been recognized as the boundary.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side) ([1]), reversing the judgment of the Superior Court District of Montreal ([2]), which dismissed the plaintiff's action with costs.\nA statement of the facts and questions at issue in this case will be found in the judgment of His Lordship Mr. Justice Girouard now reported. At the hearing of the appeal a motion was made on behalf of the respondent to quash the appeal on the ground that the action was merely possessory in its nature and did not involve any question as to title to lands so as to bring it within the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada. Judgment on the motion was reserved and counsel were directed to proceed with the argument on the merits.\nGeoffrion Q.C. for the appellant. The whole question is whether or not the appellant is a trespasser, or whether or not, after having erected his building on the present site with the consent of his neighbour he can be ordered to demolish the walls when the common error is discovered. The building was erected with the consent of the proprietor ([3]), and two fins de non recevoir (estoppel) can be opposed by the trespasser who was in good faith; if the proprietor gave his consent knowingly, he has no action so long as the building exists; if he consented by error the encroacher is bound to indemnify his losing neigh bour to the extent of the value of the land encroached upon and of the depreciation of the remaining property. The neighbour cannot ask for the removal of the walls when he discovers his error bat only for the indemnity. The builder cannot be punished for imprudence, for he had the consent of his neighbour; the latter was equally imprudent when he gave his consent; the builder is negligent, only when he builds on a line selected and determined by him self alone, and without consulting his neighbour.\nSee in support the above contentions: 9 Demolombe, no. 691 ter et seq.; 38 Dal. Rep. Jur. \" Pro pri\u00e9t\u00e9,\" no. 452; Grandbarbe de Rigoul\u00e8ne v. Phalippont ([4]); Baudry-Lacantinerie, Des Biens, nos. 372, 377; Carr v. London and North-Westen Ry. Co ([5]) at page 749; Sheridan v. Barrett ([6]); Somersetshire Coal Canal Co. v. Harcourt ([7]).\nThe argument as to res judicata has nothing to support it for the two actions seek different ends and involve different questions. The bornage was necessary in the first place to ascertain whether error actually existed as to the boundary, or if the acknowledged line formed by fences, sheds and so forth was correct as formerly supposed; Martin v. Jones ([8]). The error being? ascertained the defendant is now entitled to set up all pleas and exceptions for the defence of his rights placed for the first time in jeopardy. Grassett v. Carter ([9]) applies inversely here; the defendant is not estopped but was kept in error and deceived by the plaintiff's conduct. Compare remarks of Taschereau J. at page 345, in Joyce v. Hart ([10]).\nAs to the question of jurisdiction, the action seeks to destroy a servitude or a modified title to real property, and questions the defendant's right to the accession of the land on which he was permitted to build his wall in good faith whilst he was in undisputed possession ([11]). The land thus used became the property of the builder of the wall subject to payment of reasonable indemnity ([12]). The buildings of which the demolition is sought are themselves immoveable property and they and the land are incorporated together ([13]). This controversy consequently involves a title to real estate\nFortin for the respondent. There is no issue in this case affecting the title to the land. The defendant admits our title and the action involves only the right of possession and the demolition of the works constructed; Wineberg v. Hampson ([14]); The Emerald Phosphate Co. v. The Anglo-Continental Guano Works ([15]). The appellant has proved no title and is merely a trespasser. There is no right of eminent domain vested in private individuals ([16]). It would be against all principles of the law of ownership to allow the respondent to retain this property upon payment merely of its proportionate value.\nIt is true that he commenced to build in good faith and believed at that time that the buildings were on the division line but the evidence does not show that he accepted such line as the division line. It was incumbent upon him to ascertain the true division line before commencing to build. Moreover, if the appellant had acquired any rights to the property he should have urged them in the action en bornage, before the homologation of the report of the land surveyor and the judgment in that case is now res indicata and bars his claims.\nIn the judgment of the trial court the learned judge considered the extent of land as being insignificant and applied the maxim \"de minimis non curat lex.\" Seventeen inches of land in a city may have a great value. The learned judge reached that conclusion by taking into consideration the nine inches of land that each neighbour is bound to furnish for the construction of a common wall. But the wall in question is not a common wall, and consequently the respondent was not bound to furnish one inch of his land. In addition to the authorities cited in the judgment appealed from we add the following:\u2014Hellot v. Leclerc-Morlet ([17]); Oursel v. Delaroche ([18]); Joyce v. Hart ([19]); Kough v. Nolin ([20]).\nTaschereau J.\u2014J'ai \u00e9prouv\u00e9 beaucoup de difficult\u00e9 a en venir \u00e0 une conclusion dans cette cause et je suis encore loin d'\u00eatre sir que l'appelant doive r\u00e9ussir. 11 me serait inutile cependant de retarder le jugement, ou d'entrer un dissentiment. Je concours dubitance.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by:\nGIROUARD J.\u2014L'appelant et l'intim\u00e9 sont propri\u00e9- taires d'emplacements contig\u00fcs, situ\u00e9s sur la rue Visi tation de la cite de Montr\u00e9al, qui, jusqu'\u00e0 l'ann\u00e9e 1890, \u00e9taient la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de M. St.-Jean, leur auteur com- mun. L'intim\u00e9 acquit le premier et avait sa residence le si\u00e8ge de ses affaires et un clos de bois sur son lot; l'appelant n'avait qu'un bocataire dans une vieille maison sur le sien. En juin 1894, il ouvrit une rue sur son terrain, qu'il appela i'avenue Delorme, et se d\u00e9cida \u00e0 d\u00e9molir les anciens b\u00e2timents et \u00e0 b\u00e2tir un p\u00e2t\u00e9 de logements en briques, pla\u00e7ant l'arri\u00e8re-mur le long de Ia ligne separative. Il s'agit de savoir si le propri\u00e9taire qui, en b\u00e2tissant, empi\u00e8te de bonn\u00ba foi sur le fonds de son voisin an su et au vu de ce dernier sans protestation de sa part, et m\u00eame avec son consen ti tement, mais par suite d'une erreur commune sur la veritable ligne de division, peut \u00eatre force \u00e0 d\u00e9mollr et enlever ses constructions. Il faut bien remarquer que le consentement du voisin n'est pas seulement tacite comme resultant de sa presence sur les lieux et de son d\u00e9faut de protestation, lorsque les constructions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commenc\u00e9es et faites, mais il est formel et expr\u00e8s \u00e0 raison des dires et gestes des parties. L'architecte Simard redigea m\u00e9me un \u00e9crit de leur entente qu'il leur proposa de signer, mais l'intim\u00e9 et l'appelant ont tous deux r\u00e9pondu que cette formalit\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire, \"vu que la ligne \u00e9tait l\u00e0.\" Il existait en effet une vieille ligne\u2014consistant en une cloture et une vieille boutique\u2014qui fut accept\u00e9e par les parties au moins pour les fins de l'\u00e9rection des constructions de l'appelant comme la veritable ligne de division\u2014 l'intim\u00e9 aidant m\u00eame \u00e0 l'enlever bien que sur son terrain (ainsi qu'il l'apprit plus tard), pour faire place aux nouvelles constructions. C'est dans cette vieille ligrne qu'elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9es apparemment sur le terrain de l'appelant et sans mitoyennet\u00e9.\nCe n'est qu'en juillet 1894, apres que les logements furent presque parachev\u00e9s \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur (lemur debriques le long de la ligne de division l'\u00e9tait certainement), que l'intim\u00e9 d\u00e9couvrtt qu'il \u00e9tait dans l'erreur d'au moins dix pouces; il ne demanda pas alors \u00e0 l'appelant de d\u00e9molir ses constructions * jusqu'ici, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 avec lui dans les meilleur rapports de voisinage; il se contenta de lui communiquer sa d\u00e9couverte sans protester. L'appelant lui proposa de l'indemniser en lui donnant cinq pouces de terrain sur Ia devanture de son emplacement, sur lesquels ils n'avait pas b\u00e2ti, formant trois cents quinze pieds de terre valant environ 70 centins le pied ou en tout $220; en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 c'\u00e9tait huit pouces de large sur soixantetrois pieds que l'appelant avait laiss\u00e9s. L'intim\u00e9 accueillit la proposition de l'appelant comme suit:\nR. Je n'ai rien dit l\u00e0-dessus. J'ai dit: si vous faites toutes les reparations que vous devez faire, on verra cela. Il devait faire son pignon de maison sur le mien et la chemin\u00e9e a la hauteur de la loi et me laisser les cinq pouces. Mais apr\u00e8s avoir b\u00e2ti la maison en avant, il n'a rien fait. Alors je lui ai dit: donnez-moi mon terrain.\nIl para\u00eet que l'intim\u00e9 aurait m\u00e9me fait signifier un prot\u00eat notari\u00e9; mais \u00e0 quelle date et quelle fut sa teneur? Impossible de le dire. Le prot\u00eat n'est pas produit. Il para\u00eet qu'il contient des admissions que l'intim\u00e9 a plus tard d\u00e9savou\u00e9es. C'est ce qu'affirme le t\u00e9moin Lacroix.\nCe n'est que l'ann\u00e9e suivante, le 18 juin 1895, lors-que la b\u00e2tisse \u00e9tait finie qu'il fait constater contradictoirement son erreur par un arpenteur, dans une action en bornage, sans cependant all\u00e9guer l'empi\u00e9tement et sans prendre de conclusions en eviction. Ce n'est que du jour de l'institution de cette action que la bonne foi du d\u00e9fendeur a Pu cesser d'exister; art. 412 C. C. different du Code Napoleon, art. 550.\nLe terrain de l'intim\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 anticip\u00e9 de dix-sept pouces \u00e0 sa profondeur sur une longueur en r\u00e9tr\u00e9cissant jusqu'\u00e0 rien de soixante pieds le long de la ligne de division, formant quarante-deux pieds de terre en superficie valant 80 centins le pied ou en tout $12.60. Sur le reste de la ligne, savoir, soixante-trois pieds de long, l'appelant se trouvait avoir b\u00e2ti sur son terrain \u00e0 environ huit pouces de Ia ligne, sur lesquels se trouvait la vieille maison en bois de l'intim\u00e9.\nL'appelant n'a pas plaid\u00e9 \u00e0 l'encontre de la demande en bornage. L'on pretend que ce bornage forme chose jug'\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9sente demande aux termes de l'article 1241 du Code Civil. Mais les deux demandes n'ont pas le m\u00eame objet. L'une est en bornage et l'autre au p\u00e9titoire et en demolition de constructions \u00e9lev\u00e9es sur le terrain d'autrui. D'ailleurs les deux actions 'n'ont pas Ia m\u00e9me cause ; l'une est fondee sur les titres des parties et l'autre sur leur erreur commune et sur des faits \u00e9trangers \u00e0 ces tirres. Si l'intim\u00e9 e\u00fbt voulu \u00e9tablir chose jug\u00e9e il lui \u00e9tait facile de prendre des conclusions en eviction. Il ne l'a pas fait, paree qu'il n'y songeait pas encore s\u00e9rieusement.\nCe n'est que pr\u00e8s de deux mois apr\u00e8s ce bornage, que l'intim\u00e9, par ses avocats, fit sommer l'appelant de d\u00e9molir et enlever ses constructions conform\u00e9ment au bornage; il s'y \u00e9tait lui-m\u00eame conform\u00e9, en reculant volontairement sa maison. L'appelant ne fit rien; l'intim\u00e9 demandait $300 \u00e0 $400 pour le terrain empi\u00e9t\u00e9. Le 16 septembre 1895, sans offrir aucune indemnit\u00e9, et sans demander \u00e0 se faire relever de son erreur, l'intim\u00e9 intenta une action p\u00e9titoire pure et simple, car il \u00e9tait trop tard pour proc\u00e9der an possessoire. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a jug\u00e9 que dans les circonstances l'intim\u00e9 n'avait droit qu'\u00e0 la valeur de son terrain et renvoya l'action, r\u00e9servtnt le recours en dommages. La Cour d'Appel d\u00e9cida que ni la bonne foi de l'appelant, ni l'erreur commune des parties ne le justifiait de construire sans s'assurer de Ia veritable ligne de division entre les deux heritages. Il appelle de ce jugement \u00e0 cette cour.\nLe juge en chef Lacoste, qui a rendu le jugement de Ia Cour d'Appel constate que tout s'est fait \u00e0 Ia connaissance de l'intim\u00e9, qui croyait r\u00e9ellement dans le temps que l'appelant b\u00e2tissait dans la ligne m\u00eame. Non seulement c'\u00e9tait la croyance de l'intim\u00e9, c'\u00e9tait aussi celle de l'appelant et c'est l'intim\u00e9 qui nous le dit dans son t\u00e9moignage:\nQ. Et en arri\u00e8re, vous \u00e9tiez tous les deux sous l'impression que les b\u00e2timents \u00e9taient construits dans Ia ligne? R. Oui.\nComment concilier avec cette preuve le motif du jugement de la Cour d'Appel que l'intim\u00e9 n'avait pas accep\u00e9\u00e9 la dite ligne? La ligne fut accept\u00e9e dans le temps, mais par erreur; elle n'\u00e9tait pas conventionnelle en ce sens qu'elle liait les parties et d\u00e9limitait les deux heritages \u00e0 toujours; elle ne fut accep\u00e9ee que pour les fins de l'\u00e9rection des constructions nouvelles. C'\u00e9tait une fausse ligne, selon les titres des parties. \"Voil\u00e0 la source de tout le trouble.\nAjoutons que dans toute cette affaire, l'appelant, plus ou moins ignorant de la ligne de division, para\u00eet s'en \u00eatre enti\u00e8rement rapport\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, qui paraissait familier avec les lieux, et disait en avoir m\u00eame l'arpentage, du moins \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du depart de la ligne \u00e0 la devauture de leurs immeubles sur la rue Visitation.\nL'\u00e9quit\u00e9 est \u00e9videmment en faveur de l'appelant.\nPothier ([21]), parlant de l'accession, dit que si la chose principale est presque de nulle valeur en comparaison du prix de Ia chose accessoire, c'est la chose accessoire qui doit l'emporter, \u00e0 la charge de payer Ia valeur de la chose principale. Dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, le terrain empi\u00e9t\u00e9 avait une valeur insignifiante compar\u00e9e \u00e0 celle des constructions \u00e9lev\u00e9es sur ce terrain. Pothier ne dit pas si cette regle sapplique seulement a l'union des choses mobili\u0141res; il le laisse cependant entendre, puisque les exemples qu'il en donne sont de biens de cette nature; et telle est d'ailleurs l'opinion g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. (Dalloz, Propri\u00e9t\u00e9, n. 398; 6 Laurent, n. 252; C. C. art. 429 et suiv.) Quant aux immeubles, le possesseur se trouvait en face de l'article 187 de la Coutume de Paris reproduit aux articles 413 et suivants du Code Civil:\nQui a le sol a le dessus et le dessous, s'il n'y a titre an contraire.\nDisons de suite que le droit Romain prot\u00e9geait la bonne foi du possesseur qui b\u00e2tissait sur le fonds d'autrui Il ne pouvait en \u00eatre \u00e9vinc\u00e9 sans indemnit\u00e9 ([22]).\nCette r\u00e8gle para\u00eet \u00eatre fond\u00e9e m\u00eame sur le droit naturel. Selon 0-rotius et Puffendorf,|la bonne foi du possesseur lui tient lieu de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ([23]). Barbeyrac ajoute en note:\nAinsi, quels que puissent \u00eatre les r\u00e9glemens des loss civiles, je crois qu'\u00e0, ne consid\u00e9rer que le droit naturel, dans toute cette mati\u0141re, Ta bonne foi produit le m\u00eame effet en faveur du possesseur, que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9elle, comme les jurisconsultes Romains l'\u00e9tablissent eux-m\u00eames ([24]).\nC'est l'application de ce principe crue l'on trouve aux articles 411 et 417 du Code Civil, qui d\u00e9clarent que le possesseur de bonne foi fait les fruits siens et a droit \u00e0 la valeur de ses impenses et ameliorations.\nNous croyons le jugement de la Cour d'Appel contraire \u00e0 l'esprit et an texte m\u00eame du Code Civil.\nUn bornage r\u00e9gulier n'est pas requis pour qu'un propri\u00e9taire puisse b\u00e2tir; il suffit qu'une ligne s\u00e9parative existe on qu'un alignement soit donn\u00e9 par les deux voisins. Voir Gruyot, v\u00b0 Alignement; Desgodets, p. 67; Code Perrin\u2014Rendu, n. 83, 513; Bugnet, n. 75, 80-82; Vasserot, p. 128; Levesque v. McCready ([25]).\nIl nest pas question non plus que l'appelant garde la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9, \"non payant la valeur\" ainsi que la Cour d'Appel le declare dans un de ses consid\u00e9rants. L'appelant offre dans son plaidoyer de payer cette valeur.\nIl ne s'agit pas encore de savoir Si un propri\u00e9taire peut \u00eatre force de ceder sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9, excep\u00e9\u00e9 pour des causes d'utilit\u00e9 publique. L'intim\u00e9 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pouill\u00e9; il s'est d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame par erreur si l'on vent; mais le fait n'est pas moins vrai que, sous l'effet de cette erreur, il a laiss\u00e9 son voisin se mettre de bonne foi en possession d'une partie de son terrain et v b\u00e2tir. Son consentement \u00e9tant entach\u00e9 d'erreur 11 n'a pas perdu son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, mais ne doit-il pas souffrir le tort que cette erreur de sa part a caus\u00e9? Sans doute, il ne doit pas \u00eatre permis an voisin, m\u00eame de bonne foi et victime d'une erreur commune de s'enri- chir aux d\u00e9pens d'autrui i il' devra indemniser le propri\u00e9taire en lui payant la valeur de son terrain et m\u00eame il devra souffrir 1 eviction si oltre lui est faite de lui payer le dommage que cette erreur lui a cause, dommage que nous n'avons pas \u00e0 definir, puisque l'intim\u00e9 ne lui fait aucune offre, et demande simplement l'enl\u00e8vement des travaux. Ces obligations ne sont que la consequence rigoureuse de l'article 10.53 du Code Civil.\nElles r\u00e9sultent aussi de l'article 1047, qui sapplique aux immeubles comme aux meubles. On lit \u00e0 la page 97 des Instructions faciles sur les Conventions, an sujet de l'erreur de fait:\nLe juge dolt observer l'\u00e9tat o\u00f9 les choses sont; si on avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 agi en cons\u00e9quence de cet acte; si la rescision faisait tort \u00e0 d'autres, le juge ne pourrait l'accorder.\nDomat observe que la condition de celui qui re\u00e7oit par erreur\ndoit \u00eatre le m\u00eame que sil avait \u00e9t\u00e9 le ma\u00eetre de la chose ([26]).\n\" La d\u00e9couverte de l'erreur commune aux deux parties dit Toullier,\nne peut avoir d'effet r\u00e9troactif, annuler ce qui a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, ni donner lieu contre lui \u00e0 d'autre action qu'\u00e0 Ia restitution de ce dont il s'est enrichi ([27]).\nMarcad\u00e9:\nAlors m\u00eame que l'erreur sera coustante, l'autre partie pourra toujours, en vertu des art. 1382 et 1383 ([28]) se faire indemniser du tort qu'elle \u00e9prouve ([29]).\nDemolombe:\nLe contrat sera rescindable, sauf bien entendu, l'obligation \u00e0 la charge de la partie qui turait commis cette erreur, d'indemniser l'autre partie du pr\u00e9judice qu'elle aurait Pu lui causer; ce qui est un principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral dans cette mati\u00e9re ([30]).\nDemolombe r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 Pothier, No 19; 2 Larombi\u00e8re art. 1110 n. 13. A cette endroit Larombi\u00e8re remarque que\nla bonne foi doit \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e par l'erreur. Dumoulin et Pothier enseignent \u00e9galement que le cr\u00e9ancier qui a re\u00e7u de bonne foi, par suite d'une erreur, n'est sujet \u00e0 rendre, qu'en autant qu'il n'en souffrira aucun pr\u00e9judice et qu'il sera remis au m\u00eame \u00e9tat o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait avant de recevoir. C'est pourquoi ajoute Pothier, la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition n'a lieu que jusqu'\u00e0 con currence de ce qu'il en a profit\u00e9 ([31]).\nIl est douteux qu'il soit possible de trouver un seul auteur qui enseigne que celui qui, par erreur, cause du tort \u00e0 autrui n'est pas tenu \u00e0 le r\u00e9parer.\nOn dit que l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 seul \u00e0 causer ce pr\u00e9judice; l'appelant y a aussi contribu\u00e9 en partageant cette erreur. Pour cette raison, ce dernier ne pourra garder le terrain sans indemniser le premier, qui de son c\u00f4t\u00e9 ne pourra d\u00e9molir on faire d\u00e9molir les constructions sans en payer la valeur. Voil\u00e0 la cons\u00e9quence rigoureuse de leur erreur commune.\nSans cette erreur l'intim\u00e9 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 lie sans esp\u00e9rance d'indemnit\u00e9 m\u00eame jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de la valeur de son terrain du moins tant que les constructions dureront. L'erreur rend ce consentement non pas nul de plein droit, mais simplement annulable ([32]). Or l'intim\u00e9 ne demande pas \u00e0 \u00eatre relev\u00e9 de cette erreur, qui n'est pas m\u00eame sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e dans sa d\u00e9claration. Le consentement pur et simple lui est donc opposable; mais comme l'appelant allegue cette erreur dans sa d\u00e9fense et en cons\u00e9quence offre de l'indemniser, il n'est que juste que l'intim\u00e9 ait le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de cette offre.\nOn cite Aubry et Rau, Dalloz et Laurent contre les pr\u00e9tentions de l'appelant, mais ces commentateurs ne supposent pas le cas de l'erreur commune des deux propri\u00e9taires an sujet de la ligne de division: tons ne discutent que celui de la simple bonne foi du propri\u00e9taire qui a anticip\u00e9 sur son voisin, sans consid\u00e9rer la conduite de ce dernier. Les deux cas ne sont pas identiques* ils sont cependant assimil\u00e9s en droit. Domat, liv. 3, tit. 5, s. 3 n. 5 \u00e9d. Remy ([33]), nous dit que\nla bonne foi d'un possesseur a cet effet, qu'il peut se consid\u00e9rer comme \u00e9tant le ma\u00eetre; et cet \u00e9tat qu'il a droit de prendre pour Ia v\u00e9rit\u00e9, dolt lui en tenir lien\nVoir aussi page 206. Pothier, Propri\u00e9t\u00e9, n. 337, 341, enseigne la m\u00eame chose, invoquant Ia maxime: Bona fides tantum dem possidenti podestat quantum veritas. Le possesseur de bonne boi a done le droit de b\u00e2tir et par consequent, de garder son b\u00e2timent, ou au moins d'en avoir la valeur avant de d\u00e9guerpir. Voil\u00e0 le droit commun Fran\u00e7ais et aussi le droit Romain et le droit naturel, ainsi que nous l'avons vu\nLes commentateurs du Code Napol\u00e9on ne sont pas d'accord sur le point de savoir si l'article 555 s'applique au cas de l'empi\u00e9tement d'un propri\u00e9taire de bonne foi qui b\u00e2tit \u00e0 l'insu de son voisin. Il n'a alors que sa bonne foi et sa possession \u00e0 invoquer. Cela suffit-il? Maleville, Demolombe ([34]), Baudry-Lacantinerie et le Code Perrin-Rendu, n. 3962, enseignent l'affirmative. On oppose Aubry et Rau, Dalloz et Laurent.\nPour ce qui est des compilations publi\u00e9es sous le nom de DalIoz, les deux opinions v trouvent des d\u00e9fenseurs une de cet eminent jurisconsulte favorable \u00e0 l'appelant, dans le Repertoire ([35]) et un autre de ses continuateurs MM. Griolet et Verg\u00e9, au Supplement ([36]), qui lui est contrarre Encore ces derniers observent-ils que\nle propri\u00e9taire ne pourrait exiger la demolition dans le cas o\u00f9 il aurait autoris\u00e9 la construction soit express\u00e9ment soit tacitement.\nLaurent soutient que l'article 555\nsuppose qu'une construction a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en entier sur un fonds poss\u00e9d\u00e9 par un tiers d\u00e9tenteur il suppose un tiers possesseur, et non un propri\u00e9taire oui emni\u00e8te sur le terrain du voisin en construisant ([37]). Mais ce propri\u00e9taire n'est qu'un tiers possesseur quant au terrain anticip\u00e9. Pourqui faire une distiuction entre la possession d'une partie du terrain et celle de la totalit\u00e9 lorsque le code n'en fait pas? Ce serait bien le cas de dire: Plus le tort est consid\u00e9rable, plus la protection de la loi est grande. Maleville, vol. 2, p. 34 dit:\nCelui qui a anticip\u00e9 sans opposition sur le fonds d'autrui, doit en \u00eatre quitte en payant la valeur du sol et les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats d\u00fbs au propri\u00e9taire.\nBeaudry-Lacantinerie r\u00e9pond \u00e0 Aubry et Rau:.\nQuelles que soient l'imprudence et la n\u00e9gligeuce de celui qui b\u00e2tit sans faire op\u00e9rer un bomage pr\u00e9alable. il est cependant de bonne foi, s'il croit \u00eatre propri\u00e9taire jusqu'\u00e0 la limite des constructions \u00e9lev\u00e9es par lui ([38]).\nIl ajoute:\nIl faut supposer que l'empi\u00e8tement n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 commis avec le consentement expr\u00e8s ou tacite du voisin, ce qui supprimerait toute difficult\u00e9\nPuis il renvoie au n\u00b0 372, o\u00f9 il dit:\nL'art. 555 statue en vue de constructions faites \u00e0 l'insu du propri\u00e9taire du terrain Si les constructions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites \u00e0 sa connaissance et surtout avec son autorisation, il ne pourra pas les revendiquer comme lui appartenant, ni forcer le constructeur \u00e0 les d\u00e9molir. Il intervient, en pareil cas, entre le propri\u00e9taire du terrain et la constructeur un contrat sui generis, en vertu duquel le propri\u00e9taire du sol autorise le constructeur a jouir des constructions pendant un certain temps, autant qu'elles dureront. Il y a cr\u00e9ation au profit du constructeur d'une sorte de droit de superf\u00eccie.\nSi le doute est possible sous l'empire du Code Fran\u00e7ais, il semble qu'il ne l'est gu\u00e8re sous celui du Code de Quebec. Les Codificateurs nous informent qu'ils n'ont pas cru devoir adopter la redaction d\u00e9fectueuse des articles correspondants du Code Napoleon, et il faut ajouter que la legislature a cru devoir modifier l\u00e8 projet du Code Canadien et s'\u00e9loigner davantage du Code Napol\u00e9on. Ainsi le projet de l'article 555 du Code Napol\u00e9on ne parlent que des constructions faites par un tiers \u00e9vinc\u00e9. Mais l'article 4177 du Code de Qu\u00e9bec se contente de mentionner les \" ameliorations,\" c'est-\u00e0-dire \" les constructions et ouvrages,\" dont parle ' l'article 416, \" faites par un possesseur avec ses mat\u00e9-niaux \" Les droits du tiers d\u00e9tenteur \u00e9vinc\u00e9 sont sauvegard\u00e9s non seulement en l'article 417, mais aussi aux articles 418 et 419 qui ne se trouvent pas an Code Napoleon. A lire tons ces articles de notre Code, il est impossible d'arriver \u00e0 une autre conclusion que le possesseur de bonne foi ne pent jamais \u00eatre force \u00e0 d\u00e9molir et enlever ses constructions, sans indemnit\u00e9. Leur application n'est pas restr\u0141inte, non plus, \u00e0 un tiers d\u00e9tenteur * elle a lieu dans tous les cas de constructions on travaux faits par le possesseur sur un immeuble ou partie d'icelui, qu'il soit de bonne ou de mauvaise foi. Dans le premier cas, le propri\u00e9taire du fonds ne pourra les faire enlever; dans le second an contraire il le pourra s'il le demande. Voil\u00e0 le principe general sujet \u00e0 certaines modifications dans des cas particuliers signal\u00e9s aux articles C. C. 462, 582, 729, 958, 1546 et 1640.\nLa solution \u00e0 laquelle nous sommes arriv\u00e9s est sans pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent identique. Non pas que les tribunaux n'aient pas eu \u00e0 se prononcer sun des cas d'empitt\u00e8ments de la part du voisin qui b\u00e2tit. Les exemples ne manquent pas en France et au Canada o\u00f9 ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commis avec ou sans le consentement du propri\u00e9taire du fonds; mais je n'ai Pu trouver un seul cas o\u00f9 ce consentement fut attaqu\u00e9 pour cause d'erreur.\nBasnage ([39]), cite un arr\u00eat du Parlement de Normandie, du 30 avril 1618, qui se pronon\u00e7a contre la demolition dans un simple cas de bonne foi. Et il faut bien remarquer que cet arr\u00eat n'\u00e9tait pas appuy\u00e9 sur un texte particulier de la Coutume de Normandie, silencieuse sur le point comme celle do Paris. Il reposait uniquement sur les principes du droit Romain qui formait le droit commun de la France. Comme dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, le propri\u00e9taire du fonds disait \"qu'aucun ne peut \u00eatre force \u00e0 vendre ou \u00e0 ceder son h\u00e9ritage.\" On r\u00e9pondatt que\nquand dans la rigueur du droit \u00e9troit, il seroit tenu d'abatre, dans l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 qu'on devoit plut\u00f4t suivre, on ne pouvoit le condamner qu'\u00e0 l'estimation et aux int\u00e9r\u00eats du demandeur, plut\u00f4t que de d\u00e9molir un grand edifice; c'\u00e9toit la v\u00e9ritable esp\u00e8ce de l'action de tigno juncto, qui n'\u00e9toit fond\u00e9e que sur cette \u00e9quit\u00e9, ne diruantur \u0153dificia en l'action fin reg. permittitur judici, ut ubi non poterit fines firimers, adjudicatione fines dirimat. 1, 2 et 3, if. fin. reg. UIpian, in frag. t. 19. Il fut jug\u00e9 de la sorte, ajoute Basnage.\nSous l'empire du Code Napoleon les tribunaux ont assez fr\u00e9quemment eu l'occasion de decider des esp\u00e8ces de cette nature. Le premier arr\u00eat est celui de la Cour de Cassation du 22 avril 1823 ([40]), que l'intim\u00e9 invoque; mais cet arr\u00eat est appuy\u00e9 sur le motif que les constructions du voisin avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites, nonobstant l'opposition du propri\u00e9taire du fonds, et par consequent de mauvaise foi. L'arr\u00eat declare qu'il y a lieu d'appliquer l'art. 555. S'il est applicable au cas de la mauvaise foi, il doit 1 \u00eatre aussi \u00e0 celui de la bonne foi.\nLe second arr\u00eat, aussi cite par l'intim\u00e9, est celui du 26 juillet 1841 ([41]). Le tribunal de premiere instance renvoya la pr\u00e9tention du voisin qui avait anticip\u00e9, faute de preuve l\u00e9gale du consentement du propri\u00e9 taire; mais la bonne foi du constructeur ne para\u00eet pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9e, ni prise en consid\u00e9ration. La Cour Royale de Rouen, si\u00e9geant en appel, renversa cette decision pour les motifs qui suivent:\nAttendu que les premiers juges, dans les motifs de leur decision, out constat\u00e9 que, d'apr\u00e8s les explications donn\u00e9es par les parties, si le sieur Delaroche avait, en construisant son mur, empi\u00e9t\u00e9 de quelques centim\u00e8tres sur le terrain du Sieur Oursel, il y aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 veibalement par celui-ci \u00e0 titre de tolerance et de bon voisinage; Attendu. que, dans cet \u00e9tat de choses, le sieur Delaroche, au m\u00eame titre de tol\u00e9rance, est fonde \u00e0 conserver dans l'alignement actuel et jusqu'au moment de sa destruction, le mur qu'il a nouvellement \u00e9lev\u00e9; Par ces motifs, \u00e9mendant, dit \u00e0 tort la demande form\u00e9e par Oursel en demolition du mur le long de l'all\u00e9e dont il s'agit; d\u00e9charge, \u00e0 cet \u00e9gaid, Delaroche des condamnations prononc\u00e9es contre lui, reserve n\u00e9anmoins le sieur Oursel lorsqu'il y aura n\u00e9cessitCde reconstruire le mur en question, \u00e0 exiger du sieur Delaroche Ia retratte du dit mur dans son ancien alignement.\nLa Cour de Cassation a renvers\u00e9 ce jugement, mais uniquement parce que le consentement du propri\u00e9taire du fonds n'\u00e9tait pas l\u00e9galement \u00e9tabli:\nAttendu que le tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance de Bernay, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 m\u00eame d'appr\u00e9cier ces explications, ne les a pas trouv\u00e9es suffisantes pour justifier l'anticipation de Delaroche; qu'au contraire on lit, dans un des motifs de son jugement, que Delaroche a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 avoir fait l'anticipation avec le consentement d'Oursel, mais qu'il n'en a pas justifi\u00e9, et qu'il doit \u00eatre condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 reculer son mur.\nCette decision, loin d'\u00eatre contrarre \u00e0 l'appelant, lui est favorable. Sa preuve est complete et personne ne peut en attaquer la legalite, puisqu'elle r\u00e9sulte des admissions de l'intim\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame dans son t\u00e9moignage. Les arr\u00eatistes observent en note '.\nLa permission donn\u00e9e par un propri\u00e9taire de batir sur sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 lui \u00f4te \u00e9videmment, \u00e0 moins de reserves contraires, le droit de demander la suppression de ces constructions, tant qu'elles sont en bon \u00e9tat et qu'elles ne menacent pas ruine; autrement cette permission, loin d'\u00eatre une faveur pour celui qui i'obtient, deviendrait un pi\u00e8ge, et serait Ia cause d'un dommage certain, alors qu'elle ne devait avoir pour but que son avantage.\nPuis vient l'arr\u00eat du ler avril 1890 ([42]), qui comme celui de 1841, repose uniquement sur une autorisation pr\u00e9tendue de la part du propri\u00e9taire du fonds.\nJug\u00e9:\nLorsqu'une construction faite sur le terrain d'autrui, l'a \u00e9te au vu et au su du propri\u00e9taire et sans protestation de sa part, qu'il est au contraire d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il y a Consenti, il ne peut en exiger Ia destruction. (r\u00e9s. par Ia cour d'Appel.) Dans ce cas, son consentement, lorsqu'il est gratuit, ne constitue pas une donation, ni un abandonnement \u00e0 un titre quelconque de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la parcelle anticip\u00e9e, mais une convention particuli\u00e8re qui doit produire effet, et qui emp\u00eache le propri\u00e9taire d'exiger la demolition des constructions. (r\u00e9s. par la cour d'Appel).\nCe jugement fut rendu par la Cour d'Appel de Limoges mais fut renvers\u00e9 par la Cour de Cassation, uniquement parce qu'il avait admis la preuve testimoniale du consentement du propri\u00e9taire. Or ce reproche ne peut \u00eatre fait dans Ia pr\u00e9sente cause. Les r\u00e9ponses de l'intim\u00e9, examine comme t\u00e9moin, font une preuve suffisante de son consentement; \u00e0 tous \u00e9v\u00e9nements, elles forment un commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit qui est compl\u00e9t\u00e9 par la preuve testimoniale.\nLa m\u00eame affaire fut port\u00e9e l'ann\u00e9e suivante devant la Cour de Poitiers, qui le 6 mai 1891, d\u00e9clara que si le demandeur a fait la preuve legale qu'il a Ct\u00e9 autorise par le propri\u00e9taire du fonds \u00e0 construire en partie sur son terrain, il ne peut \u00eatre condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9molir (1).\nLes arr\u00eatistes,; Griolet et Verg\u00e9, observent en note sur l'arr\u00eat du ler avril 1890 ([43]).\nCes solutions paraissent sans pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent. La Cour de Cassation toutefois a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que lorsque l'usufruitier d'une maison, qui est en m\u00eame temps propri\u00e9taire de la maison voisine, fait faire, tant sur son h\u00e9ritage propre que sur celui dont il a l'usufruit, des constructions au moyen desquelles il r\u00e9unit les deux b\u00e2timents, et que le nu-propri\u00e9taire n'y forme pas opposition et m\u00eame approuve le travail, les tribunaux peuvent dans ce cas ordonner Ia vente des deux immeubles s'il est impossible de les s\u00e9parer, sans nuire aux int\u00e9r\u00eats des propri\u00e9taires ([44]). Ce n'est pas l\u00e0 contrevenir aux principes qui veulent que nul ne puisse \u00eatre contraint de ceder sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 hors les cas except\u00e9s par Ia loi et qu'il n'y ait lieu \u00e0 licitation qu'autant que l'immeuble est commun entre les parties. Un tel \u00e9tat de choses constituerait donc une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qni, sans \u00eatre commune, serait pourtant indivis\u00e9e ([45]). V aussi Jur. g\u00e9n. v\u00b0 Propri\u00e9t\u00e9, nos. 450 et 451.\nL'esp\u00e8ce ci-dessus se pr\u00e9sentait dans des conditions diff\u00e9rentes. Il r\u00e9sulte des dispositions des art. 552 et 553 C. Civ. que le propri\u00e9taire du terrain sur lequel une partie de la maison voisine a et\u00e9 construite devient propri\u00e9taire de cette partie de maison en vertu du droit d'accession. Lorsque le constructeur est de bonne foi le propri\u00e9taire du sol ne peut en exiger Ia d\u00e9molltion, mais il a le choix ou de rembourser la valeur drs mat\u00e9riaux et du prix de la main-d'\u0153uvre, ou de rembourser une somme \u00e9gale \u00e0 celle dont le fonds a augment\u00e9 de valeur ([46]). Fallait-il, dans l'esp\u00e8ce, faire application de l'art. 555 C. Civ.? La Cour de Limoges ne l'a pas pens\u00e9 et avec raison; Ia solution qu'elle a donn\u00e9e d\u00e9rive d'autres principes. En effet, le constructeur dont s'occupe l'art. 555 est un constructeur non autoris\u00e9, il a pu \u00eatre de bonne ou de mauvaise foi quant \u00e0 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du sol, mais c'est toujouts sans autorisation qu'il a construit. Le texte laisse donc en dehots de ses pr\u00e9visions le cas o\u00f9 celui qui empi\u00e8te sur le fonds voisin a ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 ses travaux au vu et au su du voisin ([47]). Il s'agissait, d\u00e8s lors, uniquement de rechercher quelles pouvaient \u00eatre les cons\u00e9quences juridiques de ce fait que le propri\u00e9taire avait laiss\u00e9 \u00e9lever des constructions sur son propre terrain sans s'y opposer et m\u00eame en y consentant, puisqu'il avait d\u00e9termin\u00e9 Ia limite de l'anticipation qu'il autorisait.\nUn tel consentement ne saurait rester sans effet. Emportait-il abandon \u00e0 titre gratuit de Ia propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la fraction de terrain anticip\u00e9? La cour a h\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u00e0 aller jusque-l\u00e0, pr\u00e9ocup\u00e9e qu'elle \u00e9tait du vice de Ia donation, car aucun acte notari\u00e9 n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 dress\u00e9 \u00c1 d\u00e9faut de donation de Ia propri\u00e9t\u00e9, il y avait du moins une convention d'une nature sp\u00e9ciaee s'expliquant par les relations de bon voisinage entre les parties et qui (en la supposant r\u00e9guli\u0141rement prouv\u00e9e) devait \u00eatre respect\u00e9e. Un propri\u00e9taire peut parfaitement renoncer au droit d'accession \u00e9tabli en sa faveur par les art. 552 et 553 C. Civ. et conf\u00e9rer ainsi au constructeur le droit de jouir du terrain tant que les constructions le couvriront. C'est l\u00e0 une sorte de concession de droit de superficie temporaire, de servitude qui gr\u00e8ve le fonds et dont il sera affranchi quand le constructeur voudra reb\u00e2tir ou se trouvera dans la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de le faire ([48]). L'autorisation donn\u00e9e par le propri\u00e9taire de la parcelle usurp\u00e9e l'emp\u00eache, en tous cas, d'exiger Ia suppression des travaux, en cr\u00e9ant contre lui une fin de non-recevoir, une v\u00e9ritable exception de dol, car la r\u00e8gle qui domine en pareille mati\u00e8re est celle de l'appr\u00e9ciation souveraine des juges du fait.\nVoil\u00e0 ce que la doctrine et la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise enseignent et nous pouvons en conclure que celui qui b\u00e2tit en anticipant sur le terrain d'autrui, avec le consentement de ce dernier donn\u00e9 en pleine connaissance de cause, ne peut \u00eatre force \u00e0 d\u00e9molir; il se trouve en effet prot\u00e9g\u00e9 non pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment par l'article 555 C. N., mais en vertu de l'autorisation donn\u00e9e par le propri\u00e9taire du fonds d\u00fbment prouv\u00e9e bien entendu. Cette autorisation constitue ce que des auteurs appellent une renonciation an droit d'accession, d'autres un droit de servitude, d'usufruit on de superficie du sol; de l'aveu de tous elle forme une convention qui doit \u00eatre respect\u00e9e et recevoir son execution. Cette conclusion admise, il n'est pas difficile de decider l'esp\u00e8ce qui nous occupe, savoir le cas o\u00f9 le propri\u00e9taire, croyant ne rien ceder du sien, a donn\u00e9 son consentement par erreur. Il faudra invoquer les r\u00e8gles ordinaires du droit qui r\u00e9gissent la mati\u00e8re de l'erreur et que nous avons indiqu\u00e9es plus haut. L'erreur invalidera le consentement mais en payant l'indemnit\u00e9; mais ici le demandeur demande la demolition purement et simplement.\nRemarquons bien qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que l'autorisation soit expresse; il suffit qu'elle r\u00e9sulte des circonstances. Les autorit\u00e9s que nous avons cit\u00e9es sont unanimes \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer que le fait que des constructions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites, au su et vu du propri\u00e9taire du fonds et sans protestation de sa part, constitue une autorisation tacite; et \u00e0 la liste d'arr\u00eats mentionn\u00e9s plus haut, nous pouvons ajouter les suivants: Colmar, 19 novembre 1830 ([49]); Dijon, 23 janveir 1874 ([50]): Pau, 29 novembre 1874 ([51]).\nEnfin, dapr\u00e8s l'opinion de plusieurs commentateurs qui d'ordinaire font autorit\u00e9, entr'autres, Maleville, Dalloz, Demolombe, Baudry-Lacantinerie, Perrin et Rendu, l'article 555 Code Napoleon s'applique et prot\u00e8ge la simple bonne foi du constructeur ind\u00e9pendamment de toute convention, formelle ou tacite. Nous croyon-devorr suivre ces autorit\u00e9s de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 Laurent, Aubry et Rau et les continuateurs de Dalloz; elles sont en harmonie avec la jurisprudence des tribunaux, tandis que pas un seul arr\u00e9t dans l'ancien ou le nouveau droit ne peut \u00eatre cite en faveur de l'opinion contraire; elles sont d'ailleurs plus en accord avec le texte de notre Code Civil, art. 417, beaucoup plus large que celui du Code Napoleon, art. 555; et enfin elles reposent sur des principes de justice incontestables qui ont re\u00e7u la sanction de Domat, Pothier, 0-rotius et des plus grands interpr\u00e8tes du droit Romain et du droit naturel.\nEn Louisiane, od para\u00eet suivre les m\u00eames r\u00e8gles RideII v. Jackson ([52]).\nLa jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec est dans le m\u00eame sens. Ainsi la Cour de Revision de Montr\u00e9al (MacKay et Torrance JJ., Mondelet J. dissident), jugea le 30 septembre 1869 dans Martin y. Jones ([53]), que la demolition des travaux ne pouvait \u00eatre demand\u00e9e dans un pareil cas Il est vrai que l'un des consid\u00e9rants du jugement fut qu'il n'y avait pas eu de bornage r\u00e9gulier mais la cour d\u00e9cida en m\u00eame temps que le consentement seul donn\u00e9 par le voisin anticip\u00e9 \u00e9tait une fin de non recevoir \u00e0 l'action p\u00e9titoire. M\u00eame le juge dissident, qui avait rendu le jugement en premiere instance n'avait pas ordonn\u00e9 la demolition pure et simple des travaux * il avait condamn\u00e9 le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e8 rendre le terrain anticip\u00e9 on \u00e0 payer $200. En Revision, il ajoutait que cette somme pouvait \u00eatre r\u00e9duite. si elle \u00e9tait trop \u00e9lev\u00e9e. C'est prCcis\u00e9ment la position prise par l'appelant t il offre de payer la valeur du terrain.\nLa decision he la Cour d'Appel, Dorion C. J., Monk, Tessier, Cross et Baby JJ., dans Lareau v. Dunn ([54]), rendue le 31 mai 1884 n'est pas sans \u00e0-propos. Voici ce qu'elle declare dans un de ses motifs .\nEt consid\u00e9rant que lors m\u00eame que 16 lot que l'appelant a poss\u00e9d\u00e9 depuis plus de vingt ans ne serait pas celui qu'il a acquis par l'acte du 18 mars 1857, sa possession, qui a dur\u00e9 plus de vingt ans sans interruption \u00e0 la connasssance des intim\u00e9s et de leur auteur, aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 de bonne foi et dans le cas d'erreur, aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 bas\u00e9e sur une erreur commune et qu'\u00e0 raison de sa bonne foi et en vertu de l'article 412 du Code Civil. l'appelant a fait les fruits siens, et qu'il ne pouvait \u00eatre condam\u00e9\u00e9 \u00e0 payer une somme de $1,184.50, mais qu'au contraire, il aurait le droit de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter ses impenses et ameliorations aux termes de l'article 417 du m\u00e9me code.\nEnfin nous avons la cause de Joyce et Hart ([55]) qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par cette cour le 28 juin 1877, et o\u00f9 la d\u00e9molition des travaux fut ordonn\u00e9e; mais dans ce cas, il y avait eu des 1'origine des protestations formelles de la part du voisin; et encore l'option fut donn\u00e9e au d\u00e9fendeur qui avait b\u00e2ti sur un mur de division mais non mitoyen, d'en acqu\u00e9rir Ia mitoyennet\u00e9 et d'\u00e9viter ainsi la demolition; l'on peut facilement d\u00e9duire de l'opinion dee juges que la conclusion aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 bien diff\u00e9rente si le propri\u00e9taire e\u00fbt consenti express\u00e9ment ou m\u00eame tacitement \u00e0 l'\u00e9rection des constructions.\nStrong J: When the plaintiff, by his conduct, has induced the defendant to proceed with his works in error, or in the belief that the plaintiff acquiesced in the prejudice caused to his rights, I take it for granted that an exception, analogous to an exception of fraud, might be opposed to the action. Take, for instance, the case of the defendant making a large expenditure in building on his own lands to the preju dice of an insignificant servitude of the plaintiff, the plaintiff could not after passively awaiting the termination of the work, in either a possessory or petitory action, insist on the demolition of the buildings. Again if the defendant believed himself to be building on his own land whilst the plaintiff knew he was on the plaintiff's land, it would be conduct amounting to fraud on the part of the plaintiff silently to permit the defendant to complete his erections and then turn round, assert his title and ask to have the buildings destroyed.\nIn the present case nothing of this kind occurred, for the protest made by the ministry of a notary, in due form of law, gave early notice to the defendant that he was infringing on the plaintiff's rights, and put him in such a position that all he did subsequently was done with full knowledge, and at his own risk and peril.\nJ. T. Taschereau J: Je crois le jugement bon tout en dcclarant que Iois de la plaidoirie devant nous, mon impression \u00e9tait en faveur de l'appelant, et ce qui contribuait alors \u00e0 me faire consid\u00e9rer Ia position des intim\u00e9s sous un jour tr\u00e9s d\u00e9favorabee \u00e9tait le fait (leouel ne semblait pas ni\u00e9 par eux) que les travaux dont les intim\u00e9s se plaignaient avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 commenc\u00e9s et compl\u00e8tement termin\u00e9s par l'appelant au vu et su des intim\u00e9s et sans protestation de leur part. Je me disais et je crois avec raison, qu'apr\u00e8s avoir vu l'appelant faire les ouvrages en question, sans objection de leur part, il y avait consentement tacite, sinon formel de leur part \u00e0 ce que l'appelant acquit ainsi la mitoyennet\u00e9 et que la question de l'indemnit\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait que secondaire entre des voisins et devait se r\u00e9gler \u00e0 l'amiable;\u2014et dans ce cas il me semblait remarquer une grande rigueur dans le jugement dont est appel, lequel, condamnait l'appelant \u00e0 payer des dommages pour avoir fait ce qu'il pouvait faire sous certaines conditions pr\u00e9alables, il est vrai, mais dont les intim\u00e9s me sembl\u00e8rent le dispenser en ne s'y opposant pas, ou en ne protestant pas. Mais Ia lecture du dossier m'a convaincu que l'appIlant a \u00e9t\u00e9 protest\u00e9 d\u00e8s le commencement des travaux faits par lui, et que sous le pr\u00e9texte que le prot\u00eat notari\u00e9 qu'il re\u00e7u \u00e9tait r\u00e9digC en langue fran\u00e7aise, il avait renvoy\u00e9 ce prot\u00eat aux intim\u00e9s.\nUn mot sur la question de juridiction de cette cour, soulev\u00e9e lors de la plaidoirie. Nous n'h\u00e9sitons pas \u00e0 decider qu'il s'agit ici du titre \u00e0 un terrain ind\u00e9pendamment du titre \u00e0 la nue propri\u00e9t\u00e9, qui n'est pas contest\u00e9. Mais qui a le domaine utile? C'est ce que nous avons \u00e0 decider. La d\u00e9fense de l'appelant va droit au titre de l'intim\u00e9 Les b\u00e2timents dont on demande Ia demolition sont aussi immeubles et il s'agit de savoir si l'appelant en a le titre. Enfin, le droit de les faire d\u00e9molir sans indemnit\u00e9 ou de retenir l'immeuble taut qu'elle ne sera pas pay\u00e9e ou que les constructions dureront, s'attaque directement au titre du terrain.\nNous sommes donc d'avis d'infirmer le jugement de la Cour d'Appel et de renvoyer l'action de l'intim\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens devant toutes les cours. L'appelant gardera le terrain sur lequel les constructions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9es, en payant l'indemnit\u00e9 due \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, que la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure avait r\u00e9serv\u00e9e, mais que nous croyons devoir de suite fixer \u00e0 Ia somme de $50 tant pour la valeur du terrain anticip\u00e9 que pour les dommages caus\u00e9s par l'empi\u00e8tement au reste de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Geoffrion, Dorion & Allan.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Fortin & Laurendeau.\n[1] Q.

C.\u2014Arts. 251, 252 C. C. P.\u2014Title to land\u2014Prescription\u2014Limitation of actions\u2014Equivocal possession\u2014Mala fides\u2014Sheriff's deed\u2014Nullity.\nThe Superme Court of Canada will take questions of fact into consideration on appeal, and if it clearly appears that there has been error in the admission or appreciation of evidence by the courts below, their decisions may be reversed or varied. The North British and Mercantile Insurance Company v. Tourville (25 Can. S. C. R. 177) followed.\nIn the estimation of the value of evidence in ordinary cases the testitimony of a credible witness who swears positively to a fact should receive credit in preference to that of one who testifies to a negative.\nThe evidencce of witnesses who are near relatives or whose interests are closely identified with those of one of the parties, ought not to prevail in favour of such party against the testimony of strangers who are disinterested witnesses.\nEvidence of common rumour is unsatisfactory and should not generally be admitted. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Queen's Bench for Lower Canada (appeal side), affirming the decision of the Superior Court, District of Bedford, which dismissed the plaintiffs action with costs,\nA statement of the case appears in the judgment of His Lordship Mr. Justice Girouard, now reported.\nBelcourt and Beaubien for the appellant. A title null by reason of informality cannot serve as a ground for prescription by ten years possession. Art. 2254 C. C.; Barbotte v. Hamard ([1]) (Cass 8 janv. 1838); 36 Dal. Rep. Jur. \" Prescription Civile,\" no. 900; 2 Troplong, Prescription, no. 900; 7 Toullier 718; 24 Merlin, 142. The respondents and their predecessors in title cannot shew good faith, for they have been holding in bad faith or under equivocal circumstances from which bad faith must be presumed. 36 Dal. Rep. Jur. \"Prescription Civile\" no. 915, 920, 921; Anon (Cass. Rennes, 18 juin, 1821); 2 Troplong, nos. 20, 926, 937; 21 Duranton, no 586 Error in law cannot serve as an excuse.\nThe court below has failed to give proper weight to the evidence, and has erred in accepting the testimony of interested witnesses some of whom even were warrantors of the title in dispute. The court below has failed in the proper appreciation of the affirmative testimony on behalf of the plaintiff in contradiction of bare denials of the facts by the defendant's witnesses. This court can reconsider the evidence with the fullest propriety as it was all taken by depositions at enqu\u00eate and not in the presence of the trial judge.\nAs there could be no good faith in the respondent's possession, the improvements belong, without compensation, to the real owner of the soil ([2]) and he is also entitled to receive the value of use and occupation rents issues and profits. Under the circumstances the respondents are bound by the decision in the former case of Lefeuntun v. V\u00e9ronneau ([3]), respecting the lands in question although not made parties because they purchased with knowledge of the litigation pending and took the risk of the sheriff's deed being annulled. The Supreme Court judgment in that case relates back to the date of the institution of the action, and is res judicata against the present respondents. The Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. McMillan ([4]); art. 715 C. C. P.; H\u00e9ricourt, Vente des Immeubles, 292; 1 Pigeau 778. All possible notice was given by registration; art. 2098 C. C.\nLajoie and Lussier for the respondent. The respondent and her auteurs held the land for over ten years prior to action under titles regularly issued in proper form and properly registered; 2 Aubry & Rau, 377; Pothier, Prescription, no. 57. It matters not that the original vendor had no valid title himself The immediate title of the party invoking the ten years prescription is the only one in issue. The fact that there may have been irregularities in the proceedings leading to the sheriff's sale cannot be set up against defendant to show that his own title is not valid. The possession of Paul and Hormisdas Larocque is a possession in good faith. Good faith existed in the mind of the purchaser that he bought from the real proprietor ([5]). This is a question of fact upon which the six judges of the courts below have been unanimous and this court should not interfere Grasset v Garter ([6]); Senesac v Vermont Central Railway Co. ([7]); Ryan v. Ryan ([8]) at page 406; Schwersenski v. Vineberg ([9]). Good faith is presumed. The burden of the proof was on the plaintiff to show that the defendant and his auteur were in bad faith at the time of the purchase. (Art. 2202 C. C.) Subsequent knowledge of the defendant that his vendor was not the real proprietor would not constitute bad faith.\nArticle 2253 C. C. is more complete than article 2269 of the Code Napoleon, and it has been shewn that Hormisdas Larocque was in good faith when he bought from Paul Larocque,in 1884 and that the latter was in good faith when he purchased from Langlois in 1881. It is immaterial whether bad faith may have existed at any other period. The evidence as to notoriety of the litigation respecting the property m question at the time of the purchase does not attach to the respondent or her vendors any personal knowledge or improper dealing from which they could be charged with bad faith. Had they suspected a flaw in the title they would never have purchased at the price they paid.\nWhilst in possession of the land they improved it considerably and expended large sums of money upon it. Their possession and even the possession of Langlois and the other proprietors before him was peaceable and uninterrupted. The appellant did not protest nor register notice of his proceedings to have the sheriff's sale set aside and when Paul Larocque purchased Langlois appeared as proprietor without any entry whatever in the registers to show the contrary.\nThere is no authority for the contention that prescription did not run while the proceedings en nullit\u00e9 de d\u00e9cret were pending. Appellant should have made the Larocques parties to his suit or taken a special action to interrupt prescription. He failed to do so and there is no binding decision against the responde\u00e6ts. Arts. 1241, 2224, C. C. TasChereAu J.\u2014The appellant's factum in this case refers to and gives long extracts of notes of the judge who gave the judgment of the Superior Court. Now, there is no such document forming part of the case. I need hardly say that the appellant should not so have referred to notes that are not regularly before us. It is very much to be regretted that by consent or acquiescenee of counsel on both sides we are deprived of the opinions or reasons for judgment delivered by the judges in the courts below, as we have been in this case of the reasons of the Superior Court judge. Under rule 2 of this court, it is the written opinions (when any) of the judges in all the courts through which the case has passed, that must form part of the printed case, not only those of the court directly appealed from and if counsel on both sides will settle a case without such notes we shall have to insist that the affidavit required by the rule be produced in each case The certificate of the clerk of the Court of Appeal covers only the notes of the court appealed from. Why counsel for respondent in this case allowed the printed case to be settled or made up without notes that supported the judgment he had obtained, is more than I can understand.\nI fully agree with my learned colleague, Mr. Justice Girouard, and for the reasons by him given that this appeal should be allowed.\nI have only one additional reason to give for our interference upon a question of fact with the concurrent findings of the two courts below it is that it appears to me to have been lost sight of that it is a rule of presumption that ordinarily a witness who testifies to an affirmative is to be credited in preference to one who testifies to a negative, magis creditur duobus testibus affirmantibus quam mille negantibus, because he who testifies to a negative may have forgotten a thing that did happen, but it is not possible to remember a thing that never existed.\nThen as to the various conversations upon which . an important part of the case turns, the following sentence of the Master of Rolls in Lane, v. Jackson ([10]), has full application.\nI have frequently stated that where the positive fact of a particular conversation is said to have taken place between two persons of equal credibility, and one states positively that it took place, and the other as positively denies it, I believe that the words were said, and that the person who denies their having been said has forgotten the circumstance. By this means, I give fall credit to both parties.\nIn Chowdry Deby Perad v. Chowdry Dowlut Sing ([11]), Mr. Baron Parke remarks:\nIn estimating the value of the evidence, the testimony of a person who swears positively that a certain conversation took place, is of more value than that of one who says that it did not because the evidence of the latter may be explained by supposing that his attention was not drawn to the conversation at the time.\nGwynne, Sedgewick and King JJ. also agreed with Mr Justice Girouard.\nGIROUARD J.\u2014Il s'agit des effets d'un jugement annulant un d\u00e9cret enregistr\u00e9 \u00e0 l'encontre des tiers acqu\u00e9reurs subs\u00e9quents aussi inscrits. Arm\u00e9 de ce \"jugement, le veritable propri\u00e9taire se pr\u00e9sente pour rentrer en possession de son bien. Le possesseur lui r\u00e9pond que durant les dix-sept ann\u00e9es que dura son proc\u0141s, ii a acquis l'immeuble par juste titre et qu'il en a la possession d\u00e9cennale. L'appelant, qui se trouve dans la position de ce plaideur plus malheureux que malchanceux, commence son factum par un appel touchant \u00e0 la sympathie de cette cour. Ces appels tol\u00e9r\u00e9s dans un proc\u00e9s par jur\u00e9, d\u00e9parent un factum, d'ailleurs bien fait devant un tribunal d'appel. Si l'appelant a \u00e9u tant de trouble ii faut bien qu'il prenne sa bonne part de blame, n'ayant pris aucune des procedures conservatoires que la prudence la plus ordinaire lui sugg\u00e9rait. Si la sympathie pouvait \u00eatre prise en consid\u00e9ration, l'intim\u00e9e serait peut-\u00eatre excusable dans les circonstances d'avoir ajout\u00e9 foi \u00e0 l'adage populaire, partag\u00e9 par son notaire, qu'un titre du sh\u00e9rif ne se d\u00e9truit pas. Ce fut l\u00e0 son malheur. Les titres du sh\u00e9rif, comme tous les contrats, ne sont valides que s'ils sont ex\u00e9cu\u00e9ss selon les lois du pays Les parties n'ont ici que leurs droits stricts \u00e0 faire valoir Voici les faits.\nLe 13 octobre 1866 et le 17 juin 1867, par titres notari\u00e9s en bonne forme et d\u00fbment enregistr\u00e9s, l'appelant acquit une terre nouvelle de soixante et sept arpents et demi, 15 x 41\/2, formant les num\u00e9ros 406 et 412 du cadastre de la paroisse de Saint-Val\u00e9rien de Milton, \u00e0 moiti\u00e9 d\u00e9frich\u00e9e et sans b\u00e2tisse. Le 17 ao\u00fbt 1876 elle fut vendue par le sh\u00e9rif sur l'appelant, \u00e0 la poursuite de Narcisse Bolduc, qui avait obtenu jugement contre lui pour $433.46. Bolduc en devint l'adjudicataire pour $55 et fit de suite enregistrer son titre.\nLe 23 f\u00e9vrier 1877, l'appelant produit une requ\u00eate en nullit\u00e9 du d\u00e9cret qu'il n'a fait signifier qu'\u00e0 Bolduc. Durant l'intervalle ce dernier avait vendu \u00e0 Cardinal et Dufresne, par acte de vente passe le 23 novembre 1876, et enregistr\u00e9 le 26 du m\u00eame mois, et cette vente fut suivie de plusieurs autres qui sont indiqu\u00e9es plus has\nLa requ\u00eate en nullit\u00e9 de d\u00e9cret fut renvoy\u00e9e le 28 juin 1889 par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, o\u00f9 l'action originaire \u00e9tait pendante, et ce jugement fut confirm\u00e9 par la Cour d'Appel le 18 janvier 1892. Ces deux jugements furent infirm\u00e9s par cette cour le 24 juin 1893 ([12]). La pr\u00e9sente action \u00e0 l'effet de rentrer en la possession de l'immeuble\u2014une action p\u00e9titoire\u2014 a \u00e9t\u00e9 intent\u00e9e le 1er ao\u00fbt 1893 devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure du district de Bedford o\u00f9 se trouve situ\u00e9 l'immeuble. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieuee de Bedford et la cour d'appel out renvoy\u00e9 l'action et donn\u00e9 gain de cause \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e pour deux raisons. 10. Le \"jugement sur la requ\u00eate en nullit\u00e9 de d\u00e9cret n'\u00e9tait pas chose jug\u00e9e contre le d\u00e9fendeur qui n'\u00e9tait pas dans la cause et n'y \u00e9tait pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9; et 2\u00b0. Le d\u00e9fendeur \u00e9tait devenu propri\u00e9taire par la possession de dix ans avec juste titre.\nIl n'est pas surprenant que durant ees dix-sept ann\u00e9es de litige, de. 1876 a 1893, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 alt subi plusieurs mutations. Voici Ia liste qu'en a faite M. le Juge Blanchet qui a prononc\u00e9 le jugement de la Cour d'Appel, et elle est complete:\nLe 17 ao\u00fbt 1876 vente par le sh\u00e9rif sur l'appelant. Le 23 novembre 1876, l'adjudicataire Bolduc revend \u00e0 Cardinal et Dufresne. Le 15 octobre 1877 Cardinal cede sa part \u00e0 Poirier. Le 23 mars 1880, Poirier et Dufresne retransf\u00e8rent leurs droits \u00e0 Cardinal. Le 3 novembre 1880, Cardinal vend \u00e0 Philias Langlois. Le 27 ao\u00fbt 1881, Langlois revend \u00e0 Paul Larocque, et le 31 octobre 1884, celui-ci revend \u00e0 Hormiisdas Larocque, son fr\u00e8re, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 maintenant par sa veuve, l'intim\u00e9e. Les trois derniers actes seuls paraissent avoir et\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9s.\nUn supplement au certificat du bureau d'enregistrement produit devant nous constate que la vent\u00e9 du 17 ao\u00fbt 1876, celle du 23 novembre 1876 et celle du 3 novembre 1880, ont aussi Ct\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9es.\nL'appelant ne pent donc repousser le plaidoyer de prescription qu'en prouvant la mauvaise foi d'Hormis-das Larocque le 31 octobre 1884 ou \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement celle de Paul Larocque, son vendeur, le 27 ao\u00fbt 1881. Nous voil\u00e0 en pr\u00e9sence d'une simple question de fait d\u00e9cid\u00e9e par deux cours: Nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 jug\u00e9 que nous \u00e9tions les juges des faits, et que si la preuve d\u00e9montre clairement qu'elles ont err\u00e9 dans l'appr\u00e9ciation qu'elles en ont faite notre devoir est de rendre le jugement qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre rendu ([13]). Ici la preuve est conclusive.\nNous avons une raison particuli\u00e8re d'intervenir, c'est que la Cour d' Appel et la Cour Sup\u00e9rieuee paraissent avoir viol\u00e9 une r\u00e8gle fondamentale concernant la preuve testimoniale; ils ont attach\u00e9 autant de foi aux t\u00e9moins int\u00e9ress\u00e9s qu'aux \u00e9trangers; et cet int\u00e9r\u00eat n'est pas seulement celui d'un parent ; ii est m\u00eame plus fort que celui de la partie; c'est l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du garant.\nIl faut encore observer que l'enqu\u00eate s'est faite hors la pr\u00e9sence du juge qui n'a pas eu meilleure occasion que les juges d'appel de juger la physionomie et la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins. Ce que les juges des tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs ont vu, nous pouvons le voir aussi; mais ne perdant pas de vu cette r\u00e8gle cardinale que malheureusement trop souvent l'int\u00e9r\u00eat est Ia mesure des t\u00e9moignages comme des actions, nous sommes arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 une toute autre conclusion.\nNous ne voulons pas nous arr\u00e9ter un seul instant \u00e0 la preuve par la commune renomm\u00e9e que l'on a tent\u00e9 de faire, et qui est toujours plus ou moins vague et dangereuse et n'est tol\u00e9r\u00e9e que dans des cas rares et presque privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s, par exemple, ceux des mineurs contre les tuteurs qui ont n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de faire inventaire. Ecartant done une forte partie des t\u00e9moignages qui sont devant nous, et qui ne portent que sur la commune renomm\u00e9e, nous sommes d'avis que l'appelant a fait une preuve pr\u00e9cise, circonstanci\u00e9e et complete de la mauvasse foi de Paul et Hormisdas Larocque avant et au moment m\u00eame de leurs acquisitions respectives. Nous ne savons pas exactement comment la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 cette preuve, car les notes du savant juge ne sont pas devant nous. Voici tout ce que M le Juge Blanchet en dit: Quant aux faits particuliers que l'appelant a voulu \u00e9tablir afin de prouver que l'intim\u00e9e et son auteur savaient, avant leur acquisition, qu'il r\u00e9clamait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question, ils sont tous contredits de Ia mani\u00e8re la plus formelle possible; et d'ailleurs Ta plupart des faits relat\u00e9s par les t\u00e9moins de l'appelant sont pos\u00e9\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 l'acquisition de Paul et Hormisdas Larocque.\n\u201cContredits de la mani\u00e8re la plus formelle possible.\" Oui, mais par qui i Par des personnes aussi int\u00e9ress\u00e9es que les parties; quelques-unes m\u00eame plus, comme les garants de l'intim\u00e9e.\nC'est d'abord Philias Langlois qui, par acte notari\u00e9 produit, s'est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 indemniser le d\u00e9fendeur des cons\u00e9quences de ce proc\u00e8s.\nC'est aussi Paul Larocque, le vendeur avec garantie et le rentier d'Hormisdas, le d\u00e9fendeur d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 durant l'instance et repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e, sa veuve et sa l\u00e9gataire. L'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e s'efforce de le d\u00e9sint\u00e9resser, paree qu'il est garanti par Philias Langlois qui est solvable, dit-on. Paul Larocque et son fr\u00e8re Hormisdas avaient \u00e9videmment des doutes sur l'enti\u00e8re solvabilit\u00e9 de Langlois, puisqu'apr\u00e8s l'institution de la pr\u00e9sente action, ils ont exig\u00e9 de lui le transport de trois hypoth\u00e8ques dont il \u00e9tait le cr\u00e9ancier et qui se montent en tout \u00e0 $1300 c'est-\u00e0-dire $300 de moins que le prix de ve\u00e6te, sans parler des impenses et am\u00e9liorations, frais, dommages et int\u00e9r\u00eats.\nPhilias Langlois et Paul Larocque sont pourtant les deux principaux t\u00e9moins de l'intim\u00e9e, qui contredisent ceux de l'appelant; c'est leurs t\u00e9moignages que l'intim\u00e9e invoque, et \u00e0 la plaidoirie orale et dans son factum, pour repousser la preuve de l'appelant, mais nous croyons qu'ils n'ont pas plus d'autorit\u00e9 que le t\u00e9moignage des parties elles-m\u00eames, d'autant plus qu'ils contredisent des \u00e9trangess sans int\u00e9r\u00e9t.\nLe Code Civil art. 1232 dit:\nLe t\u00e9moignage par l'une des parties dans l'instance ne peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 en sa faveur. Voir aussi l'article 251 du Code de Procedure Civile.\nPuis viennent les proches des parties, les fils du demandeur et le p\u00e8re et les fr\u00e8res du d\u00e9fendeur qui se contredisent carr\u00e9ment. Si nous avions \u00e0 decider cette cause par leurs seuls t\u00e9moignages, nous serions pent- \u00eatre dispos\u00e9s \u00e0 ajouter foi aux t\u00e9moignages des jeunes Lefeunteum de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 ceux des Larocque. Leurs r\u00e9ponses sont claires et franches; il n'y a aucune incertitude, ni hesitation. Au contraire les r\u00e9ticences et les contradictions des Larocque d\u00e9montrent que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat qu'ils portent au succ\u00e8s des Larocque les domine. Mais Il y a dans la cause nombre de t\u00e9moins \u00e9trangers et d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9s qui \u00e9tablissent hors de tout doute la mauvaise foi de Paul et Hormisdas au moment de leurs acquisitions et auparavant; et ii faut bien remarquer que leur caract\u00e8re et leur reputation n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 attaqu\u00e9s; quelques-uns sont m\u00eame des amis on parents \u00e9loign\u00e9s de la famille Larocque; et d'apr\u00e9s notre mani\u00e8re de voir, il est impossible de rejeter ce qu'ils attestent sur les seules negations des parties ou de leurs proches. Nous mettons n\u00e9anmoins de c\u00f4t\u00e9 la deposition d'Alfred M\u00e9nard qui para\u00eet avoir pris fait et cause pour l'appelant durant les diff\u00e9rentes phases de ce proc\u00e8s: nous pr\u00e9f\u00e9rons en effet nous en rapporter enti\u00e8rement aux t\u00e9moignages de personnes \u00e9trang\u00e8res et aux parties et \u00e0 Ia cause.\nClement Rivet:\nJ'ai entendu Paul Larocque et Hormisdas Larocque parler des difficult\u00e9s qui existaient sur Ia dite terre, avant quills en fussent propri\u00e9taires. Le plus vieux des fils du demandeur \u00e9tait alors present, ainsi que les deux fr\u00e8res Larocque, chez M. Arthur Malo \u00e0 Saint-Val\u00e9rien. C'\u00e9tait un jour qui faisait mauvais et nous ne travaillions pas. Moi, j'ai dit que c'\u00e9tait de valeur d'enlever cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 aux Yvon qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue et que ce n'\u00e9tait pas juste Nous causions tous ensemble, y compris les Larocque. Les deux Larocque eux-m\u00eames ainsi que d'autres ont dit que c'\u00e9tait bien de valeur et que ce n'\u00e9tait pas juste d'enlever ainsi cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 aux Yvon. Malo n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu, et ii en est de m\u00e9me de Bourdeau et Ald\u00e9ric Quintal que le t\u00e9moin nomme en transquestion comme \u00e9tant pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 la conversation\nThadd\u00e9 Poirier, qui avait pass\u00e9 quelques ann\u00e9es aux Etats-Unis comme les Larocque:\nJ'ai eu connaissance de certaines difficult\u00e9s judiciaires \u00e0 propos de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9. J'ai entendu parler de ces difficult\u00e9s ii y a quinze on seize ans quand je suis venu dans le pays. Dans bien des circonstances, j'ai alors caus\u00e9 avec le d\u00e9fendeur, et son fr\u00e8re et les autres membres de Ia famille des difficult\u00e9s qui existaient sur cette terre. J'\u00e9tais alors et je suis encore l'ami intime de la famille Larocque. Je rencontrais alors les Larocque au village, chez eux et \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes places. Quelques fois j'allais chez la famille Larocque par affaire, et quelquefois en visite, en allant voir les jeunes demoiselles.\nJ\u2019ai eu connaissance de quelques transactions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites au sujet de la terre que r\u00e9clame le demandeur J'ai eu connaissance de la vente que Langlois a faite \u00e0 Paul Larocque. C'\u00e9tait chez M. Cardinal o\u00f9 les march\u00e9s se sont faits et ensuite chez le notaire de Grandpr\u00e9 \u00e0 Ia passation du contrat On a alors parl\u00e9 de certains difficult\u00e9s existant sur cette terre ; ce fut M. Paul Larocque qui a soulev\u00e9 ces difficult\u00e9s ainsi que M. Larocque le p\u00e9re. La propri\u00e9t\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue \u00e0 bon march\u00e9, \u00e0 cause de Ia crainte que le propri\u00e9taire avait de Ia garder. L'acheteur a soulev\u00e9 ces difficult\u00e9s et apr\u00e8s des pourparlers, Paul Larocque et son p\u00e9re ont exig\u00e9 qu'une clause soit ins\u00e9r\u00e9e dans l'acte \u00e0 l'effet que M. Langlois fut garant de tous les troubles qui pouvaient r\u00e9sulter du proc\u00e9s.\nL'acte de vente contient en effet la clause de garantie de tous troubles. Le notaire de Grandpr\u00e9, qui a une mauvaise m\u00e9moire jusqu'au point d'avoir oubli\u00e9 exactement le nombre d'ann\u00e9es qu'il exerce sa profession peut-\u00eatre \u00e0 cause de son grand \u00e2ge, car sa deposition ne donne pas son age, admet que Poirier aurait p\u00fb \u00eatre present \u00e0 la passation du contrat, mais ii ne s'en rappelle pas. Enfin, si l'on consid\u00e8re la rente viag\u00e8re qui fait la consid\u00e9ration de la vente de Paul \u00e0 Hormisdas Paul achetait \u00e0 bon march\u00e9.\nEtienne M\u00e9nard:\nJe connais le d\u00e9fendeur en cette cause et sa famille; il est mon cousin germain. J'ai eu conaissance des ditficult\u00e9s qui existent au sujet de cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 depuis longtemps. J'ai entendu parler de ces difficult\u00e9s par le public en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. J'ai entendu parler de ces difficult\u00e9s par le fr\u00e8re du d\u00e9fendeur Paul Larocque; il y a \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s quinze ans de cela, chez M. Pierre Harnois \u00e0 un bee ou corv\u00e9e. Les personnss pr\u00e9sentes \u00e9taient Paul Larocque, Jean-Baptiste Larocque et Antoine Larocque, aujourd'hui d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9. Il a \u00e9td alors question des difficult\u00e9s cur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Tout en travaillant, ii est venu l'\u00e0propos de parler de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du demandeur au sujet du proces qui existait alors entre le demandeur et Narcisse Bolduc. Paul Larocque a dit que celui qui disait qu'il y avait crainte d'acheter cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9-l\u00e0 \u00e9tait un fou. Moi, j'ai dit que c'\u00e9tait pas prudent d'acheter cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9-l\u00e0, \u00e0 cause du proc\u00e9s. Il a r\u00e9pondu que si le march\u00e9 lui allait, il l'ach\u00e9terait, puis ii n'aurait pas peur de cela, parce que jamais Yvon pourrait gagner sa terre avec Bolduc, parce qu'il n'en avait pas les moyens\u2014un petit jobbeur de terre neuve comme Yvon, le demandeur, ne pouvait pas arriver avec Bolduc, parce qu'il ne pouvait pas faire assez d'argent.\nAuguste Gauthier r\u00e9f\u00e9rant \u00e0 Paul Larocque:\nLui-m\u00eame m'a racont\u00e9 Ia mani\u00e8re dont lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 introduite cette terre; qu'on lui avait dit qu'il n'y avait pas de soin, qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue par le Sh\u00e9rif, que \u00e7a effa\u00e7ait toutes pr\u00e9tentions, et que personne ne pouvait revenir dessus. C'\u00e9tait Cardinal, le d\u00e9funt Cardinal, qui lui avait dit que cette terre avait \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue. J'en ai parl\u00e9, comme \u00e7a en diff\u00e9rents temps, leur disant que Lefeunteum reviendrait pour sa terre; qu'il \u00e9tait en proc\u00e9s et que \u00e7a continuerait jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il l'ait d\u00e9finitivement. Ils ne croyaient pas \u00e7a; ils se basaient sur le contrat du Sh\u00e9rif.\nCette preuve n'a rien d'\u00e9trange. Bien an contraire. Il est difficile de s'imaginer qu'un proc\u00e9s aussi important ait pass\u00e9 pal toutes les cours du pays sans avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 connu g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement des habitants de la paroisse do Saint-Val\u00e9rien, et en particulier des divers acqu\u00e9reurs de la terre qui en faisait le sujet, surtout si l'on consid\u00e8re quo les Lefeunteum, qui paraissent avoir it langue bien d\u00e9li\u00e9e r\u00e9sidaient alors dans la localit\u00e9 m\u00eame. La chose est possible, mais n'est pas probable. Los d\u00e9tenteurs ant\u00e9rieurs aux Larocque connaissaient ce proc\u00e9s et ii est memo en preuve que plusieurs d'entr'eux ont dispos\u00e9 de la terre pour en \u00e9viter les consequences. Bolduc, Cardinal et Dufresne qui out achet\u00e9 do lui avant la production de Ia requ\u00eate en nullit\u00e9 do d\u00e9cret, paraissent avoir seuls acquis de bonne foi ; mais ils ont redout\u00e9 le denouement du litige avant d'acqu\u00e9rir la prescription, et ils se sont empress\u00e9s de vendre. Egale-. ment c'est pendant que Bolduc \u00e9tait possesseur que M. le cur\u00e9 C\u00f4t\u00e9 n'aurait pas en d'objection \u00e0 acheter. Quoiqu'il en soit, la mauvaise foi des Larocque, avant et au moment de l'acquisition, est particuli\u00e8rement \u00e9tablie et ils doivent en subir les consequences. L'in tim\u00e9e doit rendre l'immeuble \u00e0 l'appelant et lui tenir compte des fruits et revenus, deduction faite des impenses et ameliorations qui \u00e9taient toutes n\u00e9cessaires.\nLa pratique ordinaire en pareil cas est d'ordonner une expertise; mais eu \u00e9gard aux circonstances de cette cause qui traine devant les tribunaux depuis plus de vingt ans, et consid\u00e9rant que nous avons au dossier ample preuve pour adjuger sur cet incident, nous croyons devoir d'abord declarer les impenses et am\u00e9liorations compens\u00e9es par une plus forte somme qui repr\u00e9sente les fruits et revenus et en sus d'accorder \u00e0 l'appelant $200 avec int\u00e9r\u0152t, pour l'exc\u00e9dent des dits fruits et revenus.\nSans nous prononcer sur Ia question de chose jug\u00e9e-soulev\u00e9e par l'appelant nous sommes d'avis de le declarer propri\u00e9taire de l'immeuble qu'il revendique et de condamner l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 le lui rendre dans l'\u00e9tat o\u00f9 il se trouve, dans un d\u00e9lai d'un mois \u00e0 compter de la signification du jugement, et de plus \u00e0 lui payer la somme de deux cents piastres, avec int\u00e9r\u00eat sur icelle \u00e0 compter du jour de l'institution de l'action,. \u00e0 titre de fruits et revenus, en sus des impenses et ameliorations que le d\u00e9fendeur r\u00e9clame et qui sont d\u00e9clar\u00e9es compens\u00e9es comme susdit, le tout avec d\u00e9pens contre l'intim\u00e9e devant toutes les cours.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.
