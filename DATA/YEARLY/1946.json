And Kerwin, Taschereau, Kellock And Estey JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA\nReal Property\u2014Judgments\u2014Unregistered transfer of land in British Columbia by registered owner\u2014Recovery and registration of judgments against registered owner subsequent to the transfer\u2014Whether judgments attached to the land\u2014Land Registry Act, R.S.B.C. 1986, c. 140; Execution Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, c. 91.\nThe registered owner of land in British Columbia executed and delivered a transfer of it. The transfer was not registered nor was an application made to register it. Subsequently to the transfer, judgments were recovered against said registered owner, which were registered. It was held (affirming decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, [1945] 2 W.W.R. 576) that the judgments did not form a lien or charge against the land.\nProvisions of the Land Registry Act, R.SB.C. 1936, c. 140, and of the Execution Act, R.S.B.C., c. 91, discussed, and cases reviewed. Said statutes have not changed the common law rule that the execution creditor can only attach that interest which exists in the execution debtor; and, the registered owner having disposed of his entire interest at a time prior to the judgments, there was no interest upon which the judgments could attach.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] setting aside the order of Wilson J. in so far as it directed the sale of certain lands, in question in the present appeal.\nThe defendant was the registered owner of the said lands. In June, 1935, he executed and delivered a transfer of the said lands to Minto Trading & Development Company Ltd. This transfer was not registered, nor was an application made to register it.\nThe plaintiff recovered two judgments against the defendant, one in January, 1939, which was registered in July, 1943, and one in March, 1944, which was registered in March, 1944.\nWilson J., confirming the report of the District Registrar at Vancouver (made on an order of reference applied for by the plaintiff), ordered that the said lands be sold for the purpose of satisfying the said judgments. An appeal by the defendant was allowed by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, which set aside the order of Wilson J. in so far as it directed the sale of the lands now in question. Special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was granted to the plaintiff by the Court of Appeal for British Columbia.\nThe said Minto Trading & Development Company Ltd. consented to an order that it be joined as a party (respondent) on the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nH. R. Bray K.C. for the appellant.\nAlfred Bull K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin, Taschereau and Estey JJ. was delivered by\nESTEY J.\u2014The appellant holds against the respondent two judgments registered respectively on the 23rd day of July, 1943, and the 30th day of March, 1944, in the Kamloops Land Registration District in the Province of British Columbia.\nThe respondent has been, at all times material to these proceedings, the registered owner of the lands in question under a Certificate of Indefeasible Title dated the 9th day of November, 1936, and issued out of the Kamloops Land Registration District.\nThe District Registrar at Vancouver has, after hearing the interested parties, certified\nthat the interest of the said judgment debtor liable to be sold under end to satisfy the said judgment consists of the entire fee, being the entire right, title and interest registered in the name of the judgment debtor under the said Certificates of Indefeasible Title and standing in his name upon the records of the said Land Registry Office ***\nHe then specified the lands in question.\nThis certificate was confirmed by the Honourable Mr. Justice Wilson, whose decision was reversed in the Court of Appeal. A further appeal is now taken to this Court.\nThe respondent's contention is that prior to the registration of the judgments he had executed and delivered a transfer of these lands to the Minto Trading and Development Company Limited in payment of 20,000 shares of stock allotted to him by that company. This instrument of transfer was executed and delivered on June 10th, 1935, and as a consequence he contends that since that time he has had no beneficial interest in the said lands. The company has never applied for registration of this transfer, nor does it now indicate any intention with respect thereto.\nAt common law \"an execution creditor can only sell the property of his debtor subject to all such charges, liens and equities as the same was subject to in the hands of his debtor\": per Strong C.J., Jellett v. Wilkie [2].\nThe important issue, therefore, is what interest the judgment debtor had at the time the executions were registered in the Land Registry Office, or more particu- larly in this case, what is the significance and effect of the delivery by the respondent of the transfer duly executed to the Minto Trading and Development Company Limited. The determination of this question must be had from the provisions of the Land Registry Act.\nThe following section of the Land Registry Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, Ch. 140, is relevant:\n34. Except as against the person making the same, no instrument *** purporting to transfer, charge, deal with, or affect land or any estate or interest therein, shall become operative to pass any estate or interest, either at law or in equity, in the land *** until the instrument is registered in compliance with the provisions of this Act; ***\nThe respondent relies upon the decision of Entwisle v. Lenz & Leiser [3]. There the holder of an unregistered transfer brought action to have the judgment registered against the land, since the execution and delivery of the transfer, removed as a cloud upon his title. The learned trial judge decided under the then section 74 (now section 34 of the Land Registry Act) in favour of the execution creditor. His decision was reversed in the Court of Appeal where the learned judges did not discuss the provisions of the Land Registry Act, but rested their decision upon section 3 of the Judgments Act, R.S.B.C. 1899, Ch. 33 (now section 35, Execution Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, Ch. 91):\nImmediately upon any judgment being entered or recovered in this province, the judgment may be registered in any or all of the Land Registry Offices in the province, and from the time of registering the same the judgment shall form a lien and charge on all the lands of the judgment debtor in the several land registration districts in which the judgment is registered, in the same manner as if charged in writing by the judgment debtor under his hand and seal; and after the registering of the judgment the judgment creditor may, if he wishes to do so, forth-with proceed upon the lien and charge thereby created.\nThis section was construed in the Entwisle case [4]. as effecting no change in the common law. Somewhat similar statutes have been so construed. Eyre v. McDowell [5]; Case v. Bartlett [6].\nThe Entwisle case[7]. was criticized but not overruled in Bank of Hamilton v. Hartery [8]. The criticism was based upon the provisions with respect to the effect of registration under the Land Registry Act. In 1921 cer- tain amendments were made to that Act. Counsel for the respondent submits that at least some of these amendments were made, as a consequence of the criticism in this Court, for the purpose of clarifying the statute and continuing the law as laid down in Entwisle v. Lenz & Leiser [9]. That was the view of the majority of the learned judges in Gregg v. Palmer [10].\nOne of the 1921 amendments inserted at the beginning of section 34 the words: \"Except as against the person making the same\". The section prior to that amendment read in part:\nNo instrument *** purporting to transfer *** shall pass any estate or interest, either at law or in equity, in the land *** until the instrument is registered ***\nIt is apparent that prior to the insertion of these words the statute emphasized the importance of registration and it provided for what Lord Moulton described as \"the absoluteness of the effect of the registration\", Loke Yew v. Port Swettenham Rubber Co. Ltd. [11]. It was, no doubt, the criticism of the Entwisle case [12]. that brought to the attention of the legislature this conflict between section 34 and the decision in the Entwisle case [13]. This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that section 34 had remained in the statutes without amendment since prior to the Entwisle decision [14] in 1908, but immediately following that criticism it was amended.\nThese words, \"except as against the person making the same\", expressly make operative an unregistered instrument against the party making the same. Therefore, the transfer executed by the respondent was operative to transfer to the Minto Trading and Development Company Limited whatever estate, either at law or in equity, he was in possession of. As a consequence the respondent, as execution debtor, had prior to the registration of this judgment divested himself of his interest in the land here in question. The conclusion, therefore, appears to be well founded that the legislature by this amendment has continued the decision in the Entwisle case [15] as law in British Columbia. The Minto Trading and Development Company Limited is not asking to have the transfer registered under sections 175, 176 and 177 of the Land Registry Act, as enacted in 1921. They were, however, enacted at the same time as the words inserted in section 34 and may be helpful in understanding the meaning and effect of these words inserted at the beginning of section 34. Sections 175, 176 and 177 have to do with judgments in relation to those who apply for registration as owner or holder of a charge. A judgment is different from other encumbrances in that as registered it constitutes a blanket charge upon all the lands of the judgment debtor in that Land Registration District. Because of this a different system of registration is adopted and all judgments are listed under the name of the judgment debtor in a \"Register of Judgments\". Under this system questions arise with respect to the identity of owners and judgment debtors, for which a summary procedure is essential. But these sections go beyond the decision of such issues.\nIn section 175 it expressly contemplates\nwhere application has been made to the Registrar to register the applicant as owner of land *** and there is a judgment registered against the grantor of the fee-simple ***\nThen in section 176,\n*** any judgment creditor *** shall be entitled to be paid *** as costs of investigating the bona fides of the claim of the applicant that he is entitled to priority to the judgment.\nThen in section 177 it is provided that where the instrument is entitled \"to priority over the registered judgment\" the Court may nevertheless allow costs to the judgment creditor\nif in the opinion of the Court the judgment creditor was justified under the circumstances *** in requiring the applicant to have judicially established the bona fides and validity of the execution of the instrument under which the applicant claims.\nThese sections indicate that upon such applications the question of priority shall be determined, a matter which, prior to the amendments of 1921, was settled by the provisions of the sections corresponding to sections 34, 36 and 37. Indeed, the implication appears to be that, if the instrument is found to be bona fide and validly executed, it is entitled to priority over the judgment creditor under circumstances such as obtain in this case. These statutory provisions, read, as they must be, in association with section 34; retain the common law rule with respect to rights of judgment creditors. Under that rule the execution creditor can only attach that interest which exists in the execution debtor. The respondent having disposed of his entire interest before the registration of the judgment, this judgment cannot attach the land in question as certified by the Registrar.\nThe learned judge, in confirming the District Registrar's report, based his judgment upon the amendment made to the Land Registry Act in 1913 to the then section 22, now section 37. The material portion of that amendment substituted \"conclusive evidence at law and in equity\" for the words \"conclusive evidence in all Courts of Justice\". With deference to the learned trial judge, this amendment does not appear to effect the change which he suggests. All the Courts having to do with these matters apply the rules and principles of both law and equity. Moreover, it appears that the amendments made in 1921 and already discussed deal more specifically with the subject and if section 37 (section 22 in 1913) was intended to effect such a change as suggested by the learned trial judge, the legislature would, no doubt, have further amended that section in 1921.\nIn my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nKELLOCK J.\u2014This is an appeal from the order of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia dated 27th April, 1945, allowing an appeal by the respondents from the judgment or order of Wilson J. dated October 25, 1944, giving directions for the sale of certain lands of which the respondent Warren Asa Davidson is the registered owner and of which the respondent company holds an unregistered transfer.\nThe facts briefly are, that on the 10th of June, 1935, the respondent Warren Asa Davidson conveyed the lands in question to the respondent company but the transfer was not registered and to date no application to register has been made by the transferee. On the 23rd of January, 1939, the appellant, who is the wife of the respondent Warren Asa Davidson, obtained judgment against her husband, which judgment was registered in the proper land registration office on the 23rd of July, 1943. On the 27th of March, 1944, the appellant obtained another judgment against her husband, which in turn she registered on the 30th of March, 1944.\nPursuant to the provisions of section 38 of the Execution Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, Cap. 91, an application was made by the appellant to the Chief Justice of British Columbia, by whom an order was made on the 16th of May, 1944, referring the matter to the Registrar of the Supreme Court for the purpose of ascertaining what lands of the judgment debtor were liable to be sold pursuant to the provisions of the statute in order to realize the amount of the judgments. It was pursuant to this order that the report of the Registrar was made, upon which the later proceedings already mentioned were founded. The issue throughout the proceedings was as to whether or not the interest of the registered owner in the lands was subject to sale irrespective of the unregistered transfer.\nSec. 38 already referred to provides that where any judgment creditor has registered a judgment in a Land Registry Office, a motion may be made by him calling upon the judgment debtor and upon any trustee or other person having the legal estate in the land in question, to show cause why any land in the land registration district in which the judgment is registered, or the interest therein of the judgment debtor, or a competent part of the land, should not be sold to realize the amount payable under the judgment. Sec. 39 provides that upon such an application such proceedings shall be had either in a summary way or by the trial of an issue, or by enquiry before an officer of the Court, or by an action or otherwise, for the purpose of ascertaining \"the truth of the matters in question, and whether the lands, or the interest therein of the judgment debtor, are liable for the satisfaction of the judgment.\" By sec. 35 provision is made for the registration of a judgment and the section enacts that\nfrom the time of registering the same the judgment shall form a lien and charge on all the lands of the judgment debtor in the several land registration districts in which the judgment is registered, in the same manner as if charged in writing by the judgment debtor under his hand and seal; and after the registering of the judgment the judgment creditor may, if he wishes to do so, forthwith proceed upon the lien and charge thereby created. By sec. 40, it is provided that upon any application made under sec. 38 there shall be included in the order a reference to a District Registrar of the Supreme Court to find what lands are liable to be sold under the judgment, and what are the nature and particulars of the interest of the judgment debtor in the lands and of his title thereto, and what judgments form a lien and charge against the lands and the priorities between the judgments, to determine how the proceeds of the sale shall be distributed, and to report all such findings to the Court. It is further provided that the District Registrar shall cause all persons affected by his enquiries to be served with notice. The Registrar's report is subject to confirmation by a Judge of the Supreme Court, and all persons affected thereby shall have notice of the application for confirmation. By sec. 42 provision is made for an order for sale consequent upon the report of the Registrar, and by sec. 43 it is provided that where it appears on any application for an order for sale that there may be persons interested in the land to be sold whose names are unknown to the judgment creditor, the Court may direct advertisements calling upon all persons claiming to be interested in the land to come in and establish their claims within a limited time after which such persons shall be debarred.\nIn Jellett v. Wilkie [16], Strong, C. J., giving the judgment of the Court, said at p. 288:\nNo proposition of law can be more amply supported by authority than that which the respondents invoke as the basis of the judgment under appeal, namely, that an execution creditor can only sell the property of his debtor subject to all such charges, liens and equities as the same was subject to in the hands of his debtor.\nIn that case, it was held that this rule of law was not affected by the provisions of sec. 94 of the Territories Real Property Act there in question and that an execution creditor who had registered his writ of execution before registration of transfers from the registered owner bearing date prior to the date of registration of the execution was subject to the transfer.\nIt is contended on behalf of the appellant that by reason of the provisions of sections 34 and 37 of the Land Registry Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, Cap. 140, the rule of law applied in Jellett's case [17] is not applicable in the case at bar. Sec. 34 enacts in brief, so far as is relevant, that, except as against the person making the same, no instrument purporting to transfer land shall become operative to pass any estate or interest, either at law or in equity, in the land until the instrument is registered in compliance with the provisions of the Act, but such instrument shall confer on the transferee and on every person claiming through or under him the right to apply to have the instrument registered, and to use the names of all parties to the instrument in any proceedings incidental to registration. By sec. 37 it is provided that every Certificate of Indefeasible Title issued under the Act shall be received in evidence in all Courts of Justice in the province without proof of seal or signature and so long as it remains in force and uncancelled shall be conclusive evidence at law and in equity, as against His Majesty and all persons whomsoever, that the person named in the certificate is seized of an estate in feesimple in the land therein described against the whole world, subject to certain exceptions. One of these is clause (g): \"any lis pendens or mechanic's lien, judgment, caveat, or other charge *** registered since the date of the application for registration.\"\nIn Entwistle v. Lenz [18], the Court of Appeal of British Columbia held, having regard to the predecessor of sec. 35 of the Execution Act, that an execution registered prior to an unregistered conveyance made before judgment was obtained, was subsequent in priority to the conveyance and allowed an appeal from the judgment of the trial judge who had held that sec. 74 of the Land Registry Act of 1906, 6 Edward VII, Cap. 23, gave the execution priority. That section, which is the predecessor of the present sec. 34, differed in some respects from the present section in that it did not have the words \"except as against the person making the same\" at the beginning of the section, and instead of providing as at present that the unregistered transfer should not \"become operative to pass\" provided that it \"should not pass.\" It was also without the provision giving the unregistered transferee the right to use the names of the parties to the instrument in proceedings for registration. This decision was adversely commented upon by Anglin J., with whom Mignault J. agreed, in Bank of Hamilton v. Hartery [19]. The Court in the last mentioned case had to deal, not with an execution and a competing unregistered transfer, but with a mortgage and a judgment both of which had in fact been registered, and as that situation was specifically dealt with by sec. 73 of the then Land Registry Act, namely, R.S.B.C. 1911, Cap. 127, it was not necessary to deal with the soundness of the judgment in the Entwisle case [20]. The judgment of the Court of Appeal in the Entwisle case [21] proceeded upon the view that the registered owner who had made the unregistered transfer was merely the holder of the dry legal estate and that the beneficial interest had passed to the transferee notwithstanding the provisions of sec. 74.\nSince the decision in Hartery's case [22], the Land Registry Act was amended and consolidated in 1921 by Cap. 26 of the statutes of that year and the differences already pointed out as between the present sec. 34 and old sec. 74 were then made.\nIn 1932, the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in the case Gregg v. Palmer [23], held, Macdonald C.J.B.C. and Galliher J.A. dissenting, that as between an applicant to register a mortgage and a registered judgment creditor the former was entitled to priority. The majority held that the decision in Hartery's case [24] did not apply, (1) because in that case, as already pointed out, the mortgage had been registered, while in Gregg's case [25] the mortgagee had merely applied to register, and (2) because of the changes in the legislation since the decision in Hartery's case [26]. Since the decision in Gregg's case [27], there has been a further revision of the statutes in British Columbia and the relevant provisions of both the Execution Act and the Land Registry Act have been re-enacted without change.\nIn my opinion, the question raised by the present appeal is to be determined adversely to the appellant. Not withstanding the provisions upon which the appellant relies, I think that the conclusion to which one must come by virtue of the presence in the statute of Part IX deal- ing with \"judgments\" is that in such circumstances as are here present the judgment attaches only upon the interest of the execution debtor in the lands subject to the unregistered transfer. Sections 174 to 177 appear to be based upon that view of the statute.\nBy sec. 175 it is provided that where application has been made to the Land Registrar to register the applicant as owner of land and there is a judgment registered against the grantor, the Registrar may in his discretion cause a notice to be given to the judgment creditor of his intention at the expiration of a time fixed by the notice to effect registration in pursuance of the application. If the judgment creditor claims a lien upon the lands covered by the application, he is required, within the time fixed by the notice, to follow the procedure for enforcing his charge defined in sections 38 to 44 of the Execution Act and to register a certificate of lis pendens, otherwise the Registrar may register the applicant free from the judgment. By sec. 176, it is provided that where the above notice is served and it appears that the title of the applicant for registration is founded upon an instrument executed more than one month before the application for registration the judgment creditor is entitled to be paid by the applicant $5 as costs of investigating \"the bona fides of the claim of the applicant that he is entitled to priority to the judgment.\" Sec. 177 provides that where proceedings are taken under sections 38 to 44 of the Execution Act\nand fail by reason of the finding of the Court that the instrument under which the applicant for registration *** claims is entitled to priority over the registered judgment, the Count may, in its discretion, dismiss the proceedings without costs, or allow costs to the judgment creditor, if in the opinion of the Court the judgment creditor was justified under the circumstances, including the delay in application for registration, in requiring the applicant to have judicially established the bona fides and validity of the execution of the instrument under which the applicant claims.\nIf mere priority in point of time in registration of a judgment entitled the judgment creditor to priority over an unregistered transfer were sufficient, I find it impossible to give any meaning to the sections just referred to. As I have said, I think the only meaning that can be given to them in such a case as the present is that where there is no question between the parties, apart from the time of the execution of the transfer and the time of the registration of the judgment, the former is entitled to priority. It may be noted that no question arises, as in Hartery's case [28], under the provisions of the present section 42 of the Act, as it is not a case of competing registered charges.,\nIt may be pointed out that, while sec. 177 of the Act was not in force at the time of the decision in Hartery's case [29], provisions similar to or identical with sections 174 to 176 were, however, in the statute before that case was decided; see Statutes of British Columbia, 1914, Cap. 43, sec. 70; 1916, Cap. 32, sections 27 and 28. These provisions, however, were not dealt with in the judgments in that case, but they were, however, drawn to the attention of the Court in the factum of the respondent. It is true that in the case at bar sec. 175, subsection 1, is predicated upon an application for registration having been made by the holder of the unregistered conveyance, but although no such application has as yet been made by the respondent company, I do not think this fact affects the result. The judgment creditor has taken the proceedings he was entitled to take under the Execution Act which are the same proceedings the respondent company would have to call upon the appellant to take if the company desired to apply for registration and to obtain priority over the appellant's judgments. I do not think the appellant can take the position, if otherwise sound, that under the provisions of sections 34 and 37 of the Land Registry Act she is entitled to priority and that Part IX of the Act may not be looked at because of the fact that there is no application on the part of the respondent company to register. The result of this would be that the respondent company would be left free to apply to register under the provisions of Part IX, in which event I do not think the fact that proceedings had already been taken at the instance of the judgment creditor under the Execution Act would constitute an estoppel so as to prevent the provisions of Part IX having their due application with a resulting priority in favour of the respondent company. I think that, not- withstanding there is no application to register on the part of the respondent company, the sections included in Part IX may be looked at for the purpose of interpreting the statute as a whole, and when this is done the result is, in my opinion, as already stated.\nIn his judgment in the case at bar, Wilson J. pointed out that at the time of the decision in the Lenz case [30] the predecessor of the present sec. 37 (then sec. 81 of 6 Edward VII, Cap. 23, referred to by Wilson J. as R.S.B.C. 1911, Cap. 127, sec. 22) provided that a certificate of indefeasible title should be \"conclusive evidence in all Courts of Justice\" that the person named therein was seized of an estate in fee simple, and that some five years after the decision in that case, by 3 George V, Cap. 36, sec. 8, the subsection was amended by substituting for the words above quoted the following, namely, \"conclusive evidence at law and in equity as against His Majesty and all persons whomsoever.\" In the opinion of Wilson J., this change indicated an intention on the part of the legislature contrary to the decision in Lenz's case [31], founded, as it was, upon the view that the holder of the unregistered transfer held the beneficial title. In the opinion of Wilson J., the amendment of 1913 was intended to prevent such a view being taken thereafter and to render the certificate of title conclusive evidence that not only the legal estate but the beneficial estate remained in the registered owner. It was also pointed out by Wilson J. that Hartery's case [32] was a decision on facts differing from those existing in Lenz's case [33] and decided on that ground and that the facts in the case at bar are similar to those in Lenz's case [34], and different from the facts in Gregg's case [35]. He also pointed out what I have already mentioned, namely, that while in the judgments in Gregg v. Palmer [36]., Part IX of the Land Registry Act or its predecessor was necessarily taken into consideration, the Part is predicated upon an application to register on the part of the holder of the unregistered instrument. He was of the opinion that those sections could not be invoked in the case at bar, and for that reason and also because of the difference in facts, he did not consider that the decision in Gregg v. Palmer [37]. applied. He did consider that he was bound by Lenz's case (1), but in view of the amendment of 1913, he thought his decision should now be in favour of the judgment creditor. In the Court of Appeal, the appeal was allowed. O'Halloran J. A., giving the judgment of the Court, dealt only with the amendment of 1913 and held that, read in its context, it did not change the meaning of the section.\nBut for the presence in the statute of the group of sections included in Part IX, there would be much, in my view, to be said in favour of the contention upon which the appellant rests her case. However, it is not necessary to express any final view on this question, in view of the conclusion to which I have come by reason of the presence in the statute of Part IX, which proceeds upon the basis that the result of proceedings by a judgment creditor under sections 38 et seq. of the Execution Act, where there is no lack of bona fides attaching to the unregistered conveyance and the latter is validly executed, is to give priority to the unregistered conveyance and that this priority is effective under the Land Registry Act.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: T.

The suppliant claimed damages against the Crown for injury suffered in a collision between his taxi, driven by him, and an army truck, driven by a member of the Canadian Army Service Corps, about 7.45 a.m. on January 28, 1944, in the city of Vancouver. The army truck, which had been going westward on Georgia street, turned left to go south on Bute street and struck the taxi which, going westward on Georgia street, was in the course of passing the truck on the truck's left side. The truck was a right-hand drive vehicle, and its driver, who was alone and did not see the taxi, extended his arm to the right, but this was not seen by the suppliant. The suppliant in proceeding to pass did not sound his horn.\nHeld (affirming judgment of Angers J. in the Exchequer Court): Having regard to all the circumstances (discussed), the accident was caused solely by negligence of the driver of the army truck.\nPer the Chief Justice and Kerwin and Estey JJ.: The truck-driver violated the provisions of s. 3 (j) of the regulations passed under the Motor-vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, c. 195, in not ascertaining if the turn could be made in safety and in failing to give a signal plainly visible. The suppliant was entitled to rely upon compliance with such provisions.\nPer Rand and Kellock JJ.: The truck-driver failed completely to take any precaution to see whether or not the turn could be made safely; and this, apart altogether from any statutory provision, was negligence. The suppliant, while obliged to keep a proper look-out, and it was not shown he did not, was not bound to anticipate that the truck would turn into Bute street in the absence of any indication that such was its driver's intention.\nPer curiam: In the circumstances in question, it was not \"reasonably necessary\" (s. 3 (h) of said regulations) for the suppliant to sound his horn.\nAPPEAL on behalf of His Majesty the King from the judgment of Angers J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada in favour of the suppliant (the present respondent) for damages ($2,422.10) resulting from personal injuries to the suppliant caused by a collision of an army motor truck, driven by a private in the Canadian Army Service Corps, with a motor car driven by the suppliant, at or near the intersection of Georgia street and Bute street in the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, at or about 7.45 a.m. on January 28, 1944. Angers J. held that the accident was due solely to the negligence of the driver of the army vehicle.\nR. Forsyth K.C. for the appellant.\nC. K. Guild K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin and Estey JJ. was delivered by\nEstey J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment after trial in the Exchequer Court in which the respondent (suppliant) taxi driver claims damages against His Majesty for injury suffered in a collision between his taxi and an army motor vehicle.\nThe learned trial judge found: \"I have come to the conclusion that the accident is due solely to the negligence of the driver of the Army vehicle\" in that he failed to give \"a visible signal to the driver of the taxi\". He accordingly directed judgment for the respondent (suppliant in the Exchequer Court) in the sum of $2,422.10. The appellant (respondent in the Exchequer Court) asks that this Court reverse that finding of fact and find that the respondent's conduct constituted negligence, either ultimate or contributory.\nThe army vehicle, driven by a member of the armed services, was proceeding westward on Georgia street in the City of Vancouver at about 7.45 on a frosty morning, the 28th of January, 1944. The city lights were still on; the street was hard surfaced and at the time described by some as slippery. He was alone in this right-hand drive army vehicle and proceeding at a speed which he estimated not to be in excess of 15 m.p.h. at any time and at the time of impact about 8 to 10 m.p.h. Other evidence suggests he was going a little faster, perhaps 20 to 25 m.p.h. As he was \"just getting into the intersection\" of Georgia and Bute streets he made a turn to the south. He admits that, notwithstanding his motor vehicle was equipped with a rear-view mirror, he did so without looking to ascertain if any vehicle was at or near this point. Moreover, he did so without giving any signal except to extend his arm on the right side where he knew it could not be seen by a driver of an over-taking motor-car upon his left. Immediately he started to make this turn he collided with the respondent's taxi, then in the course of passing him on the south side, as it was proceeding in the same direction westward on Georgia street.\nThere were only three parties who saw the accident: the respective drivers and the passenger in the taxi. The respondent, the driver of the taxi, was taking a passenger to work. He was driving at 25 to 30 m.p.h. near the centre of Georgia street and noticed the army vehicle when it was about 100 to 150 feet from Bute street and about 10 or 15 feet in front of him but to his right. Because the army truck was to his right and proceeding in the same direction, he did not change his speed, alter his course or sound his horn. As he was passing the army vehicle, and when the front of his taxi was approximately 3 or 4 feet from the front end of the army vehicle, the latter made a \"fast turn\" to his left and collided with the right front door of the taxi. The respondent suffered serious personal injuries, the passenger was rendered unconscious and the taxi damaged.\nThe passenger sitting in the front seat on the right-hand side saw nothing to attract his attention. He said:\nWe were not going very fast * * * the truck was on our right side * * * we were just starting to go by it * * * Well we were going along the street, as I remember it, we seemed to be coming up onto the corner, and there was a truck on our right, and the next thing I realized we were sort of lifted up in the air and pushed across the street into a building, and from then on I don't know because I was knocked out.\nCertain photographs were placed in evidence and these corroborated the statements of the respondent, his passenger and Constable Vance that the right front door of the taxi was damaged by contact with a front tire of the army vehicle.\nConstable Vance of the Vancouver Police Force and Capt. Edwards of the Royal Canadian Army Service Corps arrived very soon after the accident and independently examined the tracks of the respective vehicles. They were able to trace the tracks of both vehicles approximately 20 and 30 feet eastward from the intersection and agreed that the vehicles were proceeding more or less parallel. They disagreed entirely with respect to the point of impact. Constable Vance found skid marks made by the taxi 20 to 30 feet east of the east curb line of Bute Street and fixed that as the point of impact. Capt. Edwards found some dirt near the yellow line about 8 feet west from the east curb line of Bute street and he fixed that as the point of impact. Both felt that the marks of the respective vehicles justified or corroborated their conclusions as to the point of impact. The respondent thought the collision occurred when he had \"not quite\" reached the intersection, and the driver of the motor vehicle thought it happened \"when I got into the interestion I just started my left turn.\" It is impossible upon the evidence to reconcile these statements and with regard to which the learned trial judge made no specific finding either with respect to the point of impact or the credibility of the respective witnesses, no doubt because in his opinion the sole cause of the collision was the negligent conduct on the part of the driver of the army vehicle.\nThat the driver of the army vehicle was negligent there can be no doubt. He admits that he turned south without giving any signal evidencing his intention to do so, and without looking to ascertain if there was any traffic nearby. In this he violated the express provisions of section 3 (j) of the regulations passed under the provisions of the Motor-vehicle Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, Chap. 195:\n3. (j). Before turning, stopping, or changing the course on the highway of any motor-vehicle, and before turning such vehicle when starting the same, it shall be the duty of the operator thereof first to ascertain whether there is sufficient space for such movement to be made in safety, and the operator shall give a signal plainly visible to the operators of other vehicles of his intention to turn, stop, or change his course. Such signal shall be given either by the use of the hand and arm or by the use of an approved mechanical or electrical device:\nThe word \"highway\" is defined to include \"every * * * street, lane * * * used by the general public for the passage of vehicles.\" In my opinion, therefore, the appellant's servant violated the express provisions of section 3 (j) and his conduct in this regard constitutes negligence.\nThe respondent on his part was entitled to rely upon the appellant complying with these provisions of section 3 (j), \"to ascertain\" if the turn could be made \"in safety\" and also \"give a signal plainly visible\". Carter v. Van Camp[1]; Toronto Railway Co. v. King[2], where Lord Atkinson stated:\nIt is suggested that the deceased must have seen, or ought to have seen, the tramcar, and had no right to assume it would have been slowed down, or that its driver would have ascertained that there was no traffic with which it might come in contact before he proceeded to apply his power and cross the thoroughfare. But why not assume these things? It was the driver's duty to do them all, and traffic in the streets would be impossible if the driver of each vehicle did not proceed more or less upon the assumption that the drivers of all the other vehicles will do what it is their duty to do, namely, observe the rules regulating the traffic of the streets.\nThe appellant contended that the respondent's failure to see the warning painted on the rear of the army vehicle, \"Caution Right Hand Drive Vehicle\u2014No Signals\", was evidence of his failure to keep a proper look-out. The only evidence, however, with respect to this caution sign is that it was \"dirty\", \"smeared as though they had been used for a period of time\". In fact there is no evidence that a reasonable driver in the position of the respondent could have seen these words. The respondent was not asked specifically as to whether he did see them. He admits, however, seeing the army vehicle but concluded that, as it was to his right, there was plenty of room for both to continue on their respective courses, and further that immediately he saw the army vehicle turn toward the south, he \"tried to swing with it\" but \"he [driver of the army vehicle] turned too fast\".\nThe appellant also contended that the driver of the taxi was negligent in not sounding his horn. The respondent admits that he did not sound his horn. The regulation with respect thereto, as passed pursuant to the Motor-vehicle Act (R.S.B.C. 1936, Chap. 195) and amendments thereto, includes the following as a part of paragraph 3 (h):\nThe motor-vehicle shall be equipped with a suitable horn, * * * and the same shall be sounded whenever it is reasonably necessary as a signal or warning to any person of the approach of the motor-vehicle; * * *\nWhat is \"reasonably necessary\" is a question of fact upon which point the learned trial judge in this case has made no finding. While I do not minimize the importance of sounding a horn under other circumstances, the evidence in this case, having regard to the width of the street, the absence of other traffic, the conduct of the respective drivers and the doubt as to their east-west position on Georgia street, does not establish a case of reasonable necessity therefor and consequently does not warrant a finding of negligence on the part of the respondent taxi driver.\nThe evidence establishes that the respondent was driving at a reasonable speed, maintaining a careful lookout and approaching the intersection with such care and caution that he would have adjusted his course to meet any condition that might reasonably have been anticipated, including the giving of a signal evidencing a turn to the left at the intersection. On the other hand, the army driver, without either looking into his rear-view mirrors or giving any signal, turned left just after entering the intersection. It therefore appears to me that the evidence does not establish a case of contributory negligence on the part of the respondent, but rather supports the finding of the learned trial judge that it was the failure of the driver of the army vehicle to give a \"visible signal to the driver of the taxi\" which caused this accident.\nIt is unnecessary, in view of the foregoing, to consider the submissions made relative to the by-laws of the City of Vancouver and District Routine Order No. 122. Insofar as either or both of these submissions may be applicable, they merely add to or strengthen the conclusions already arrived at.\nIn my opinion, the judgment of the learned trial judge should be affirmed and this appeal dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rand and Kellock JJ. was delivered by\nKellock J.\u2014In my opinion, it is not possible in this case to absolve the driver of the appellant's truck of negligence. This vehicle, an army truck, was so constructed that the driver could not see to his rear through the truck but had to depend for his knowledge of traffic approaching from the rear upon two mirrors projecting from either side of the windshield. Admittedly, the driver made a left-hand turn for the purpose of proceeding south on Bute street without knowing anything as to the presence or absence of traffic to his rear and without looking in either mirror. While he gave a signal with his right hand on that side of the truck, this could not be observed by the respondent. The driver failed completely to take any precaution to see whether or not the turn could be made safely before proceeding to execute it. Apart altogether from any statutory provision, this, in my opinion, was negligence. The enquiry then resolves itself into one as to whether or not there was any negligence on the part of the respondent. The respondent said that he first observed the truck when at a distance of from 100 to 150 feet from Bute street. At that time, the truck was from 10 to 15 feet in front of his taxi-cab, but well to the right and close to the north curb on Georgia street, a wide street measuring 50 feet from curb to curb. The respondent said that his taxi cab was proceeding north of the centre line of the street, the two vehicles being separated by from 3 to 4 feet. The respondent said his speed was between 25 to 30 miles per hour but closer to the former figure, while the truck was travelling somewhat more slowly and that when the front end of the taxi cab was approximately 3 to 5 feet from the front of the truck, the vehicles not having \"quite\" reached the intersection, the truck turned quickly to its left. The respondent says that he also swung to the left, but could not get away from the truck which struck the right front door of the taxi cab with its left front wheel.\nI do not think any point can be made of the fact that the respondent first observed the truck at the time above mentioned. At that time, it was well to his right and the two vehicles were some distance east of the point where any change in course was made by either.\nThe main contention on behalf of the appellant was that the respondent's taxi cab was endeavouring to pass the truck south of the centre line of Georgia street, as the two vehicles approached the intersection. It is said that the respondent ought not to have pursued such a course at that point but ought to have had his vehicle under control in anticipation of the possibility of the vehicle ahead turning into Bute street, and that in fact the respondent had been warned of such an intention on the part of the truck by the action of the truck driver in pulling his vehicle over toward the centre of Georgia street as he approached the intersection before he actually made the left-hand turn. This contention raises a question of fact and depends upon the proper view to be taken of the evidence.\nThe driver of the truck deposed that at no time had he travelled at a speed in excess of 15 miles an hour and that as he approached the intersection he slowed down to between 8 and 10 miles an hour and pulled over from the centre of the north half of the street to within 2 feet of the centre line at a point from 20 to 30 feet east of the property line on the east side of Bute street, which in turn, is 18 feet easterly from the east curb. He says that when he got into the intersection, he made his left-hand turn and the collision then occurred. He admits that the collision took place between the left front corner of his vehicle and the front door of the taxi cab and that it is possible that the point of impact may have been further to the east than he stated. If this evidence be accurate, the truck travelled a maximum of only 38 feet from the point where it began its inclination to the point of impact. The witness, Edwards, called on behalf of the appellant, who came on the scene after the accident, stated that he followed the tracks of the truck and that at a point 20 to 30 feet east of the east curb of Bute street they were from 2 to 3 feet north of the centre line. His evidence is not very clear, as he follows this statement up by saying that these marks were \"right at the yellow line\" and so continued up to the point 8 feet west of the east curb when they showed a decided turn to the left. On his evidence, there is only the one deviation from a straight course, namely, after the truck had entered the intersection, so that this witness has nothing to say about any earlier change of course on the part of the truck. He also says that he followed the marks of the taxi cab from a point 20 to 30 feet east of the east curb of Bute street to the point where the taxi cab came to rest against the building at the southwest corner of the intersection. This witness said that at the most easterly point where these marks began, one wheel was between 3 and 4 feet south of the centre line of Georgia street while the other was approximately 1 foot north of that line. He says these tracks travelled in a straight line until about 8 feet west of the east curb of Bute street where he found some dirt on the roadway where he says the marks moved slightly south of their original direction. Without taking into consideration the evidence of the respondent's witness, Vance, who places the marks of the vehicles in a different position, it is plain that, even giving full effect to the evidence of the truck driver, the first alteration of his course and the ultimate turn into the intersection all took place within a maximum of 38 feet. When it is remembered that the taxi cab at 25 miles an hour would cover this distance in slightly-over one second and the truck at 10 miles an hour would cover the same distance in something over two seconds, it is evident that the taxi cab in the position in which it found itself had no sufficient warning of the actual turn. It may well be that the learned trial judge was of opinion that the truck was proceeding faster than its driver would admit. I do not think that the respondent was bound to anticipate that the truck would turn into Bute street in the absence of any indication that such was the intention of its driver. That is not to say that the respondent was not at all times obliged to keep a proper lookout. It is not shown he did not.\nIt was also argued on behalf of the appellant that the respondent was negligent in not sounding his horn. I do not think, in the circumstances, there was any obligation on the respondent to sound his horn. The two vehicles, prior to the sudden change of course of the truck, were proceeding westerly on the north side of this wide city street, the one overtaking the other at a speed which was not excessive. In the absence of some warning of a change of course on the part of the vehicle ahead, I see no reason why the horn of the respondent should have been sounded. There is nothing in the relevant statutory provision, regulation 3 (h) passed pursuant to R.S.B.C. 1936, c. 195, to require it. According to the respondent, the front of his taxi cab was from 3 to 5 feet only from the front of the truck when the left turn was made. The taxi in that position could easily have been seen by the truck driver had he looked. In all these circumstances, I do not think it was \"reasonably\" necessary that the horn of the taxi cab should have been sounded and if not reasonably necessary the blowing of the horn was prohibited by the same regulation.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: F. P. Varcoe (solicitor for the Attorney-General of Canada); R. V. Prenter.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W. S. Lane.\n[1] [1930] S.C.R. 156.\n[2] [1908] A.C. 260 at 269.\n",

Pursuant to the agreement, appellant paid to the English company in 1940, 1941 and 1942, commissions of $17,381.94, $29,325.85, and $39,480.91, respectively, for which it claimed deductions in computing its income under the Dominion Income War Tax Act. The sums were disallowed as deductions except as to the sum of $7,500 in each year. From such disallowance, as affirmed by the Minister of National Revenue (acting by the Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Taxation), appellant appealed to the Exchequer Court. Its appeal was dismissed ([1945] Ex. C.R. 174); and it appealed to this Court. It contended (inter alia) that the commissions were an obligation imposed by a valid contract; that on the evidence they were reasonable and there was no evidence to the contrary; that s. 6 (1) (i) of said Act governed and that as the English company did not control appellant, no disallowance was warranted; that s. 6 (2) was not applicable; and that in any case the Minister's discretion was not properly exercised; that a report to the Minister from the local inspector of taxation should have been before the Exchequer Court, to give opportunity to appellant to controvert any statements therein; that the function falling upon the Minister was not within his power of delegation to the Deputy Minister. Held (Kerwin J. dissenting): The appeal should be allowed and the matter referred back to the Minister to be dealt with by him according to the reasons of the majority of the Court.\nPer the Chief Justice: In view of an admission, binding respondent, as to the proportion of shares in appellant held by the English company, appellant must be taken not to be controlled directly or indirectly by the English company, and therefore the disallowance of the deductions was not authorized under s. 6 (1) (i) of the Act, the provisions of which were applicable to the case, and the Minister could not act under s. 6 (2) in contravention of what was prescribed under s. 6 (1) (i); further, there was evidence, uncontradicted, that the advice and services of the English company were worth the amounts paid; further, s. 6 (2) did not apply to the facts: the sums claimed as deductions were not \"expenses\" within the meaning of s. 6 (2) (which contemplates expenses in the ordinary course of business); they were the price or consideration of the contract and of the due performance by the English company of its obligations; without them there would have been no contract and appellant would not have been in business. (The opinion was expressed that the assessment should be set aside to all intents and purposes, but, in view of conclusions by Hudson, Kellock and Estey JJ. that the matter should be referred back to the Minister, such disposition was agreed to).\nPer Hudson J.: S. 6 (1) (i) of the Act did not exclude the exercise of the Minister's discretion under s. 6 (2) under which he proceeded. The sums for which appellant claimed deductions could not be considered as part of its \"net profit or gain\" under s. 3, and there should be special reasons to support the disallowance. The Minister's ruling did not disclose reasons. The Court should know the reasons, so as to decide whether or not they are based on sound and fundamental principles. The report of the local inspector should have been before the Court under s. 63 (g) of the Act; appellant was entitled to see it and reply to it. The matter should be referred back to the Minister for reconsideration.\nPer Kellock J.: Having regard to the matters for which the commissions were paid, s. 6 (1) (i) did not apply; and the Minister did not purport to act under it but expressly acted under s. 6 (2). His discretion under s. 6 (2) should be exercised on proper legal principles. Appellant had a statutory right to have deducted, in the computation of its net profits or gains, \"expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended\" for the purpose of earning those profits or gains. For the Minister to disallow any excess over what was reasonable or normal for appellant's business, he first had to determine what was reasonable or normal. His formal decision threw no light as to the grounds upon which it rested. He could not ignore the agreement between appellant and the English company nor its legal consequences; and there was nothing before the Court upon which it could be said that there was any unreasonableness attaching to the commissions or to the agreement to pay them. What evidence there was, was to the contrary. The ground of the Minister's decision was unexplained and his decision was made to appear as a purely arbitrary one. Whether the local inspector's report disclosed grounds for the Minister's decision the Court had no means of knowing. Therefore it was the duty of the Court to refer the case back to the Minister. Further, s. 63 (g) of the Act made the report of the local inspector evidence, and appellant was entitled to have it produced to him before the assessments were made and to have an opportunity to meet whatever it contained; and his not having been accorded this right was in itself a ground for setting aside the assessments and sending the case back for further consideration.\nPer Estey J.: The Minister acted under s. 6 (2) of the Act, as stated in his decision and the correspondence; also s. 6 (1) (i) was inappropriate, in view of the matters for which the commissions were paid; moreover, there was no evidence before the Minister upon which he could determine by whom appellant was controlled \"directly or indirectly\" within the provision in s. 6 (1) (i). The Minister's discretion under s. 6 (2) is a judicial discretion, to be exercised on proper legal principles. Apart from the local inspector's report, which was not produced before the Court, there were no facts before the Minister which provided a basis upon which a discretionary determination could be made that the items in question were excessive within the terms of s. 6 (2). The said report, admitted by the Deputy Minister to have contained representations from the taxpayer, was \"relative to the assessment\" and should have been filed as required by s. 63 (g) of the Act. As it was not so filed, and also as further information might well have been requested from and given by appellant, the case should be referred back to the Deputy Minister as provided under s. 65 (2) of the Act.\nPer Kerwin J., dissenting: On the evidence it could not be said definitely that appellant was not \"controlled directly or indirectly\" by the English company within the meaning of s. 6 (1) (i) of the Act; in any event, s. 6 (2) (enacted in its present form subsequently to the enactment of s. 6 (1) (i)) conferred upon the Minister a power which he might exercise even if appellant had been able to bring itself within s. 6 (1) (i), and that power is a purely administrative one. Even if it were held to be of a quasi-judicial nature, appellant was given a fair opportunity to be heard and to make its representations, and there was nothing to indicate that the discretion was not exercised on proper legal principles. Appellant's payments to the English company fell within the term \"expense\" in s. 6 (2). As the substantial matter in the appeal to the Deputy Minister (acting for the Minister) was the same as what was involved in the exercise of his discretion, the decision in Local Government Board v. Arlidge, [1915] A.C. 120, not only justifies but requires a decision that he was not obliged to produce any report from the local inspector.\nIt was held (per Kerwin, Hudson, Kellock and Estey JJ.; the Chief Justice not expressly dealing with the matter) that the Minister's duty in this case came within his power of delegation under s. 75 (2) of the Act.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Cameron, Deputy Judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing the present appellant's appeal from the affirmance by the Minister of National Revenue (acting by the Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Taxation) of the assessment made against the appellant in respect of income tax and excess profits tax for the years 1940, 1941 and 1942, which assessment disallowed (except as to the sum of $7,500 for each year), as deductions in computing the appellant's taxable income, sums paid ($17,381.94 in 1940; $29,325.85 in 1941; and $39,480.91 in 1942) by the appellant to Wrights' Ropes Limited, of Birmingham, England, as commissions pursuant to the provisions of an agreement dated 12th September, 1935.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions involved in the appeal are sufficiently stated in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported.\nBy the judgment of the Court (Kerwin J dissenting), the appeal was allowed with costs, and the matter was referred back to the Minister to be dealt with by him according to the reasons of the majority of the Court. (The matter of costs in the Exchequer Court, overlooked when the reasons were first given, was later spoken to, and the Judges forming the majority of the Court decided that there be added to their reasons a holding that the appellant was entitled to its costs in the Exchequer Court).\nH. R. Bray K.C. for the appellant.\nR. Forsyth K.C. and H. H. Stikeman for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The Appeal Case states the present litigation as follows:\u2014\n(1) This is an appeal by the appellant from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice J.CA. Cameron delivered on the 3rd day of August, 1945, on an appeal by the appellant from the decision of the Honourable the Minister of National Revenue affirming the assessment made against the appellant under the provisions of The Income War Tax Act in respect of its taxable income and in respect of Excess Profits Tax for the years 1940, 1941 and 1942.\n(2) Pursuant to the provisions of an Agreement made between the appellant and Wrights' Ropes Limited of Birmingham, England, dated September 12, 1935, the appellant has made certain annual payments to Wrights' Ropes Limited.\n* * *\n(12) From the said judgment the appellant appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada. The reasons for appeal as given in the notice of appeal from the assessment, were as follows:\n(1) That the commissions paid by the appellant to Wrights' Ropes Limited were an obligation imposed on the appellant by a valid contract.\n(2) That the opinion of the Minister herein was not based on a consideration of the facts.\n(3) That the opinion of the Minister herein was unreasonable and was not formulated in accordance with the law.\n(4) That no opportunity has been given to the appellant to refute any material that may have been laid before the Minister of National Revenue or the Commissioner of Income Tax relative to the said assessment and which may be prejudicial to the interests of the appellant.\nThe decision of the Minister of National Revenue was that, having duly considered the facts and having exercised his discretion under the provisions of subsection 2 of section 6 of the Income War Tax Act, he affirmed the assessment and disallowed the sums already mentioned paid to Wrights' Ropes Limited of Birmingham, as expenses or deductions for the purposes of the said Act. \"Therefore, on these and related grounds and by reason of other provisions of the Income War Tax Act and Excess Profits Tax Act,\" said assessment was affirmed.\nSubsequent to the filing of a Notice of Dissatisfaction, the case was carried to the Exchequer Court of Canada, where the judgment was that the appeal failed and should be dismissed with costs.\nThe appellant is incorporated under the Dominion Companies Act.\nThe sections of the Income War Tax Act having to do with the issues raised are as follows:\u2014\nSection 6 (1):\nIn computing the amount of the profits or gains to be assessed, a deduction shall not be allowed in respect of\n* * *\n(i) any sums charged by any company or organization outside of Canada to a Canadian company, branch or organization, in respect of management fees or services or for the right to use patents, processes or formulae presently known or yet to be discovered, or in connection with the letting or leasing of anything used in Canada, irrespective of whether a price or charge is agreed upon or otherwise; but only if the company or organization to which such sums are payable, or the company in Canada, is controlled directly or indirectly by any company or group of companies or persons within or without Canada, which are affiliated one with the other by the holding of shares or by agreements or otherwise; provided that a portion of any such charges may be allowed as a deduction if the Minister is satisfied that such charges are reasonable for services actually rendered or for the use of anything actually used in Canada.\nSection 6 (2):\nThe Minister may disallow any expense which he in his discretion may determine to be in excess of what is reasonable or normal for the business carried on by the taxpayer, or which was incurred in respect of any transaction or operation which in his opinion has unduly or artificially reduced the income.\nThe Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, provides as follows:\nSection 8:\nIn computing the amount of profits to be assessed, subsections one and two of section six of the Income War Tax Act shall, mutatis mutandis, apply as if enacted in this Act * * *\nThe payments claimed by the appellant as deductible expenses were made pursuant to paragraph (5) of the agreement between the appellant and the Birmingham company and the evidence establishes that the payments were made in fact in accordance with said agreement. Paragraph (5) reads as follows:\nIn consideration of the due performance by Wrights' of their obligations under this Agreement the Canadian Company will pay to Wrights' a commission at the rate of five per centum upon all cash received in respect of the net selling price of all wire ropes both manufactured and sold by the Canadian Company after the date of this Agreement * * *\nThere is no dispute that the amounts paid by the appellant to the Birmingham company were an obligation imposed by a valid contract. The learned trial judge was of the opinion that the assessments were made, in so far as the matters in dispute are concerned, under section 6 (2) and not under section 6 (1) (i). He said that was clearly established by the letter of August 13, 1943, and by the decision of the Minister, dated September 26, 1944.\nThe contention of the appellant is that the Minister should have considered the matter under section 6 (1) (i) of the Act and should have found:\n(1) That the commissions paid by the appellant to the English company were in respect of the matters mentioned in the first part of the subsection and\n(2) That the appellant was not controlled by Wrights' Ropes Limited and (3) That, therefore, as the items claimed as deductions were not paid to a controlling company, they could not be disallowed, but, in fact, should be allowed in full.\nThe learned trial judge, however, found that the evidence was not at all clear that the appellant was not controlled by the English company.\nThere is, however, in the record a consent signed on behalf of both parties whereby they agreed that at all times pertinent to the issues in this appeal, Wrights' Ropes Limited held 49\u00b786 per cent. of the shares and not 50 per cent. of the shares of the appellant.\nThis was an admission binding the respondent; and it seems, therefore, difficult to understand why the judgment of the learned trial judge expresses a doubt as to that fact.\nIt would follow that section 6 (1) (i) does apply to the case under consideration, for the appellant, as a result of the consent so filed by the parties, must be taken not to be controlled directly or indirectly by the English company. It is only when the Canadian company is controlled by the company without Canada that a deduction of the sums charged by the company outside of Canada for \"services\" shall not be allowed as a deduction.\nNor in my view can it be said that, irrespective of the provisions contained in section 6 (1) (i), the Minister may disallow the deduction under section 6 (2).\nIf the case is covered by section 6 (1) (i), with due respect, it can not come under 6 (2); it is already provided for and that is the end of it. I can not see how the Minister can act under section 6 (2) in contravention of what is prescribed under section 6 (1) (i).\nI can not find any good reason for excluding section 6 (1) (i) as the learned trial judge has done and, to my mind, that would be sufficient to allow the appeal, because the sums paid by the appellant to the English company in respect of services were not paid to a company controlling the appellant, and it is of no concern to inquire what services were supplied, how frequently they were supplied or how important they were.\nHowever, the managing director testified that the advice and services were worth the amounts paid and his evidence was not contradicted. But further and in any event, I can not see my way to apply section 6 (2) to the present case.\nThe section says:\nThe Minister may disallow any expense which he in his discretion may determine to be in excess of what is reasonable or normal for the business carried on by the taxpayer, or which was incurred in respect of any transaction or operation which in his opinion has unduly or artificially reduced the income.\nOf course, the discretion must be exercised on proper legal principles. (Pioneer Laundry and Dry Cleaners Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue[2]).\nWhatever may be said about the question whether the record discloses that, in the premises, the Minister exercised or not his discretion, I am distinctly of opinion that section 6 (2) does not apply to the facts herein.\nWhat the Minister may disallow is \"any expense\".\nThe sums claimed as deduction by the appellant are not expenses within the meaning of the section, they were sums paid by the appellant as a condition sine qua non of the agreement between it and the English company. These sums were the price or consideration of the contract and of the due performance by the English company of its obligations under the agreement. No other consideration moving from the Canadian company to the English company was either contained or represented in the agreement. Without them, there would have been no contract at all. It is the essential condition of its very existence. But for the payment so agreed upon and made by the appellant to the English company, there would have been no contract; and but for that contract, the appellant would not have been in business.\nThe effect of the Minister's decision is really to nullify the consideration clause in the agreement and to leave the latter in a modified or amended form to which, of course, the parties never agreed.\nI fail to see where in section 6 (2) the Minister found the power and authority to act as he has done.\nThe sums paid by the appellant were not expenses in the ordinary course of their business, and those are the expenses which are contemplated by section 6 (2).\nHere, the sums which the Minister refused to allow as deductions constitute the very price and the only price paid by the appellant for the contract which they made with the English company; and I am unable to read section 6 (2) as being intended to cover a case such as this.\nBoth therefore for the reason that under 6 (1) (i) the appellant has been proved and indeed admitted not to be controlled by the English company and, as a consequence, the sums paid by the appellant are properly deductible and can not be disallowed, but also because, in any event, section 6 (2) does not apply to the present case, I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs and that the assessment should accordingly be set aside to all intents and purposes; but, in view of the conclusions reached by the other Members of the Court who think that the matter should be referred back to the Minister under the provisions of section 65 (2) of the Act, I will agree with them in the disposition of the present case.\nKerwin J. (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal by Wrights' Canadian Ropes Limited, a company incorporated under the Dominion Companies Act, from a judgment of the Exchequer Court dismissing its appeal from the respondent's affirmation of the appellant's assessments for the years 1940, 1941 and 1942, wherein commissions paid by the appellant to an English company called Wrights' Ropes Limited, Birmingham, were disallowed as deductions from income for those years, except as to the sum of $7,500 in each year.\nThe commissions were paid pursuant to an agreement dated September 12th, 1935, between Wrights' Ropes Limited, Birmingham, (Wrights'), Charles Hirst and Son Ltd. (Hirst's) and the appellant, which agreement was supplemental to an earlier one dated May 19th, 1931. The pertinent terms are, I think, fairly summarized in the appellant's factum and I transcribe them substantially as follows:\u2014\n(a) The English company should not sell wire rope in Western Canada (west of the Ontario-Manitoba boundary).\n(b) Any orders from Western Canada received by the English company to be transmitted by it to the appellant.\n(c) The English company must select and test all wire purchased by the appellant from Hirst's. (d) The English company is to place at the disposal of the appellant, at request, all its technical knowledge and generally advise the appellant on manufacture and marketing.\n(e) In payment for such services and for territory, the appellant is to pay the English company a commission of 5 per cent. on all sales made by it of its manufactured product.\nPursuant thereto the following amounts were paid to Wrights' by the appellant: in 1940, $17,381.94; in 1941, $29,325.85; in 1942, $39,480.91; and these were claimed by the appellant as deductions from income in its returns for those years. On August 13th, 1943, the Inspector of Income Tax at Vancouver notified the appellant that the Minister of National Revenue was about to exercise his discretion under subsection 2 of section 6 and subsection 2 of section 75 of the Income War Tax Act in connection with these payments and invited the appellant to submit written representations for consideration. The appellant in reply forwarded the agreements of 19th May, 1931, and 12th September, 1935.\nOn October 9th, 1943, the Inspector further notified the appellant that it was proposed to recommend to the Minister that commissions paid to Wrights' (called by the Inspector \"the controlling company\") in 1940, 1941 and 1942 be disallowed as deductions except as to the sum of $7,500 in each year. The appellant replied on 21st October, 1943, that it had nothing further to add but on 29th October, 1943, it advised the Inspector that Wrights' did not have the controlling interest in the appellant company but held fifty per cent. of the shares, the other fifty per cent. being held by Hirst's.\nThe Minister by the Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Taxation exercised his discretion in the manner suggested and on 10th May, 1944, notices of assessment were mailed to the appellant, all payments to Wrights' by way of commissions on sales being disallowed as deductions except for the sum of $7,500 in each year.\nThe appellant gave notice of appeal on 29th May, 1944, and on 26th September, 1944, the Minister of National Revenue, acting by the Deputy Minister, affirmed the assessments. On 11th October, 1944, the appellant filed his Notice of Dissatisfaction and, by Reply dated 8th January, 1945, the Minister, again through the Deputy Minister, affirmed the assessments as levied. From that affirmation an appeal was taken to the Exchequer Court.\nA formal admission in writing was filed in that Court, signed by the solicitors for both parties, that Wrights' held 49\u00b786 per cent. of the shares referred to in the letter of October 29th, 1943, and not 50 per cent. as therein stated. It was proved at the trial that there was no relation between Wrights' and Hirst's \"as far as stock interest goes.\" The appellant desired that these two matters be shown in order to avail itself, if possible, of subsection 1, paragraph (i), of section 6 of the Income War Tax Act. The Deputy Judge of the Exchequer Court, Cameron J., decided that it did not apply but that the discretion of the Minister, conferred on him by subsection 2 of section 6, had been properly exercised. These two enactments read as follows:\u2014\n6. In computing the amount of the profits or gains to be assessed, a deduction shall not be allowed in respect of\n(i) any sums charged by any company or organization outside of Canada to a Canadian company, branch or organization, in respect of management fees or services or for the right to use patents, processes or formulae presently known or yet to be discovered, or in connection with the letting or leasing of anything used in Canada, irrespective of whether a price or charge is agreed upon or otherwise; but only if the company or organization to which such sums are payable, or the company in Canada, is controlled directly or indirectly by any company or group of companies or persons within or without Canada, which are affiliated one with the other by the holding of shares or by agreements or otherwise; provided that a portion of any such charges may be allowed as a deduction if the Minister is satisfied that such charges are reasonable for services actually rendered or for the use of anything actually used in Canada;\n2. The Minister may disallow any expense which he in his discretion may determine to be in excess of what is reasonable or normal for the business carried on by the taxpayer, or which was incurred in respect of any transaction or operation which in his opinion has unduly or artificially reduced the income.\nFor the appellant it is argued that subsection 2 is a general provision which is inapplicable because the circumstances bring the case within the special category dealt with in paragraph (i) of subsection 1. Related to the facts of this case that paragraph, it is said, means this:\u2014In computing profits or gains, a deduction is not to be allowed for management fees or services charged by a company outside of Canada to a Canadian company although by the proviso power is given the Minister to allow as a deduction a portion of any such fees or services; however, by virtue of the middle part of the paragraph, introduced by the words \"but only\", the prohibition does not apply at all if direct or indirect control of the Canadian company by the receiving company (outside of Canada) is lacking. It is said that the English company does not control the appellant directly or indirectly since it holds only 49\u00b786 per cent. of the total issued capital stock of fifteen hundred shares. It is pointed out that it is admitted that the payments to the English company were made in pursuance of a valid contract and, therefore, it is argued, while subsection 1, paragraph (i), of section 6 is in negative terms, these payments should be allowed.\nNow, in the first place, the \"sums charged\" shall not be allowed as a deduction if either the receiving company or the paying company is controlled \"by any company or group of companies or persons within or without Canada, which are affiliated one with the other by the holding of shares or by agreements or otherwise.\" The mere fact that Wrights' does not own a majority of the shares of the appellant and that there was no relation between Wrights' and Hirst's \"as far as stock interest goes\" is not sufficient to bring the appellant within the negative words of subsection 1, paragraph (i). Furthermore, it may be noted that the only other shareholders of the appellant are three residents of Canada and in the agreement of May 19th, 1931, at which time the appellant was known as William Cooke and Co. (Canada) Limited (for brevity called \"Cooke's\"), it was recited that \"Wrights' and their nominees hold one-half of the issued share capital in Cooke's, and Hirst's and their nominees hold the other half of such issued capital.\" Because of these additional factors, I agree with the Deputy Judge that it cannot be said definitely that the appellant is not \"controlled directly or indirectly\" by Wrights' within the meaning of the paragraph. In any event, paragraph (i) was already in the Act, having been enacted in 1935, when subsection 2 was passed in 1940. It is true that subsection 2 was enacted in lieu of an earlier subsection 2 but the wording thereof is so different and the powers conferred upon the Minister by the present subsection are so greatly extended that it must be taken as a later expression of the will of Parliament. A comparison of the present wording of subsection 2 given above with the earlier enactment transcribed below, will, I think, make the matter clearer:\u2014\n2. The Minister may disallow as an expense the whole or any portion of any salary, bonus, commission or director's fee which in his opinion is in excess of what is reasonable for the services performed.\nTherefore, by subsection 2 of section 6, Parliament conferred upon the Minister a power which he might exercise even if the appellant had been able to bring itself within paragraph (i), and that power is a purely administrative one. Even if it were held to be of a quasi-judicial nature, the appellant was given a fair opportunity to be heard and to make its representations, and there is nothing to indicate that the discretion was not exercised on proper legal principles. The fact that subsection 3 of section 6 concludes \"The decision of the Minister on any question arising under this subsection shall be final and conclusive\", and that subsection 4 ends with the sentence, \"The determination of the Minister hereunder shall be final and conclusive\", cannot alter the construction of subsection 2, Subsections 3 and 4 deal with entirely different matters and it will be time enough to deal with the effect of the concluding sentences therein when the occasion arises. The payments made to Wrights' fall within the term \"expense\" in subsection 2; if this were not so, the appellant would have difficulty in showing that they were disbursements or expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income.\nIt was argued that since the sum of $7,500 was allowed in each year, although the three years differed widely in volume of sales as reflected in income, it was evident that the discretion had not been properly exercised, but the answer is that the Deputy Minister might very well consider that, whatever the volume, the amount allowed was reasonable or normal for the appellant's business.\nIt was contended that the Minister was not empowered to delegate his duty under section 59 of considering the appeal from the original assessment. In order to appreciate this argument, it is necessary, first of all, to refer to subsection 2 of section 75:\n2. The Minister may make any regulations deemed necessary for carrying this Act into effect, and may thereby authorize the Commissioner of Income Tax to exercise such of the powers conferred by this Act upon the Minister, as may, in the opinion of the Minister, be conveniently exercised by the Commissioner of Income Tax.\nIn accordance therewith the Minister, on August 8th, 1940, signed the following authorization to the Commissioner of Income Tax:\u2014\nTo whom it may concern:\nBe it hereby known that under and by virtue of the provisions of the Income War Tax Act, and particularly section 75 thereof, and the provisions of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, and particularly section 14 thereof, that I do hereby authorize the Commissioner of Income Tax to exercise the powers conferred by the said Acts upon me, as fully and effectively as I could do myself, as I am of the opinion that such powers may be the more conveniently exercised by the said Commissioner of Income Tax.\nDated at Ottawa this 8th day of August, A.D. 1940.\n(sgd) COLIN GIBSON,\nMinister of National Revenue.\nBy section 1 of chapter 24 of the Statutes of 1943-44, authority was given the Governor in Council to appoint a Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Taxation and it was provided that wherever in any statute, regulation, authorization or order there appears the expression \"Commissioner of Income Tax\", the said statute, regulation, authorization or order shall be read and construed as if the expression \"Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Taxation\" were substituted therefor. It is not disputed that Mr. C. Fraser Elliott was the Commissioner of Income Tax and is now the Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Taxation, nor is it denied, if subsection 2 of section 6 applies so as to permit the Minister to exercise the discretion referred to therein, that such discretion could be exercised by the Deputy Minister in making the original assessment. Having received notice of that original assessment, the appellant company objected to the amount thereof and duly served a notice of appeal upon the Minister. It is at this stage that section 59 may be conveniently looked, at:\u2014\n59. Upon receipt of the said notice of appeal, the Minister shall duly consider the same and shall affirm or amend the assessment appealed against and shall notify the appellant of his decision by registered post.\nNow, the discretion having in fact been exercised under subsection 2 of section 6 by the Deputy Minister and the notice of assessment having been given by him on behalf of the Minister, the argument is that section 59, in enacting that \"the Minister shall duly consider\" the appeal, imposed a duty upon him which could not be delegated under the permission given by subsection 2 of section 75 to the Minister to authorize the person who is now the Deputy Minister to exercise \"powers\" conferred by the Act upon the Minister. Counsel for the appellant drew a distinction between powers and what he described as a duty under section 59. While it is true that a duty in the sense of an obligation is imposed upon the Minister by that section, it is none the less true that the powers thereby invested in him to hear the appeal must be included within the powers that he is authorized to delegate by subsection 2 of section 75.\nThe final contention on behalf of the appellant is that in deciding the appeal the Deputy Minister improperly received evidence not known or made available to the appellant and that no opportunity was given it to controvert the facts or statements, the subject matter of that evidence. It is made abundantly clear in the examination for discovery of Mr. Elliott, which was put in at the trial, that in hearing the appeal under section 59 he had before him nothing but what he had already considered in exercising the discretion under subsection 2 of section 6, excepting, of course, matters to which the appellant drew his attention. The material included one or more reports from the Vancouver inspector. In connection with the appeal certain remarks in The King v. Noxzema Chemical Company of Canada, Ltd.[3] maybe reiterated and emphasized. While that case was concerned with the Special War Revenue Act, reference was made to the decision of the Judicial Committee in Pioneer Laundry v. Minister of National Revenue[4], where the Income War Tax Act was in question although in connection with a decision of the Minister as to depreciation under section 5 (a) as it then stood. It was pointed out at page 185 of the Noxzema case (1) that while there was no appeal provided for in terms from such a decision, there was an appeal from the determination as to the amount of taxes to be paid. Similarly, in the present case, while there is no appeal from the exercise of discretion under subsection 2 of section 6, there is an appeal from the assessment to the Deputy Minister and ultimately to the Courts. On my construction of the relevant provisions, the substantial matter in the appeal to the Deputy Minister was the same as what was involved in the exercise of the discretion, and the decision of the House of Lords in Local Government Board v. Arlidge[5] not only justifies but requires a decision that the Deputy Minister is not obliged to produce any report from the Inspector.\nThis is the conclusion at which the local judge arrived in the present case, although he stated that it was not without some doubt, in view of the following extract from the speech of Lord Loreburn in Board of Education v. Rice[6]:\u2014\nThey can obtain information in any way they think best, always giving a fair opportunity to those who are parties in the controversy for correcting or contradicting any relevant statement prejudicial to their view.\nAs the local judge pointed out, the decision in the Rice case[7] was referred to with approval by Davis J. in the Noxzema case (1).\nThe decisions in the Rice (5) and Arlidge5 cases must be read together. The former illustrates the principle that any power conferred upon a Government Department by statute must be exercised in strict conformity with the terms of the statute, and that any action by such department, which is not so exercised, should be treated by a court of law as invalid. Lord Loreburn's speech, including the extract copied above, was referred to in the Arlidge case[8] but all the peers had no difficulty in holding that although the appeal to the local Government Board under the Housing, Town Planning, etc., Act, 1909, required the Board to act judicially, there was no obligation upon it to produce a report made to it by one of its inspectors. This is particularly applicable in the present case when, as I have already indicated, the appeal to the Deputy Minister really involved the same matter as had come before him when exercising the discretion conferred by subsection 2 of section 6. This disposes of the last contention advanced on behalf of the appellant.\nThe discretion was exercised not only in connection with income tax but also excess profits tax, as section 8 of The Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, provides:\u2014\n8. In computing the amount of profits to be assessed, subsections one and two of section six of the Income War Tax Act shall, mutatis mutandis, apply as if enacted in this Act and no deduction shall be allowed in respect of the following:\n(a) the tax payable under this Act in respect of any taxation period;\n(b) any expense which the Minister in his discretion may determine to be in excess of what is reasonable and normal for the business carried on by the taxpayer, or which was incurred in respect of any transaction or operation which in his opinion has unduly or artificially reduced the amount of profits.\nBy virtue of section 14 of that Act, subsection 2 of section 75 of the Income War Tax Act applies, mutatis mutandis, to matters arising under the provisions of the former. What has been said with reference to the income tax assessment applies equally to the excess profits tax assessment.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nHudson J.\u2014The question for decision in this appeal is whether or not certain sums of money paid out of earnings by the appellant company could properly be disallowed by the Minister under section 6 (2) of the Income War Tax Act and section 8 of The Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940. The sections read as follows:\nSec. 6 (2):\nThe Minister may disallow any expense which he in his discretion may determine to be in excess of what is reasonable or normal for the business carried on by the taxpayer, or which was incurred in respect of any transaction or operation which in his opinion has unduly or artificially reduced the income.\nSec. 8:\nIn computing the amount of profits to be assessed, subsections one and two of section six of the Income War Tax Act shall, mutatis mutandis, apply as if enacted in this Act and no deduction shall be allowed in respect of the following:\n* * *\n(b) any expense Which the Minister in his discretion may determine to be in excess of what is reasonable and normal for the business carried on by the taxpayer, or which was incurred in respect of any transaction or operation which in his opinion has unduly or artificially reduced the amount of profits.\nThe facts in evidence are set forth in the judgment of the Court below.\nIt appears that the payments in question were all made in fulfilment of legal obligations arising under the terms of agreements made by the appellant with two other companies some years prior to the taxation years in question. The evidence does not indicate any inadequacy in consideration for the payments made, nor is there any suggestion of fraud.\nThe Minister professed to act under the provisions of the above sections 6 (2) and 8, but gives no reasons for his decision.\nThe Court is warranted in interfering with the exercise of the Minister's discretion if such discretion has not been exercised in accordance with \"sound and fundamental principles\": see Pioneer Laundry and Dry Cleaners Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue[9]; The King v. Noxzema Chemical Co. of Canada Ltd.[10].\nOn the facts before us it would appear that the taxes in question were imposed in respect of moneys received by the appellant but which it was in effect legally bound to pay to third parties. Such payments could not be considered as part of the \"net profit or gain\" of the appellant under section 3 of the Income War Tax Act, and there should be special reasons to support such a departure from this general rule as appears here.\nThe ruling of the Minister does not disclose any reasons. No doubt he had what appeared to him perfectly sound reasons for his decision, but none are before us. It is not for the Court to weigh the reasons but we are entitled to know what they are, so that we may decide whether or not they are based on sound and fundamental principles.\nThe Minister also had before him a report from the local Inspector of Taxation but that report's contents is not in evidence. It may have had an important bearing on his decision. It should have been before the Court. Section 63 (g) of the Act provides:\nProceedings in Exchequer Court.\n63. Within two months from the date of the mailing of the said reply, the Minister shall cause to be transmitted to the registrar of the Exchequer Court of Canada, to be filed in the said Court, typewritten copies of the following documents:\n* * *\n(g) All other documents and papers relative to the assessment under appeal.\nIt was strongly contended on behalf of the appellant that this document should have been before the Court on the appeal, so that evidence could be given on its behalf in rebuttal to any statements and such answers to arguments advanced which it thought advisable.\nIt was argued on behalf of the Minister that there was no duty on the part of the Minister to produce a document such as this, which was in its nature confidential.\nThere are many good reasons for not compelling the production of such report. These reasons are set forth in the various opinions of the judges in England in the case of Local Government Board v. Arlidge[11], but these, I think, are not applicable to the case here and, in any event, as the report should be before the Court under the provision of section 63 (g) of our Act, the appellant would have a right to see it and make such reply as it deems advisable. It was also contended by the appellant that the provisions of section 6 (1) (i) and section 6 (2), in so far as they were applicable to the case at bar, were mutually exclusive. The Minister proceeded under section 6 (2) and I am satisfied that in the present case section 6 (1) (i) does not in any way exclude the exercise of discretion under the former section.\nThe appellant also contended that the Minister had no power to delegate his authority to decide this matter, but that, I think, is disposed of by section 75 (2) of the Act.\nThe matter should be referred back to the Minister for reconsideration under the provisions of section 65 (2) of the Act. The appellant should have the costs of this appeal.\nKellock J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court, Cameron J., dated 3rd of August, 1945, dismissing an appeal by the appellant from the decision of the Minister of National Revenue which in turn affirmed an assessment made against the appellant for income and excess profits taxes for the years 1940, 1941 and 1942. In those years commissions of $17,381.94, $29,325.85 and $39,480.91, respectively, were paid by the appellant to an English company, Wrights' Ropes Limited, upon the terms of an agreement in writing between them. In lieu of these amounts, a uniform sum of $7,500 was allowed in respect of each year as an expense in determining the taxable income or profits of the appellant and the excess over that amount was disallowed. Before the assessments were made, all apparently being made at the same time, the local Inspector of Income Tax at Vancouver wrote the appellant on the 13th of August, 1943, saying that \"by virtue of the powers vested in the Minister under subsection 2 of section 6 and subsection 2 of section 75 of the Income War Tax Act, discretion is about to be exercised\" in connection with the \"commission on sale of wire rope manufactured, paid to Wrights' Ropes Limited.\" The appellant was invited to submit written representations for consideration. Following this, the appellant sent to the local Inspector copies of two agreements dated respectively May 19, 1931, and September 12, 1935, under the latter of which the commissions had been paid. On the 9th of October, 1943, the local Inspector advised the appellant that he proposed to recommend to the Minister the action ultimately adopted and invited further representations, either verbal or written, to be made before the 15th of October. To this letter the appellant replied that it had nothing further to add, but by letter of the 29th of October the appellant referred to the letter of October 9th in which the Inspector had referred to the commissions as having been paid to the \"controlling\" company. In answer the appellant stated that this was not a correct statement, as the English company did not have a controlling interest in the appellant but held 50 per cent. of the shares, the other 50 per cent. being held by another English company, also party to the agreements, namely, Charles Hirst & Sons Limited. It now appears that the real situation with regard to the ownership of shares in the appellant company is that Wrights' Ropes Limited held 49\u00b786 per cent. and not 50 per cent.\nIt is not necessary to refer with particularity to the course of proceedings followed subsequent to the assessments. The contentions of the appellant are in substance, (1) that sec. 6 (1) (i) governs and that, as the English company, Wrights' Ropes Limited, hereinafter referred to as Wrights', does not control the appellant, the clause does not warrant any disallowance; (2) that subsection 2 of sec. 6 is not applicable as the two provisions are mutually exclusive; (3) whether the Minister acted under subsection (1) (i) or subsection 2, he was performing a quasi-judicial function and the discretion was not properly exercised; (4) that the Minister acted upon evidence not known or made available to the appellant and which the appellant had no opportunity of controverting; and (5) that section 75 (2) authorizes the Minister to delegate \"powers,\" whereas the function falling upon the Minister under section 6 (2) was a \"duty\" and therefore not within the power of delegation.\nDealing with the first contention, my opinion is that subsection (1) (i) of section 6 does not apply. Under the agreement of 12th of September, 1935, which displaced the earlier agreement except as to rights already accrued under that agreement, the appellant became obligated to pay to Wrights' a commission of 5 per cent. upon its cash receipts from the sale of wire ropes in consideration \"of the due performance by Wrights' of their obligations\" under the agreement. Wrights' was a manufacturer of wire ropes and prior to the date of the first agreement was engaged in selling them in Western Canada. By the first agreement, Wrights' transferred this business to the appellant and agreed to stay out of the territory and to refer all enquiries and orders to the appellant. Under the later agreement, which was entered into after the business had been transferred to the appellant, Wrights' agreed (a) not to supply for sale or sell any wire ropes in Western Canada, (b) to refer all enquiries or orders from Western Canada to the appellant, (c) with respect to any enquiry for goods which the appellant should be unable or unwilling to fill and which could be manufactured by Wrights', the appellant was to act as agent for Wrights' in connection with such business and Wrights' was to pay the latter a commission, (d) Wrights' was to pay the appellant a commission in respect of sales which might be made by a former agent of Wrights' out of stocks still remaining in the hands of that agent, (e) Wrights' were to act as technical advisors of the appellant, (f) to supply the appellant with information, and (g) to supervise the supply by the Hirst Company to the appellant of goods ordered by the appellant from Hirst's. These terms appear to be identical with those contained in the first agreement.\nAccordingly, the sums payable by the appellant to Wrights' were not merely paid \"in respect of management fees or services\" and it is not shown and no doubt could not be shown how much of the sums were so paid. There is nothing in either agreement as to rights to use patented processes or formulae or in connection with the letting or leasing of anything from the one company to the other, so that it could not be argued that the last part of the subsection could have any application. Accordingly, in my opinion, for the reasons given, the subsection has no application at all and it is not necessary to consider the question of control of the appellant company. It is apparent from the correspondence already referred to and from the formal decision of the Minister on the appeal to him from the assessments, that the Minister was of the same view and did not purport to act under the provisions of subsection (1) (i) but expressly under subsection 2.\nIt will be convenient at this point to consider the appellant's fourth contention. It was shown in evidence that in reaching his decision, the Minister, or rather the Deputy Minister acting for him, had before him a report of the local Inspector which was not made known to the appellant. Counsel for the respondent objected in the course of the proceedings in the Exchequer Court to its production and it was not produced. The decision of the Minister states that he has duly considered the facts as set forth in the Notice of Appeal \"and matters thereto related.\" The document also states that \"notice of such decision is hereby given pursuant to Section 59 of the Act and is based on the facts presently before the Minister.\"\nBefore us the respondent contended that the decision of the House of Lords in Local Government Board v. Arlidge[12] supported the stand taken and that the appellant was not entitled to see the report.\nIn my opinion, the answer to this contention is to be found in the Income War Tax Act itself. The Act by sec. 60 provides for an appeal to the Exchequer Court of Canada and sec. 63 imposes upon the Minister the obligation of causing to be transmitted to the registrar of the Court for filing in that Court a number of documents including \"all other documents and papers relative to the assessment under appeal\" (clause g). I know of no statutory provision derogating from the imperative terms of this section. The Arlidge case (1) involved quite different statutory provisions and, when the reasons for judgment in that case are examined, their relevancy to the legislation under consideration in the case at bar, in my opinion, disappears. In Arlidge's case (1), it was decided, among other things, that a report made by an Inspector of the Local Government Board to that Board upon a public inquiry held by him into the matter there in question, namely, the refusal of a local authority to determine a previous order made by it for the closing of a dwelling house of the respondent's, need not be produced to the respondent in connection with his appeal to the Board from that refusal. Before the legislation there in question, such an appeal had been to quarter sessions but a change was made by the Act of 1909 which provided that the appeal should go to the Board. The Act also provided that in the case of an appeal, the procedure as to everything, including costs, was to be such as the Board might by its rules determine, provided that the rules should provide that the Board should not dismiss any appeal without having first held a public local inquiry.\nPrior to this legislation, the Board was already in existence as a Department of State, and the evidence established that the holding of local inquiries by the Board was directed under many other statutes and that it had always been the practice of the Board to treat the reports of their Inspectors on such inquiries as confidential documents for their own use. The House of Lords held that Parliament in enacting the 1909 legislation must have intended that the existing procedure of the Board should continue to be followed. Lord Haldane at p. 132 said:\nSuch a body as the Local Government Board has the duty of enforcing obligations on the individual which are imposed in the interests of the community. Its character is that of an organization with executive functions. In this it resembles other great departments of the State. When, therefore, Parliament entrusts it with judicial duties, Parliament must be taken, in the absence of any declaration to the contrary, to have intended it to follow the procedure which is its own, and is necessary if it is to be capable of doing its work efficiently.\nLord Moulton at p. 150 said:\nParliament has wisely laid down certain rules to be observed in the performance of its functions in these matters, and those rules must be observed because they are imposed by statute, and for no other reason, and whether they give much or little opportunity for what I may call quasi-litigious procedure depends solely on what Parliament has thought right. These rules are beyond the criticism of the Courts, and it is not their business to add to or to take away from them, or even to discuss whether in the opinion of the individual members of the Court they are adequate or not.\nLord Parmoor at p. 143 said:\nIt was well known in 1909 that the Local Government Board did not in ordinary cases publish the reports of inspectors before whom local enquiries were held. Unless an opposite intention is declared, or can be inferred, a statutory form of procedure should be construed so as to conform with prevailing practice. However, he also said at p. 144:\nIf the report of the inspector could be regarded as in the nature of evidence tendered either by the local authority or the owner of the premises, there would be a strong reason for publicity. In my opinion it is nothing of the kind, and is simply a step in the statutory procedure for enabling an administrative body, such as the Local Government Board, to hear effectively an appeal against the order of the local authority.\nIn the case at bar, the Statute by section 63 (g) has, in my view, made the report of the local Inspector here in question, evidence. Arlidge's case[13], therefore, is an authority in favour of the appellant rather than in favour of the respondent.\nIn Board of Education v. Rice[14], Lord Loreburn at p. 182 said:\nComparatively recent statutes have extended, if they have not originated, the practice of imposing upon departments or officers of State the duty of deciding or determining questions of various kinds. In the present instance, as in many others, what comes for determination is sometimes a matter to be settled by discretion, involving no law. It will, I suppose, usually be of an administrative kind; but sometimes it will involve matter of law as well as matter of fact, or even depend upon matter of law alone. In such cases the Board of Education will have to ascertain the law and also to ascertain the facts. I need not add that in doing either they must act in good faith and fairly listen to both sides, for that is a duty lying upon every one who decides anything. But I do not think they are bound to treat such a question as though it were a trial. They have no power to administer an oath, and need not examine witnesses. They can obtain information in any way they think best, always giving a fair opportunity to those who are parties in the controversy for correcting or contradicting any relevant statement prejudical to their view.\nIn The King v. Noxzema Chemical Company of Canada Ltd.[15], Davis J. said at p. 180:\nIf, on the other hand, the function of the Minister under the section may be said to be of a quasi-judicial nature, even then all that was necessary was that the taxpayer be given a fair opportunity to be heard in the controversy; and to correct or to contradict any relevant statement prejudicial to its interests.\nIt is admitted by the respondent that the Minister, or his Deputy, was acting in the case of the appellant in a quasi-judicial character. In my opinion, therefore, the appellant was entitled to have produced to him before the assessments were made, the report in question and to have an opportunity to meet whatever it contained. It could not be contended it was not a document \"relative\" to the assessment under appeal. Not having been accorded this right, I think the appeal must be allowed and the assessments set aside on this ground alone and the case be sent back for further consideration to the court below were nothing more involved in the appeal.\nComing to the appellant's third contention, this involves the question of the proper construction of subsection 2 of sec. 6. It reads as follows:\nThe Minister may disallow any expense which he in his discretion may determine (to be in excess of what is reasonable or normal for the business carried on by the taxpayer, or which was incurred in respect of any transaction or operation which in his opinion has unduly or artificially reduced the income.\nSection 8 (b) of The Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, is virtually in the same terms. As already mentioned, it is not disputed, but rather expressly admitted, by the respondent that the duty cast upon the Minister under this provision is of a quasi-judicial nature. In his factum counsel for the respondent says:\nIn deciding the appeal, the Court must determine that the assessment was made in accordance with the law. To do this, it must be ascertained that the assessment was issued in compliance with all the statutory provisions of the two Acts and that no general rules of law outside the statutes have been contravened. The only statutory requirements in question are those above quoted [i.e. Sec. 6 (2) and Sec. 8 (b)], and the only extra statutory rules which must be considered are those governing the exercise of the discretion of the Minister of National Revenue conferred upon him by Sec. 6 (2) of the Income War Tax Act and Sec. 8 (b) of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940. It is submitted that if the statutory requirements and the rules of law regarding the exercise of ministerial discretion have been properly observed throughout, there can be no alternative but to hold that, since the discretion was properly exercised, it cannot be interfered with and that the assessment was properly levied.\nThe factum further states as follows:\nThat this is one of the cardinal rules of the proper exercise of discretion is indicated by Lord Thankerton, L.C., in the judgment of the Privy Council in Pioneer Laundry and Dry Cleaners Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue[16], where he says \"That involved, in my opinion, an administrative duty of a quasi-judicial character\u2014a discretion to be exercised on proper legal principles\".\nThe respondent contends that the discretion was exercised by the Minister in accordance with the requirements so stated and was not \"arbitrary, vague or fanciful, but legal and regular\". The language quoted is to be found in the judgment of Lord Halsbury in Sharp v. Wakefield[17], to which I shall later refer.\nIn the Pioneer Laundry case[18] a claim for depreciation in connection with certain machinery of the taxpayer had been disallowed on the ground that the machinery had been the subject of an allowance for depreciation of approximately 100 per cent. while in the hands of a former owner. In the view of the Department on the facts there present, although the former owner and the then owner were separate legal entities, there had been no actual change in ownership of the machinery, and therefore nothing could be allowed. In his judgment in this Court, which was approved by the Privy Council, Davis J. at p. 4 referred to the opening words of the definition of \"income\" in sec. 3, viz., the annual \"net\" profit or gain and to sections 5 (a) and 6 (b) of the Income War Tax Act as they then stood. Section 5 provided that:\nIncome as hereinbefore defined shall for the purposes of this Act be subject to the following exemptions and deductions:\u2014\n(a) Such reasonable amount as the Minister in his discretion may allow for depreciation, * * *\nSection 6 (b), then as now, provided that in computing the amount of the profits or gains to be assessed, a deduction should not be allowed in respect of any depreciation, depletion or obsolescence except as otherwise provided by the Act. Davis J. held that under these provisions the taxpayer was entitled, in the language of the statute, to an exemption or deduction in \"such reasonable amount as the Minister in his discretion may allow for depreciation\", which involved, in his opinion, \"an administrative duty of a quasi-judicial character\u2014a discretion to be exercised on proper legal principles.\" He referred to sec. 60 which gives a right of appeal, and stated that the exercise of the Minister's discretion would not be interfered with unless it was \"manifestly against sound and fundamental principles.\" At p. 6 he said:\nIf the Court is of the opinion that in a given case the Minister or his Commissioner has, however unintentionally, failed to apply what the Court regards as fundamental principles, the Court ought not to hesitate to interfere; and at p. 8:\nThe Income War Tax Act gives a right of appeal from the Minister's decisions and while there is no statutory limitation upon the appellate jurisdiction, normally the Court would not interfere with the exercise of a discretion by the Minister except on grounds of law.\nHe held that in that case, the Minister had exercised his discretion upon wrong principles of law.\nIn the Privy Council[19], Lord Thankerton at p. 136 said:\nThe taxpayer has a statutory right to an allowance in respect of depreciation during the accounting year on which the assessment in dispute is based. The Minister has a duty to fix a reasonable amount in respect of that allowance and, so far from the decision of the Minister being purely administrative and final, a right of appeal is conferred on a dissatisfied taxpayer; but it is equally clear that the Court would not interfere with the decision unless\u2014as Davis J. states\u2014\"it was manifestly against sound and fundamental principles.\"\nUnder the legislation in question in the Pioneer case, therefore, it was held that, (1) the taxpayer was given a right to an allowance in respect of depreciation, and (2) a duty was imposed upon the Minister to fix a reasonable amount therefor, (3) such duty was not purely administrative, but required the Minister to give effect to the evidence before him in accordance with relevant legal principles.\nIn the case at bar the appellant, by sec. 6 (a), is given a statutory right to have deducted in the computation of its \"net\" profits or gains, \"expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended\" for the purpose of earning those profits or gains. In order that the Minister might disallow any excess over what was reasonable or normal for the appellant's business, he first had to determine what was reasonable or normal. The legislation here applicable, therefore, is in principle the same as that in question in the case just cited. In my opinion, therefore, the respondent was well advised in taking the view of the law set out in his factum to which I have referred.\nIn Sharp v. Wakefield[20], Lord Halsbury said:\n\"Discretion\" means, when it is said that something is to be done within the discretion of the authorities, that that something is to be done according to the rules of reason and justice, not according to private opinion: Rooke's case[21]; according to law, and not humour. It is to be, not arbitrary, vague, and fanciful, but legal and regular. One of the facts before the Minister in exercising the duty cast upon him by the Statute was the agreement under which the commissions were paid. It was not open to the Minister to ignore the agreement nor its legal consequences. Accordingly, upon what evidence or upon what ground could he refuse to give effect to it, assuming its bona fides? The Statute does not say that the Minister may disallow the excess over what is reasonable or normal for the \"class\" of business carried on by the taxpayer. When the Statute means that, it says so; sec. 23B. It is not shown that the appellant had ever paid any other commissions than those to Wrights' Ropes Limited and there is, therefore, no standard by which the commissions here in question can be shown to have been abnormal with respect to its business. Accordingly, the disallowance can only have been based on unreasonableness. The formal decision of the Minister throws no light as to the grounds upon which it was rested. The document reads:\nThe Honourable the Minister of National Revenue having duly considered the facts as set forth in the Notice of Appeal, and matters thereto related and, having exercised his discretion under the provisions of Subsection 2 of Section 6 of the Income War Tax Act, hereby affirms the said assessment wherein $9,881.94 of the commission of $17,381.94 in the year 1940, $21,825.85 of the commission of $29,325.85 in 1941 and $31,980.91 of the commission of $39,480.91 in 1942 paid to Wrights' Ropes Limited of Birmingham were disallowed as expenses or deductions for the purposes of the said Act. Therefore on these and related grounds and by reason of other provisions of the Income War Tax Act and Excess Profits Tax Act said Assessments are affirmed.\nNOTICE of such decision is hereby given pursuant to Section 59 of the Act and is based on the facts presently before the Minister.\nOne receives no help in this regard from a perusal of the respondent's factum nor the argument of counsel. It is merely contended that the discretion was properly exercised in accordance with the relevant authorities but the actual principle applied is not stated nor in any way indicated. There is nothing shown upon which anyone can say that there is any unreasonableness attaching to the commissions or to the agreement to pay them. Want of bona fides is not suggested. Nor is it suggested that the issued shares of the appellant were at the time of the first agreement all in the hands of Wrights' and the Hirst Company or their nominees and that these companies caused the appellant to make an improvident bargain for their own purposes. Moreover, any such suggestion is negatived by the evidence. In cross-examination of a witness for the appellant, the witness said that the technical information supplied the appellant by Wrights' was, in the opinion of the witness, by itself commensurate in value with the commissions paid. No other evidence was adduced on the point. This same witness was also asked: \"This $7,500, is that the amount allowed to you by the Munitions and Supply in connection with your contracts?\" The answer was: \"I will have to refer to my file on that question.\" Counsel for the respondent must have been instructed with regard to the subject-matter of this question, but it was not followed up or developed in any way and there is no other evidence with regard to it. The Court is left to wonder whether something of this nature entered into the making of the assessments. They cannot be supported, however, on a mere suggestion of this kind. The ground of decision, therefore, is unexplained and the decision itself is made to appear as a purely arbitrary one.\nIf the present were a case of disallowance of expenses for advertising or for travelling or of similar items within the control of the taxpayer, the grounds of disallowance might more readily suggest themselves. The present case is not of that sort and there is nothing which displaces the agreement and the legal consequences which flow from it. Therefore, where there is nothing before the Court which enables it to see any ground or principle upon which the decision appealed from can be supported, but on the contrary where the evidence substantiates the deduction claimed and therefore the decision appears as a purely arbitrary one, which the Statute does not permit, the appellant, in my opinion, has met the onus resting upon it of showing that the exercise of discretion involved has been \"manifestly against sound and fundamental principles\" or based upon \"wrong principles of law.\" I do not think the appellant is in the position where his appeal must fail because, not knowing the ground of decision, he is unable to point to its error. I further think it cannot be said that the Statute contemplates that an appeal under its provisions is to be rendered abortive by the mere silence of the decision itself as to the grounds upon which it proceeds. Section 60 (2) to my mind indicates the contrary, as it calls upon an appellant to submit with his notice of dissatisfaction a statement containing the \"further\" reasons which he intends to urge before the Exchequer Court in support of his appeal; \"further\" in the sense of \"additional\" reasons to those urged before the Minister. No appellant is in a position to give reasons for an appeal against an unfavourable decision without knowing the ground of such decision. I think the Statute recognizes this and when by sec. 59 the Minister is required to notify the appellant of his \"decision\", by registered post, reasons are intended to be given. When they are not given, I think, in such a case as the present at least, the result is not that the Court must assume something quite contrary to the evidence submitted to it.\nIt may be that the report of the local inspector discloses ground for the decision arrived at, but at the moment there are no means of knowing this. I think, therefore, consistently with the authorities to which I have referred, it is the duty of the Court to refer the case back to the Minister under the provisions of sec. 65 (2).\nI have not referred to the provisions of The Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, other than sec. 8 (b). By sec. 14, sections 40 to 87 of the Income War Tax Act are made applicable to excess profits tax. By sec. 2 (f) of the former Act \"profits\" in the case of a corporation are defined as the amount of net taxable income as determined under the provisions of the latter Act.\nAs to the contention that section 75 (2) of the Income War Tax Act does not authorize the delegation to the Deputy Minister of the duty imposed upon the Minister by sec. 6 (2), I cannot agree. A power may well include a duty. See Murray's New English Dictionary, p. 1213. In the context of sec. 75 (2) I think it is so included.\nI would allow the appeal and remit the case back as already stated.\nEstey J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment in the Exchequer Court confirming a decision of the Deputy Minister of National Revenue whereby he disallowed the greater part of three items claimed as deductible expenses. The appellant filed its income tax returns for the years 1940, 1941 and 1942, and included for the respective years as deductible expenses:\nCommission on sales of wire rope manufactured. $17,381.94\nCommission on sales of wire rope manufactured 29,325.85\nCommission on sales of wire rope manufacturers 39,480.91\nThe Deputy Minister of National Revenue, delegated by the Minister, as provided by section 75 (2), disallowed all these items except $7,500 in each year. This he did by virtue of the authority vested in him under section 6 (2) of the Act. This section reads as follows:\n6 (2).\nThe Minister may disallow any expense which he in his discretion may determine to be in excess of what is reasonable or normal for the business carried on by the taxpayer, or which was incurred in respect of any transaction or operation which in his opinion has unduly or artificially reduced the income.\nThe section is restricted in its application to items of expense, and in the exercise of his discretion the Minister, or Deputy Minister, as in this case, is required to determine whether the amount claimed as a deductible expense is \"in excess of what is reasonable or normal for the business carried on by the taxpayer, or which was incurred in respect of any transaction or operation which in his opinion has unduly or artificially reduced the income\". It is not an amount which is reasonable or normal in respect of business generally, but in respect of the business of that particular taxpayer.\nThe discretion to be here exercised is a judicial discretion similar to that under the then section 5 (b) which Davis J. described as \"an administrative duty of a quasi-judicial character\u2014a discretion to be exercised on proper legal principles.\" (Pioneer Laundry and Dry Cleaners Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue[22]). This statement was adopted by Lord Thankerton in the judgment of the Privy Council in Pioneer Laundry and Dry Cleaners Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue[23].\nOnce such a discretion is properly exercised there is no appeal, but the Courts have consistently exercised the right to determine in a given case whether the discretion has in fact been exercised within proper limits and upon proper grounds, or in other words, to determine if the discretion has been exercised as contemplated by the terms of the statute.\nLord Esher, in The Queen v. The Vestry of St. Pancras[24]:\nIf people who have to exercise a public duty by exercising their discretion take into account matters which the Courts consider not to be proper for the guidance of their discretion, then in the eye of the law they have not exercised their discretion.\nLord Thankerton in Pioneer Laundry and Dry Cleaners Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue[25]:\nBut it is equally clear that the Court would not interfere with the decision unless\u2014as Davis J. states\u2014\"it was manifestly against sound and fundamental principles.\"\nIn the latter case, in the exercise of a discretion irrelevant facts were accepted and acted upon; as a result the assessment was set aside.\nCockburn, C.J., in The Queen v. Adamson[26]:\nIf I could see my way to the conclusion that the magistrates had considered this evidence and given a decision upon it, I should certainly say that the Court could not act upon the matter further, or send the case back to the magistrates; but the Solicitor General has called our attention to evidence of such a description that I cannot resist the conclusion that the magistrates must have acted upon a consideration of something extraneous and extra-judicial which ought not to have affected their decision, and which, it seems to me, was the same as declining jurisdiction.\nThe appellant had its head office in the City of Vancouver. On the 13th of August, 1943, Mr. Norman Lee, Inspector of Income Tax at Vancouver, advised the appellant that:\nBy virtue of the powers vested in the Minister under Subsection 2 of Section 6 and Subsection 2 of Section 75 of the Income War Tax Act, discretion is about to be exercised in the following matters, which appear to be in excess of what is reasonable for the business * * *\nUnder date of September 8th, 1943, the appellant replied, enclosing copies of the agreements dated May 19th, 1931, and September 12th, 1935, under the terms of which these payments had been made in each of the respective years to Wrights' Ropes Limited, but did not otherwise attempt to justify the amounts. Under date of October 9th, 1943, Mr. Norman Lee advised the appellant that it was proposed to recommend to the Minister that all the foregoing items except $7,500 for each year be disallowed. He again invited the appellant to submit representations either orally or in writing by the 15th October. On the 21st of October the appellant replied that they had nothing to add to their favour of September 8th.\nThe manager of the appellant company summarized the relevant provisions of these two agreements as follows:\nWrights' Ropes, Birmingham, have agreed not to market any of their products in the district west of a line being the boundary between the provinces of Manitoba and Ontario * * * they place at our disposal their accumulated technical experience, extending over the past 170 years, in the design and manufacture of wire rope, the design, manufacture and installation of wire rope machinery, and such other information as is necessary and desirable in the successful conduct of the business.\nThe agreements provide:\nIn consideration of the due performance by Wrights' of their obligations under this Agreement the Canadian Company will pay to Wrights' a commission at the rate of five per centum upon all cash received in respect of the net selling price of all wire ropes both manufactured and sold by the Canadian Company after the date of this Agreement.\nIn this paragraph Wrights' is Wrights' Ropes Limited of Birmingham, England, and the Canadian Company is the appellant.\nThe Deputy Minister, when exercising his discretion with respect to these three items, had only the income tax returns with the three items appearing as above set out, the copy of the agreements above mentioned, and the report from his Inspector of Taxation at Vancouver, Mr. Norman Lee. With this information he reduced each of the said three items to $7,500 by exercising the authority vested in him by section 6 (2) of the Act.\nThe Inspector's Report was not produced. Without a knowledge of its contents it is impossible to determine its validity as a basis for the exercise of the discretion here provided for. Apart from this report, which will be more particularly discussed hereafter, there would appear to be no facts contained either in the income tax returns or in the agreements which would provide a basis for the determination of what would be a reasonable or normal expense in the business carried on by the taxpayer, or that this expense was incurred in respect of any transaction or operation which would unduly or artificially reduce the income. Yet it is the determination of these questions which the statute specif\u00eccially places upon the Minister. It is the relation of this item of expense to the business of the taxpayer, or the transaction or operation mentioned, that he is called upon to exercise his discretion. It is true that the income tax returns contain many figures with reference to the business of the appellant, and show with respect to the items on which the five per cent. was computed a very substantial increase during the three years. This latter the appellant pressed as an indication that the discretion had not here been exercised judicially. That would not of necessity follow. The greater difficulty is that the facts here disclosed in the returns filed and the agreements do not provide a basis upon which a discretionary determination can be made that the items are excessive within the terms of section 6 (2).\nThe Court, sitting in appeal, is not concerned with the amount as fixed but with the basis upon which the decision fixing that amount is determined. Upon principle it would seem that to act upon insufficient facts or information should in the result be the same as acting upon improper facts as in Pioneer Laundry and Dry Cleaners Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue[27]. The information contained in the income tax returns and the provisions of the agreements did not, in my opinion, place before the Minister or the Deputy Minister facts or information which enabled him to exercise the discretion contemplated by this section.\nThen with respect to the report from Mr. Norman Lee, the Inspector of Income Tax at Vancouver, it is admitted that this included representations made to him by the appellant and that these were before the Deputy Minister when he exercised his discretion under section 6 (2). As to the contents of this report the Deputy Minister deposed as follows:\nMr. Bray: I am not asking for production now of the representations to which you refer as having been made to you, but I think they should be here at the trial the day after to-morrow. Mr. Forsyth: Yes, the representation that you made to us.\nMr. Bray: I know what they are, but I am asking that they be here.\nBy Mr. Forsyth:\n26. Q. They were considered by you?\u2014A. I think so.\nBy Mr. Bray:\n27. Q. I notice you answered Mr. Forsyth's query with \"I think so\". Do you know, Mr. Elliott?\u2014A. As I said before, all these facts are reported from the Vancouver offices; and to answer the question whether this or that document was considered I would have to thumb through the whole file. I do know thai all the facts pertaining to this were transmitted from Vancouver to Ottawa, among which were representations from the taxpayer as expressed through the medium of Mr. Lee.\nMr. Bray's admission, as counsel for the appellant, is that he knows what the representations are and no doubt Mr. Lee reported the representations fairly and accurately as he understood them, but there is much to be said for Mr. Bray's contention that he should see them. It is well known that, however careful and conscientious one may be in recording statements, errors will creep in Furthermore, one reading a report may place quite a different interpretation thereon from that which its author intended. It might well be, therefore, that after reading the report counsel for the appellant would have desired to make some explanation, supplement the facts or make submissions with respect thereto. It appears that without that report, which may have been important, it cannot be said that the appellant had the opportunity \"to correct or to contradict any relevant statement prejudicial to its interests\". Davis J. in The King v. Noxzema Chemical Co. of Canada Ltd.[28]:\nIf, on the other hand, the function of the Minister under the section may be said to be of a quasi-judicial nature, even then all that was necessary was that the taxpayer be given a fair opportunity to be heard in the controversy; and to correct or to contradict any relevant statement prejudicial to its interests.\nLord Loreburn in Board of Education v. Rice[29]:\nThey can obtain information in any way they think best, always giving a fair opportunity to those who are parties in the controversy for correcting or contradicting any relevant statement prejudicial to their view. * * * But if the Court is satisfied either that the Board have not acted judicially in the way I have described, or have not determined the question which they are required by the Act to determine, then there is a remedy by mandamus and certiorari. The respondent takes the position that this communication between the officials of the Department is privileged and that there is no obligation to produce it. In this regard reliance is had upon the established rule that such documents are in general privileged. They are so privileged under the rules and practice of Parliament, but in this particular instance Parliament has directed by section 63 (g) that this document when \"relative to the assessment under appeal\" shall be filed in the Exchequer Court. This report was before the Deputy Minister and it contained representations made by the appellant. What these were and whether material or proper to be taken into account cannot now be determined, but, as intimated above, apart from the document it would appear that no basis existed for the exercise of the discretion called for in section 6 (2). In any event, when the Deputy Minister admits that the report contained representations from the taxpayer and that it was considered, it then becomes \"relative to the assessment\" and should have been filed as required by section 63 (g).\nThe contention of the appellant that the Deputy Minister acted under section 6 (1) (i) and not under 6 (2) is not well founded. The correspondence and the decision of the Minister specificially stated that the disallowance was made under section 6 (2). There are possibly items under the terms of the agreements which might be included under some of the headings in section 6 (1) (i), but not all of them. One in particular, a payment in consideration of Wrights' Ropes Ltd. of Birmingham not marketing their products in Western Canada, is not included, and, as there is no information upon which the amounts may be allocated to the respective headings in the agreements, it is quite obvious why the Deputy Minister did not deal with this matter under section 6 (1) (i).\nMoreover, under 6 (1) (i) the deduction shall not be allowed if \"the company in Canada is controlled directly or indirectly by any company * * *\" There was no evidence before the Minister upon which he could determine by whom this company is controlled \"directly or indirectly\". The question was not raised by the Minister, but because of a description in Mr. Norman Lee's letter of October 9th \"Commissions paid to controlling Company\", the Company replied advising that Wrights' Ropes Ltd. held only 50 per cent. of the shares, and that Charles Hirst & Sons, Ltd., also an English company, held the other 50 per cent. Apart from this there was no information with respect to the question of control. It appears to me that had the Minister intended to act under section 6(1) (i) he would have obtained further information. There was further evidence given at the trial before the learned judge of the Exchequer Court and upon that evidence I agree with the learned judge that it is impossible to determine the question of control.\nIt there appeared that the shares were held as follows:\nShares\nWrights' Ropes Limited \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n748\nCharles Hirst & Sons, Ltd \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n749\nH.

Gyles \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n1\nJ. G. Chutter \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\n1\nNo evidence was given as to the basis upon which the three shares are held in Canada, and such evidence upon this allocation of shares is very important with reference to the matter of control. The consent filed at the trial does not in any way clear up this point. It merely states that Wrights' Ropes Limited hold 49\u00b786 per cent. of the shares. Viscount Simon, L.C.:\n* * * I think the conception of \"controlling interest\" may well cover the relationship of one company towards another, the requisite majority of whose shares are, as regards their voting power, subject, whether directly or indirectly, to the will and ordering of the first-mentioned company * * * I find it impossible to adopt the view that a person who, by having the requisite voting power in a company subject to his will and ordering, can make the ultimate decision as to where and how the business of the company shall be carried on, and who thus has, in fact, control of the company's affairs, is a person of whom it can be said that he has not in this connection got a controlling interest in the company. [British American Tobacco Co. Ltd. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners][30].\nUpon the evidence it does not appear to me a case which could properly have been dealt with under section 6 (1) (i).\nIf I am correct in my analysis of this case, the report made by the Inspector of Income Tax at Vancouver, which included representations made by the appellant, may or may not have been the dominating factor in the exercise of the Deputy Minister's discretion. Inasmuch as apart from it the discretion could not be exercised as contemplated by the statute, its production as required by section 63 (g) becomes the more important in order to determine whether the discretion has been exercised as required by the statute.\nI do not overlook that both under date of August 13th and October 9th the respondent invited the appellant to make representations, and on the latter date specifically indicated his probable decision, nor that the appellant replied under date of October 21st, \"We have nothing further to add * * *\" Such a general invitation asked for either facts or submissions or both. While such a request at that time is not provided for by the statute, it is not only unobjectionable but commendable; the appellant might well have complied therewith. What the statute does contemplate is that if additional information is required it will be requested under sections 41 and 43. Under the circumstances of this case further information relative to these items might well be requested. In view of this and the fact that the report was not filed under section 63 (g), I have concluded that the case should be referred back to the Deputy Minister as provided under section 65 (2).\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs and the matter referred back to the Minister to be dealt with by him according to the reasons of the majority of the Court.\nSolicitor for the appellant: H.

The by-laws, dealing with the rights of the preference shareholders, provided that such shares shall be \"entitled out of * * * net earnings * * * to cumulative dividends at the rate of seven per cent. per annum for each and every year in preference and priority to any payment of dividends on common stock and further entitled to priority on any division of the assets of the company to the extent of its repayment in full at par together with any dividends thereon then accrued due and remaining unpaid.\" The Company, in January 1944, then in voluntary liquidation under the Winding-up Act, had in its treasury more than $6,000,000. The liquidator, after having made a preliminary distribution by which the preference and common shareholders were reimbursed in full at par, still had surplus money amounting to $500,000. Up to the winding-up of the Company, the preference shareholders had received the stipulated dividends of 7 per cent., aggregating per share $239.75 and $200.11 for the first and second issues; while the holders of common stock had received in dividends a smaller aggregate of $188.50. The latter had received, until 1931, dividends lower than 7 per cent. per year; but, from 1931 to 1942, the annual dividend had been 8 per cent. and, in 1943, 49i per cent. The liquidator, by way of petition, then sought the direction of the Bankruptcy Court as to the distribution of the surplus amount of $500,000, submitting that the holders of common shares were alone entitled to it. The preferred shareholders, represented by the respondents, claimed, first, that there should be an equalization as between them and the common shareholders of certain dividends paid before liquidation, and, so, that they should be paid the amounts in excess of 7 per cent. received by the common shareholders from 1931 until liquidation, and, secondly, that they should then share equally with the common shareholders in the balance of $500,000. These claims were disallowed by the Bankruptcy Court, which made an order in accordance with the conclusions of the petition. On appeal, the dismissal of the first claim advanced by the preferred shareholders was affirmed, but it was held that the preferred and common shareholders were entitled to share equally in the distribution of the Company's surplus assets. The common shareholders appealed from that judgment before this Court and the preferred shareholders cross-appealed.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from (26 C.B.R., 170), The Chief Justice dissenting in part, that, under the by-laws of the Company, the preference shareholders, subject to their rights with regard to dividends and priority to be repaid at par, have otherwise all the rights of the common shareholders; and, once the preference and the common stocks have been reimbursed in full at par, the preference shareholders are further entitled to share pari passu in the distribution of all surplus assets of the Company with the common shareholders.\nPer The Chief Justice (dissenting in part):\u2014But for the very reason that the common and preference shareholders should be put on the same footing for the purpose of such division, they should have received previously \"equal treatment,\" outside of priorities to which the latter are entitled, the fundamental principle of \"equality\" being basically the essence of the Canadian Companies Act. In the present case, the preference shareholders did in fact receive per share dividends greater in the aggregate than those received by the holders of common shares; and, if the judgment appealed from is allowed to stand, there would be \"inequality\" between all shareholders. Therefore, before any division of surplus assets is made, the common shareholders should first be paid the sum representing the difference between the aggregate dividends paid to them and the aggregate dividends paid to the preferred shareholders; and, thereafter, the balance of the surplus assets should then be distributed equally between all shareholders.\nHeld, also, that the claim of the preference shareholders that they should be paid on a basis of equality of dividends with the common shareholders must be dismissed. The preference shareholders are not entitled to any greater amount than 7 per cent. on their shares per annum, notwithstanding dividends at a higher rate having been paid on common shares in any year.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec[1], reversing in part the judgment of the Superior Court, Boyer J., sitting in Bankruptcy[2]. The material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nGeo. A. Campbell K.C. for the appellant.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and A. S. Bruneau K.C. for the respondents McMaster University and others.\nJ. Sen\u00e9cal K.C. for the Liquidator respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting in part)\u2014The cross-appeal should be dismissed, for the reasons given by my brother Kerwin with whom I am fully in accord in this respect.\nOn the main appeal however, I have to make the following observations: The by-laws providing for the issue of the preference shares as set out in the supplementary letters patent confirming them are as follows:\nThe said increased capital stock of five hundred thousand dollars shall be preference stock entitled out of any and all surplus earnings whenever ascertained to cumulative dividends at the rate of seven per cent. per annum for each and every year in preference and priority to any payment of dividends on common stock, and further entitled to priority on any division of the assets of the company to the extent of its repayment in full at par together with any dividends thereon then accrued due and remaining unpaid.\nThe Porto Rico Power Co. Ltd., now in liquidation under the Winding-up Act and whose liquidator is the Montreal Trust Company, was incorporated under the Dominion Companies' Act of 1906; and by force of section 4.9 of that Act,\nholders of shares of such preference stock shall be shareholders within the meaning of this Part, and shall in all respects possess the rights and be subject to the liabilities of shareholders within the meaning of this Part: Provided that in respect of dividends, and in any other respect declared by by-law as authorized by this Part, they shall, as against the ordinary shareholders, be entitled to the preferences and rights given by such by-law.\nThat is the law of Canada and the law which must be applied in the premises, notwithstanding any ruling handed down by courts having to apply different laws or statutes.\nFor that reason, may I say with respect, most of the authorities, to which the Court has been referred, can have no application to the decision which we have to render. That decision depends on the language of the by-laws under authority of which the preference shares were issued and the issue was set by Viscount Haldane in Will v. United Lanket Plantations Co.[3].\nThe point in dispute is one of construction, and construction must always depend on the terms of the particular instrument; it is only to a limited extent that other cases decided upon different documents afford any guidance. I make that observation because a good deal of authority has been cited in the course of the argument, and reference has been made to dicta of various learned judges. But in all those cases they were dealing with documents which were different from those we have to construe, and our primary guide must be the language of the documents we have before us.\nTo which the Earl Loreburn in the same case added at page 18:\nMy lords, I do not think that any light can be thrown upon the construction of this particular resolution by considering language that was used, whether by way of decision or of conjecture, in the construction of perfectly different contracts by other learned judges. There is nothing more unfortunate than the tendency which appears to influence some minds that you can attain to certainty in the interpretation of one set of sentences by considering the analogy of other different sentences.\nNow, if we look at section 49 of the Dominion Companies' Act of 1909, we find that holders of preference stock are shareholders and\nshall in all respects possess the rights and be subject to the liabilities of shareholders within the meaning of this Part.\nIt follows that, under our law, holders of preference stock are primarily shareholders on the same footing as ordinary shareholders. But section 49 adds the proviso that\nin respect of dividends and in any other respect declared by by-law as authorized by this Part, they (the preference shareholders) shall, as against the ordinary shareholders, be entitled to the preferences and rights given by such by-law.\nThe preference shareholders and, in this particular case, the respondents have therefore all the rights of the ordinary shareholders (in this case the appellant); but in addition, they have the preferences and rights given by the by-laws under which the preferred shares were issued.\nMoreover, if we will now refer to the by-laws which govern the case, we find that the preference stock is entitled\n(1) out of any and all surplus earnings whenever ascertained to cumulative dividends at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum for each and every year in preference and priority to any payment of dividends on common stock; (2) and further entitled to priority in any division of the assets of the company to the extent of its repayment in full at par together with any dividends thereon then accrued due and remaining unpaid.\nThe claim by the preference shareholders for additional dividends provided for in the first part of the by-law formed the subject of the cross-appeal and has now been finally disposed of.\nThe main appeal concerns the meaning of the second part of the by-law dealing with the division of the assets of the company, and on that point, I have this to say:\nLike the Court of King's Bench, I think the second part of the by-law, having to do with the division of the assets of the Company, deals only with the priority to which the preference shareholders are entitled. In my view, it means that, \"to the extent of its repayment in full at par\" i.e. to the extent of the repayment in full at par of the preference stock, the holders of that stock are entitled to a priority as against the common shareholders. They will be reimbursed of the amount of their stock \"in full at par\" before the common shareholders are reimbursed of the amount of their stock.\nBut, should there be a surplus remaining after both the preference shareholders and the common shareholders have been so reimbursed, then, as the by-law is silent on the subject, the first part of section 49 of the Companies' Act comes into play and for the purpose of the division of those surplus assets, there are no longer preference shareholders and common shareholders, there are left only holders of shares in all respects possessing \"the rights and subject to the liabilities of shareholders within the meaning of\" the Companies' Act.\nSo far therefore, I agree with the proposition that after the preference stock has been reimbursed in full at par and the common stock has also been reimbursed, with regard to the surplus assets then remaining, both the preference and the common stock holders must be put on the same footing for the purpose of division; but, for that very reason, my view is that, in the present case, the judgment of the Court of King's Bench (appeal side) must be modified.\nIt is common ground in this case that the holders of preference stock, up to the winding-up of the Company, have received dividends aggregating $239.75 or $200.11 per share while the holders of common stock have received in dividends only an aggregate of $188.50 per share.\nAlthough the Court of King's Bench fully acknowledged that fact, which is undisputed, and although the judges of the Court insisted upon the fundamental principle, under our law, of the equality of shareholders, yet they took no account of the fact and they delivered a judgment which, if it should be allowed to stand, would do away with the principle of \"equal treatment\" between the preference and common shareholders, outside of the priorities to which the preference shareholders are entitled. For if all the shareholders are now to be allowed to divide share and share alike the surplus assets now in the hands of the liquidator, it will follow that, on the aggregate and outside of their priorities, the preference shareholders will have received or will receive in the end, a larger amount than the common shareholders, although there are in the hands of the liquidator ample funds both to cover the amounts to which the preference shareholders are entitled in priority and to meet the fundamental requirement of equality between all shareholders outside of the priority.\nAs stated in the judgment of Boyer J. \"the principle of equality invoked by the contestants should work both ways\".\nFrom the incorporation of the company in liquidation up to the date of the winding-up order herein, the preference shareholders, as remarked by MacKinnon J. in the Court of King's Bench, did in fact receive per share dividends greater in the aggregate than those received by the holders of common shares.\nAs matters now stand, the preference shareholders have received in full the 7 per cent. per annum cumulative dividends to which they were entitled under the by-laws and the supplementary letters patent. They have also been reimbursed in full at par, of the whole of the payments they made in purchase of the preference stock. On the other hand, under the scheme proposed by the judgment appealed from, the common shareholders would receive payment in full at par of the stock paid for by them, but in respect of dividends, they stand in the proportion of $239.75 per share, paid in the aggregate to the holders of preference stock of the first issue, to approximately $200.11 per share to those of the second issue and to only $188.50 per share to the holders of common shares.\nThere would follow this inequality: that the common shareholders have therefore received as dividends per share less than the preference shareholders.\nI cannot see how to reconcile such a result with the principle of equality which is basically the essence of the Canadian Companies' Act, which is the principle on which the Court of King's Bench pretends to proceed and which indeed is the very foundation of the claims made by the preference shareholders in the present case. In the absence of any provisions to the contrary, the rights of the shareholders are equal and they should participate in the distribution of profits and assets in proportion to their interest in the company of which they are shareholders.\nIn the Court of King's Bench, Stuart McDougall J. very well said:\nUnder our system it seems to me that we should start with that equality as a basis and then endeavour to determine if it has been derogated from by the by-laws or charter.\nAstbury J. in In re Fraser and Chalmers Limited[4] said at page 120:\nAll shareholders are entitled to equal treatment unless and to the extent that their rights in this respect are modified by the contract under which they hold their shares.\nIt is what, with respect, the judgment appealed from has disregarded. If the respondents were to be paid what the Court of King's Bench gave them, they would, in the aggregate, receive more than the appellant and there would be no equality as between the shareholders.\nAccording to the ruling case of Steel Company of Canada v. Ramsay[5], dividends do not mean yearly dividends but dividends in the aggregate, and the holders of common shares should be entitled to be paid dividends equal in amount to those paid to the holders of preferred shares, before the latter become entitled to participate further.\nOf course, it is objected in the present case that we are no longer dealing with profits as such, but rather with the division of the remaining assets. But I think the objection is answered by Lindley L.J., in In Re Bridgewater Navigation Co.[6]. At page 329, Lord Justice Lindley says:\nThe problem is no longer what is to be done in the way of dividing the profits of a going concern; the problem now is how much of the whole assets of the company belongs to one class of shareholders and how much to another; and if it appears that some of those assets consist of the undrawn profits of one of those classes, such undrawn profits ought to be distributed among the members of that class unless some sufficient reason to the contrary can be shown, and in this case there is no such reason.\nApplying the words of Lindley L.J. to the case now before us, I must repeat: \"In this case there is no such reason\", i.e. there is no reason why before any division of the surplus assets, in fact, before the liquidator could consider that there are surplus assets, he should not first equalize the payments made to the preferred shareholders and those made to the common shareholders so that each class of shareholders shall receive equal treatment. In the premises, this cannot be done unless and until the common shareholders receive the amount of dividend per share, which so far the preferred shareholders have received over and above that paid to the common shareholders.\nThat is the only result consistent with the fundamental equality of rights in the matter of dividends as between the preference and common shareholders, taking into consideration the amounts paid in the aggregate on each class of shares down to the liquidation. This, to my mind, is the proper application of the decision of the Privy Council in the Ramsay case[7] and also appears to be the conclusion reached by MacKinnon J. in the present case.\nThe Ramsay case7 was a Canadian case and the decision of the Judicial Committee in that respect constitutes an authoritative statement of the law applicable in this case.\nIf the rule of parity between shareholders must prevail and if all shareholders are entitled to equal treatment, unless and to the extent that their rights are modified by the contract under which they hold their shares, the rule would not be followed if the preferred shareholders, having received substantially more in dividends than the common shareholders and still holding that advantage, should be allowed to divide equally with the common shareholders the surplus assets now in the hands of the liquidator.\nMy conclusion is that, here, the proper advice to be given the liquidator is, that the common shareholders and that is to say, among others, the appellant, should first be paid the sum representing the difference between the aggregate dividends paid to the preferred shareholders and the aggregate dividends paid to the common shareholders, up to the date of the liquidation, and that the judgment of the Court of King's Bench (appeal side) should be modified accordingly.\nOutside such modifications, the judgment of the Court of King's Bench in the main appeal should not be further disturbed. As agreed, the costs of all parties both in the main appeal and in the cross-appeal should be against the estate.\nKerwin J.\u2014Porto Rico Power Company, Limited, is being wound-up under the provisions of the Dominion Winding-up Act, and the liquidator sought the direction of the Bankruptcy Court in Quebec by two petitions, with the second of which only are we concerned. The liquidator therein requested the Court to direct it to distribute a sum of $500,000, and any additional assets which might thereafter become available in its hands, among the holders of the common shares of the Company. The holders of those shares and of the preferred shares had been repaid in full the amount paid for them. Upon the hearing of the petition, the preferred shareholders, represented by the present respondents, claimed first that there should be what they termed an equalization as between the preferred and common shareholders of certain dividends which had been paid by the Company before liquidation, and second, that they should share equally with the common shareholders in the balance of the $500,000 and in the additional assets. These claims were disallowed and an order made in accordance with the conclusions of the petition. On appeal the Court of King's Bench agreed with the dismissal of the first claim advanced by the preferred shareholders but decided that the preferred and common shareholders were entitled to share equally in the distribution of the Company's surplus assets. It is from that judgment that International Power Company, Limited, representing the common shareholders, appeals and that McMaster University and others, representing the preferred shareholders, cross-appeal.\nPorto Rico Power Company, Limited, was incorporated by letters patent dated August 29th, 1906, under the provisions of the Dominion Companies Act, 1902, chapter 15. After some years of operation, the directors of the Company decided to increase its capital by creating and issuing $500,000 of preference stock. In 1909 this was done by by-law no. 10 and confirmed by supplementary letters patent in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, R.S.C. 1906, chapter 79. Clause 2 of by-law no, 10 provides:\u2014\n2. That the said increased capital stock of five hundred thousand dollars shall be preference stock entitled out of any and all surplus net earnings whenever ascertained to cumulative dividends at the rate of seven per cent. per annum for each and every year in preference and priority to any payment of dividends on common stock; and further entitled to priority on any division of the assets of the Company to the extent of its repayment in full at par together with any dividends thereon then accrued due and remaining unpaid.\nBy-law no. 10 and the supplementary letters patent provided for further increases of capital stock by the issue of additional preference stock on the same terms, and to rank pari passu in all respects with the $500,000 of preference stock authorized by the by-law. In the exercise of the right so reserved, the capital stock of the Company was by by-law increased by the further sum of $500,000 by the creation of an additional 500,000 preference shares of $100 each. The relevant wording of this by-law and the confirming supplementary letters patent is substantially identical with the phraseology in by-law 10.\nIn due course all the preference stock was issued, and at liquidation amounted in the aggregate to $1,000,000 fully paid. For upwards of thirty years, without interruption, dividends at the stipulated rate of 7 per cent. were paid on all preference shares from time to time outstanding, and so continued down to the 31st of December, 1943, shortly before liquidation. Down to that date the holders of preference stock of the first issue were paid dividends amounting to $239.75 per share, and the holders of the second issue were paid dividends amounting to approximately $211 per share, whereas the common stock holders received only $188.50, paid at varying rates in some of the years and including a special dividend of 49\u00b750 per cent. in 1942.\nThe respondents' contention is that the preferred shareholders were entitled to participate in dividends equally per share with the common shareholders after each class had received 7 per cent. dividends in each year. As to this claim and as to the claim to share in the surplus assets, the position of the respondents is that the Companies Act of 1909 did not permit any restriction upon what they term the rights of preferred shareholders in common with all other shareholders but that, on the contrary, the Act permitted merely the granting of a preference and priority. They also argue that the by-law on its true construction did nothing more. The trial judge disagreed with these contentions but the Court of King's Bench, while apparently holding the view that the Act did not authorize the suggested restriction, decided, on the wording of the by-law, that no such restriction was in fact imposed. However, on the first claim, that Court decided that the silence or acquiescence of the holders of preferred stock over a period of thirteen years was a bar to the holders of preference shares now seeking to be put on a footing of equality.\nThe applicable statutory provisions of the Companies Act of 1909 are sections 47 and 49, which read as follows:\u2014\n47. The directors of the company may make by-laws for creating and issuing any part of the capital stock as preference stock, giving the same such preference and priority, as respects dividends and in any other respect, over ordinary stock as is by such by-laws declared.\n2. Such by-laws may provide that the holders of shares of such preference stock shall have the right to select a certain stated proportion of the board of directors, or may give them such other control over the affairs of the company as is considered expedient.\n* * * *\n49. Holders of shares of such preference stock shall be shareholders within the meaning of this Part, and shall in all respects possess the rights and be subject to the liabilities of shareholders within the meaning of this Part: provided that in respect of dividends, and in any other respect declared by by-law as authorized by this Part, they shall, as against the ordinary shareholders, be entitled to the preferences and rights given by such by-law. Subsections 3 and 4 of section 57, which have been referred to, really have no application as they deal merely with the result of the increase or reduction of capital which might be effected only by supplementary letters patent.\nCertain rights are common to the holders of all shares under Part I of the Act in which sections 47 and 49 are found but not all the rights of any shareholder are found in any part of the statute. While the judgment of the Privy Council in Steel Company of Canada v. Ramsay[8], does not refer to the provisions of the Act, it will be noticed from the report of this case in the Court of Appeal for Ontario[9] that counsel for the company argued:\u2014\nUnder secs. 47, 48 and 49, preference shareholders may be given priority when the fund shall be distributed; but apart from that, all shares, preference and common, must be placed on an equal basis when the distribution is made, i.e., at the time of the distribution it must be a \"rateable distribution\".\nNo reference is made in any of the judgments in any o\u00ed the Courts to the statutory provisions, and the judgment of the Privy Council, therefore, cannot be taken as a pronouncement upon the point. However, it has arisen in Holmsted v. Alberta Pacific Grain Co. Limited[10], where the court of appeal of Alberta, affirming the decision of Ford J. decided that the powers given the directors of a company were not restricted to giving preferences. I agree with those judgments and particularly the statement of Chief Justice Harvey that preference shareholders\nhave the rights and liabilities which are common to all shareholders and in addition they have the preferential rights conferred by the by-law. It (section 49) does not say nor can I see any reason to think it means, that they possess all the rights of any shareholder.\nThe fact that in 1924 Parliament amended section 47 does not alter my opinion in this respect as the amendment deals with deferred as well as preferred stock.\nHaving the power to provide that so far as dividends are concerned the holders of preference shares should be entitled to cumulative dividends at the rate of seven per cent. per annum, and to nothing more, is that what the by-law provides? I think it does because, as pointed out by Viscount Dunedin in the Ramsay case[11], it has been decided by the House of Lords in Will v. United Lanket Plantations Company Limited[12], that, ordinarily speaking, when a preferred shareholder receives his preferred dividend, he can ask no more. So far as the claim now under consideration is concerned the remarks of Earl Loreburn in the Will case (2), at page 19, are, I think, apposite:\u2014\nMy lords, I have no doubt myself in regard to this particular resolution, that the people who took the preference shares under it knew perfectly well that they were taking shares with a preferential dividend of 10 per cent. I think they would have been rather surprised, although no doubt they would have been gratified, if they had been told that they were about to receive the almost boundless additional advantages which have been held out to them in the arguments we have been hearing.\nWhile there are differences between companies in England and those incorporated under the Dominion Companies Act, the decision in the Will case (2) applies equally here as is indicated by Viscount Dunedin's reference to it in the Ramsay case11.\nThe question remains as to whether, having similar powers with reference to surplus assets, the directors exercised it. The true nature of the fund in dispute is, I think, nowhere better expressed than in the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Eve in In re William Metcalfe & Sons, Ld.[13], where he says:\u2014\nThe expression \"surplus assets\" in this and similar cases signified something different from the expression \"capital\"; surplus assets are part and parcel of the property of the company not required for the discharge of its liabilities or for returning to the shareholders the capital they have paid up; they are part of the joint stock or common fund which, at the date of the winding-up, represented the capital of the company, but they are no part of the repayable capital. It has ex hypothesi been repaid before they came into existence.\nHis judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal and in the judgments in that court are found references to most, if not all, prior decisions.\nWhile in Birch v. Cropper[14], the House of Lords was concerned with a company, the articles of which contained no provision as to the distribution of assets on its winding-up, the inclusion in the present case in the by-law of the words and further entitled to priority on any division of the assets of the Company to the extent of its repayment in full at par together with any dividends thereon then accrued due and remaining unpaid\ncan I think make no difference. The remarks of Lord Macnaghten at page 543, referring, of course, to a company incorporated under the British Companies Act of 1862, apply as well to the Porto Rico Company,\u2014that every person who becomes a shareholder becomes entitled to a proportionate part in the capital of the company and unless otherwise provided, entitled as a necessary consequence to the same proportionate share in all the property of the company, including its uncalled capital. In the present case the priority of repayment in full at par applies to the preference stock and has no application to the right of a holder of such stock to a share in the surplus assets as above defined. The reasoning in Williams v. Renshaw[15] to which we were referred, seems to overlook this distinction.\nFor these reasons, therefore, I am of opinion that the Court of King's Bench came to the right conclusion as to the surplus assets, and that both Courts came to the right conclusion with respect to the respondents' claim for equality of dividends. Upon this view of the matter, no question arises as to the propriety of the allowance of interest at five per centum per annum from February 2nd, 1944, upon the division of the sum of $500,000. If the conclusion now arrived at had been reached by the judge of first instance, that sum would have been distributed among the holders of preference shares at that time.\nThe appeal and cross-appeal should be dismissed and the costs of all parties paid by the liquidator out of the assets of the Company.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Estey J.J. was delivered by\nTaschereau J.\u2014The Porto Rico Power Co. Ltd. was incorporated under the Dominion Companies Act of 1902, by letters patent dated the 29th of August, 1906. Its original authorized capital was $3,000,000 divided into 30,000 common shares of $100 each, all of which were issued and fully paid. In 1909, the Company increased its capital by creating and issuing $500,000 of preference stock, divided into 5,000 shares of $100 each, and again in 1911, a further increase of $500,000 raised the amount of preference stock to $1,000,000 and, as a result of which, the total capitalization of the company was $4,000,000.\nThe provisions of both supplementary letters patent, dealing with the rights of the preference shares are the following:\u2014\nThe said increased capital stock of five hundred thousand dollars shall be preference stock entitled out of any and all surplus net earnings whenever ascertained to cumulative dividends at the rate of seven per cent. per annum for each and every year in preference and priority to any payment of dividends on common stock, and further entitled to priority on any division of the assets of the company to the extent of its repayment in full at par together with any dividends thereon then accrued due and remaining unpaid.\nThe main holdings, if not the only, of the Porto Rico Power Company, Limited were the shares of a certain Porto Rican subsidiary, the assets of which were expropriated by the Porto Rico Water Resources Authority, of the Porto Rican Government. As a result of this transaction, the Montreal Trust Company, in its quality of liquidator of Porto Rico Power Company, Limited, now in voluntary liquidation, had in its treasury more than $6,000,000 available for distribution amongst both classes of shareholders. The present appellant owns 29,357 of the 30,000 common shares of the Porto Rico Power Company, Limited, and the respondents are the holders of a substantial number of preference shares.\nThe Montreal Trust Company of Montreal was appointed liquidator on the 26th of January, 1944, and was authorized by the Court to make a preliminary distribution of $100 per share to the preference shareholders and $150 per share to the holders of common stock, and it also prayed the Court to determine how the surplus money amounting to $500,000 should be distributed. The Montreal Trust Company submitted that the holders of common shares are alone entitled to share in any surplus assets available for distribution after payment by priority of $100 per share to the preference shareholders, plus dividends thereon accrued due and remaining unpaid, and that the holders of preference shares are entitled only to said payment by priority of $100 per preference share and dividends thereon accrued and remaining unpaid, and that they are not entitled to share pro rata with the holders of shares of common stock in any surplus assets. The contention is that the rights of the holders of the preference shares of stock of the Porto Rico Power Company Limited, in liquidation, are completely and exhaustively set out in the by-laws and supplementary letters patent and that, after having received cumulative dividends at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum, which in fact they have received, they are entitled to only $100 per share in the distribution of the assets of the company which is the repayment in full of their shares at par.\nThe respondents intervened to contest the petition of the liquidator claiming that the preference shareholders are entitled to equal treatment in all respect with the common shareholders, except to the extent to which the said preference shares are given a priority by the supplementary letters patent and the by-laws of the company. They further alleged that no limitation whatsoever is placed upon the rights of the preference shareholders, and all that the said by-laws and supplementary letters patent provide is the extent of the priority given to the preference shareholders.\nThe respondents further claimed that the company in liquidation has paid dividends to the common shareholders in excess of the 7 per cent. received by the preference shareholders, and that the said dividends paid to the common shareholders constitute an advance in respect of which the preference shareholders are entitled to be placed on an equal basis.\nMr. Justice Boyer dismissed the contention of the McMaster University and directed that the $500,000 and all further assets subject to distribution should be distributed to the common shareholders only, and to the exclusion of the preferred shareholders.\nThe Court of King's Bench allowed the appeal of the McMaster University, ordered that the judgment a quo be modified to the extent of ordering, and ordered, the liquidator to distribute amongst the holders of preference shares the sum of $500,000 in proportion to their holdings of said shares, with interest at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum from the 2nd day of February, 1944. The Court of King's Bench further ordered the liquidator to distribute amongst the holders of preference and common shares in proportion to their holdings of the said shares, without any distinction, any or all balance of surplus assets available for distribution, but dismissed the claim of preferred shareholders as regards dividends.\nThe decision of this case depends upon the true construction of the essential words of the supplementary letters patent and by-laws already cited. It is clear, I think, that under the Dominion Companies Act, a preferred shareholder has all the rights and liabilities of a common shareholder. This proposition is found in section 49 of the Companies Act, R.S.C. 1906, chap. 79, which reads as follows:\u2014\nHolders of shares of such preference stock shall be shareholders within the meaning of this part, and shall in all respects possess the rights and be subject to the liabilities of shareholders within the meaning of this part.\nThe preferred shareholders are however entitled to additional preferences and rights which are authorized by section 47 of the Act, which is to the effect that the directors of the company may make by-laws for creating and issuing any part of the capital stock as preference stock, giving the same such preference and priority, as respects dividend and in any other respect, over ordinary stock as is by such by-laws declared, and this is confirmed by subsection 49, which, after stating that holders of shares of preference stock are shareholders within the meaning of the Act, says that they are, as against the ordinary shareholders, entitled to the preferences and rights given by the by-laws.\nMany judgments have been cited by both parties. As it will be seen the consensus of opinion appears to be that preference shareholders have all the rights and liabilities of common shareholders, and that the additional preferences and priorities, to which they may be entitled, must be found in the by-laws and supplementary letters patent of the company. The oldest case is, I think, the case of Birch v. Cropper[16]. In that case, the articles of association of an English company incorporated under the Companies Act of 1862 provided that the net profits for each year should be divided pro rata upon the whole paid-up share capital, and that the directors might declare a dividend thereout on the shares in proportion to the amount paid up thereon. The articles contained no provisions as to the distribution of assets on the winding-up of the company. The original capital consisted of ordinary shares partly paid up. Afterwards, preference shares were issued entitling the holders to a dividend at a fixed rate with priority over all dividends and claims of the ordinary shareholders. The preference shares were fully paid up. The undertaking having been sold under an Act which made no provision for the distribution of the purchase money amongst the shareholders, the company was voluntarily wound up and assets remained for distribution. It was held by the House of Lords, reversing the decision of the Court of Appeal, that in distributing the assets \"amongst the members according to their rights and interests in the company\" and in adjusting \"the rights of the contributors amongst themselves\", the liability of the ordinary shareholders for the unpaid balance of their shares must not be disregarded; and that, after discharging all debts and liabilities and repaying to the ordinary and preference holders the capital paid on their shares, the assets ought to be divided amongst all the shareholders, not in proportion to the amounts paid on the shares, but in proportion to the shares held.\nAt page 531, Lord Herschell said:\u2014\nTo treat them as partners receiving only interest on their capital and not entitled to participate in the profits of the concern, or to regard them as mere creditors whose only claim is discharged when they have received back their loan, appears to me out of the question. They are members of the Company, and as such shareholders in it as the ordinary shareholders are; and it is in respect of their thus holding shares that they receive a part of the profits. I think, therefore, that the first contention of the appellant wholly fails.\nAt page 543, Lord Macnaghten says:\u2014\nEvery person who became a member of a company limited by shares of equal amount becomes entitled to a proportionate part in the capital of the company, and, unless it be otherwise provided by the regulations of the company, entitled, as a necessary consequence, to the same proportionate part in all the property of the company, including its uncalled capital.\nAnd at page 546, Lord Macnaghten says also:\u2014\nThe ordinary shareholders say that the preference shareholders are entitled to a return of their capital, with 5 per cent. interest up to the day of payment, and to nothing more. That is treating them as if they were debenture-holders, liable to be paid off at a moment's notice. Then they say that at the utmost the preference shareholders are only entitled to the capital value of a perpetual annuity of 5 per cent. upon the amounts paid up by them. That is treating them as if they were holders of irredeemable debentures. But they are not debenture-holders at all. For some reason or other the company invited them to come in as shareholders, and they must be treated as having all the rights of shareholders, except so far as they renounced those rights on their admission to the company. There was an express bargain made as to their rights in respect of profits arising from the business of the company. But there was no bargain\u2014no provision of any sort\u2014affecting their rights as shareholders in the capital of the Company.\nIn In re Espuela Land and Cattle Company[17], it was held:\u2014\nThere is no general rule that where preference shareholders have a preference as to repayment of capital they can have no further share in surplus assets. The question depends on the construction of the memorandum and articles of association. But if these documents contain no provisions on the point, surplus assets must in a winding-up be divided amongst all the shareholders, ordinary and preference, in proportion to the nominal value of the shares.\nIn this case, Mr. Justice Swinfen Eady says at page 193:\u2014\nThere remains the question how the assets which remain after paying preference capital, interest thereon, and ordinary capital are to be distributed.\nMr. Younger, who claimed the whole surplus on behalf of the ordinary shareholders, contended that where priority of repayment on a winding-up is secured to the preference capital the preference shareholder is entitled to that repayment, but not to any further interest in the capital of the company, in the same manner as where a right to a fixed preferential dividend is secured to preference shareholders they take that fixed amount and nothing more, however large the revenue of the company may be.\nThis, however, is merely a question of the construction of the memorandum and articles. There is not any rule of law that shareholders having a fixed preferential dividend take that only. It is quite open to a company to distribute its revenue first in paying a fixed preferential dividend, then in paying a dividend of like amount to the ordinary shareholders, and then dividing any surplus revenue of any year rate-ably between the preference and ordinary shareholders. An instance of this is found in Webb v. Earle[18]. The documents embodying the constitution of the company determine how its revenue shall be distributed; and in like manner they determine how any surplus assets are to be divided. An instance of a provision that preference shares shall confer certain rights, \"but shall not confer any further right to participate in profits or surplus assets,\" occurred in In re South African Supply and Cold Storage Co.[19]. In the absence, however, of any provision to the contrary, the rights of the shareholders are equal. Where the shares are of unequal amounts the surplus assets must be distributed rateably according to the nominal amount of the shares, unless some provision to the contrary is to be found in the memorandum or articles: In re Wakefield Rolling Stock Co.[20]; Birch v. Cropper[21].\nThe judgment in the case of Will v. United Lankel Plantations Co.[22] did not deal with the distribution of the assets of the company but only with the right to dividends, and the House of Lords came to the conclusion that, on the construction of the by-law, a contract or a bargain for a 10 per cent. dividend was complete as to dividends, and that the preferred shareholders were not entitled to share in the dividends in excess of that amount. The only point in dispute was one of construction, and as Viscount Haldane said,\nconstruction must always depend on the terms of the particular instrument\nand\nour primary guide must be the language of the documents we have before us.\nLord Atkinson said:\nIt is said that the earlier part of the resolution by making him a shareholder gives him a right to some additional dividend on distribution. It does not appear to me to be at all capable of that construction.\nIn that same case, where only the right to dividends was discussed before the House of Lords, Lord Justice Farwell had said in the Court of Appeal[23]:\u2014\nTo my mind the considerations affecting capital and dividend are entirely different. The preference given to capital is in the winding-up, and the preference claimed to be given to dividend here is in a going concern; and I do not think that you can reason from what will happen to capital in a winding-up to what ought to happen to dividend while the company is a going concern.\nIn In re National Telephone Company[24] much turned on the wording of some of the preferred share provisions. The first preferred stock was entitled to a cumulative dividend of 6 per cent. per annum and no more, and to a preferential payment of the amount paid up out of the assets of the company in the event of the company being wound up\nin priority to any payment in respect of the ordinary shares of the company but to no other participation in profits.\nThe second preferred shares were given the right to participate rateably in the surplus profits with the common shareholders, and it was provided that in winding up\nthe surplus assets shall be applied in the first place in repaying the holders of the original preference shares, the full amount paid up thereon, and subject thereto in repaying to the holders of the second preference shares the full amount paid up thereon in priority to any payment in respect of the ordinary shares of the company.\nNext, the surplus assets were to be applied in repaying to the holders of the third preference non-cumulative shares the full amount paid up thereon, and the fourth preferred was in the event of winding up to\nrank for repayment of the full amount paid up thereon, together with a bonus of 5 per cent. in priority to the common stock.\nThe appellants have relied upon this judgment and particularly upon the following passage of Mr. Justice Sargant:\u2014\nIt appears to me that the weight of authority is in favour of the view that, either with regard to dividend or with regard to the rights in a winding-up, the express gift or attachment of preferential rights to preference shares, on their creation, is prima facie a definition of the whole of their rights in that respect, and negatives any further or other right to which, but for the specified rights, they would have been entitled.\nBut this expression of opinion of Mr. Justice Sargant was later overruled in two cases.\nIn In re Fraser & Chalmers Limited[25] Mr. Justice Astbury, after considering the Espuela[26] and National Telephone[27] cases as well as the Will case[28], expressed his preference for the decision of Mr. Justice Swinfen Eady in favour of the preference shareholders.\nAt page 120, Mr. Justice Astbury says:\u2014\nAll shareholders are entitled to equal treatment unless and to the extent that their rights in this respect are modified by the contract under which they hold their shares. And at page 121, he further adds:\u2014\nIt seems to me impossible to say that, because it is provided that certain debts of the company shall be paid in a winding-up in a particular order, a fund remaining after doing so which is not expressly, nor by implication, referred to at all, and which forms part of the general assets of the company, shall be divided between some, to the exclusion of other shareholders.\nThe ordinary shareholders contend that the express rights given to the preference shareholders by these resolutions contain the whole of their rights as such. It is clear however that they do not. They have voting and other rights as corporators, and I see no reason for construing this contract as depriving them of a right to share in an ultimate surplus that is not referred to, any more than as depriving them of voting and other rights of shareholders which are in the same position.\nThe other case which overruled the decision in the National Telephone Company case[29], is the case of Anglo-French Music Company Limited v. Nicoll[30]. In that case the preferred shareholders were entitled to a fixed 7 per cent. cumulative dividend with right to repayment of capital before any dividend is paid or capital repaid to the holders of ordinary shares, with right to a further participation in dividends.\nAt page 391 Mr. Justice Eve says:\u2014\nThe point I have to consider is this: does the provision in the bargain providing for what is to happen in the event of the assets being insufficient to repay all the capital operate to preclude the preference shareholders, in the event of the assets being more than sufficient to repay all the capital, from participating in the excess? I see no reason why it should do so * * * I do not think it is accurate to say that the whole bargain between the two classes of shareholders is to be found in the memorandum, except to this extent, that the rights of each class are thereby finally determined in respect of all matters expressly or by necessary implication therein dealt with.\nIn the present case the respective rights of the two classes to the profits of the company are expressly dealt with\u2014so also are the rights in the event of an insufficiency of assets to repay all the capital in a winding-up\u2014but I cannot see anything which deals either expressly or by necessary implication with the rights of either class in the event of the assets being more than sufficient to repay the capital.\nMr. Justice Eve who gave the judgment in the case of Anglo-French Music Company Limited v. Nicoll30, made a further similar pronouncement in In re Madame Tussaud & Sons, Limited[31]. In that case His Lordship held that, according to the constitution of the company, the prima facie presumption in favour of equality of distribution amongst all the shareholders ought to obtain, and the surplus assets were distributed amongst all the shareholders pro rata, in proportion to the amount paid up on their shares.\nThe appellant relied on the Collaroy Company, Limited v. Giffard case[32]. The company's memorandum after stating that the capital was 300,000 divided into 10,000 preference shares of 10 each and 20,000 ordinary shares of 10 each, declared that such preference shares should confer \"the right\" to a fixed cumulative preferential dividend at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum on the capital paid up thereon, and \"shall rank\" both as regards dividends and capital in priority to the ordinary shares. It was held that the memorandum and article contained an exhaustive delimitation of \"the right\" of the preference shareholders, and that in the event of a winding-up they would be, entitled to a return of their capital, but not to participate in surplus assets. This judgment was given by Mr. Justice Astbury who had previously given the judgment in the Fraser & Chalmers case[33]. It would seem that both decisions are contradictory, but a careful reading of the judgment leads me to a different conclusion. The learned Justice stated in the first part of his judgment a proposition that cannot in his mind be questioned, and it is that:\u2014\nThe annexation to preference shares of a right to receive back their capital in a winding-up in priority to the ordinary shares does not prima facie exclude the preference shareholders from participation in the ultimate surplus assets if any.\nIn support of this proposition Mr. Justice Astbury cites the Espuela case[34], as well as Fraser & Chalmers Limited (2) and Anglo-French Music[35] cases. He further states that a provision may be expressed in such a manner and in such a context that according to its true construction, it does exclude preference shareholders from such a participation, and the question that he had to decide was as to whether the contract in the particular case he had to determine did exclude the preference shareholders. On the construction of the contract he reached the conclusion that the preference shareholders were excluded, and he seems to base his judgment on a very narrow ground, namely, that the preference shareholders were given \"the right\", to repayment of capital, and that the use of the word \"the\" was limitative and produced a very different result from the use of such words as a \"right\".\nIn the Metcalfe & Sons Limited case[36] the Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of Mr. Justice Eve who disagreed with the conclusion arrived at by Mr. Justice Astbury in the Collaroy Company, Limited v. Giffard case[37], and Lord Hanworth says at page 158:\nPersonally I find myself inclined to agree with Eve J. in not being able to follow the distinction between the Fraser & Chalmers Limited[38], and the Collaroy case (2).\nAnd at the same page he also states:\u2014\nTherefore, looking at the authorities as a whole, I come to the conclusion that there must be in respect of this balance of surplus assets a parity between all the shareholders. I cannot find anything in the present case which either expressly or impliedly is sufficient to displace the rights which belong to the preference shareholders equally with the ordinary shareholders, and the rule of parity among shareholders must therefore prevail.\nIn the John Dry Steam Tugs Limited case[39] the principle, that there being nothing in the articles to modify or exclude the normal right of the preference shareholders to share in the distribution of the surplus assets, was upheld and the preference shareholders were declared to be entitled to rank pari passu with the ordinary shareholders in the distribution of the assets of the company.\nAnother case reported in England is Re W. Foster & Sons Limited[40]. It was there held that the question whether a liquidator ought to divide and distribute the surplus assets amongst the holders of the ordinary shares alone, or amongst the holders of the preference shares and the holders of the ordinary shares pari passu, was governed by the decision In re William Metcalfe & Sons Limited42\nThe English Weekly Notes of May 27th, 1944, at page 143 refers to a decision of Mr. Justice Cohen in In re Wood, Skinner & Company Limited[41], in which the preferred shareholders were entitled to rank as regards dividends and capital in priority to the ordinary shares. It was held that all shareholders are entitled to equal treatment unless and to the extent that their rights are modified by the contract under which they held their shares.\nTwo other cases were cited by the appellant, but nothing in the reasons for judgment can be found which is useful to help us in the determination of the case at bar.\nThe first one is the case of Steel of Canada Limited v. Ramsay[42]. In that case the preferred shareholders were entitled to a fixed cumulative preferential 7 per cent. dividend, and were further entitled to share equally with the common stock in additional profits after the holders of the ordinary shares should have received dividends equal to those paid on the preferred shares. The question was whether under this special clause the common shareholders were entitled to be equalized with the preferred shareholders only in respect of the current year or as regards other years. The judgment of the Privy Council did not purport to deal with the division of surplus assets, but was only dealing with the right to additional dividends.\nThe other case is Holmested et al. v. Alberta Pacific Grain Company Limited[43]. In the by-law of the company it was provided that the cumulative preferred shares would rank both as regards dividends and return of capital, in priority to all common shares in the capital stock of the company, but did not confer any further rights to participate in profits or assets. The preferred shareholders commenced an action for a declaration that they were entitled to rank equally with the holders of common shares on the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of the company's assets and business. It was argued that the by-law creating the said preferred shares, in so far as it purported to limit or restrict the right of the preferred shares to participate in the distribution of the profits or assets of the company was ultra vires of the Grain Company, because section 47, as it read at that time (now amended by 14-15 Geo. V, chap. 33, sec. 16), authorized only priorities but not restrictions. The Court came to the conclusion that the by-law was not invalid and that the restriction was intra vires of the powers of the company. The decision in that case does not apply to the case which has been submitted to this Court. In the Alberta Pacific Grain case[44] there was a restriction attached to the preference shares, but such restriction does not exist in the case which is submitted to this Court.\nFrom all these numerous judicial pronouncements, and from a careful reading of the Company's Act, I believe that one may rightly gather that the rights of all classes of shareholders are on a basis of equality, unless they have been modified by the by-laws or the letters patent of the company, and, that the right to the return of invested capital, and the right to share in surplus assets are quite different and distinct matters.\nHolders of preference stock are shareholders within the meaning of the Act, and they possess in all respects the rights, and are subject to the same liabilities as the other classes of shareholders. Section 49 on this point is quite clear and unambiguous. It is in virtue of this section that the ordinary rights of preference shareholders are created. These rights put them on an equal footing with the common shareholders as to the sharing in surplus assets.\nIt is in the letters patent and the by-laws of the company that have to be found the priorities that may be attached to preference shares, and which are clearly authorized by section 47. It may of course happen that these priorities are exhaustive of the rights of the preference shareholders, and therefore negative any additional rights, or it may be also that they create additional rights which coexist with the original rights inherent to all classes of shareholders. But in order to determine the true meaning and the legal effect of these preference and priority clauses, one must necessarily look at the creating clauses in order to find if there is or not an express or implied condition, which limits or adds to the ordinary rights of the shareholders. It is a mere question of construction of these clauses, which form part of the contract under which the shareholders hold their shares.\nI entirely agree with the Court of King's Bench that the provisions of the by-laws of the company do not expressly or by necessary implication, limit the rights of the holders of preference shares. They do create priorities, but these priorities are in addition to the existing rights, and are not a declaration of all the rights of this class of shareholders. These priorities consist in a right for the preference shareholders to be repaid of the invested capital at par, together with any dividends accrued and remaining unpaid, but do not affect their right to share in the profits. For the sharing in the profits, which is the fundamental right to all shareholders, is a matter entirely different from the priority given to the preference shareholder which is the additional privilege given to him.\nIn the present case the priority to repayment\non any division of the assets of the company to the extent of its repayment in full at par together with any dividends thereon then accrued due and remaining unpaid\nis a definition of the existing priority as to the sharing of assets, and cannot, I believe, be construed as a bar or a limitation to any further rights.\nFor these reasons, I come to the conclusion that the preference shareholders have a priority to be repaid at par, and that they are further entitled to share pari passu in the distribution of the assets of the company with the common shareholders, after the latter have received payment at par.\nThe main appeal should therefore be dismissed.\nIt is the contention of the cross-appellant that the stipulation for payment of cumulative dividends at the rate of 7 per cent. per annum for each and every year, in preference and priority to any payment of dividends on common stock, was not limitative in its terms and that in the event of the common shareholders receiving, in any year, a dividend exceeding the said rate of 7 per cent. per annum, then, the preferred shareholders were entitled to be paid on a basis of equality.\nThe preference shareholders have received each year the stipulated dividends of 7 per cent. until the winding-up of the company, and the common shareholders until 1931 have received dividends lower than 7 per cent per year. However, from 1931 to 1942, the directors have declared for the benefit of the common shareholders an annual dividend of 8 per cent. and in 1943 this dividend was 49\u00bd per cent. The preference shareholders ask for equal treatment in the matters of dividends. I cannot agree with this proposition, and it seems that the cases cited by the respondents on the main appeal defeat this very contention.\nThe question, I think, has been settled by the case of Will v. United Lanket Plantations Company, Limited[45]. In that case the Court of Appeal[46] decided that, in the distribution of profits, holders of the preference shares were not entitled to anything more than a 10 per cent. dividend, and in the House of Lords (1) Viscount Haldane said:\u2014\nMoreover, I think that when you find\u2014as you do find here\u2014the word \"dividend\" used in the way in which the expression is used in the resolution and defined to be a \"cumulative preferential dividend\" you have something so definitely pointed to as to suggest that it contains the whole of what the shareholder is to look to from the company.\nThe right to dividend, while the company is a going concern and the right to capital and surplus assets in the winding-up, are quite distinct. In the present case, the right of preference shareholders is to be paid an annual dividend of 7 per cent. and they have a priority for dividends accrued due and remaining unpaid. These dividends have been paid, and the preference shareholders, as to dividends, have therefore received all that they are legally entitled to.\nThe by-laws give priority to the preference shareholders to obtain reimbursement of their invested capital, in addition to their right to share in the division of assets, but a similar privilege as to dividends is not given. In the latter case, the privilege is only to assure the payment of a dividend of 7 per cent. which has been declared, and which at the time of the winding-up accrued and remained unpaid. I should dismiss the cross-appeal.\nAs agreed, all costs of the parties will be paid by the liquidator out of the mass of the estate.\nRand J.\u2014This is a controversy between holders of common and preferred shares of the Porto Rico Power Company Limited in liquidation. Two claims are made, one by each group. During the company's business life, the preferred shareholders have received more than one-half of the total dividends declared: but they claim that where in any year a dividend equal to that received by them is paid to the common shareholders, any excess in that year must be shared equally by both classes. On the other hand, the common shareholders contend that when the total amount of subscribed capital has been repaid, the remaining or surplus assets belong exclusively to them.\nThe provision of the supplementary letters patent authorizing the issue of the preference stock was in these words:\nThe said increased capital stock of $500,000 shall be preference stock entitled out of any and all surplus net earnings whenever ascertained to cumulative dividends at the rate of 7 per cent per annum for each and every year in preference and priority to any payment of dividends on common stock, and further entitled to priority on any division of the assets of the company to the extent of its repayment in full at par together with any dividends thereon then accrued, due and remaining unpaid.\nThis authority was exercised under the Dominion Companies' Act, R.S.C. 1906, chapter 79, sections 47 and 49 of which were at the time as follows:\n47. The directors of the company may make by-laws for creating and issuing any part of the capital stock as preference stock, giving the same such preference and priority, as respects dividends and in any other respect, over ordinary stock as by such by-laws declared.\n2. Such by-laws may provide that the holders of shares of such preference stock shall have the right to select a certain stated proportion of the board of directors, or may give them such other control over the affairs of the company as is considered expedient.\n* * *\n49. Holders of shares of such preference stock shall be shareholders within the meaning of this Part, and shall in all respects possess the rights and be subject to the liabilities of shareholders within the meaning of this Part: Provided that in respect of dividends, and in any other respect declared by by-laws as authorized by this Part, they shall, as against the ordinary shareholders, be entitled to the preferences and rights given by such by-law.\nI see no substance in the claim of the preferred shareholders that their equality in dividends must be referred to each year's distribution. On Mr. Geoffrion's basic assumption that all shareholders are equal with certain additional rights annexed to the preferred shares, his clients, having received substantially more in dividends than the common shareholders, are still holding an advantage. The reasoning in Steel Company of Canada Limited v. Ramsay[47], although there it was expressly provided that participation of the preferred shareholders in addition to the fixed rate of 7 per cent should be only when the ordinary holders should have received \"dividends equal to those paid on the preferred shares\", applies even in the absence of such a stipulation. Certainly that would seem inescapable under the principle of section 49.\nThe language of the letters patent\nthe said increased capital stock * * * shall be preference stock entitled out of any and all surplus net earnings whenever ascertained to cumulative dividends * * * in preference and priority to any payment of dividends on common stock\nis claimed by the appellants to limit the preference holders so far as dividends go to the rate of 7 per cent provided. What is sometimes called a \"preferential dividend\" is simply a dividend with certain preferential incidents. The latter in this case are the fixed rate, the accumulation and the priority. What the resolution deals with however is the entire right itself to dividend or to participation in profits, with those incidents. Whether this commutation of the right rather than merely declaring preferential additions is a violation of section 49 it is not, in view of the dividend inequality, necessary to consider, but the particular language used will be seen to be relevant to the second claim, that of the holders of ordinary shares in the distribution of assets.\nThe provision in relation to that is quite different in effect. Its subject does not purport to be the whole right to share in assets; it deals only with a preferential incident, the right of priority and priority only to the extent \"of its repayment\" meaning the repayment of the capital paid in. The funds which we are considering are surplus assets which were not paid in, and could not in any proper sense be said to be repaid.\nIt is argued that you cannot have a share in the abstract, that it is only to issued shares that incidents attach, and that these arise only at the moment of issue. But the determination of \"preferential\" rights involves an interpretation of qualifying language, and before that is possible we must make assumptions of the underlying substantive matter. The preference provision would be meaningless in isolation, and its interpretation depends upon what we attach to the concept of a share.\nAs declared by section 49, the holder of the preferred share is none the less a shareholder because he has certain advantages over ordinary shareholders: he places his property at the fundamental risk; but the interpretation of the constituting provision will depend upon whether we superimpose it upon the ordinary notion of share with its incidents of voting, participating in profits and in assets when the venture is over; or upon a skeleton of that concept such as a fractional interest in a fund to which the resolution adds all significant characteristics. Here again the essential fact obtrudes itself that all members are of a common group, and I think the rule unassailable that postulates the common and ordinary rights of shareholders as the underlying basis for the interpretation: In re Wm. Metcalfe & Sons Ltd.[48]. The question then is simply one of construction: how far have those rights been clearly taken away? Here, in relation to surplus assets, the right is left intact and taking that view, I do not, again as in the other branch of the argument, find it necessary to consider whether section 49 would have prevented any restriction of that right.\nI would therefore dismiss both the appeal and the cross-appeal with costs to be paid by the liquidator as agreed.\nAppeal and cross-appeal dismissed, costs to be paid by liquidator as agreed.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Campbell, Weldon, Kerry & Rinfret.\nSolicitor for the respondents McMaster University et al.

Minister of National Revenue, [1946] S.C.R. 209\nDate: 1946-01-24\nPercy Walker Thomson Appellant;\nand\nThe Minister of National Revenue Respondent.\nPresent :\u2011Kerwin, Taschereau, Rand, Kellock and Estey JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nIncome tax\u2014Liability for\u2014Income War Tax Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 97, and amendments), s. 9 (1) (a) (b) (before its amendment in 1942)\u2014\"Residing or ordinarily resident\" in Canada \"during\" year\u2014\"Sojourns\".\nSec. 9 (1) of the Dominion Income War Tax Act (as it stood before amendment in 1942) required payment of a tax \"upon the! income during the preceding year of every person (a) residing or ordinarily resident in Canada during such year; or (b) who sojourns in Canada for a period or periods amounting to\" 183 days \"during such year\".\nAppellant was born in the province of New Brunswick. He had retired from business by 1923, and in that year, owing to a dispute over a village assessment, he sold his home in New Brunswick, declared Bermuda to be his domicile, went there and leased a house but didn't stay, and went to the United States and lived there, chiefly at Pinehurst, North Carolina, where in 1930 he built an expensive dwelling. From 1925 to 1931 he made some visits to Canada, mostly short. In 1932 he rented a house in New Brunswick where he spent a summer season in each of the years 1932, 1933 and 1934, of 134, 134 and 81 days, respectively; and in 1934, as his wife enjoyed being near her relatives and friends in New Brunswick, he built an expensive house there, and from 1935 to 1941 (inclusive) spent (in the warmer part of the year) an ,average of 150 days in each year (159 days in 1940, the year in question). The rest of the year the house was closed except quarters for his wife and house-keeper which were open the year round. In 1941 the Dominion authorities asked him to file an income tax return for the year 1940, and, on his not doing so, fixed a tax against him, under s. 47 of the Act. His liability to the Dominion of Canada for income tax was the question in dispute.\nHeld (Taschereau J. dissenting): Appellant was \"residing or ordinarily resident\" in Canada \"during\" the year 1940, within the meaning of said s. 9 (1) (a), and was liable for income tax in Canada.\nthe meaning of \"residing\", \"ordinarily resident\", \"sojourns\", \"during\", discussed. Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Lysaght, [19281 A.C. 234; Levene v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue, [19281 A.C. 217, and other cases, discussed.\nThe word \"during\" in s. 9 (1) (a) meant \"in the course of\" rather than \"throughout\". (No ground against such construction was afforded by the fact that by subsequent amendment, in 1942, the words \"at any time in\" were substituted for \"during\"). Per Kerwin J.: The frequency with which appellant came to Canada, his \"routine of life\" in that regard, the family ties of his wife, if not of himself, the erection and occupancy of his house, retention of servants, together with all the surrounding circumstances, make it clear that he was \"residing\" rather than merely staying temporarily in Canada. Assuming that he was a resident of the United States for the pur-poses of income tax there, a man may be a resident of more than one country for revenue purposes.\nPer Rand J.: The mode or nature of appellant's living in Canada brought him within the language of s. 9 (1) (a). Apart from any question of domicile, which would appear to be still in New Brunswick, his living in Canada was substantially as deep rooted and settled as in the United States, though in terms of time his home in the United States might take precedence. He was at his place in Canada as at his \"home\", .and the mere limitation of time did not qualify that fact. That brought him within the most exacting of any reasonable inter\u00adpretation of \"resides\" or \"ordinarily resident\".\nPer Kellock J.: There was no difference been appellant's use of his Canadian home and that of his United States home or homes. The establishments were essentially of the same nature and were equally regarded by him as \"homes\" in the same sense. His residence in each was in the ordinary and habitual course of his life and there was no difference in the quality of his occupation, though he occu\u00adpied each at different periods of the year. He came within the terms \"residing\" and \"ordinarily resident\" in Canada.\nPer Estey J.: Appellant selected the location for his residence in. Canada, built and furnished it for his wife's enjoyment of her rela\u00adtives and friends and his own enjoyment of golf nearby; his resi\u00addence there was, in successive years, in the regular routine of his life; and, taking such facts into consideration, the conclusion must be that he was \"ordinarily resident\" there, within the meaning of s. 9 (1) (a). A person may have more than one residence, and the. fact of his residence in the United States in no way affected the determination of the issue.\nPer Taschereau J., dissenting: Appellant had in. 1923 ceased to be a resident of Canada and his visits thereafter were of a temporary nature and did not justify a finding that he was \"residing\" or \"ordin\u00adarily resident\" in Canada; he was really a resident of the United States making occasional visits to Canada; and was not subject to, income tax in Canada.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Thorson J., President. of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing the present appellant's appeal from the decision of the Min\u00adister of National Revenue affirming an assessment levied upon him for the taxation year 1940 under the provisions, of the Income War Tax Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 97, with amendments, as it stood prior to amendment in 1942). The Minister's affirmance of the assessment was on the ground that \"the facts disclose that the taxpayer was resident or ordinarily resident in Canada during the year upon him for the taxation year 1940 under the provisions by paragraph (a) of section 9 of the Act\". Thorson J. in his judgment put the question in the case as follows:\nThe only question to be determined is whether the appellant in 1940 was \"residing or ordinarily resident in Canada during such year\", within the meaning of section 9 (a) of the Income War Tax Act, as it was in. force in 1940, or whether he was merely sojourning there within the meaning of section 9 (b).\nand came to the conclusion that, on the facts, and the proper construction of the said Act, the appellant was both \"residing\" and \"ordinarily resident\" in Canada \"dur\u00ading\" the said year 1940.\nThe facts are discussed at length in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported, and also in the reasons for judgment of Thorson J. in the Exchequer Court (above cited).\nC. F. Inches K.C. and E. F. Newcombe K.C. for the appellant.\nR. Forsyth K.C. and E. S. MacLatchy for the respon\u00addent.\nKURWIN J.\u2014The sole point for determination in this appeal is whether, during the year 1940, the appellant was \"residing or ordinarily resident in Canada\" within the meaning of section 9 (1) (a) of the Income War Tax Act as it stood in 1940, or whether he was merely sojourn\u00ading there within the meaning of section 9 (1) (b). No question is raised as to the amount of the assessment. The relevant parts of section 9 are as follows:\u2011\n9. There shall be assessed, levied and paid upon the income during the preceding year of every person\n(a) residing or ordinarily resident in Canada during such year; or\n(b) who sojourns in Canada for a period or periods amounting to one hundred and eighty-three days during such year;\nThere is no definition in the Act of \"resident\" or \"ordin\u00adarily resident\" but they should receive the meaning ascribed to them by common usage. When one is con\u00adsidering a Revenue Act, it is true to state, I think, as it is put in the Standard Dictionary, that the words \"reside\" and \"residence\" are somewhat stately and not to be used indiscriminately for \"live\", \"house\" or \"home\". The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary gives the meaning of \"reside\" as being \"To dwell permanently or for a consider-able time, to have one's settled or usual abode, to live, in or at a particular place.\" By the same authority \"ordinarily\" means \"1. In conformity with rule; as a matter of regular occurrence. 2. In most cases, usually, commonly. 3. To the usual extent. 4. As is normal or usual.\" On the other hand, the meaning of the word \"sojourn\" is given as \"to make a temporary stay in a place; to remain or reside for a time.\"\nThe House of Lords has adopted the everyday meaning as a test in applying the terms \"resident\" and \"ordinarily resident\" in the British Income Tax Act. Levene v. Com\u00admissioners of Inland Revenue[2]; Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Lysaght[3]. Under the British Act that is of particular importance where a finding of the Commissioners on a question of pure fact cannot be reviewed by the Courts except on the ground that there was no evidence on which they could have arrived at their conclusion. Under our Act no such question arises, but the remarks of the peers who took part in the two judg\u00adments mentioned are of assistance. Rule 3 of the Gen\u00aderal Rules applicable to all the Schedules of that Income Tax Act may have had an effect in the result arrived at in some of the cases. In the Levene case, Viscount Cave, at page 224, points out that if a man sought to be taxed is a British subject regard must be had to that rule\nwhich provides that every British subject whose ordinary residence bas been in the United Kingdom shall be assessed and charged to tax not-withstanding that at the time the assessment or charge is made he may have left the United Kingdom, if he has so left the United Kingdom for the purpose only of occasional residence abroad;\nand as a matter of fact, at the foot of the same page the Lord Chancellor, after agreeing that it was plainly open to the Commissioners to find that Mr. Levene was resi\u00addent in the United Kingdom, stated that it was probable that Rule 3 applied to him. Viscount Sumner refers, at p. 227, to the soundness of the Commissioners' conclusion on Rule 3. On the other hand, the decision of the First Division of the Court of Exchequer (Scotland) in Cooper v. Cad\u00adwaladar[4], was referred to with apparent approval by Viscount Cave at page 223 of the Levene case[5] and by Viscount Sumner at page 244 of the Lysaght case[6]. There, the person held liable to tax was a citizen of the United States, where he resided and practiced his profes\u00adsion, but rented a house and shooting rights in Scotland where he spent about two months in each year. I refer to this decision because I find it difficult to imagine that it would be held in Canada that a citizen of the United States, residing in that country, but owning a summer home in Canada which he occupied for four or five months in each year, was, by reason of the latter facts, a resident of this country within the meaning of our Act.\nHowever, that is not the case before us. No quarrel is found with the statement of facts contained in the reasons for judgment of the President of the Exchequer Court and I do not, therefore, repeat all of them. The appellant was born in Saint John, New Brunswick, and is still a citizen of Canada. Notwithstanding the absence of a provision corresponding to Rule 3 of the General Rules referred to above, that is a fact to be considered. I agree with the President that the appellant's motions in going to Ber\u00admuda, making an affidavit as to his intention, renting a house which he never used, and obtaining a passport, were a pure farce; that the appellant never became a resident of Bermuda; but that, whether that be so or not, he was certainly not a resident of Bermuda in the year 1940. The appellant had not been there since 1933 and his entry to Canada as a tourist from Bermuda was fictitious. The residence he built at Pinehurst in North Carolina, presum\u00adably with his other activities in the United States, con\u00advinced the tax authorities of that country that he was a resident there for the purposes of its Income Tax Act. Assuming that to be a fact, a man may be a resident of more than one country for revenue purposes. The fre\u00adquency with which he comes to Canada and what the President described as the routine of his life are impor\u00adtant matters in coming to a conclusion, and I agree with that arrived at by the President.\nThe appellant seeks to make himself a sojourner as he carefully remained in 'Canada for a period or periods amounting to less than 183 days during each year. This attempt fails. The family ties of his wife, if not of himself, the erection of a substantial house, the retention of the ser\u00advants, together with all the surrounding circumstances, make it clear to me that his occupancy of the house and his activities in Canada comprised more than a mere temporary stay therein.\nThe appellant developed an argument based upon the words \"during such year\" at the end of paragraph (a). These words were added by the commissioners charged with the duty of the 1927 revision of the statutes and were continued until the amendment of 1942. That amendment is in the following terms:\u2011\n9. (1) There shall be assessed, levied and paid upon the income during the preceding year of every person, other than a corporation, or joint stock company,\n(a) residing or ordinarily resident in Canada at any time in such year; or\n(b) who sojourns in Canada in such year for a period or periods amounting to one hundred and eighty-three days;\nAttention was called to the change from \"during\" to \"at any time in.\" This amendment does not, of course, govern, since it is the year 1940 in respect of which the appellant is assessed, but it is argued that the amendment shows that a change was intended to be made. That this is not the case appears by subsections 2 and 3 of section 21 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1927, chapter 1:\u2011\n2. The amendment .of any Act shall not be deemed to be or to involve a declaration that the law under such Act was, or was con\u00adsidered by Parliament to have been, different from the law as it has become under such Act as so amended.\n3. The repeal or amendment of any Act shall not be deemed to be or to involve any declaration whatsoever as to the previous state of the law.\nReliance was placed upon the decisions in The Queen v. Anderson[7], and Bowes v. Shand[8], but these deci\u00adsions were concerned with entirely different matters and do not affect what is to be determined here. \"During such year\" cannot certainly mean throughout the whole year, as the same phrase is used in (b). In each case it refers back to \"the preceding year\" in the body of section 9; that is, the year for which the assessment on income is to be made is the same as that in which the residing or sojourning occurs.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nTASCHEREAU J. (dissenting)\u2011This is an appeal from a judgment rendered by the Honourable Mr. Justice Thor-son, President of the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nIt raises the important and difficult question of deter-mining the true meaning of the words \"residing or ordin\u00adarily resident in Canada\", that are found in the Income War Tax Act. The facts that brought about this liti\u00adgation are the following:\u2011\nThe appellant, Percy Walker Thomson, was born in Saint John, N.B., and lived there until he retired from business. He then became a resident of Rothesay, in the County of Kings, a short distance from Saint John, where he lived in 1923. During that year, he had a dispute with the, tax assessors, and decided to leave Canada and establish his home in a different country.\nThe evidence reveals that, since moving from Canada, he spent most of his time in the United States, living in Pinehurst, originally in rented houses and later in a house that he built himself, at a cost of nearly $100,000. From 1925 to 1931, he paid very few visits to Canada, but from 1932 to 1941 inclusive, he spent the summers in Canada, first in St. Andrews, and from 1935, in a house that he built at Riverside, N.B. It was while he was occupying that house in 1941 that the Income Tax Department at Saint John, N.B., requested him to file a return for the year 1940. The appellant denied his liability, stat\u00ading that as he understood the Canadian law, he was not compelled to file any income tax statement here, because he was visiting Canada only as a tourist. The Income Tax Department decided then to issue an arbitrary assessment against him for the year 1940, based on a yearly income of $50,000; with this letter was an official bill imposing a tax of $21,122, with interest amounting to $480.31, making a grand total of $21,602.31, the whole payable as of October 13th, 1941.\nThe appellant gave notice of appeal pursuant to section 58 of the Income War Tax Act, and on April 6th, 1942, the Minister of National Revenue issued his decision, affirming the said assessment, on the ground that the facts disclosed that the appellant was \"residing or ordinarily resident\" in Canada during the year 1940, and hence was subject to income tax as provided by paragraph (a) of section 9 of the Income War Tax Act. The appellant appealed to the Exchequer Court of Canada but his appeal was dismissed with costs.\nSection 9 reads in part as follows:\u2011\nThere shall be assessed, levied and paid upon the income during the preceding year of every person\n(a) residing or 'ordinarily resident in Canada during such year; or\n(b) who sojourns in Canada for a period or periods amounting to one hundred and eighty-three days during such year.\nThe learned President reached the conclusion that the appellant had spent the following number of days in St. Andrews, N.B., since 1935: 1935-156 days, 1936-138 days, 1937-169 days, 1938-145 days, 1939-166 days, 1940-159 days, 1941-115 days. He also stated that the question of whether a person is ordinarily resident in one country or in another, cannot be determined solely by the number of days that he spends in each, but that he may be ordin\u00adarily resident in both, if his stay in each is substantial and habitual and in the normal and ordinary course of his routine of life.\nAccording to his views the terms \"residing\" and \"ordin\u00adarily resident\" found in the Income War Tax Act have no technical or special meaning, and the question whether in any year a person was residing or ordinarily resident in Canada within the meaning of the section, is a question of fact. He finally came to the conclusion that in 1940 the appellant was \"residing or ordinarily resident\" in Canada. On this point he says:\u2011\nThere is no substance in the appellant's contention that when he was at East Riverside he was merely sojourning there. There was nothing of a transient character about his stay there. He lived there regularly with his wife and family and his staff of servants. The house at East Riverside was a permanent one. He kept a housekeeper and his wife there throughout the year and the house was always available to him as his place of abode. The fact that he chose to stay there only while the weather made it pleasant to play golf is quite imma\u00adterial and does not affect the question. His liability to income tax assessment based upon residence cannot be determined by the fact that when it was too cold to play golf at East Riverside, he chose to go to Pinehurst to play golf there. Nor is the question of residence deter-mined by the number of days spent at East Riverside. The regular and usual relationship implied in the term \"residing\" is present this case. He stayed at East Riverside during a substantial part of each year, and his stay was habitual. Moreover he resided at East Riverside in the ordinary course of his life. There was nothing of an unusual or casual character about it. He lived and played there as long as it suited his pleasure to do so. His residence at East Riverside was in the course of the regular, normal and usual routine of his life. In my opinion the facts are conclusive that in. 1940 the appellant was both residing and ordinarily resident in Canada within the meaning of sec\u00adtion 9 (a) of the Act and I so find. Section 9 (b) has nothing to do with the matter.\nMany cases have been cited by the respondent, but in examining these cases which are all British cases, it is very important to find out if the law applicable is the same as the one which governs us, and if the words that have been the subject of interpretation by the British courts have the same meaning as those used in our Statute.\nThe first distinction that must be taken note of is that in England the finding of the Commissioners on a ques\u00adtion of fact is final, and not subject to review by the higher courts, the jurisdiction of which is limited to ques\u00adtions of law. It was held by the House of Lords that the question whether a person was a resident of England or not was a question of fact for the sole determination of the Commissioners. And in many of those cases their Lordships felt that, although they would have probably come to a different conclusion had they been the Com\u00admissioners, they could not possibly intervene. The situa\u00adtion before this Court is, of course, entirely different, and it is clearly open to us to hold that certain facts, not contested by the parties, satisfy or not the meaning of a particular word found in the provisions of an Act of Parliament.\nAnother distinction of paramount importance between the British and the Canadian Acts is that the words \"residing\" and \"ordinarily resident\" have not, in my judgment, a similar meaning. In the former case, they are singled out, and have been taken in their ordinary meaning, while in the Canadian Statute, being grouped together, they have a technical signification, which may not be ignored.\nAs it has already been said, these words are very flexible and elastic. They take colour in the context in which they are used, and may have a great variety of meanings according to the subject matter and the purposes of the Legislature, and the courts must consequently attrib\u00adute to them a signification that will give effect to the legislative will.\nIn Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Lysaght[9], Lord Buckmaster said at page 391:\nIt may be true that the word \"reside\" or \"residence\" in other Acts may have special meanings, but in the Income Tax Acts it is, I think used in its common sense * * *\nAnd in Sif ton, v. Sifton[10], Lord Romer said at page 675:\u2011\nTheir Lordships' attention was called during the arguments to numerous authorities in which the Court has been called upon to con\u00adsider the meaning of the words \"reside\" and \"residence\", and the like. But these authorities give their Lordships no assistance in construing the present will. The meaning of such words obviously depends upon the context in which the words are used. A condition, for instance, attached to the devise of a house that the devisee should reside in the house for at least six weeks in a year can present no difficulty. In some contexts the word \"reside\" may clearly denote what is sometimes called \"being in residence\" at a particular house. In other contexts it may mean merely maintaining a house in a fit state for residence.\nMoreover, in the majority of these cases, the taxpayer was held liable, not because his visits to England were of such a nature that they were considered sufficient to qualify him as a \"resident\", but for the reason that he had never ceased to be a resident of England, and that his occasional absences had never deprived him of his status of British resident.\nFor instance, in the case of Lloyd v. Sulley[11], it was held that the taxing provisions extended to a person who is not for a time actually residing in the United Kingdom, but who has constructively his residence there, because his ordinary place of abode and his home is there, although he is absent for a time from it, however long continued that absence may be. It was found that Lloyd's ordinary residence was at Leghorn, England, and therefore he was chargeable under the Act.\nA more striking example of the application of this principle may be found in the case of Levene v. Inland, Revenue Commissioners[12]. In that case Viscount Sumner said, speaking of Mr. Levene :\u2011\nThe evidence as a whole disclosed that Mr. Levene continued to go to and fro during the years in question, leaving at the beginning of winter and coming back in summer, his home thus remaining as before. He changed his sky but not his home. On this I see no error in law in saying of each year that his purpose in leaving the United Kingdom was 'occasional residence 'abroad only.\nBut in the case at bar, the facts are entirely different. The appellant left Canada in 1923, after having severed all his business connections, and after having made public his intention of ceasing to be a resident of 'Canada. Since moving from Canada, he lived with his family mostly in the United States, as indicated by the following figures: 201 days in 1925; 240 in 1926; 238 in 1927; 351 in 1928; 353 in 1929; 321 in 1930; 319 in 1931; 199 in 1932; 227 in 1933; 182 in 1934; 209 in 1935; 195 in 1936; 196 in 1937; 220 in 1938; 199 in 1939; 206 in 1940; 250 in 1941.\nFor some years he lived in rented houses in Pinehurst, North Carolina, building a house there in 1930, and for the years 1930 to 1942, he paid the United States income taxes as a resident of the United States. From 1925 to 1931 he spent the following number of days in Canada: 102 days in 1925; nil in 1926; nil in 1927; 2 in 1928; 12 in 1929; 44 in 1930; 2 in 1931.\nIt seems clear that since 1923 he had definitely left Canada and this fact was coupled with his avowed inten\u00adtions of doing so permanently. In 1928, when he came back to Canada for a period of two days, it was for the purpose of settling with the proper authorities a balance of $180.40 which he owed for income tax. At that time, he was told that all his liability under the Act up to 1927 had been discharged, and that he would not become tax-able until his status had changed. It was acknowledged that having left Canada, with a permanent purpose, with what has been called the animus manendi in his new settled abode, he had unquestionably ceased to be a resi\u00addent of this country.\nIt is now claimed that because from 1932 to 1934, he spent the summers at St. Andrews, and from 1935 to 1941, at East Riverside, he falls within the provisions of the Income War Tax Act, having become a \"resident or ordinarily resident\" of Canada.\nWith this view I cannot agree. Of course, during that period of time, Thomson had a dwelling place in Canada, a temporary residence. But this is far from saying that he was \"residing or ordinarily resident in Canada\".\nIt is clear, I think, that in the charging section of the Act the words \"ordinarily resident\" mean \"in most cases\", \"usually\", \"commonly\", and is obviously stronger than \"temporarily\" which is the qualification that may be given to the occasional visits that Thomson made when he came to his country house to spend the summer in Canada.\nThe context further indicates that the words \"ordinar\u00adily resident\" are broader than the word \"residing\", and that the former were used to cover a field that the latter did not occupy. The aim of Parliament was to tax, not only the residents of Canada, those who have here their permanent home, their settled abode, but also those who live here most of the time, even if they are absent on temporary occasions. The first group comes under the classification of \"residents\", and the second under that of \"ordinarily residents\".\nThe fundamental error of the court below has been, I believe, to consider Thomson as a resident of Canada, making occasional visits to the United States, when .he should have been classified as a resident of the United States, making occasional visits to Canada. The retain\u00ading of his Canadian citizenship has no bearing upon the matter. Nationality is not an ingredient for the purpose of the Act. Residents are taxed, not Canadians; but residents within the meaning of the Act, and not persons who have left this country since several years, and who, like many citizens of the United States and other coun\u00adtries, come here as tourists to enjoy the climate of our summer months. As Viscount Sumner said in the Levene case[13] \"they change their sky, but not their home\". The status of \"residents or ordinarily residents\" is not acquired by these periodical visits to Canada.\nI do not think that it has ever been the intention of Parliament to say so, and it would take much clearer words than those used in the Statute, to convince me that the' present appellant and those who have residences or lodges in Canada, and who elect to occupy them at regular annual intervals, are subject to income tax.\nThere are two other cases with which I would like to deal before concluding. The first one is the case of Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Lysaght[14], decided by the House of Lords. I may say that I do not think that this case is binding. Lysaght was held liable, but their Lord-ships came to the conclusion that they could not review the finding of facts of the Commissioners, and some of them expressed the view that they would not have neces\u00adsarily reached the same conclusion if their jurisdiction had not been limited to questions of law.\nThe case of Cooper v. Cadwaladar[15], decided by the First Division of the Court of Exchequer (Scotland), is the case of an American citizen living in the United States, who owned shooting rights in Scotland, where he spent a few months annually, and who was held liable in Scot-land for income tax. I feel quite confident that no Cana\u00addian court, in similar circumstances, would hold that such a person, in view of the provisions of our Act, is a \"resi\u00addent\" and therefore liable.\nFor the above mentioned reasons, I believe that the appellant is not liable, and that the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout.\nRAND J.\u2011The appeal raises a question of interpretation of the charging section of the Income War Tax Act. The appellant has been assessed on income received for the year 1940 and his liability depends on whether he is within the following provisions of section 9:\n9. There shall be assessed, levied and paid upon the income during the preceding year of every person\n(a) residing or ordinarily resident in Canada during such year; or\n(b), who sojourns in Canada for a period or periods amounting to one hundred and eighty-three days during such year. He claims that during 1940 he was neither residing nor ordinarily resident in Canada, nor did he sojourn here for the number of days specified.\nThe material facts may be shortly stated. Born in Saint John, New Brunswick, in 1872, the appellant lived in that city and later at the village of Rothesay, a short distance from it, until 1923 and in that time had become a man of means. As the result of a dispute over assessment by the village, he took up arms against what has become a sea of taxing troubles, sold his home, declared Bermuda to be his domicile, and proceeded to that island; and at the end of a week, armed with a British passport obtained there, returned to the mainland to set up residence in the United States. This continued until 1930, with his chief abode at Pinehurst, North Carolina. There in that year he built an expensive dwelling which ever since has been kept in readi\u00adness for occupancy. In 1932, marking his return to Canada, he rented a house at St. Andrews, New Brunswick, where he spent a summer season of 134 days. This was repeated during the next two years, with 134 days in 1933 and 81 days in 1934. In the latter year he built a house at East River-side near Rothesay, costing, with furniture, close to $90,000. The reason given for this was his wife's desire to be near her relatives and friends in New Brunswick, but he pro-tests against harbouring any like sentiment. Since then and up to 1942, between May and October he has spent there an average of 150 days each year. After the season at East Riverside, his life has centered around Pinehurst, with a stay of a month or two at Belleair, Florida. Dur\u00ading that time, the New Brunswick house is closed except the quarters of a housekeeper and wife which are open the year around; but it could at any time become a winter or all year home if desired. With him in these mass movements are his wife and only child, motor cars and servants, and at all three places he indulges himself as an addict of golf, to which he devotes most of his time and a substantial part of his money. His passport was renewed in 1933 for a further period of ten years at a British Consulate in the United States, and on it his domicile was again stated to be in Bermuda. Apart from the brief visit in 1923, leasing a house for one or two years which he never occupied, a stay of six days in 1926 and eight in 1938, that island was stranger to him for the twenty years after leaving Rothesay. From 1930 to 1941 he was taxed on income in the United States as a non-resident: but in 1942 he was classed as a resident and taxed accordingly.\nThe President of the Exchequer Court properly, I think, characterizing his motions in relation to Bermuda as \"pure farce\", found him to be ordinarily resident in Canada for the year in question and maintained the action; and from that judgment this appeal is brought.\nThe judgment treats as relevant a number of authori\u00adtative decisions on the Income Tax Act of the United Kingdom, including Cooper v. Cadwalader[16], Levene v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue[17], and Lysaght v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue[18], as they bear upon the interpretation of the words \"residing\" and \"ordinarily resident\". Mr. Inches, in an able argument, challenges the validity of that application on the ground that in the English Act these expressions, found in schedules, are in all cases used singly and in differing contexts and that there was raised no question of their effect upon one another in the collocation in which we have them in section 9, and their modification both by the phrase \"during such year\" and the word \"sojourns\" in paragraph (b). Before dealing with this contention, I think it desirable to refer briefly to the effect of those decisions upon the two expressions and, in the conno\u00adtations so found, to consider them in the juxtaposition in which they appear in our own Act.\nAs interpreted, the English Act uses the word \"resid\u00ading\" or the expression \"ordinarily resident\" in the sense of the general acceptation, without special or technical meaning; and the Tax Commissioners find first the actual circumstances of a case and then as fact whether they are within that acceptation. An appeal is allowed on a point of law, ,and where the person charged is appealing, the question invariably is whether there was any evidence to justify the finding. This strictly limited jurisdiction prevents us from assuming that a court sitting in appeal generally would have come to the same view of liability; and there are frequent intimations by individual judges that their own finding might have been different. But notwithstanding this limited function, these decisions reveal many aspects of residence under modern conditions and the extreme scope of interpretation to which the courts have felt themselves driven by the generality of the terms used and from the wide administrative jurisdiction conferred upon the Commissioners.\nIn Lysaght v. Commissioners, supra, \"residing\" was examined by the House of Lords and it must, I think, be said that the language of \"plain men\" was stretched to the breaking point to encompass the facts that had been found by the Commissioners to be residence. The enquiry lies between the certainty of fixed and sole resi\u00addence and the uncertain line that separates it from occa\u00adsional or casual presence, the line of contrast with what is understood by the words \"stay\" or \"visit\" into which residence can become attenuated; and the difference may frequently be a matter of sensing than of a clear differ\u00adentiation of factors.\nThe gradation of degrees of time, object, intention, continuity and other relevant circumstances, shows, I think, that in common parlance \"residing\" is not a term of invariable elements, all of which must be satisfied in each instance. It is quite impossible to give it a precise and inclusive definition. It is highly flexible, and its many shades of meaning vary not only in the contexts of different matters, but also in different aspects of the same matter. In one case it is satisfied by certain ele\u00adments, in another by others, some common, some new.\nThe expression \"ordinarily resident\" carries a restricted signification, and although the first impression seems to be that of preponderance in time, the decisions on the English Act reject that view. It is held to mean residence in the course of the customary mode of life of the per-con concerned, and it is contrasted with special or occasional or casual residence. The general mode of life is, therefore, relevant to a question of its application.\nFor the purposes of income tax legislation, it must be assumed that every person has at all times a residence. It is not necessary to this that he should have a home or a particular place of abode or even a shelter. He may sleep in' the open. It is important only to ascertain the spatial bounds within which he spends his life or to which his ordered or customary living is related. Ordin\u00adary residence can best be appreciated by considering its antithesis, occasional or casual or deviatory residence. The latter would seem clearly to be not only temporary in time and exceptional in circumstance, but also accom\u00adpanied by a sense of transitoriness and of return.\nBut in the different situations of so-called \"permanent residence\", \"temporary residence\", \"ordinary residence\", \"principal residence\" and the like, the adjectives do not affect the fact that there is in all cases residence; and that quality is chiefly a matter of the degree to which a person in mind and fact settles into or maintains or centralizes his ordinary mode of living with its accessories in social relations, interests and conveniences at or in the place in question. It may be limited in time from the outset, or it may be indefinite, or so far as it is thought of, unlimited. On the lower level, the expressions involv\u00ading residence should be distinguished, as I think they are in ordinary speech, from the field of \"stay\" or \"visit\".\nIn that view, it is scarcely open to doubt that if the word \"residing\" or the expression \"ordinarily resident\" had been used as in the English statute, it would have been impossible not to hold the appellant in the year in question both residing and ordinarily resident at East Riverside for the full 160 days of living there. His life is a good example of what Viscount Sumner in the Levene case [supra] had in mind when he spoke of the \"fluid and restless character of social habits\" to which modern life has introduced us. His ordinary residence through-out the year 1940 was indisputably within a strip of North America bordering on the Atlantic and running from Florida to New Brunswick. In that area, enabling him to keep pace with a benign climate, he had at least two and possibly three dwelling places, each of which coupled with his presence for the time being constituted, so far as he had any, his home. When he moved to East River-side, he moved not only himself but that home; ambulatory over a considerable part of the Continent, it became residence where so set up. From each radiated his living and interests and from them in turn he might make occasional departures or visits or temporary stays amounting even to limited residence.\nGiving to \"residing\" in paragraph (a) the fullest signification of which it is capable, \"ordinarily resident\" becomes superfluous. Mr. Inches contends for a construc\u00adtion of both and of \"sojourns\" purely in terms of time: that \"residing * * * during such year\" means a permanent residence throughout the year, without even temporary absence: \"ordinarily resident * * * during such year\" a predominant residence in Canada throughout the year but subject to temporary absences not amounting to resi\u00addence elsewhere: and \"sojourns\" connoting temporary residence.\nThis view is based largely on the expression \"during the year\", the legal meaning of which is argued to be \"throughout the year\". The case cited for this, The Queen v. Anderson[19], was a decision on the Poor Law, but the statutes are not in pari materia. In general the language of a taxing statute is to be taken in its colloquial or popular sense, and \"during the year\" in that acceptation signifies rather \"within the year\" or \"in the course of the year\" than \"throughout\". Although consistency of language is no longer a jewel in such legislation, yet the adoption of that expression for the various paragraphs of the section by the amendment in 1927 would appear to intend the same sense in all of them. Obviously \"throughout\" is inappropriate to paragraphs (b) and (e), and the others would be unwarrantably restricted in appli\u00adcation by such a construction. I think the suggested meanings are quite artificial and that nothing in the context of the section or in the Act requires us to give them to the expressions used. This makes it unnecessary to con\u00adsider whether \"ordinary residence\" must be capable of being extended in a fictional sense over the entire taxing year,\nI am not greatly concerned by overlapping or super\u00adfluous or even the virtual equivalence of terms. The language of the two paragraphs may not be a model of precision or artistry, and if redundancy is of such a nature as might raise serious doubt of the intention of Parlia\u00adment, some interpretative modification should be given; but when an intention to guard against omissions can fairly be drawn and there is no inconsistency or repug\u00adnancy, that would seem to make an end of the matter. If I may, I would adopt the language of Lord Selborne, L.C., in Hough u. Windus[20]:\nI adhere to an opinion, expressed by myself in the House of Lords more than ten years ago in Giles v. Melsom[21] which, unless I am much deceived, I have also heard in substance expressed by great masters of the law, that \"nothing can be more mischievous, than the attempt to wrest words from their proper and legal meaning, only because they are superfluous\".\nIt is sufficient for the purposes of this case that the mode or nature of the appellant's living in Canada brought him within the language of paragraph (a) and strictly it is unnecessary to deal further with paragraph (b). But in justice to Mr. Inches' argument, I think I should say that I differentiate the circumstances of this case from those contemplated, say, by rule 2 of Miscel\u00adlaneous Rules applicable to Schedule D under the Eng\u00adlish Act:\n2. A person shall not be charged to tax under this Schedule as a person residing in the United Kingdom, in respect of profits or gains received in respect of possessions or securities out of the United Kingdom, who is in the United Kingdom for some temporary purpose only, and not with any view or intent of establishing his residence therein, and who has not actually resided in. the United Kingdom at one time or several times for a period equal in the whole to six months in any year of assessment, but if any such person resides in the United Kingdom for the aforesaid period he shall be so chargeable for that year.\nThe Canadian Act taxes the person \"residing\" on the whole of his income, and provides only for a deduction of the amount of tax which the taxpayer may have been compelled to pay in a foreign country on the income aris\u00ading from sources there. In the English Act, on the con\u00adtrary, there is an elaborate classification of income with varying taxibilities and to hold a person liable for income from foreign possessions beyond what was received in the United Kingdom it is necessary under Schedule D to find not only that he resides in the United Kingdom but where he is a British subject, that he is both ordinarily resident and domiciled there. These taxes are, in theory, justified by the protection to life and property which the laws of the country imposing them may give. They are con\u00adceived to be intended to apply fairly and equally to all persons and an apparent gross violation of that assump\u00adtion is relevant to the enquiry into what Parliament by its general language has intended. That a person should be liable for tax upon the whole of his income even with the deduction mentioned merely because he has spent, say, two months in Canada as a temporary change of scene, whether or not part of his routine of life, is too unreasonable an intention to attribute to the language of Parliament unless it is beyond doubt. I would, there-fore, treat the word \"sojourns\" as applying to presence in Canada where the nature of the stay is either outside the range of residence or is what is commonly understood as temporary residence or residence for a temporary purpose.\nBut that qualified stay is not the character of the appellant's. Apart from any question of domicile which would appear to be still in New Brunswick, his living in Canada is substantially as deep rooted and settled as in the United States. In terms of time, Pinehurst may take precedence but at best it is a case of primus inter pares. He is at East Riverside as at his \"home\"; and the mere limitation of time does not qualify that fact: Attorney-General v. Coote[22]. That brings him within the most exacting of any reasonable interpretation of \"resides\" or \"ordinarily resident\".\nFor these reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nKELLOCK J.\u2011The facts have been sufficiently stated and it is not necessary to repeat them. The question for decision upon the facts is as to whether or not the appellant is, by reason of sec. 9(1) (a) of the statute, liable to be assessed for income tax. Clauses (a) and (b) of section 9, subs. (1), are as follows:\nThere, shall be assessed, levied and paid upon the income during the preceding year of every person\n(a) residing ordinarily resident in Canada during such year; or\n(b) who sojourns in Canada for a period or periods amounting to one hundred and eighty-three days during such year; To \"sojourn\" is defined in Murray's New English Dictionary as, to \"make a temporary stay in a place,\" \"to make stay,\" \"to tarry,\" \"to delay,\" while \"reside\" is defined as, \"to take up one's abode or station,\" \"to dwell permanently or for a considerable time,\" \"to have one's settled or usual abode,\" \"to live in or at a particular place.\"\n\"'Ordinarily\" is defined as \"in conformity with rule or established custom or practice,\" \"as a matter of regular practice or occurrence,\" \"in the ordinary or usual course of events,\" \"usually,\" \"commonly,\" \"as is normal or usual.\"\n\"Sojourn\" in clause (b) is to be contrasted with \"resi\u00addent\" in clause (a). A mere sojourn is not within the section unless the sojourn continues beyond the stated period. In my opinion, the appellant is not to be described as a sojourner in respect of the years in ques\u00adtion but as a person residing in Canada within the mean\u00ading of clause (a). There is not the slightest difference between his use of his Canadian home and that of either of his two American homes. All three establishments are essentially of the same nature and are equally regarded by him as \"homes\" in the same sense. The appel\u00adlant's residence in each is in the ordinary and habitual course of his life and there is no difference in the quality of his occupation in any one of them, although he may and does occupy each at different periods of the year.\nWith respect to the collocation of the word \"residing\" and the phrase \"ordinarily resident\" in clause (a), the phrase would seem to assume that a person may be resident in Canada without being \"ordinarily resident.\" It is not necessary to consider just what the distinction may be in any particular circumstances. The appellant is residing and is ordinarily resident here in respect of the years in question. Even if in no case could any distinc\u00adtion be drawn between \"residing,\" and \"ordinarily resi\u00addent\" so that the phrase must be treated as superfluous, there is in law no objection to so doing, as has been pointed out by my brother Rand in the course of his judgment, citing Hough v. Windus[23], per Lord Selborne, L.C., at 229. As to the appellant's argument that the phrase \"during such year\" is to be interpreted as meaning \"throughout the whole year,\" I do not agree. It would not be pos\u00adsible to apply the appellant's interpretation to the phrase as it appears in clause (e), and there is no reason to suppose that it was intended it should not have the same meaning wherever it appears in the subsection. The phrase is used throughout with reference to the phrase \"the preceding year\" in the early part of the subsection and in my opinion means \"in the course of.\"\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nESTEY J.\u2011This is an appeal from a judgment ren\u00addered in the Exchequer Court. The learned President of that Court has embodied in his judgment an exhaus\u00adtive statement of the facts, and as a consequence only a summary of the more relevant facts will be mentioned here.\nThe appellant resided at Saint John, New Brunswick, where he retired from business in. 1921. Thereafter he resided in Rothesay, New Brunswick, until 1923 when, following a dispute with the taxing authorities, he left Canada, announcing that he intended to take up residence in Bermuda. He did not remain in Bermuda and during the next few years did a good deal of travelling. Eventu\u00adally he selected Pinehurst, North Carolina, where in 1930 he built a residence which he still occupies.\nIn 1932 he spent the summer months at St. Andrews, New Brunswick, and again in 1933 and 1934. In the latter year he built and furnished another residence, at a cost of approximately $90,000, at East Riverside near Rothesay, New Brunswick. This residence at East River-side was built in order that his wife might have the opportunity of visiting and enjoying the friendship of her relatives and friends in Saint John and Rothesay, and that he himself might enjoy the golf course near the residence. He employed a family who occupied the ser\u00advants' quarters throughout the year, and though the rest of the house was closed during the appellant's absence, they looked after the premises. His practice was to move into this residence in the Spring and remain until some time in the Fall of each year. From 1935 to 1941, in\u00adclusive, he spent the following number of days in Canada:\ndays\n1935 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n156\n1936 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n138\n1937 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n169\n1938 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n145\n1939 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n166\n1940 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n159\n1941 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n115\nThis residence at East Riverside was maintained in a man\u00adner that made it always at his disposal and available at any time. When there his activities of life were centred about that point. It was to and from there he made his visits to other places. He and his family were then living there. It would appear that the appellant was maintain\u00ading more than one residence to which he could and did come and go as he pleased.\nIn the light of these circumstances, the officials of the Department of National Revenue asked the appellant to file an income tax return for the year 1940, and when he did not do so the Minister, by virtue of section 47, fixed the tax at $21,122.\nThe appellant does not question the amount but takes the position that he is not liable for income tax in Canada. The relevant sections of the Act are:\n9. There shall be assessed, levied and paid upon the income during the preceding year of every person\n(a) residing or ordinarily resident in Canada during such year; or\n(b) who sojourns in Canada for a period or periods amounting to one hundred and eighty-three days during such year; or\nThe appellant contends that he is not ordinarily resident in Canada under section 9 (a), but that he merely sojourns in Canada for a period less than 183 days in each year and is therefore not taxable under 9 (b).\nA reference to the dictionary and judicial comments upon the meaning of these terms indicates that one is \"ordinarily resident\" in the place where in the settled routine of his life he regularly, normally or customarily lives. One \"sojourns\" at a place where he unusually, casually or intermittently visits or stays. In the former the element of permanence; in the latter that of the temporary predominates. The difference cannot be stated in precise and definite terms, but each case must be deter-mined after all of the relevant factors are taken into con\u00adsideration, but the foregoing indicates in a general way the essential difference. It is not the length of the visit or stay that determines the question. Even in this statute under section 9 (b) the time of 183 days does not deter-mine whether the party sojourns or not but merely deter-mines whether the tax shall be payable or not by one who sojourns.\nThe words of Viscount Sumner in Inland Revenue Com\u00admissioners v. Lysaght[24], are indicative:\nI think the converse to \"ordinarily\" is \"extraordinarily\" and that part of the regular order of a man's life, adopted voluntarily and for settled purposes, is not \"extraordinary\".\nLord Buckmaster, with whom Lord Atkinson concurred, in the same case, at p. 248:\n* * * if residence be once established ordinarily resident means in my opinion no more than that the residence is not casual and un-certain but that the person held to reside does so in the ordinary course of his life.\nThe appellant selected the location, built and furnished the residence for the purpose indicated, and has main\u00adtained it as one in his station of life is in a position to do. In successive years his residence there was in the regular routine of his life acting entirely upon his own choice, and when one takes into consideration these facts, particu\u00adlarly the purpose and object of his establishing that resi\u00addence, the conclusion appears to be unavoidable that within the meaning of this statute he is one who is ordin\u00adarily resident at East Riverside, New Brunswick, and is therefore liable for income tax under section 9 (a).\nIt is well established that a person may have more than one residence, and therefore the fact of his residence in Pinehurst or Belleair does not assist or in any way affect the determination of this issue.\nThe appellant then contends that even if he be properly described as one ordinarily resident in Canada, he is not within the terms of section 9 (a) because he is not \"ordinarily resident in Canada during such year.\" He submits that the word \"during\" means throughout. As I under-stand his contention, it is that one must be a resident through the entire year and that when the appellant leaves Canada to go back to North Carolina or Florida he goes back to his residence in the United States, and is not then resident in Canada, and is therefore not resident in Canada throughout the year.\nIn the Oxford Dictionary \"during\" is defined as: \"Throughout the whole continuance of; in the course of\". In the Concise Oxford Dictionary it is defined as: \"Throughout, at some point in, the continuance of\". This term \"during\" appears several times throughout the Act and not only does it appear in subsections (a) and (b) of section 9, the clauses with which we are concerned, but also in other subsections of this same section. Apart from a specific provision or necessary implication, 'it would be assumed that Parliament intended these terms to have the same meaning throughout these subsections, and indeed throughout the Act.\nI agree with the learned President of the Exchequer Court that the word \"during\" means, as used in this statute, \"in the course of.\" Particularly in subsection (b) I do not know how any other meaning could be attributed thereto.. If one sojourns in Canada 183 days or more he is taxable; if less than that time he is not taxable. If he were here for only 184 days it would not matter where he was throughout the rest of the year. He would be in Canada a taxable period of 184 days during that year. Moreover, that appears to be the clear meaning of the word in certain other subsections and is the natural meaning, it seems to me, throughout the statute.\nThe appellant submitted two cases in support of his contention. Bowes v. Shand[25], where the contract called for the shipment of rice \"during the months of March and\/or April\". In fact the rice was shipped in February. The Lord Chancellor in the course of his judgment:\nTherefore, dwelling merely on the natural sense of the words, I must without hesitation conclude that the meaning of the contract must be one of these two things, either that the rice shall be put on board during the two months, i.e. not before the 1st of March nor after the end of April, or (and this construction, would require evidence of usage) the shipment must be made in a manner which has been described as continuous, and be completed during one of these months, and that the bill of lading should be given for the whole and complete shipment at that time.\nThe appellant particularly relied upon the remark of Lord Hatherly to the effect that \"during those months\" implied \"a continuous act of shipping\". It is obvious from reading the report that that did not mean continu\u00adous throughout the entire period of two months. It seems to me that a reading of the case supports the view that the word \"during\" should be interpreted as \"in the course of\".\nThe other case, The Queen v. Anderson[26], the words are found in a statute, and, having regard to the pro-vision of that statute, Lord Denman, C.J., gave to the word \"during\" the meaning that the appellant here con-tends for, but that is a very different statute and one which does not assist in the construction of the word as it appears in the Income War Tax Act.\nI agree with the conclusions arrived at by the learned President of the Exchequer Court and would therefore dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C.

S. 84 made any person, who failed to collect or withhold any sum as required by the Act, liable for the amount thereof.\nRespondent was a company incorporated in England. Its registered office was in London, England. It was registered in British Columbia as an extra-provincial company. It carried on the business of supplying electric power and light and operating electric railways and motor buses in British Columbia. Its head office was at Vancouver, B.C. During the period in question its whole business, except such formal administrative business as was required by the statutes governing it or by its articles of association to be transacted at its registered office, was conducted and carried on in Canada. All its directors and officers were residents of Canada. All stockholders' and directors' meetings were held in Canada. All its assets, except for certain records and books of account kept in London, England, and certain cash remitted there from time to time, were situate in Canada. All the income from which the dividends in question were paid was earned in Canada. Its register of members in respect of the stock in question was kept at London, but, pursuant to an Imperial statute, a Dominion register of members in Canada was kept at Vancouver, and stock registered in the Dominion register could be transferred only upon that register, and all other stock could be transferred only upon the register in London; but there was provision for change of registry. The Attorney General of Canada claimed on behalf of the Crown against respondent for amounts not withheld and remitted by respondent in respect of dividends paid by respondent to holders not resident in Canada of its cumulative perpetual preference stock. Such dividends were paid by respondent's registrar and paying agent in London after funds had been remitted to London from Canada.\nHeld: Respondent was a \"Canadian debtor\" within the meaning of said subs. 2 (a) of s. 9B and came within the aforesaid requirements of the Act, and in respect of the dividends in question was liable for amounts not withheld and remitted by it in accordance with such requirements. (Judgment of Thorson J., [1945] Ex. C.R. 82, reversed). Said provisions of the Act, applied in accordance with such holding, were intra vires (B.N.A. Act, s. 91, head 3; Statute of Westminster, 1931 (Imp.), particularly s. 3 thereof; its effect discussed) and must be given effect by Canadian courts.\nAPPEAL by the Attorney General of Canada from the judgment of Thorson J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing the action, which was brought by information of the Attorney General of Canada on behalf of His Majesty the King to recover from the defendant (a company incorporated in England, registered in British Columbia as an extra-provincial company, and carrying on its business in that province) the amount of 5 per cent. of the dividends paid or credited by the defendant during the period between April 1, 1933, and April 29, 1941, to non-residents of Canada on the defendant's fully registered 5 per cent. cumulative perpetual preference stock; and to recover interest on said amount claimed. The Attorney General alleged that in respect of such dividend payments the defendant was a \"Canadian debtor\" within the purview of s. 9B (2), paragraph a, of the Income War Tax Act, and that, having failed to deduct or withhold, from the amounts paid or credited to such non-residents of Canada, at the time of payment or crediting, the tax of 5 per cent. due under s. 9B (2) (and particularly said paragraph (a) thereof) of said Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 97, as amended by c. 41 of the statutes of Canada, 1932-1933) and to remit the same to the Receiver General of Canada (as provided by s. 9B (4) of said Act as so amended), the defendant was liable (under s. 84 of said Act as so amended) for the amounts which should have been withheld out of said dividends. The material facts of the case and the questions involved are sufficiently stated in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported.\nF. P. Varcoe K.C. and W. R. Jackett for the appellant.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and A. B. Robertson for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014The first question for determination in this appeal depends upon the construction of the expression \"Canadian debtors\" in subsection 2, paragraph (a), of section 9B of the Income War Tax Act, as enacted by section 9 of chapter 41 of the Statutes of 1932-33. Prior thereto, the main (but not the only) charging provision in the Act was section 9 wherein, speaking generally, Parliament dealt with incomes of persons who were resident, or ordinarily resident, or who sojourned in Canada, or who were employed or carrying on business therein, or who, not being resident in Canada, derived income from services rendered therein. In order to understand what Parliament was really doing by the particular enactment with which we are concerned, it is necessary to set forth subsections 1, 2, 3 and 4 of section 9B:\u2014\n9B. (1) In addition to any other tax imposed by this Act an income tax of five per centum is hereby imposed on all persons resident in Canada, except municipalities, or municipal or public bodies which in the opinion of the Minister perform a function of government, in respect of all interest and dividends paid by Canadian debtors, directly or indirectly to such persons, in a currency which is at a premium in terms of Canadian funds.\n(2) In addition to any other tax imposed by this Act an income tax of five per centum is hereby imposed on all persons who are non-residents of Canada in respect of\n(a) All dividends received from Canadian debtors irrespective of the currency in which the payment is made, and\n(b) All interest received from Canadian debtors if payable solely in Canadian funds except the interest from all bonds of or guaranteed by the Dominion of Canada.\n(3) In the case of bearer coupons or warrants, whether representing interest or dividends, the taxes imposed by this section shall be collected by the encashing agent or debtor who shall withhold five per centum of the obligation and remit the same to the Receiver General of Canada, provided that any encashing agent so withholding and remitting shall be entitled to recover one hundred per centum of the obligation from the debtor.\n(4) In the case of interest or dividends in respect of fully registered shares, bonds, debentures, mortgages or any other obligations, the taxes imposed by this section shall be collected by the debtor who shall withhold five per centum of the interest or dividend on the obligation and remit the same to the Receiver General of Canada.\nThe remaining subsections are subsidiary.\nAt the same session, section 84 was also added to the principal Act and it provides:\u2014\n84. Any person who fails to collect or withhold any sum of money as required by this Act or regulations made thereunder, shall be liable for the amount which should have been collected or withheld together with interest at the rate of ten per centum per annum.\n(2) Any person who fails to remit any sum of money collected or withheld as required by this Act, or at such time as the Minister may in special cases prescribe, shall in addition to being liable for such sum of money so collected or withheld, be liable to a penalty of ten per centum of the said sum together with interest at the rate of ten per centum per annum.\nSection 21 of the 1932-33 enactment provides that sections 9B and 84 of the principal Act as therein enacted shall be deemed to have come into force April 1st, 1933.\nIt will be noticed that in section 9B the expression \"Canadian debtors\" is used thrice. By subsection 1 an additional income tax of five per centum is imposed on all persons resident in Canada (except as stated) in respect of all interest and dividends paid by Canadian debtors but only when so paid \"in a currency which is at a premium in terms of Canadian funds.\" This subsection was amended in 1940 but the purpose for which I refer to it is not affected by the wording of the amendment.\nWhen we come to subsection 2 we find that a tax is imposed on non-residents of Canada. While in subsection 1 dividends and interest are dealt with together, in subsection 2, paragraph (a), reference is made to dividends only, and paragraph (b) deals with interest only. As to dividends, it does not matter in what currency the payment is made, but as to interest, it is only payments in Canadian funds that are covered. In both cases, however, the payments or receipts are from \"Canadian debtors.\" Paragraphs (c) and (d), which were added to subsection section 2 of section 9B in 1934, do not concern us, but paragraph (e), enacted by chapter 40, section 9, of the Statutes of 1935, should be noted:\u2014\n(e) All payments received directly or indirectly from Canadian debtors in respect of\n(i) any copyright, used in Canada, relating to books, music, articles in periodicals, newspaper syndicated articles, pictures, comics and other newspaper or periodical features, and\n(ii) any rights in and to the use of any copyrighted work subsequently produced or reproduced in Canada by way of the spoken word, print or mechanical sound on or from paper, composition, films or mechanical devices of any description.\nThe tax payable by virtue of this paragraph shall be deducted by the Canadian debtor from the amount paid or credited to such non-resident at the time of payment or crediting and shall be remitted to the Receiver General of Canada.\nThus, for the fourth time, \"Canadian debtors\" are mentioned. One purpose of section 9B as first enacted and as amended from time to time was to ease the foreign exchange situation, and the expression in question should receive the same meaning throughout the section.\nIt could hardly be contended that in subsection 1 or in paragraph (e) of subsection 2 the expression meant anything except an individual who resided in Canada or an incorporated company which\u2014in the sense in which that word is explained in well-known tax decisions\u2014resided in Canada. It can surely have no reference to the nationality of the individual so as to exempt an alien resident in Canada nor, if the expression is applicable, to that of a company. The same meaning should be applied to it when it is found in subsection 2, paragraph (a).\nIt is under that paragraph that the Attorney General of Canada on behalf of His Majesty the King filed an information in the Exchequer Court against British Columbia Electric Railway Co. Ltd., alleging that an income tax of five per centum had been imposed on the non-resident holders of the Company's five per cent. cumulative perpetual preference stock in respect of the dividends received by them from the Company from April 1st, 1933, to April 29th, 1941; that by subsection 4 of section 9B this tax was to be collected by the Company and remitted to the Receiver General of Canada and that this was not done. Therefore, under section 84, the amount which should have been collected was claimed, together with interest at the rate of ten per cent. per annum from the respective dates upon which the dividends became payable.\nThe action came on for trial before the President of the Exchequer Court upon written admissions and certain exhibits. From these, it appears that the Company was incorporated in England in 1897 under the Companies Acts, 1862 to 1893. Since 1898 it has been registered in British Columbia as an extra-provincial company under the 1897 Companies Act of that province; it carries on the business of supplying electric power and light and operating electric railways and motor buses in British Columbia, and has its head-office at Vancouver. During the entire period under review, its whole business, except such formal administrative business as was required by the statutes governing it or by its articles of association to be transacted at its registered office, was conducted and carried on in Canada. All its directors and officers were residents of Canada; all such stockholders' meetings as were held and all directors' meetings were held in Canada; all its assets, except for certain records and books of account kept in London, England, and certain cash remitted there from time to time, were situate in Canada; and all the income from which its dividends were paid was earned in Canada. There is no question about these facts and the others mentioned in the President's judgment and the Company does not dispute his conclusion on those facts that it was resident in Canada for income tax purposes.\nThe President decided that because of the use of the word \"dividends\" in paragraph (a), the word \"debtors\" therein would apply only to companies, and with that I agree. He then proceeded, however, to take a further step and it is there that I find it necessary to part company with him. That was to construe \"Canadian debtors\" as \"Canadian companies.\" This is substituting one phrase for another by applying the adjective \"Canadian\" to a noun that Parliament did not use and is, I think, an unjustifiable alteration of the language actually employed. Further difficulties in that connection would arise as to whether \"Canadian companies\" would include the respondent, which was incorporated in England and not in Canada although doing business and earning all its income here.\nThe President stated that a reference to various other sections of the Act indicated that a clear distinction was throughout drawn between a resident in Canada and a non-resident, both with respect to individuals and companies, and from that he concluded that, if it had been the intention in paragraph (a) to denote as payors, companies resident in Canada, the same words indicating residence would have been used. This does not follow. In 1932-33 Parliament chose to use a certain expression to which some meaning must be attached but there is no rule whereby that expression may not mean the same as a different set of words in other provisions of the same Act. Particularly is this so when one bears in mind the foreign exchange position with which Parliament was concerned in enacting section 9B. The President also expressed the view that if it were the intention that \"Canadian debtors\" should mean debtors who are resident in Canada, it would follow that there would be no duty to collect the tax imposed upon a company incorporated in Canada and that was not resident therein. That is so but, in my view, Parliament has covered the former class and not the latter. For the reasons indicated, the expression means the same throughout 9B and the meaning in paragraph (a) is \"Companies resident in Canada.\"\nThis being so, I should add that I do not understand that the Deputy Attorney General, either in the Exchequer Court or before this Court, argued alternatively that if the expression should not be interpreted as I have construed it and as he contended, it meant a person or company who owed a Canadian debt. I understood his position to be that if the Company's contention that Canadian debtors meant persons owing Canadian debts was right, then he would contend that the dividends constituted a Canadian debt. The Company did argue that and also that as it was incorporated in England the dividends, although declared here, were governed by English law and that, therefore, they were English and not Canadian debts. That argument also would alter and not construe \"Canadian debtors\" and fails for the same reason as the suggestion to read the phrase as if it were \"Canadian companies.\"\nAs to the second question raised in the appeal, viz., that on the construction of \"Canadian debtors\" I have concluded is the correct one, subsection 2, paragraph (a), of section 9B is ultra vires Parliament on the ground that it is extra-territorial legislation, the Statute of Westminster, 1931, and particularly section 3, leaves no basis for the argument. By head 3 of section 91 of the British North America Act, Parliament was authorized to make laws with reference to \"the raising of money by any mode or system of taxation.\" As long as Parliament legislates with reference to such matters, the permitted scope of the legislation is not restricted by any consideration not applicable to the legislation of a fully sovereign state. Such a state may tax persons outside its territory. Here it is clear that it has done so and the Canadian courts must obey the enactment. It is true that the Company might find itself in difficulties if holders of its preference stock chose to sue it in England for any taxes withheld by it under subsection 4 of section 9B but that is because the courts of one country will not enforce the fiscal legislation of another. The Company was under a duty to obey the injunction in subsection 4 and since it did not do so it is liable to the penalty prescribed by section 84.\nIn the admissions signed by the solicitors for the parties, it was admitted that between April 1st, 1933, and April 29th, 1941, the Company paid to holders of its five per cent. cumulative perpetual preference stock, whose addresses entered in its register of members as required by section 95 of the Imperial Companies Act of 1929 were elsewhere than in Canada, dividends upon the said stock amounting to $2,780,682.37, and that some, at least, of the said holders were non-residents of Canada. It was also agreed that should the Court decide that the Company should have deducted a tax of five per cent. from those dividends paid to any holders who were non-residents of Canada, a reference might be directed for the taking of an account to determine which of the said holders were non-residents of Canada within the meaning of section 9B of the Act. Such a reference should be directed, to be proceeded with before the Registrar of the Exchequer Court or, if the parties think it more convenient, before some one else to be agreed upon. The appellant is entitled to its costs of the action and appeal. The costs of the reference may be disposed of by a Judge of the Exchequer Court upon the confirmation of the report.\nThe judgment of Rand and Kellock JJ. was delivered by\nRand J.\u2014The respondent was incorporated in 1897 under the Companies Acts (Imperial), 1862-1893, and was registered as an extra-provincial company under the British Columbia Companies Act of 1897 on January 3rd, 1898. The head office is in Canada, all directors and officers are residents of Canada, and all meetings of shareholders and directors are held in Canada. The business of the Company is that of supplying electric power and light and operating electric railways and motor buses; and all of it, except such formal administrative matters as are required by statute or its articles of association to be transacted at its registry office in London, England, is carried on, all of its income earned and all of its assets, except certain records and books of account, are, in Canada. The Company's principal register is kept at London and in accordance with sec. 103 of the Companies Act (1929) (Imperial) a dominion register at Vancouver, on both of which holdings of its five per cent. cumulative perpetual preference stock are registered: a duplicate of the dominion register is kept in London and is deemed there to be part of the principal register. Stock registered in the dominion office can be transferred only upon that register and all other only upon the register in London, but there is provision for change of registry.\nThe controversy concerns dividends paid to the holders of the perpetual preference stock who reside in England. They were paid by the Company's registrar and paying agent in London after funds had been remitted to London from Canada. The Crown has assessed taxes under section 9B of the Income War Tax Act on these dividends, and the right to do so is the question presented for decision. Section 9B, subsections 2 and 4, are the charging provisions and are as follows:\n2. In addition to any other tax imposed by this Act an income tax of five per centum is hereby imposed on all persons who are non-residents of Canada in respect of\n(a) All dividends received from Canadian debtors irrespective of the currency in which such payment is made, and\n* * *\n4. In the case of interest or dividends in respect of fully registered shares, bonds, debentures, mortgages or any other obligations, the taxes imposed by this section shall be collected by the debtor who shall withhold five per centum of the interest or dividend on the obligation and remit the same to the Receiver General of Canada.\nIt is the contention of the Crown that under this language the Company is a Canadian debtor and that it is bound to deduct the tax imposed from the dividends. The President of the Exchequer Court construed the expression \"Canadian debtors\" in paragraph (a) to mean \"Canadian company debtors\" and \"Canadian company\" a company incorporated in Canada: and he dismissed the action.\nThe substitution of \"Canadian company debtors\" for \"Canadian debtors\" in paragraph (a) effects a subtle transfer of meaning which I think has escaped the President. Undoubtedly \"Canadian company\"\u2014and the expression is used in a number of instances in the Act\u2014imports a national characteristic, but that is due to the special and abstract nature of the concept \"company\" which is not present in the collocation \"Canadian debtors.\" What is done by the importation is in fact to qualify the meaning of \"Canadian debtors\" by introducing a new and significant word.\nThe same expression is used in paragraph (b) of subs. 2:\nAll interest received from or credited by Canadian debtors if payable solely in Canadian funds, except the interest from all bonds of or guaranteed by the Dominion of Canada.\nIf the meaning so given to \"Canadian\" in (a) is applied to (b), it means that (b) in relation to natural persons is applicable only to Canadian nationals. It would exempt foreign citizen debtors who might have spent their lifetime in Canada and whose nationality would have no relevancy to their being debtors in Canada. We would have also the apparent anomaly in (a) of Canadian companies carrying on their entire business outside of Canada being forced to pay over monies in respect of dividends which would never be in Canada and would move within or between foreign countries.\nIt was argued by Mr. Geoffrion that the expression, itself ambiguous, is in (a) limited to one of two interpretations, either Canadian company or foreign company, that in neither case was any further qualification to be attached, and that, construing the section in the light of the presumptions as to inherent limitations on jurisdiction and the rules of comity between states, the judicial choice must be the former. But I see nothing in the statutory matter to drive us to any such exclusive or limited alternatives, certainly not as the initial step in interpretation.\nHe argued also that \"Canadian debtor\" meant the debtor of a Canadian debt, i.e., a debt arising by virtue of Canadian law; that the dividend as a debt arose from English law and that it was therefore outside the scope of the provision. But there is nothing in the context of the statute that gives significance to the place of origin of the debt or the law from which it arises, and where the creditor is admittedly a non-resident, it would be quite unwarranted and in fact invidious to do so.\n\"Canadian debtor\" must, I think, be considered from the point of view of the Canadian Parliament. It can be said with some force that here we have a creditor in England who purchased his stock in England, who receives his dividend from the agent of the company at the registry office in England, and who looks only to the symbol of the company as that is present in England. But the creditor knows that the substance of the company is in Canada, that it \"keeps house and does its business\" there, a business completely within Canadian legislative power; and that he must look to Canada for the act of the company which declares the dividend and for the dividends themselves. The fact that the money is remitted in a lump sum to England and there distributed among the shareholders entitled is not significant. The cheques could have issued direct to the shareholders from the head office, as they were to shareholders shown as resident in Canada on the principal register and to all shareholders on the dominion register.\nThe imposition of the tax on the non-resident, subs. 2 (a), and the obligation of the debtor \"to withhold\" and to pay to the Receiver General, subs. 4, are express: and it is chiefly the latter provision by which, I think, are indicated the distinctive marks of the debtor intended to be charged: a person over whom there is actual power of compulsion; from whom in Canada payment of the debt is to proceed; on whom there is an obligation to pay the dividend qua dividend; and who, in the course of that act, is \"to withhold\". The expression, then, means a debtor resident in Canada by whom the act of paying the dividend as such is, under the obligation itself, to be initiated in and the payment to proceed from this country.\nIt may be and doubtless is the case that such an exercise of taxing power or, as it may be called, exacting power, is so extraordinary that the court should require a clear identification of any relation to which it is proposed to be applied. With the policy of legislation we have, of course, nothing to do, but I think the subject-matter with reference to which the non-resident is taxed is here clearly identified, and that it embraces the correlatives of the obligations of the respondent under consideration.\nThe legislative competence of Parliament to tax non-residents was challenged. It is argued that the power \"to make laws having extra-territorial operation\" as enacted by the Statute of Westminster, 1931, section 3, is subject to two conditions: that the legislation deal with matter assigned by the British North America Act to the federal legislature; and that it be of such a nature as under international public or private law would be accorded extra-territorial effect. It is then contended that the power of the Dominion under section 91 (3), \"the raising of money by any Mode or System of Taxation,\" does not extend to taxation of non-citizens outside the boundaries of Canada; and that international comity, apart from any rule against giving effect in one state to fiscal measures of another state, would not for any purpose recognize the validity of, much less enforce, what Parliament is said to purport by this legislation to do.\nThe power of the Dominion to tax is to be interpreted as being \"as plenary and as ample within the limits prescribed by section 92 (91) as the Imperial Parliament in the plenitude of its power possessed or could bestow\": Hodge v. The Queen[2]. But there is obviously a distinction between the standing of legislative enactments by a sovereign state within its boundaries and beyond them. In an effective sense, a declaration by such a legislature that it imposes a tax upon a citizen of a foreign country toward whom there is no internationally recognized bond or relation, is, beyond the territories of that state, a futile act, and it is futile for the reason that beyond them it is incapable of enforcement. Within the state, however, it becomes an obligatory rule to be enforced whenever enforcement is feasible. The specific investment of extra-territorial power by section 3 of the Statute of 1931 was designed, no doubt, to remove the generally accepted limitation of colonial legislative jurisdiction, a limitation which the courts of the colony itself were bound to recognize: Macleod v. Attorney General for New South Wales[3], and any such jurisdictional inadequacy no longer hampers the legislative freedom of the Dominion. Within its field, there is now a legislative sovereignty. That the enactment of section 9B is an exercise of taxing power within that jurisdiction does not, I think, admit of doubt. It is an assessment uniformly imposed in respect of special items of a general class of defined subject-matter in an elaborated tax system; there is admitted jurisdiction over an act essential to the subject-matter, i.e., the act of performance of an obligation; and these, taken with the language used, satisfy the taxation criteria. Legislation so enacted will be effective in, and must be enforced by the courts of, this country. To what extent, if at all, it will receive recognition in the tribunals of foreign countries depends upon different considerations: but that circumstance, apart from its function in interpretation, is not one in which the local tribunal is interested.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and direct judgment against the respondent for such sum as may be found to be owing, with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: F.

The reasons for the adoption of Order 7355 are stated in the preamble: \"Whereas during the course of the war with Japan certain Japanese nationals manifested their sympathy with or support of Japan by making requests for repatriation to Japan and otherwise; And whereas other persons of the Japanese race have requested or may request that they be sent to Japan; And whereas it is deemed desirable that provisions be made to deport the classes of persons referred to above; And whereas it is considered necessary by reason of the war, for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada, that provision be made accordingly\". Section 2 then provides that \"(1) Every person of sixteen years of age or over, other than a Canadian national, who is a national of Japan resident in Canada and who, (a) has, since the date of declaration of war by the Government of Canada against Japan, on December 8, 1941, made a request for repatriation; or (b) has been in detention at any place in virtue of an order made pursuant to the provisions of the Defence of Canada Regulations or of Order in Council P.C. 946, * * * 1943, as amended by P.C. 5637, * * * 1945, and was so detained as at midnight of September 1, 1945; may be deported to Japan. (2) Every naturalized British subject of the Japanese race of sixteen years of age or over resident in Canada who has made a request for repatriation may be deported to Japan: Provided that such person has not revoked in writing such request prior to midnight the first day of September, 1945. (3) Every natural born British subject of the Japanese race of sixteen years of age or over resident in Canada who has made a request for repatriation may be deported to Japan; Provided that such person has not revoked in writing such request prior to the making by the Minister of an order for deportation. (4) The wife and children under sixteen years of age of any person for whom the Minister makes an order for deportation to Japan may be included in such order and deported with such person.\" Section 3 provides that \"Subject to the provisions of section 2 of this Order a request for repatriation shall be deemed final and irrevocable for the purpose of this Order or any action taken thereunder.\" Order 7356 refers to Order 7355 and further provides that \"Any person who, being a British subject by naturalization * * * is deported from Canada under the provisions of Order * * * 7355 * * * shall, as and from the date upon which he leaves Canada in the course of such deportation, cease to be either a British subject or a Canadian national.\" By Order 7357 provision is made for the appointment of a Commission \"to make inquiry concerning the activities, loyalty and the extent of cooperation with the Government of Canada during the war of Japanese nationals and naturalized persons of the Japanese race in Canada * * * with a view to recommending whether in the circumstances of any such case such person should be deported,\" and, also, to \"inquire into the case of any naturalized British subject of the Japanese race who has made a request for repatriation and which request is final under the said Order in Council and may make such recommendations with respect to such case as it deems advisable.\" (1)\nHeld that the Orders in Council, apart from the question as to the validity of their provisions upon which opinions are hereinafter reported, contain legislation that could have been adopted by\n(1) Full text of the three Orders in Council are hereinafter printed. Parliament itself; that under the War Measures Act the Governor General in Council was empowered to adopt any legislation which Parliament could have adopted; that such legislation was, expressly and impliedly, adopted because it was deemed necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada by reason of the existence of war; that the Governor General in Council was the sole judge of the necessity or advisability of these measures and it is not competent to any court to canvass the considerations which may have led the Governor General in Council to deem such Orders necessary or advisable for the objectives set forth.\u2014Re Gray (57 Can. S.C.R. 150); Fort Frances Pulp & Power Co. v. Manitoba Free Press ([1923] A.C. 695) and Reference re Chemicals ([1943] S.C.R. 1).\nPer Rand, Kellock and Estey JJ:\u2014Although the Orders in Council ceased to derive any force from the provisions of the War Measures Act from and after January 1, 1946, after that date, they derive their force from the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1946 by reason of the existence of the emergency therein referred to.\nHeld that subsections (1) and (2) of section (2) of Order 7355 are intra vires of the Governor General in Council.\nPer The Chief Justice and Kerwin, Hudson, Taschereau and Estey JJ.:\u2014The provisions of the three Orders in Council are intra vires, Hudson and Estey JJ. excepting subsection (4) of section 2 of Order 7355.\nPer Hudson, Rand, Kellock and Estey JJ:\u2014Subsection (4) of section 2 of Order 7355 (deportation of wife and children under 16 of person ordered to be deported) is ultra vires.\u2014Per Rand J.:\u2014It is ultra vires in relation to wives and children under 16 who do not come within the first two classes ((1) and (2) of s. 2 of 7355).\nPer Rand and Kellock JJ.:\u2014Subsection (3) of section 2 of Order 7355 in relation to the compulsory deportation of natural born British subjects resident in Canada is ultra vires.\nPer Kellock J.:\u2014Section 3 of Order 7355 is ultra vires insofar as it prevents such persons from withdrawing consent at any time and in any manner.\nPer Rand and Kellock JJ.:\u2014Order 7356 is intra vires insofar as it takes away incidental rights and privileges of persons of the Japanese race as Canadian nationals; but it is ultra vires to the extent that it provides for loss of the status of a British subject by naturalization.\nPer Rand J.:\u2014Order 7357 is not ultra vires, subject to the observance of the requirements of the Naturalization Act as to grounds for the revocation of naturalization.\nPer Kellock J.:\u2014Order 7357 is intra vires save insofar as it may purport to authorize a departure from the provisions of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914.\nPer The Chief Justice and Kerwin and Taschereau JJ.:\u2014The powers of the Governor General in Council, under section 3 of the War Measures Act, are not strictly limited to such \"deportation\" as means \"the forcible removal of aliens.\" Such word, in subsection (b), has not that exclusive meaning, and, according to quotations from reputed dictionaries, could well include the word \"exile\" which admittedly means the banishment of a national from his country. However, subsection (b) also contains the word \"exclusion\" which would be apt to cover the measures adopted through Order 7355. Moreover, assuming that these measures are not strictly and specifically contemplated by the use of these two words, they are undoubtedly covered by the general terms of the War Measures Act, the enumeration contained in the last part of section 3 being stated not to restrict the generality of the terms of the first part of that section.\nPer Rand J.:\u2014The words \"deport\" and \"repatriation\" are appropriate to the return to his native country of an alien. The power of Parliament to deal with aliens is unquestioned, and that field is under delegation to the Governor General in Council. The obligation of his own state to receive him must be deemed correlated with the power of the foreign state to expel him.\nPer Kellock J.:\u2014The consideration of the word \"deportation\" as the equivalent of \"to remove into exile\" or \"to banish\" involves the idea of penal consequences. Such a meaning is not apt in the case of citizens who have committed no offence nor, in modern times, in application to a national born citizen of a country on the assumption that some other country is under some obligation to receive him by reason of some previous connection of the citizen with that country. No country is under any obligation to receive the natural born citizen of another country and any attempt to force such a citizen upon another country would involve an infringement of sovereignty\u2014The consent of Japan through General MacArthur is a consent to \"repatriation,\" i.e. to restore a person to his own country and, thus, is no consent to the reception of natural born Canadians who have no country but Canada.\nPer Estey J.:\u2014The word \"deportation\" has been restricted to aliens in one case and applied to native-born in another. The standard dictionaries do not agree as to its exact meaning. Upon this reference, it is not necessary to precisely define the word. It is enough to emphasize that, as it is applied in law, it is a compulsory sending out of, or, as stated in the Oxford Dictionary, \"a forcible removal,\" and that, while it need not be restricted to aliens, it does apply to them.\nPer Estey J.:\u2014The terms of subsection (3) of section 2 of 7355 cannot be regarded as enacting compulsory deportation. The persons therein mentioned having expressed a desire to be repatriated to Japan, the Governor General in Council decided to facilitate their going by perfecting the necessary arrangements. This matter is more one of policy for the Government than a question of jurisdiction.\nSection 9 of Order 7355 provides that \"any person * * * who is detained pending deportation * * * shall * * * be deemed to be in legal custody,\" and section 5 of the War Measures Act enacts that \"no person who is held for deportation under this Act * * * shall be released upon bail or otherwise discharged or tried, without the consent of the Minister of Justice.\" Held that there is no conflict between these two sections. The words \"be deemed to be in legal custody\" in section 9 do not rule out any remedy provided for in section 5, and, more particularly, the wording of section 9 does not indicate any intention of the Order that the recourse to habeas corpus was thereby abolished.\nPer Kellock and Estey JJ.:\u2014The provisions of section 6 of Order 7355, relating to the sale of real and personal property of deportees by the Custodian of Enemy Property are not invalid as being repugnant to section 7 of the War Measures Act.\nREFERENCE by His Excellency the Governor General in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada in the exercise of the powers conferred by section 55 of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 35) of the following question: Are the Orders in Council dated the 15th day of December, 1945, being P.C. 7355, 7356 and 7357, ultra vires of the Governor in Council either in whole or in part and, if so, in what particular or particulars and to what extent?\nThe Order in Council referring this question to the Court is as follows:\n\"Whereas section 3 of the War Measures Act, chapter 206 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, provides as follows:\u2014\n3.

(1) Every person of sixteen years of age or over, other than a Canadian national, who is a national of Japan resident in Canada and who,\n(a) has, since the date of declaration of war by the Government of Canada against Japan, on December 8, 1941, made a request for repatriation; or (b) has been in detention at any place in virtue of an order made pursuant to the provisions of the Defence of Canada Regulations or of Order in Council P.C. 946, of the 5th day of February, 1943, as amended by P.C. 5637, of the 16th day of August, 1945, and was so detained as at midnight of September 1, 1945;\nmay be deported to Japan.\n(2) Every naturalized British subject of the Japanese race of sixteen years of age or over resident in Canada who has made a request for repatriation may be deported to Japan: Provided that such person has not revoked in writing such request prior to midnight the first day of September, 1945.\n(3) Every natural born British subject of the Japanese race of sixteen years of age or over resident in Canada who has made a request for repatriation may be deported to Japan: Provided that such person has not revoked in writing such request prior to the making by the Minister of an order for deportation.\n(4) The wife and children under sixteen years of age of any person for whom the Minister makes an order for deportation to Japan may be included in such order and deported with such person.\nThe Order further provided that a request for repatriation, made under the above provisions, would be deemed final and irrevocable for the purpose of the Order or any action taken thereunder after a fixed delay.\nThe Minister of Labour was thereby authorized to \"make orders for the deportation of any persons subject to deportation\"; to take such measures as he deemed advisable to arrange for the deportation and for the detention, transportation, etc., of the persons subject thereto, and generally to make such rules or regulations and employ such officers or adopt such measures as he would from time to time deem necessary for the purpose of carrying out the Order.\nCertain ancillary provisions are added to the Order with regard to property and belongings of the person being deported, or subject to deportation, or for the purpose of enabling the Minister to carry out the provisions of the Order. Of these ancillary provisions, section (9) alone need be reproduced verbatim:\u2014\n(9) Any person for whom an order for deportation is made and who is detained pending deportation or who is placed under restraint in the course of deportation by virtue of any order or measure made or taken under section 4 of the Order shall, while so detained or restrained, be deemed to be in legal custody. This Order in Council was given No. P.C. 7355 and the reasons for its adoption are stated in the preamble as follows:\u2014\nWhereas during the course of the war with Japan certain Japanese nationals manifested their sympathy with or support of Japan by making requests for repatriation and otherwise;\nAnd whereas other persons of the Japanese race have requested or may request that they be sent to Japan;\nAnd whereas it is deemed desirable that provisions be made to deport the classes of persons referred to above;\nAnd whereas it is considered necessary by reason of the war, for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada, that provision be made accordingly;\nOn the same day two other Orders in Council were adopted under numbers P.C. 7356 and P.C. 7357. The first of these (7356) refers to Order in Council 7355 whereby provision is made for the deportation of persons who, during the course of the war, have requested to be removed or sent to an enemy country\nor otherwise manifested their sympathy with or support of the enemy powers and have by such actions shown themselves to be unfit for permanent residence in Canada.\nIt orders that any person who, being a British subject by naturalization under the Naturalization Act, chapter 138, R.S.C. 1927, is deported from Canada under the provisions of Order in Council P.C. 7355 of the 15th of December, 1945,\nshall, as and from the date upon which he leaves Canada in the course of such deportation, cease to be either a British subject or a Canadian national.\nOrder in Council P.C. 7357 begins by stating that during the war particular measures with regard to persons of the Japanese race were made necessary by reason of their concentration along the Pacific Coast of Canada; that experience during the war in the Administration of Order in Council P.C. 946 of February 5th, 1943, providing for the control of persons of the Japanese race has indicated the desirability of determining whether the conduct of such Japanese persons in time of war was such as to make the deportation of any of them desirable in the national interest, and that it is deemed advisable to make provision for the appointment of a Commission to institute the investigation concerned. It is then ordered that a Commission consisting of three persons shall be appointed to make inquiry concerning the activities, loyalty and the extent of cooperation with the Government of Canada during the war of Japanese nationals and naturalized persons of the Japanese race in Canada in cases where their names are referred to the Commission by the Minister of Labour for investigation with a view to recommending whether in the circumstances of any such case such person should be deported. The Commission is given power, at the request of the Minister of Labour, to inquire into the case of any naturalized British subject of the Japanese race who has made a request for repatriation and which request is final, and to make such recommendations with respect to such case as it deems advisable. The Commission is to report to the Governor in Council. Any person of the Japanese race who is recommended by the Commission for deportation shall be deemed to be a person subject to deportation under the provisions of Order in Council P.C. 7355, which order shall then apply, mutatis mutandis, to such person. As a result of the deportation, the person in question shall cease to be either a British subject or a Canadian national. And, further, the Commission is given, for the purpose of all inquiries and investigations made pursuant to this Order, all the powers and authority of Commissioners appointed under part one of the Inquiries Act.\nAs will be seen, the latter two Orders in Council (7356-7357) have no operation except by reason of the first Order in Council (7355); the three Orders constitute one scheme, the validity of which depends upon the first Order in Council.\nI have outlined above the preamble of the first Order in Council. The Order contains certain definitions. \"Deportation\" is stated to mean the removal, pursuant to the authority of this Order (7355), of any person from any place in Canada to a place outside Canada. \"Deported\" is stated to mean removed or sent from Canada pursuant to the authority of this Order. \"Minister\" means the Minister of Labour. \"Request for repatriation\" means a written request or statement of desire to be repatriated or sent to Japan.\nThe Order establishes three categories of persons who may be deported to Japan. The first category includes every national of Japan, who is not also a Canadian national, of sixteen years of age or over, resident in Canada who was detained pursuant to the provisions of the Defence of Canada Regulations or of Order in Council P.C. 946 of February 5th, 1943, as amended by Order in Council P.C. 5637 of August 16th, 1945, at midnight of September 1st, 1945, the day before the formal unconditional surrender of the military forces of Japan.\nThe second category includes certain persons of the Japanese race of sixteen years of age or over resident in Canada, who have made written requests for repatriation. It includes either a national of Japan, a person who is a naturalized British subject, or a natural-born British subject, provided their requests were made before certain dates and were not revoked prior to the making by the Minister of an order for deportation.\nThe third category of persons includes the wife and children under sixteen years of age of any person against whom an order for deportation is made. They may be included in the order.\nThese Orders in Council are expressed to have been made under the authority of the War Measures Act, chapter 206 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927. It is stated and established that these Orders were made only after a suitable arrangement had been made with General MacArthur, Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers in Japan.\nFollowing the adoption of the Orders, representations were made to the Acting Minister of Justice by and on behalf of a number of Canadian organizations and societies expressing the opinion based on advice of legal counsel that the Orders were ultra vires and requesting a reference to the Supreme Court of Canada to test the question. An action had even been commenced against the Attorney General of Canada for a declaration that the Orders in Council were ultra vires, illegal and void. It was, therefore, felt that, in the circumstances, in the public interest, the opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada should be obtained upon the question of the validity of the aforesaid Orders in Council, because, in the opinion of the Acting Minister of Justice, they raised an important question of law touching the interpretation of Dominion legislation. Therefore, His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Acting Minister of Justice and under and by virtue of the authority conferred by section 55 of the Supreme Court Act referred the following question to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration:\u2014\nAre the Orders in Council, dated the 15th day of December, 1945, being P.C. 7355, 7356, and 7357, ultra vires of the Governor in Council either in whole or in part and, if so, in what particular or particulars and to what extent?\nIn The matter of a Reference as to the validity of the regulations in relation to Chemicals enacted by the Governor General of Canada on the 10th day of July, 1941, P.C. 4996, and of an Order of the Controller of Chemicals, dated the 16th day of January, 1942, made pursuant thereto,[1] this Court held that the authority vested in the Governor General in Council by the War Measures Act (its constitutional validity having been finally determined in Re Gray,[2] and the Fort Frances case[3], is legislative in its character; and an Order in Council passed in conformity with the conditions prescribed by, and the provisions of, that Act, i.e. a legislative enactment such as should be deemed necessary and advisable by reason of war, has the effect of an Act of Parliament, although the final responsibility for the acts of the Executive Government rests upon Parliament. Parliament has not abdicated its general legislative powers nor abandoned its control. The subordinate instrumentality, which it has created for exercising the powers, remains responsible directly to Parliament and depends upon the will of Parliament for the continuance of its official existence. Parliament has not effaced itself, and has full power to amend or repeal the War Measures Act, or to make ineffective any of the Orders in Council passed in pursuance of its provisions; and if, at any time, Parliament considers that too great a power has been conferred upon the Governor General in Council, the remedy lies in its own hand.\nOn this occasion it was stated by Sir Lyman Duff, then Chief Justice, that (p. 9):\u2014\nThe War Measures Act came before this Court for consideration in 1918 in Re Gray2, and a, point of capital importance touching its effect was settled by the decision in that case. It was decided there that the authority vested in the Governor General in Council is legislative in its character and an order in council which had the effect of radically amending the Military Service Act, 1917, was held to be valid. The decision involved the (principle, which must be taken in this Court to be settled, that an order in council in conformity with the conditions prescribed by, and the provisions of, the War Measures Act may have the effect of an Act of Parliament.\n* * *\nThe judgment of the Privy Council in Fort Frances Pulp & Power Co. v. Manitoba Free Press Co.[4] laid down the principle that, in an emergency such as war, the authority of the Dominion in respect of legislation relating to the peace, order and good government of Canada may, in view of the necessities arising from the emergency, displace or overbear the authority of the provinces in relation to a vast field in which the provinces would otherwise have exclusive jurisdiction.\nBut any Order made under the War Measures Act is subject to two specific provisions: The Governor in Council is empowered to do and authorize such acts and things, and to make such orders and regulations, provided there exists a real or apprehended war, invasion, or insurrection; and also provided that the act or thing done, or the order or regulation made, are such that the Governor in Council, by reason of real or apprehended war, deems them necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada.\nAnd at p. 12 of the Chemicals Reference[5] Sir Lyman Duff states:\u2014\nThe duty rests upon the Executive Government to decide Whether, in the conditions confronting it, it deems it necessary or advisable for the safety of the state to appoint such subordinate agencies and to determine what their powers shall be.\nThere is always, of course, some risk of abuse when wide powers are committed in general terms to any body of men. Under the War Measures Act the final responsibility for the acts of the Executive rests upon Parliament. Parliament abandons none of its powers, none of its control over the Executive, legal or constitutional.\nThe enactment is, of course, of the highest political nature. It is the attribution to the Executive Government of powers legislative in their character, described in terms implying nothing less than a plenary discretion, for securing the safety of the country in time of war. Subject only to the fundamental conditions explained above (and the specific provisions enumerated), when Regulations have been passed by the Governor General in Council in professed fulfilment of his statutory duty, I cannot agree that it is competent to any court to canvass the considerations which have, or may have, led him to deem such Regulations necessary or advisable for the transcendent objects set forth. The authority and the duty of passing on that question are committed to those who are responsible for the security of the country\u2014the Executive Government itself, under, I repeat, its responsibility to Parliament. The wards are too plain for dispute: the measures authorized are such as the Governor General in Council (not the courts) deems necessary or advisable.\nThe Co-operative Committee on Japanese Canadians appeared through Counsel in the matter and submitted that the question referred to the Court should be answered in the affirmative, that is to say, that the Orders in Council are wholly ultra vires of the Governor in Council.\nFirst, they said that the word \"deportation\" means, and means exclusively, \"the forcible removal of aliens\"; and that it is not apt to describe the sending to Japan of Canadian citizens who were either born or naturalized in Canada and who have no connection with Japan other than that of \"race\". According to them, \"deportation\" is the return of an alien to the country from whence he came and not the exile or banishment of a citizen to an alien country.\nIn the second place, they said that the purpose of the enumeration in section 3 of the War Measures Act was to indicate that the powers of the Governor in Council \"could go even thus far\", or to indicate \"marginal instances\", or \"cases in which there might be such doubt that it was better to mention them specifically\". For that contention, certain dicta in the Gray case,[6] are referred to.\nThey added that the banishment of subjects by any court or body for any other reason than conviction of felony is expressly prohibited by heavy penalties by the Habeas Corpus Act 31, Charles II, chapter 2, section 60.\nMoreover, they said that the banishment of nationals, particularly on racial grounds, is contrary to the accepted principles of International Law, such as may be gathered from Attorney General of Canada v. Cain[7].\nThey also contended that various provisions of the Orders in Council are repugnant to the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 4-5 George V, chapter 17, and that the latter is an Act to which the Colonial Laws Validity Act applies. Their conclusion is, of course, that if the Parliament of Canada did not have the power to make laws repugnant to the Imperial Statute, it could not delegate such power and could not be assumed to have attempted to do so.\nThen they urged that section 9 of Order in Council P.C. 7355 does away with the right to the writ of habeas corpus and, moreover, conflicts with section 5 of the War Measures Act; and they contended that none of the sections, including said section 9, are severable from the three Orders in Council, so that it cannot be said that the Governor in Council would have passed the Orders at all if some of the sections thereof were being left out, all the provisions of the Orders in Council being interdependent. They argued that it is impossible to say that the Governor in Council would not have abandoned the whole scheme if parts of it had been known to have been ultra vires.\nA further argument was put forward on the ground that the words \"Japanese race\" are so vague as to make the provision unenforceable and, for that reason also, the Orders in Council should be set aside.\nIn respect of the last argument, the Court indicated immediately that it would not be taken into consideration as the question referred to us is whether the Orders in Council are ultra vires, and the point whether some words or sentences therein are vague does not fall within that question. The Orders in Council would not be ultra vires even if some parts thereof were vague.\nThe attack upon the use of the word \"deportation\" is addressed, of course, to the word in the War Measures Act, for, in so far as the Orders in Council themselves are concerned, they contain a definition of the word which is said to mean, for the purposes of the Orders,\nthe removal pursuant to the authority of this Order of any person from any place in Canada to a place outside Canada.\nThere can be no doubt that \"deportation\" so understood clearly covers the cases and categories of persons affected by the Orders.\nBut section 3 of the War Measures Act, after stating that the Governor in Council may do and authorize such acts and things, and make from time to time such orders and regulations, as he may by reason of the existence of real or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection deem necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada, adds:\u2014\nand for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms, it is hereby declared that the powers of the Governor in Council shall extend to all matters coming within the classes of subjects hereinafter enumerated;\nand among the matters enumerated are (section (b)) \"Arrest, detention, exclusion and deportation\". The contention of the Co-operative Committee is that, as \"deportation\" is specifically mentioned in that sub-section of section 3, the powers of the Governor in Council, under the War Measures Act, are strictly limited to such \"deportation\" as means \"the forcible removal of aliens.\"\nBut, to begin with, it is far from being sure that the word \"deportation\" is limited to what the Co-operative Committee contends. Counsel for the Attorney General of Canada was able to quote several definitions from standard dictionaries where the meaning of the word is stated to be more extensive. The New English Dictionary, edited by Sir James Murray, LL.D., and Henry Bradley, M.A., known as the Oxford English Dictionary, defines the word:\u2014\nThe action of carrying away; forcible removal esp. into exile; transportation.\nWebster's New International Dictionary gives:\u2014\nAct of deporting or state of being deported; banishment, transportation. In modern law, the removal from a country of an alien considered inimical to the public welfare; distinguished from transportation and extradition.\nIn Worcester's Dictionary:\u2014\nThe act of carrying away; removal; transportation; exile; banishment.\nIt would follow from the above definitions that the word \"exile\" could well come under the word \"deportation\"; and, if it is submitted that \"deportation\" should, in ordinary language, be used for \"the forcible removal of aliens\", it should also, according to the above quotations from reputed dictionaries, include the word \"exile\" which admittedly means the banishment of a national from his country, or, in the words of the Interpretation Section of the Order itself (7355), \"the removal of any person from any place in Canada to a place outside Canada\".\nHowever, I would not pause to further consider the objection raised upon that ground, because sub-section (b) of section 3 of the War Measures Act also contains the word \"exclusion\", which would be apt to cover the measures that are being adopted through the Orders in Council under consideration; and, moreover, if the measures so adopted are not, as contended, strictly and specifically contemplated by the use of the words \"exclusion and deportation\" in sub-section (b), what is now being done pursuant to the Orders in Council is undoubtedly covered by the general terms of the War Measures Act. The enumeration therein contained is stated to be only \"for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms\", and, in the first part of section 3, the Governor in Council is given the power\nto do and authorize such acts and things, and make from time to time such orders and regulations, as he may by reason of the existence of real or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection, deem necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada.\nSo that the discussion as to the exact meaning of the words \"exclusion and deportation\" in sub-section (b) is really immaterial, for either the \"acts and things\" mentioned in Orders in Council 7355, 7356 and 7357 are covered by these two words or they are not. If they are, cadit questio; if they are not, they then come under the general powers conferred by the first part of section 3.\nOrder in Council P.C. 7355 expressly states:\u2014\nIt is considered necessary by reason of the war, for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada, that provision be made accordingly.\nThe other two Orders in Council, as already pointed out, are merely ancillary to Order in Council 7355, and, although bearing separate numbers, would have no real existence but for Order in Council 7355. Indeed this is the very argument of the Co-operative Committee, that they are so completely interdependent that one cannot stand without the others. They are really the subordinate provisions and means for the purpose of carrying out the main Order contained in P.C. 7355. They must be read together and be taken to have been adopted because they were deemed necessary and advisable by reason of the war. This statement of fact made by the Governor in Council, so far as the Court is concerned, cannot be overruled in the circumstances of the matter before us. In the Fort Frances case[8], Viscount Haldane had this to say at page 706:\u2014\nIt may be that it has become clear that the crisis which arose is wholly at an end and there is no justification for the continued exercise of an exceptional interference which becomes ultra vires when it is no longer called for. In such a case the law as laid down for distribution of powers in the ruling instrument would have to be invoked. But very clear evidence that the crisis had wholly passed away would be required to justify the judiciary, even when the question raised was one of ultra vires which it had to decide, in overruling the decision of the Government that exceptional measures were still requisite. In saying what is almost obvious, their Lordships observe themselves to be in accord with the view taken under analogous circumstances by the Supreme Court of the United States, and expressed in such decisions as that in October, 1919, in Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries Co.,[9].\nLater, in the Chemicals Reference[10], Sir Lyman Duff points out at page 13 that\nit is perhaps theoretically conceivable that the Court might be required to conclude from the plain terms of the Order in Council itself that the Governor General in Council had not deemed the measure to be necessary or advisable, or necessary or advisable by reason of the existence of war.\nSuch a situation must indeed be rare and certainly it does not arise in the present instance. I repeat the four recitals in P.C. 7355:\u2014\nWhereas during the course of the war with Japan certain Japanese nationals manifested their sympathy with or support of Japan by making requests for repatriation to Japan and otherwise;\nAnd whereas other persons of the Japanese race have requested or may request that they be sent to Japan;\nAnd whereas it is deemed desirable that provisions be made to deport the classes or persons referred to above;\nAnd whereas it is considered necessary by reason of the war, for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada, that provision be made accordingly;\nThen comes the following:\u2014\nNow, therefore, His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Labour, concurred in by the Secretary of State for External Affairs, and under the authority of the War Measures Act, Chapter 206 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, is pleased to make and doth hereby make the following Order;\nIt is clear from this that the Order is made under the authority of the War Measures Act. The Japanese nationals referred to in the first recital are covered by the enacting provisions, paragraph 2, subparagraph 1; \"other persons of the Japanese race\" referred to in the second recital are dealt with by paragraph 2, subparagraph 2: \"Naturalized British subject of the Japanese race\", and by subparagraph 3: \"natural born British subject of the Japanese race\". The third recital states that it is deemed desirable that provision be made to deport these classes who have requested, or (in the case of naturalized or natural born British subjects) who may request that they be sent to Japan, and the fourth recital is surely a plain statement that the Governor General in Council has deemed it necessary by reason of the war to provide with reference to these various classes in the manner set forth in paragraph 2 of the Order and elsewhere.\nIt will be noticed that in the first recital dealing with Japanese nationals, the word \"repatriation\" is used, while in the second recital, dealing with other persons of the Japanese race, the reference is to requests \"that they be sent to Japan\". After these recitals surely the word \"deport\", in the third recital, is sufficient, notwithstanding any argument that might on other occasions be made that the word \"deport\" would not apply to the sending to Japan of natural born British subjects of the Japanese race.\nWhatever might be said as to certain of the remarks made in Re Price Bros. and Company and the Board of Commerce of Canada[11], in view of the later decision in the Fort Frances case[12], it is quite clear from a perusal of all the opinions in the former that not only was there before the Court an opinion by the then Minister of Justice that there was no emergency, but also there was no definite statement such as we find in the fourth recital in P.C. 7355. In the Price Bros. case (1), Sir Lyman Duff referred to the recitals in the Order in Council of December 20th, 1919, as being\nin themselves sufficient to constrain any Court to the conclusion that the Order of 29th January was not preceded or accompanied by any such decision,\ni.e., a decision\nthat the particular measure in question is necessary or advisable for reasons which have some relation to the perils actual or (possible of real or apprehended war. At page 707 of the Fort Frances case[13] appears at least one statement in the Order of December 20th, 1919, to which Sir Lyman Duff must have been referring, i.e., that it must\nbe realized that although no proclamation has been issued declaring that the war no longer exists, actual war conditions have in fact long ago ceased to exist, and consequently existence of war can no longer be urged as a reason in fact for maintaining these extraordinary regulations as necessary or advisable for the security of Canada.\nNotwithstanding this reference in the Fort Frances case13, their Lordships of the Judicial Committee had no difficulty in determining the validity of the Orders in Council there under review.\nIt is suggested that it cannot be said that the Governor General in Council really considered it necessary by reason of the war, for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada that natural born British subjects should be expelled. The argument is that while P.C. 7356 provides that any person who being a British subject by naturalization is deported from Canada under 7355\nshall as and from the date upon which he leaves Canada in the course of such deportation cease to be either a British subject or a Canadian national,\nno provision is made anywhere that a natural born British subject of the Japanese race who is deported shall cease to be a British subject or a Canadian national; and that, therefore, theoretically there would be nothing to prevent such last mentioned person from immediately re-entering Canada. It is sufficient to point out that once such person is expelled from the country and sent to Japan under the arrangements made with General MacArthur, it is inconceivable that any practical difficulty can ever arise. In the history of England examples are not unknown of cases where natural born British subjects have been exiled without any provision being made that they should lose their British nationality.\nIt has also been suggested that since any natural born British subject of the Japanese race who has made a request to be sent to Japan may revoke in writing such request prior to the making by the Minister of Labour of an order for deportation, it could not be said that the Governor General in Council really deemed it necessary to provide for the peace, order and good government of Canada to send them to Japan. As to this, and generally to all such arguments, it must be borne in mind that the Governor General in Council was dealing with people who had made requests to be sent to Japan or who might after the making of P.C. 7355 make such requests. Surely under the circumstances that existed during the actual hostilities with Japan or in the ensuing months, the Governor General in Council might well be justified in considering such people a menace to Canada and the mere fact that they were given an opportunity of retraction cannot alter the fact that the Governor General in Council did so decide. Even if it turned out that every natural born British subject of the Japanese race did withdraw his request, it would remain as expressed in the Order in Council that it was considered advisable to provide for the event of any number of such class not taking advantage of the opportunity of revocation.\nNor are we concerned with the policy of these measures. As was said by Lord Buckmaster in Attorney General v. Wilts United Dairies[14], in dealing with an Order of the Food Controller made in April, 1919:\u2014\"The only question here is: were such powers granted?\"\nThat Canada possessed the power to expel an alien from its territory or to deport him to the country whence he entered it, is a question that may now be regarded as settled since the judgment of the Privy Council in Attorney General for Canada v. Cain[15]. It was also decided in that case that the power could be delegated to the Government, with the authority to impose such extra-territorial constraint as was necessary to execute the power.\nAs to the second point raised by the Co-operative Committee. I do not think it can be said that any provision of the Orders in Council now under discussion are repugnant to the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 4-5 George V, chapter 17. It does not seem necessary for me to develop that statement, as, after all, the fact of no conflict can be ascertained only by comparison of the respective provisions of the latter Act and the text of the Orders in Council. Section 26 of the British Nationality Act, at the beginning, would seem to eliminate any possibility of conflict. The question which naturally comes to one's mind is: Why should Canada not be able to denaturalize the persons whom it had previously naturalized? The loss of the quality of British subject, resulting from the deportation and the denaturalization which takes place under the Orders, must be read, of course, to mean the cessation of the privileges of a British subject only in so far as Canada is concerned. Moreover, the attempt by the Co-operative Committee to apply here the provisions of the Colonial Laws Validity Act is, in my opinion, ineffective, because each of the Orders in Council are, by force of the War Measures Act, the equivalent of a statute; they have the force of law, and, to all intents and purposes, while they stand, they are exactly on the same footing as an Act of Parliament. It would follow, therefore, that they must be looked upon with regard to the Statute of Westminster, as bearing the date of the 15th of December, 1945, and consequently, much posterior to the coming into force of that statute. So that being posterior to it and getting the benefit of the Statute of Westminster itself, they are thus withdrawn from the application of the Colonial Laws Validity Act.\nMoreover, the British Nationality Act cannot be said to have been adopted by Canada. The Canadian Act was an independent enactment, which was intended by the Canadian Parliament here as its own Act, with the consequence that it can be truly said that the British Nationality Act as such never applied to Canada.\nPerhaps a special reference ought to be made to section 9 of Order in Council P.C. 7355, in respect of which counsel for the Co-operative Committee made a very insistent argument that it conflicted with section 5 of the War Measures Act and that it had the effect of abolishing the right to resort to habeas corpus. Section 5 in question enacts:\u2014\nNo person who is held for deportation under this Act or under any regulation made thereunder, or is under arrest or detention as an alien enemy, or upon suspicion that he is an alien enemy, or to prevent his departure from Canada, shall be released upon bail or otherwise discharged or tried, without the consent of the Minister of Justice. Section 9 of P.C. 7355 enacts:\u2014\nAny person for whom an order for deportation is made and who is detained pending deportation or who is placed under restraint in the course of deportation by virtue of any order or measure made or taken under section 4 of this Order shall, while so detained or restrained, be deemed to be in legal custody.\nI do not see any conflict between the two sections. It is apparent that section 5 of the Act really deals with the situation anterior to the order for deportation, while section 9 of the Order deals with the situation after the order for deportation has been made. Even if the two sections dealt with the same situation, it does not follow that because the person detained or restrained is declared to be deemed to be in legal custody under section 9, it could not happen that the same person could be released upon bail, or otherwise discharged or tried, with the consent of the Minister of Justice.\nBut, above all, there is a good deal to be said for the contention that section 9 of the Order is really superfluous, because, if the order for deportation was made, or if the person detained pending deportation, or placed under restraint in the course of deportation, was so placed \"by virtue of any order or measure made or taken under section 4 of this Order\", such person is necessarily in legal custody. The whole of section 9 is predicated upon the assumption that the order for deportation, or detention, or restraint, was properly made or taken under section 4; and, if the provisions of section 4 are valid and followed, the necessary consequence is that the person detained, or restrained, is in legal custody. Section 9, therefore, appears to be superfluous, and to have been put there ex abundanti cautela, or, in other words, in order to avoid a doubt as to the legality of the detention or restraint. That very legality necessarily results from the fact that any order, or measure, taken under section 4, means precisely what it says, that is to say, an order or measure in conformity with section 4.\nBut I do not think that it can be concluded from the wording of section 9 that the intention of the Order in Council is that the recourse to habeas corpus is thereby abolished. At Bar, counsel for the Crown did not so contend; on the contrary, he stated that it was not. The language of section 9 refers to an order authorized by Order in Council P.C. 7355 and, therefore, a valid order resulting in legal custody.\nIn addition to any other argument in respect to section 9, it may be said that it is clearly severable; and, even if it was held to be ultra vires\u2014which, in my opinion, it is not\u2014it is quite evident that declaring it ultra vires would not in any way affect the remainder of the several Orders in Council now submitted.\nThe third recital in P.C. 7355,\nAnd whereas it is deemed desirable that provisions be made to deport the classes of persons referred to above,\nin terms applies only to the classes referred to in the first two recitals, i.e., Japanese nationals who had manifested their sympathy with or support of Japan by making requests for repatriation to Japan and otherwise, and other persons of the Japanese race who had requested, or might request, that they be sent to Japan. Subparagraph 4 of paragraph 2 of the Order, however, provides:\u2014\n(4) The wife and children under sixteen years of age of any person for whom the Minister makes an order for deportation to Japan may be included in such order and deported with such person.\nAs to children, at what age under sixteen would a consent be of any value? As to both children and wives, it was apparently considered advisable that the Minister should have power to expend the sums mentioned in paragraph 7 in a desire to keep families together. Even though no request from wives or children under sixteen is required by subparagraph 4 of paragraph 2, it appears that the Governor in Council deemed it necessary for the security, defence, etc., of Canada to authorize the Minister of Labour to include this class in an Order covering a person of either of the first two classes. That the Governor in Council considered the matter necessary may appear without specific words being used, Rex v. Controller General of Patents[16], and in this case I am satisfied upon a consideration of all the terms of the Order that this occurred. My conclusion is that Orders in Council 7355, 7356 and 7357 contain legislation that could have been adopted by Parliament itself; that, under the War Measures Act, the Governor in Council was empowered to adopt any legislation that Parliament could have adopted; that such legislation was, expressly and impliedly, adopted because it was deemed necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada by reason of the existence of war; that the Governor in Council was the sole judge of the necessity or advisability of these measures and it is not competent to any Court to canvass the considerations which may have led the Governor in Council to deem such orders necessary or advisable for the objectives set forth.\nThe authority conferred on the Governor General in Council is a plenary legislative power, both to adopt the orders and to continue them in force, which is not subject to review in a Court of Justice.\nMy answer to the question submitted to the Court is, therefore, that the Orders in Council dated the 15th of December, 1945, being P.C. 7355, 7356 and 7357 are not ultra vires of the Governor General in Council either in whole or in part.\nWe hereby certify to His Excellency the Governor General in Council that the foregoing are our reasons for the answer to the question referred herein for hearing and consideration.\nT. RINFRET\nP. KERWIN\nR. TASCHEREAU Hudson J.\u2014The question submitted for our opinion is the following:\nAre the Orders in Council dated 15th December, 1945, being P.C. 7355, 7356 and 7357 ultra vires of the Governor in Council, either in whole or in part and, if so, in what particular or particulars?\nThese Orders in Council purport to be made under the authority of the War Measures Act and provide for the removal from Canada to Japan of a large number of persons of Japanese race, the revocation of naturalization of such of them as have been naturalized and the disposition of the properties of such persons in Canada.\nThe reasons given in Order P.C. 7355, which is basic, are stated as follows:\nWhereas during the course of the war with Japan certain Japanese nationals manifested their sympathy with or support of Japan by making requests for repatriation to Japan and otherwise;\nAnd whereas other persons of the Japanese race have requested or may request that they be sent to Japan;\nAnd whereas it is deemed desirable that provisions be made to deport the classes of persons referred to above;\nThe persons to whom this Order applies are of four classes. The first is:\nEvery person of sixteen years of age or over, other than a Canadian national, who is a national of Japan resident in Canada and who,\n(a) has, since the date of declaration of war by the Government of Canada against Japan, on December 8, 1941, made a request for repatriation; or\n(b) has been in detention at any place in virtue of an order made pursuant to the provisions of the Defence of Canada Regulations or of Order in Council P.C. 946, of the 5th day of February, 1943, as amended by P.C. 5637, of the 16th day of August, 1945, and was so detained as at midnight of September 1, 1945.\nBy section 91, heading 25, of the British North America Act the Dominion is given exclusive legislative authority in respect of naturalization and aliens, and it was held in the case of Attorney-General v. Cain[17], that the Crown undoubtedly possesses the power to expel an alien from the Dominion of Canada, or to deport him to the country from whence he entered it. In giving the judgment of the Committee, Lord Atkinson said at p. 546:\nOne of the rights possessed by the supreme power in every State is the right to refuse to permit an alien to enter that State, to annex what conditions it pleases to the permission to enter it, and to expel or deport from the State, at pleasure, even a friendly alien, especially if it considers his presence in the State opposed to its peace, order, and good government, or to its social or material interests.\nIt was also held that the Dominion has the power to exercise such extra-territorial constraint as is necessary to execute the power.\nThe second class provided for in the Order includes:\nEvery naturalized British subject of the Japanese race of sixteen years of age or over resident in Canada who has made a request for repatriation may be deported to Japan: Provided that such person has not revoked in writing such request prior to midnight the first day of September, 1945.\nIt is provided by section 9 of the Naturalization Act, R.S.C. 1927, chapter 138, that:\nWhere the Governor in Council, upon the report of the Minister, is satisfied that a certificate of naturalization granted by the Minister under this Act or granted under any Naturalization Act heretofore in force in Canada has been obtained by false representation or fraud, or by concealment of material circumstances, or that the person to whom the certificate was granted has shown himself by act or speech to be disaffected or disloyal to His Majesty the Governor in Council shall by order revoke the certificate.\nHere the request for repatriation by a Japanese has been treated by the Governor in Council as evidence of \"disaffection or disloyalty to His Majesty\" under the conditions subsisting in Canada at the time, that is, when this country was at war with Japan, or just emerging therefrom.\nAs the Canadian Parliament have power to grant naturalization, they have equally the power to revoke such naturalization and may delegate such power to the Governor in Council. Once the naturalization is revoked, the person concerned reverts to his original status of being an alien and thus becomes subject to deportation in the same way as any other alien.\nIt must also be remembered that in making the order for deportation, the Governor in Council is doing what the person involved himself had authorized.\nThe third class of persons included in Order in Council 7355 consists of:\nEvery natural born British subject of the Japanese race of sixteen years of age or over resident in Canada who has made a request for repatriation may be deported to Japan: Provided that such person has not revoked in writing such request prior to the making by the Minister of an order for deportation. The form of request for repatriation used by this class was supplied to us by counsel for the Co-operative Committee of Japanese Canadians and reads as follows:\n\"I, \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.:(\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.), born\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n(M. or F.)

The form of request signed contains a declaration of a desire to relinquish British nationality and assume the status of a national of Japan. Any change of nationality, however, is left to action by the person himself. Section 16 of the Naturalization Act provides that:\nA British subject who, when in any foreign state and not under disability, by obtaining a certificate of naturalization or by any other voluntary and formal act becomes naturalized therein, shall thenceforth be deemed to have ceased to be a British subject. I should say that no question could be raised as to the right of the Governor in Council to facilitate the departure of any member of the Japanese race who desires to make his home in Japan. A question of compulsion can arise only where a person seeks to withdraw his request after the Governor in Council has finally acted on it.\nThe relationship between a British subject and his sovereign is stated in Blackstone's Commentaries, vol. 1, p. 370, as follows:\nNatural allegiance is therefore perpetual, * * * allegiance is a debt due from the subject, upon an implied contract with the prince, that so long as the one affords protection, so long the other will demean himself faithfully. As therefore the prince is always under a constant tie to protect his natural-born subjects, at all times and in all countries, for this reason their allegiance due to him is equally universal and permanent.\nThe mutual obligations there are spoken of as those arising from an implied contract.\nIt would seem to follow that such obligations could be modified or cancelled by mutual agreement expressed in any way not forbidden by law. The facts here establish a concurrence in some modifications leading to a final extinguishment of all.\nThe request of the subject states his desire to relinquish his British nationality and to assume the status of a national of Japan and asks the Government of Canada to arrange for and effect his repatriation to Japan. By this he must mean his naturalization in Japan. This is a plain indication that, with him, the ties of race are stronger than the obligations of nationality.\nBy the order the Governor in Council concurs in his proposal with no qualification, except that the subject is given an option to withdraw his request at any time before the final deportation order is actually made. If there is no withdrawal in time, it would seem that there was in the language of commerce \"a firm contract\", so that the deportation order when made and carried out will be in fulfilment of the promise made on behalf of the Government.\nIt remains to consider whether or not Parliament has power to authorize the Governor in Council to make these orders and, if so, whether such power has been delegated. As to the first two classes, for the reasons already given, I am satisfied that Parliament has that power and can delegate it to the Governor in Council.\nAs to the third class, there would be more difficulty in upholding the order, were it not for the terms of the request. Ample opportunity has been and still is given to the subject for reconsideration and withdrawal before the final order is made. It would be hard indeed if the Governor in Council, as soon as arrangements for transportation and reception are completed, is not permitted to carry out the arrangement. It has, in my opinion, adequate legislative sanction.\nThe British Parliament would undoubtedly have power to order the deportation from the realm of a British subject and the Canadian Parliament appears to have similar powers. Under the British North America Act it has a right to legislate in regard to the peace, order and good government of Canada and, in heading 25 of section 91, it is given exclusive power to legislate in regard to aliens and naturalization. Although deportation of a British citizen would not fall within this heading, yet it is of the same character and is a subject which could not be dealt with by a Provincial Legislature.\nUnder the War Measures Act, section 3, the Governor in Council is authorized to do all acts and things and make from time to time such orders and regulations as he may by reason of the existence of real or apprehended war deem necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada. This enables the Governor in Council to deal with any subject matter within the power of Parliament during the prescribed time, which does not conflict with any provision of the War Measures Act itself. This was conclusively established in Re Gray[18], and Fort Frances Pulp and Power Co. v. Manitoba Free Press[19]. As was said by Sir Lyman Duff in the Chemicals Reference[20]:\nThe enactment is, of course, of the highest political nature. It is the attribution to the Executive Government of powers legislative in their character, described in terms implying nothing less than a plenary discretion, for securing the safety of the country in time of war. The Act also provides in section 2 that it shall be conclusive evidence that war, invasion, or insurrection, real or apprehended, exists and has not ceased until by proclamation it is so declared. No such proclamation was made up to the time these Orders in Council were passed. Even if it were, it was held in the Fort Frances case[21] that Parliament still had power to conclude matters under way while the war was still going on.\nThe Orders with which we are here concerned plainly arose out of matters originating during the war, so that I think the Orders in Council can be taken to be an exercise of the powers vested in Parliament bearing on the subject matter under consideration.\nThe very able arguments presented by counsel for the Co-Operative Committee of Japanese Canadians have been dealt with by some of the other members of the Court and I shall make brief reference to only two or three.\nIt was argued that clause 9 of Order in Council P.C. No. 7355 might have the effect of depriving a person about to be deported from any right to a writ of habeas corpus. I agree with the other members of the Court that such is not a proper interpretation of this clause. I think that where any question of fact bearing on the jurisdiction of the Governor in Council is raised, the person concerned would have a right to put it forward: for example, whether or not he had signed any request or had been induced to sign by misrepresentation or coercion, or whether or not he was of the Japanese race. The validity of the Orders depends on the reality of the requests and any individual who wishes to raise a question of fact, so far as it affects him, should not be deprived of an opportunity of establishing his case.\nI am in agreement with what Mr. Justice Estey has said in regard to the fourth class, that is, women and children.\nThe question submitted in this reference is as follows:\nAre the Orders in Council dated 15th December, 1945, being P.C. 7355, 7356 and 7357 ultra vires of the Governor in Council, either in whole or in part and, if so, in what particular or particulars? In my opinion all the Orders in Council are intra vires of the Governor in Council with the exception of paragraph 2 (4) of P.C. 7355.\nI HEREBY CERTIFY to His Excellency the Governor General in Council that the foregoing are my reasons for the answer to the question referred herein for hearing and consideration.\nA. B. HUDSON.\nRand J.\u2014His Excellency in Council has referred to this Court the following question arising out of certain Orders in Council which deal with the deportation of persons of the Japanese race:\u2014\nAre the Orders in Council dated the 15th day of December, 1945, being P.C. 7355, 7356 and 7357, ultra vires of the Governor in Council either in whole or in part, and if so, in what particular or particulars and to what extent?\nThe Orders provide for the deportation in certain circumstances of:\u2014\n(a) Japanese nationals;\n(b) Naturalized British subjects of the Japanese race resident in Canada;\n(c) Natural born British subjects of the Japanese race resident in Canada; and\n(d) The wives and children under 16 years of age of persons in classes (a), (b) and (c).\nThe power of the Governor in Council to enact legislation by Order is derived from section 3 of the War Measures Act, which, so far as it is pertinent here, is as follows:\u2014\n3. The Governor in Council may do and authorize such acts, and things, and make from time to time such orders and regulations, as he may by reason of the existence of real or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection deem necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada; and for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms, it is hereby declared that the powers of the Governor in Council shall extend to all matters coming within the classes of subjects hereinafter enumerated, that is to say:\u2014\n* * *\n(b) Arrest, detention, exclusion and deportation.\nApart from a consideration I shall deal with later, I am bound by decisions of this Court and of the Judicial Committee to attribute to Parliament the intention of clothing the Governor in Council with authority to enact by Order, subject to the provisions of the Act, legislation in a field as wide as that possessed by Parliament itself subject only to any restriction of the power of Parliament under the British North America Act to delegate to the Governor in Council: Duff C. J., Chemicals Reference[22]. The condition of the exercise of that power is that the Governor in Council should by reason of the existence of real or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection deem necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada the acts and things which by Order he purports to do. It is not for the courts to substitute their view of any such necessity or advisability: but it must appear from the Order or be presumed that that decision has been made, or the condition laid down by Parliament is not fulfilled.\nThe preamble of Order P.C. 7355 contains the following recitals:\u2014\nWhereas during the course of the war with Japan certain Japanese nationals manifested their sympathy with or support of Japan by making requests for repatriation to Japan and otherwise;\nAnd whereas other persons of the Japanese race have requested or may request that they foe sent to Japan;\nAnd whereas it is deemed desirable that provisions be made to deport the, classes of persons referred to above;\nAnd whereas it is considered necessary by reason of the war, for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada, that provision be made accordingly;\nNow, therefore, His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Labour, concurred in by the Secretary of State for External Affairs, and under the authority of the War Measures Act, chapter 206 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, is pleased to make and doth hereby make the following Order:\nA request for repatriation is defined as a written request or statement of desire to be repatriated or sent to Japan. Then follow specific provisions dealing with the different classes of persons affected.\nOf these classes there is first that of Japanese nationals. The preamble quoted recites certain conclusions of the Governor in Council pertinent to jurisdiction, and we are to say whether from these and the operative provisions of the Order we find that the decision which the statute has prescribed as its condition has not been made: in re Price Bros. and Company[23], Duff J. (as he then was): In this connection the sole point requiring examination is that which arises out of Mr. Biggar's contention in his admirable argument that orders in council made by the Governor General in Council professedly under the authority of section 6 of that Act are not judicially revisable. I think such orders are reviewable, in this sense that when in a proper proceeding the validity of them is called into question, it is the duty of a court of justice to consider and decide whether the conditions of jurisdiction are fulfilled and if they are not being fulfilled, to pronounce the sentence of the law upon the illegal order.\nOne of the conditions of jurisdiction is, in my judgment, that the Governor in Council shall decide that the particular measure in question is necessary or advisable for reasons which have some relation to the perils actual or possible of real or apprehended war\u2014(I leave the case of insurrection out of view as having no relevancy) or as having some relation to the prosecution of the war or the objects of it.\nRex v. Comptroller[24]. The language of the preamble is not precisely that employed by the statute, but in relation to this class of persons it appears, I should say, from the Order that the condition has been satisfied. The words \"deport\" and \"repatriation\" are appropriate to the return to his native country of an alien. The power of Parliament to deal with aliens is unquestioned, and that field is under delegation to the Governor in Council. The obligation of his own state to receive him must be deemed correlated with the power of the foreign state to expel him, and this has been implemented here by a direction of General MacArthur to which I shall refer later.\nAs is seen, the second recital of the preamble speaks of \"other persons of the Japanese race\", but from the operative paragraphs of the Order it is clear that this language refers to both naturalized persons of the Japanese race and natural born British subjects of Canada who have a Japanese racial origin. The Order in relation to naturalized subjects must be read with Order 7356 which deals only with that class and is as follows:\nWhereas by Order in Council P.C. 7356 of 15th December, 1945, provision is made for the deportation of persons who, during the course of the war, have requested to be removed or sent to an enemy country or otherwise manifested their sympathy with or support of the enemy powers and have by such actions shown themselves to be unfit for permanent residence in Canada;\nTherefore, His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Secretary of State (concurred in by the Secretary of State for External Affairs) and under the authority of the War Measures Act, chapter 206 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, is pleased to order and doth hereby order as follows: 1. Any person who, being a British subject by naturalization under the Naturalization Act, chapter 138, R.S.C. 1927, is deported from Canada under the provisions of Order in Council P.C. 7355 of 15th December, 1945, shall, as and from the date upon which he leaves Canada in the course of such deportation, cease to be either a British subject or a Canadian national.\n2. The Secretary of State shall publish in the Canada Gazette the names of all persons who have ceased to be British subjects or Canadian nationals by virtue of this Order.\nAs in the case of Japanese nationals, these two Orders show the jurisdictional decision of the Governor in Council in respect of naturalized Japanese. But a question arises of the relation between revocation by Order 7356 and deportation under 7355. No doubt the expulsion was intended to be followed by alienage of the deported persons; but if no or only a partial effect has been brought about by Order 7356, does that modify the operation of Order 7355?\nThe Naturalization Act contains a number of grounds upon which the revocation of naturalization can be affected, but the only one of interest here is that set forth in section 9 of chapter 138, Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, which is as follows:\nWhere the Governor in Council, upon report of the Secretary of State of Canada, is satisfied * * * that the person to whom the certificate was granted has shown himself by act or speech to be disaffected or disloyal to His Majesty, the Governor in Council shall, by order, revoke the certificate.\nOrder 7356 does not refer to any naturalized person being \"disaffected or disloyal\"; it deals only with the deportation of a person under Order 7355, and this in turn puts the deportation on the fact of a request for repatriation which has not been revoked in writing prior to September 1st, 1945. Are we to imply from this language that the Governor in Council is satisfied in each case of the disaffection or disloyality of the naturalized person? Here is a penal provision of a drastic nature, and as it affects British subjects, I am unable to supply that conclusion by implication. The revocation for that cause seems to require the aid of the War Measures Act to enable the Governor in Council, as distinguished from the Secretary of State for Canada, to act under the Naturalization Act, but in either case, action must be strictly within the provisions of the latter as to grounds in order to bring about the revocation. It was argued that as Parliament could rescind the adoption, the Governor in Council could revoke on any ground he might see fit: but that view, I think, misconceives the foundation of the Naturalization Act. The legislative efficacy under which the naturalization arises is that of the British Nationality Act, part II of which has been \"adopted\" by the Canadian Parliament. That word would seem to mean simply that the Canadian Parliament has cleared the way for the extension to Canada of an Imperial Act providing an empire naturalization. That Act directly authorizes the Canadian Government to exercise the powers it creates. The form of the Canadian statute is not ex facie strictly in accordance with that conception, but if we look upon it as an exercise of Canadian legislative jurisdiction then that jurisdiction must be deemed to be by way of a specific investment additional to the British North America Act, but limited strictly to the precise language of the Imperial Act. No question of the Colonial Laws Validity Act arises because of the express power under the statute to rescind the adoption. But naturalization effecting an empire-wide status lies outside of the legislative power of Canada under section 91 of the Constitutional Act: and as the conditions of revocation have not been complied with, the status of British subject has not been destroyed.\nAnother view of these statutes might be that each member of the Commonwealth with concurrent action of the others itself enacts empire-wide legislation which in relation to grant or revocation of naturalization it would be at liberty to amend at its pleasure without affecting the recognition accorded by the other members. But that is not the legislative design of the British Nationality Act.\nBut Order 7356 declares a cesser also of being a Canadian national and in this goes beyond status. By the Canadian Nationals Act, chapter 21 of the Revised Statutes (1927) a Canadian national is a British subject who is a Canadian citizen within the definition of the Immigration Act. The latter for the purpose here requires a Canadian domicile: and the right to residence in Canada appears to be what the Order takes away from the deported person. With the country of origin consenting to his return, the requirement for permanent exclusion is obtained. In these circumstances I am unable to say that the failure in revocation of naturalization is of such a nature as to affect the operation of Order 7355.\nIn relation to the third class, natural born British subjects resident in Canada, serious questions arise.\nI observe first that the expulsion of persons in the other two classes is in conjunction with an order or the equivalent of an order made by General MacArthur for their reception as repatriates in Japan. The letters passing between the Governments of Canada and the United States make it clear that what was asked for and conceded was \"repatriation\". That word is defined in Order 7356 in effect as either a \"return\" to Japan or \"being sent\" to that country, but obviously that definition is irrelevant to the meaning of the word as it is used in the communications between the two countries. \"Repatriation\" means simply a return to the patria or fatherland, and it has no relation to the compulsory transfer of a natural born British subject to a foreign country. Whatever legal rights it may confer to enter or to remain in Japan do not apply to such a subject.\nBanishment with or without the loss of citizenship status or rights, as an effective exile over a period of time, whatever its feasibility in the early political organization of the world is to-day, considering the tenacity with which every foot of land and water is now sought and held, a legislative and executive impossibility. Admittedly one sovereignty has no legal power to force its own citizen into the territory of another. It is quite the case that banishment and exile were known to the common law, but in each it was either a deportation to politically unorganized lands, a transportation to a British colony by way of punishment for a criminal offence, or a voluntary exile made either by way of abjuration of the realm or as fulfilment of a condition in a pardon or other remission or as an avoidance of punishment requiring self-exile. In none of these situations is there the slightest suggestion of compulsory invasion of another's territory. The process and effects of deportation of natural born British subjects under the Order seem to be these: a physical compulsion to leave Canadian shores; a de facto but not de jure entry upon Japanese territory: no citizenship rights in Japan and a retention of the rights of Canadian citizenship.\nNow I must deal with this case as if, instead of a Canadian national of Japanese origin, I were dealing with that of a natural born Canadian national of English extraction who sympathized with Mosley or a French-Canadian national who supported P\u00e9tain or an Irish-Canadian national who thought deValera's course justified. I am asked to hold that, without a convention with those countries, the Government may, under the War Measures Act, and without affecting the national status or the citizenship rights of these persons, issue an order for their deportation, to those foreign shores. I am unable to agree with that contention.\nIn these days, we are familiar with exchanges or transfers of sections of population from one country to another by agreement or imposed, but they are carried out as changes of nationality as well as of country: a deprivation of citizenship rights by one state and an investment of them by the other. That is not what is done or intended to be done by the Order with which I am dealing.\nI think that Parliament in enacting the War Measures Act must have contemplated, as a fundamental assumption underlying the statute, the delegation of legislative power of a strictly legal character only, and must have intended to restrict the Governor in Council to measures or actions in which full juridical quality would inhere: that power without recognized legal character would be excluded. What is proposed here is not juridical: it is an act envisaging the violation of the sovereign rights of another state by an invasion of its territory and an affront to its dignity as represented by the occupying power. This quality, of course, is not present in the case of an alien: there the authority of expulsion is a necessary corollary to that of the right to exclude: Attorney General v. Cain[25]: but the fundamental distinction between the two cases is, I think, unquestionable. As a further illustration of the principle invoked, I mention the presumption against the power to make retroactive orders, which I suggest would bind the Governor in Council, though there is no such restriction on Parliament.\nOn another ground I would come to the same conclusion. In Order 7355 the recital which, among others, relates to natural born British subjects, refers only to a request to be sent to Japan, implying, as I think, a continuing request: the general recital of \"desirability\" that provision be made to deport and the declaration of the necessity to make provision accordingly, apply to all three classes. The right to revoke the request by the natural born Canadian national is preserved up to the issue of the Order for deportation and this time limit is simply an administrative convenience. \"Deportation\" connotes only a single act and no period of time beyond the accomplishment of the expulsion. There is nothing in the Order to prevent such a Canadian from returning at once to the land of his birth. The contrast with the alien is obvious; once an alien leaves this country, he must establish a right given him by the legislature to return; at common law he has no right to enter which is recognized in our courts: Musgrove v. Toy[26]. Considering, then, that the operation of the Order against the British subject by birth is placed solely upon a request which implies a continuing desire to leave this country, that the Order contemplates as well the withdrawal of persons voluntarily and enables the Minister to make financial arrangements to that end, in conjunction with the other circumstances I have detailed, I find in the Order clear evidence that that act of expulsion is not deemed by the Governor in Council either necessary or advisable for the peace, order or welfare of this country by reason of war; and the essential condition of the provision for compulsion is lacking.\nThe members of the family of a Canadian national may under Order 7355 be included in the deportation order. If revocation of naturalization takes place, the status of the wife and minor children may thereby be affected. But where by the Order only incidents of the status of the husband and father are reached, the full citizenship rights of the wife and minor children continue. It was not seriously urged that the Governor in Council has deemed the expulsion of such persons advisable or necessary to the peace or welfare of Canada for any reason arising out of war; the most suggested was that it was advisable to the peace and welfare of indivdual families; but that purpose does not seem to be among the objects of Parliament's delegation of legislative power to the Governor in Council.\nMr. Cartwright argued that the war emergency must be deemed to have ended when the War Measures Act became inoperative on January 1st of this year. But that, I think, confuses the emergency with a particular period of it to which particular legislation is related. The emergency as a state of fact underlies both the War Measures Act and the Transitional Powers Act which came into force on January 1st, 1946.\nThen it was argued that section 9 of Order 7355 is ultra vires because of conflict with section 5 of the War Measures Act. But an \"order\" for deportation under Order 7355 means one that carries with it the force of law. The \"legal custody\" which is declared relates only to the agents or instruments by which the restraint is effected: Liver side v. Sir John Anderson[27].\nI would therefore answer the question as follows:\u2014\n1. Order 7355 is intra vires of the Governor in Council in relation to Japanese nationals and to persons of the Japanese race naturalized under the Naturalization Act of Canada as well as to persons voluntarily leaving Canada; but is ultra vires in relation to the compulsory deportation of natural born British subjects resident in Canada, and of wives and children under 16 who do not come within the first two classes.\n2. Order 7356 is ultra vires of the Governor in Council to the extent that it purports to revoke the naturalization of persons of the Japanese race under the Naturalization Act but it is intra vires so far as it takes away incidental rights and privileges of such persons as Canadian nationals. 3. Order 7357 is intra vires of the Governor in Council, subject to the observance of the requirements of the Naturalization Act as to grounds for the revocation of naturalization.\nI hereby certify to His Excellency the Governor General in Council that the foregoing are my reasons for the answer to the question referred herein for hearing and consideration.\nI. C. RAND\nKellock J.\u2014By Order in Council of the 8th day of January, 1946, P.C. 45, His Excellency the Governor General in Council referred to this Court pursuant to the provisions of section 55 of the Supreme Court Act the following question, namely:\u2014\nAre the Orders in Council, dated the 15th day of December, 1945, being P.C. 7355, 7356 and 7357, ultra vires of the Governor in Council either in whole or in part, and, if so, in what particular or particulars and to what extent?\nThe first named order, P.C. 7355 contains the following recitals:\u2014\nWhereas during the course of the war with Japan certain Japanese nationals manifested their sympathy with or support of Japan by making requests for repatriation to Japan and otherwise;\nAnd whereas other persons of the Japanese race have requested or may request that they be sent to Japan;\nAnd whereas it is deemed desirable that provisions be made to deport the classes of persons referred to above;\nAnd whereas it is considered necessary by reason of the war, for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada, that provision be made accordingly;\nNow, therefore, His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Labour, concurred in by the Secretary of State for External Affairs, and under the authority of the War Measures Act, chapter 206 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, is pleased to make and doth hereby make the following Order,\u2014\nBy section 2 (1), it is provided that every person of sixteen years of age or over, other than a \"Canadian national\", who is a national of Japan resident in Canada and who (a) has, since the date of declaration of war by the Government of Canada against Japan on December 8, 1941, made a request for repatriation; or (b) has been in detention at any place in virtue of an order made pursuant to the provisions of the Defence of Canada Regulations or of Order in Council P.C. 946, of the 5th day of February, 1943, as amended by P.C. 5637, of the 16th day of August, 1943, and was so detained as at midnight of September 1, 1945, may be deported to Japan. By subsection 2, provision is made for the deportation to Japan of every naturalized British subject of the Japanese race of 16 years of age or over resident in Canada who has made a request for repatriation, provided that the same had not been revoked in writing prior to midnight of September 1st, 1945. Subsection 3 makes similar provision with respect to natural born British subjects of the Japanese race of 16 years of age or over, provided that requests in the case of these persons are not revoked in writing prior to the making by the Minister of Labour of a deportation order. By subsection 4, the Minister may include in any order for deportation the wife and children under 16 years of age of any deportee.\nBy section 3 a request for repatriation shall be deemed final and irrevocable for the purposes of the Order, subject only to the provisions for revocation already mentioned. By section 9, it is provided that any deportee detained pending deportation or placed under restraint in the course of deportation shall be deemed to be in legal custody.\nBy the second Order, P.C. 7356, it is provided, with respect to any person naturalized under the provisions of the Naturalization Act, R.S.C. 1927, cap. 138, and who is deported, that he shall, from the date upon which he leaves Canada, cease to be a British subject or a Canadian national. By R.S.C. cap. 21 it is provided:\u2014\n2. The following persons are Canadian Nationals, viz:\u2014\n(a) Any British subject who is a Canadian 'citizen within the meaning of the Immigration Act;\n(b) The wife of any such citizen;\n(c) Any person born out of Canada, whose father was a Canadian National at the time of that person's birth, or with regard to persons born before the third day of May, one thousand nine hundred and twenty-one, any person whose father at the time of such birth, possessed all the qualifications of a Canadian National, as defined in this Act.\n3. (a) Any person who by reason of his having been born in Canada is a Canadian National, but who at his birth or during his minority became under the law of Great Britain or of any self-governing Dominion of the British Empire, a national also of that Kingdom or Dominion, and is still such a national; and (b) Any person who though born out of Canada is a Canadian National;\nmay, if of full age and not under disability, make a declaration, renouncing his Canadian nationality.\n2. Such declaration may be made before a notary public or other person authorized to administer oaths in the locality in which the declaration is made, and may be in the form set out in the Schedule to this Act.\n3. The declarant shall transmit his declaration to the Secretary of State of Canada and upon the Secretary of State being satisfied of the sufficiency of the declaration and that it has been duly executed, it shall be filed on record, whereupon the declarant shall cease to be a Canadian National, and a certified copy of the declaration shall be forwarded to the declarant with an endorsement thereon that the original declaration has been filed of record.\nBy the third Order, P.C. 7357, provision is made for the appointment of a Commission to make inquiry concerning the activities, loyalty and the extent of co-operation with the Government of Canada during the war of Japanese nationals and naturalized persons of the Japanese race in Canada in cases where their names are referred to the Commission by the Minister for investigation with a view to recommending whether, in the circumstances of any such case, such person should be deported. It is further provided that notwithstanding any provision of P.C. 7355, the Commission may, at the request of the Minister, inquire into the case of any naturalized British subject of the Japanese race who has made a request for repatriation which is final under the terms of the said Order in Council and may make such recommendations with respect to such case as the Commission deems advisable. It is further provided that any person of the Japanese race recommended by the Commission for deportation shall be subject to deportation under the provisions of Order in Council P.C. 7355, and where any person is so recommended for deportation he shall, from the date on which he leaves Canada in the course of such deportation, cease to be a British subject or a \"Canadian national.\"\nAll of the above orders purport to be made pursuant to the provisions of the War Measures Act, R.S.C. 1927.\nOn the 28th of December, 1945, P.C. 7414 was passed. By this Order it is recited that the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, is to come into force on the first of January, 1946, and by its terms provides that on and after that day the war, for the purposes of the War Measures Act, shall be deemed no longer to exist, that under section 4 of the first mentioned Act the Governor in Council may order that orders and regulations lawfully made under the War Measures Act, or pursuant to authority created thereunder in force immediately before the first of January, 1946, shall, while the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, is in force, continue in full force and effect subject to amendment or revocation thereunder, and that all orders and regulations so made and in force immediately before the day the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, comes into force, shall, while that Act is in force, continue in full force and effect subject to amendment or revocation under that Act.\nIn pursuance of the order of reference to this Court, we heard argument on behalf of the Attorney General of Canada, the Attorney General of British Columbia and the Cooperative Committee of Japanese Canadians. Counsel for the Attorney General of British Columbia supported the submissions of counsel for the Attorney General of Canada, while counsel for the Committee attacked the validity of the orders in question.\nMr. Cartwright argues that the Orders in Council here in question deal with a matter which, in the absence of the emergency of war, would fall within the competence of the provincial legislatures as being property and civil rights. He contends that to restrict the liberty of the subject where no crime has been committed is an interference with a civil right and he referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal of Ontario in re MacKenzie[28]. The contention is that the Orders in Council are in their nature preventive and are not within the sphere of criminal law. It is conceded however, that, by reason of war, a new aspect of the business of government arises which justifies legislation by the Dominion Parliament in this aspect on matters normally exclusively within section 92 of the B.N.A. Act. It is also conceded that such legislation may continue to be justified after actual war has ceased but while conditions arising out of war continue, and reference is made to Fort Frances Pulp and Paper Company v. Manitoba Free Press[29]. Counsel contends, however, that Parliament by the enactment of the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945 (9 and 10 George VI, cap. 24) has recognized that the emergency of war which justified or required the enactment of the War Measures Act ceased on the first of January, 1946. It is further contended that as the Act of 1945 does not include the provisions contained in clause (b) of subsection 1 of section 3 of the War Measures Act, this constitutes a declaration by Parliament that in respect to the matters included in such clause there is no continuing necessity for the exercise of extraordinary powers by the Governor in Council from the first of January, 1946, by reason of the emergency of war or of any continuing transitional post-war emergency.\nUnder the provisions of section 2 of the War Measures Act, the issue of a proclamation is to constitute conclusive evidence that war, real or apprehended, exists or has existed for any period of time therein stated and of its continuance until, which has not yet happened, by the issue of a further proclamation, it is declared that the war no longer exists.\nThe Act of 1945 recites among other things as follows:\nAnd whereas the national emergency arising out of the war has continued since the unconditional surrender of Germany and Japan and is still continuing; and whereas it is essential in the national interest that certain transitional powers continue to be exercisable by the Governor in Council during the continuance of the exceptional conditions brought about by the war and it is preferable that such transitional powers be exercised hereafter under special authority in that behalf conferred by Parliament instead of being exercised under the War Measures Act; and whereas in the existing circumstances it may be necessary that certain acts and things done and authorized and certain orders and regulations made under the War Measures Act be continued in force and that it is essential that the Governor in Council be authorized to and authorize such further acts and things and make such further orders and regulations as he may deem necessary or advisable by reason of the emergency and for the purpose of the discontinuance in an orderly manner as the emergency permits of measure adopted during and by reason of the emergency.\nBy section 2, the Governor in Council may do and authorize such acts and things and make from time to time such orders and regulations, as he may, by reason of the continued existence of the national emergency arising out of the war against Germany and Japan, deem necessary or advisable for the purpose of certain specified matters including, by clause (e),\ncontinuing or discontinuing in an orderly manner as the emergency permits measures adopted during and by reason of the war. Section 4 provides:\nWithout prejudice to any other power conferred by this Act, the Governor in Council may order that the orders and regulations lawfully made under the War Measures Act or pursuant to authority created under the said Act in force immediately before the day this Act comes into force shall, while this Act is in force, continue in full force and effect subject to amendment or revocation under this Act.\nBy section 5, provision is made for the Act to come into force on the first of January, 1946, and it is declared that\nOn and after that day the war against Germany and Japan shall, for the purposes of the War Measures Act, be deemed no longer to exist.\nIt would appear that the effect of the declaration in section 5 just referred to is, so far as the War Measures Act is concerned, to render that statute no longer available as authority for orders or regulations thereunder. However, the statute of 1945 becomes the authority for the orders and regulations for which it provides, and an Order in Council of the 28th December, 1945, P.C. 7414, passed under its provisions and pursuant to section 12 of the Interpretation Act, provides that\nall orders and regulations lawfully made under the War Measures Act or pursuant to authority created under the said Act in force immediately before the day (the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, comes into force shall, while that Act is in force, continue in full force and effect subject to amendment or revocation under that Act.\nI think, therefore, that although the Orders in Council here in question cease to derive any force from the provisions of the War Measures Act from and after the first of January, 1946, after that date, they derive their force from the statute of 1945, by reason of the existence of the emergency therein referred to. I do not think, therefore, that effect can be given to the argument of Mr. Cartwright that Parliament has declared by the statute of 1945 that there is no continuing necessity for the exercise of such powers as were formerly contained in subsection 1 of section 3 of the War Measures Act.\nWith the exception of the above argument, no other attack (apart from the question of severability) was made upon the orders which affects their validity with respect to nationals of Japan. As I know of no other ground of invalidity in this respect, I would hold the orders valid with respect to this class of person. It was next argued on behalf of the Committee that the Orders in Council in question in so far as they provide for the removal from Canada of persons other than aliens are not authorized by the provisions of the War Measures Act.\nIt will be convenient, in considering this submission, to quote section 3 of that Act:\nThe Governor in Council may do and authorize such acts and things, and make from time to time such orders and regulations, as he may by reason of the existence of real or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection deem necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order 'and welfare of Canada; and for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms, it is hereby declared that the powers of the Governor in Council shall extend to all matters coming within the classes of subjects hereinafter enumerated, that is to say;\u2014\nAs will be observed, \"deportation\" is not defined in the Act but by section 1 (a) of P.C. 7355 it is defined as\nthe removal pursuant to the authority of this order of any person from any place in Canada to a place outside Canada.\n(It is also to be observed that the words used in subsections (1) (2) and (3) of section 2 of P.C. 7355 are \"deported to Japan.\") The contention on behalf of the Committee in effect is that these provisions are not authorized by the provisions of the War Measures Act.\nCounsel for the Attorneys General contend that \"deportation\" as used in the statute is wide enough to include the meaning given to it by the definition in the order but that, in any event, the definition in the order is authorized by the earlier general language of subsection 1 of the Act.\nIn In re Gray[30], Fitzpatrick C.J.C. said with reference to the specified subjects in the subsection at p. 138,\nthat the reason for introducing specifications was that those specified subjects were more or less remote from those which were connected with the war, and it was therefore thought expedient to declare explicitly that the legislative power of the Governor could go even thus far\"\nDuff J., as he then was, said at 168,\nthere is in the second branch of the section an enumeration (an enumeration let it be said rather of groups of subjects which it appears to have been thought might possibly be regarded as \"marginal instances\" as to which there might conceivably arise some controversy whether or not they fell within the first branch of the section) * * * At 177 Anglin J., as he then was, with whom Fitzpatrick C.J.C. also agreed, said\nthe specification should be deemed to be of cases in which there might be such doubt as to whether they fell within the ambit of the general terms\u2014wide as they are\u2014that ex abundanti cautela it was safer to mention them specifically.\nIn Murray's New English Dictionary, \"deportation\" is defined as \"to carry away,\" \"carry off,\" \"remove,\" \"transport,\" \"especially to remove into exile,\" \"to banish.\" \"Exile\" by the same authority is defined as \"enforced removal from one's native land according to an edict or sentence,\" \"penal expatriation or banishment,\" \"the state or condition of being penalty banished,\" \"enforced residence in some foreign land;\" and \"banish\" is defined as \"to put to the ban,\" \"proclaim as an outlaw,\" \"to outlaw,\" \"to condemn a person by public edict or sentence, to leave the country,\" \"to exile, expatriate.\"\nCounsel for the Attorney General of Canada also called our attention to the definition of \"deportation\" in Webster's New International Dictionary, namely, the\nact of deporting or state of being deported; banishment; transportation; in modern law the removal from the country of an alien considered inimitable to the public welfare; distinguished from \"transportation\" and \"extradition\".\nThis last is evidently taken from the judgment of Gray, J. in Fong Yue Ting v. United States[31], as follows:\u2014\nStrictly speaking, \"transportation\", \"extradition\", and \"deportation\", although each has the effect of removing a person from the country, are different things, and have different purposes. \"Transportation\" is by way of punishment of one convicted of an offence against the laws of the country. \"Extradition\" is the surrender to another country of one accused of an offence against is laws, there to be tried, and, if found guilty, punished. \"Deportation\" is the removal of an alien out of the country, simply because his presence is deemed inconsistent with the public welfare and without any punishment being imposed or contemplated either under the laws of the country out of which he is sent or of those of the country to which he is taken.\nMr. Geoffrion points out that the Court in the case last cited was in fact dealing only with aliens and that the portion of the judgment quoted was obiter. He says in any event that the judgment is not binding on this court.\nThe importance or relevance of the above citation is, of course, not from any binding effect it may have, but as illustrating a meaning assigned to the word in question in a modern statute dealing with a cognate subject. This use of the word in such a statute, although of another jurisdiction, leads naturally to the inquiry as to the meaning with which the word is used in statutes of Parliament and particularly in the War Measures Act.\nTo consider the word merely as the equivalent of \"remove\" or \"carry away,\" as in fact it may be used, is to give effect to the contention of counsel for the Attorneys General. To consider it, however, as the equivalent of \"to remove into exile\" or \"to banish\" involves the idea of penal consequences, such as was involved in the old sentence of outlawry now abolished in criminal cases by the provisions of section 1031 of the Code. Such a meaning, in my opinion, is not apt in the case of citizens who have committed no offence, and as to whom there is no charge no trial and no conviction, nor is it apt in modern times in application to a natural born citizen of a country as it involves the idea that there is some other country to which the citizen may be sent, which is under some obligation to receive him by reason of some previous connection of the citizen with that country. No country is under any obligation to receive the natural born citizens of another country and any attempt to force such a citizen upon another country would involve an infringement of sovereignty.\nIn Bar on Private International Law, second ed., p. 135, the author says:\u2014\nHowever far a State may go in hospitably receiving foreigners, still foreigners who are dangerous to the community, or in need of relief from the poor law, may be refused a right of residence, and in extraordinary cases at least that right may be limited by special legislation to some other effect. On the other hand, no State can in these days effectively refuse to receive back into its own territory subjects of its own, who have been rejected by a foreign country. The banishment of a State's own subjects, a power which is still sometimes exercised as an exceptional political measure, in truth can only be exercised with the knowledge that it is contrary to the rules of public law, and that it is impossible to carry it out in so far as other States refuse to receive the exiles.\nIt may be that the removal of citizens of one country to another country can be arranged with the consent of the latter, but it is to be observed in the present case that the consent of Japan through General MacArthur, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, is a consent to \"repatriation\" and nothing else. \"Repatriation\" is defined by Murray as \"to return to one's country;\" \"to restore a person to his own country.\" Thus in the present case there is no consent to the reception of natural born Canadians who have no country but Canada. Japan is a sovereign power subject to the control of the powers represented by General MacArthur and no act such as is here in question can be legally done without his consent. The fact that the removal of a natural born Canadian to another country would involve an infringement of the sovereignty of the latter country apart from the consent of that country at a time when Canada has formally recognized the end of hostilities, and that the government of Japan is now as above stated, is, in my opinion, strong ground for construing the statute in question, in the absence of clear language, in a manner which does not involve such a result.\nIt is relevant here to refer to the official communication from the Government of Canada to General MacArthur to which the consent of the latter relates. That communication is contained in a letter of the 17th September, 1945, to the Canadian Ambassador at Washington and reads as follows:\u2014\nThere are approximately 24,000 people of Japanese origin now resident in Canada. About 10,000 (including dependents) have expressed a desire to be repatriated to Japan. There are also about 500 Japanese nationals now interned whom it will probably be desired to deport. At a later date it is probable that there will be some additional deportees and voluntary repatriates who will also have to be removed. The Canadian Government is anxious to proceed with repatriation and deportation as soon as this can be done without causing you embarrassment. It is difficult to proceed with redistribution and relaxation of control over Japanese remaining in Canada until repatriates and deportees are removed.\nIt is proposed that repatriates and deportees from Canada should be given free transportation for themselves and their effects and provided with a maintenance grant upon repatriation sufficient to take care of their immediate needs, also that they be permitted to transfer remainder of their funds to Japan.\nYou will appreciate the desire of the Canadian Government to proceed with these plans as soon as possible. The Canadian Government would be grateful for your advice as to the earliest date on which you would be prepared to have these people arrive in Japan.\nIt is to be observed that the word \"deport\" in the above communication is used only with respect to aliens. The word \"repatriate\" used with respect to the other persons is properly usable only with respect to persons other than natural born Canadian citizens. In my opinion, this communication affords the best evidence as to the sense in which the word \"deport\" is understood in this country. As I have already indicated, nowhere in the communication is it used with reference to natural born Canadian citizens and even the word \"repatriate\" as applied to such persons is not appropriate. What is being done in the case of such persons is expatriation.\nCounsel for the Committee further argues that where the personal liberty of the subject is in question, the view most favourable to the preservation of that liberty should be accepted. In Rex v. Halliday[32], Lord Atkinson said at 274,\nfor myself, I must say that I never could appreciate the contention that statutes invading the liberty of the subject should be construed after one manner, and statutes not invading it after another, that certain words should in the first class have a meaning put upon them different from what the same words would have put upon them when used in the second. I think the tribunal whose duty it is to interpret the statute of one class or the other should endeavour to find out what, according to the wellknown rules and principles of construction, the statute means, and if the meaning be clear to apply it in that sense. Should the statute be ambiguous, equally susceptible of two meanings, one leading to an invasion of the liberty of the subject and the other not, it may well be that the latter should be preferred on the ground of the presumed intention of the legislature not to interfere with it.\nPollock, C.B. in Bowditch v. Balchin[33], cited with approval by Lord Wright in Barnard v. Gorman[34] said, at p. 381,\nIn a case in which the liberty of the subject is concerned, we cannot go beyond the natural construction of the statute.\nI turn to statutes in force in 1927 when the statutory revision of that year was made. The Immigration Act, R.S.C. cap. 93 section 2 (c) contains a definition of the word \"deportation\" for the purposes of that Act. It is defined as\nthe removal under authority of this Act of any rejected immigrant or other person, or of any immigrant or other person who has already been landed in Canada, or who has entered or who remains in Canada contrary to any provision of this Act, from any place in Canada at which such immigrant or other person is rejected or detained to the place whence he came to Canada, or to the country of his birth or citizenship. \"Immigrant\" is defined in clause (g) of the same section as\na person who enters Canada with the intention of acquiring Canadian domicile, and for the purposes of this Act every person entering Canada shall be presumed to be an immigrant unless belonging to one of the following classes of persons hereinafter called \"non-immigrant classes\".\nHere follows a long list of classes, the first of which is \"Canadian citizens and persons who have Canadian domicile.\" \"Canadian citizen\" in turn is defined by clause (f) of the section as \"(1) a person born in Canada who has not become an alien,\" \"(2) a British subject who has Canadian domicile,\" or \"(3) a person naturalized under the laws of Canada who has not subsequently become an alien or lost Canadian domicile.\" By section 3 the classes of persons who may be denied entry to Canada, or who, having entered Canada, may be removed, do not include Canadian citizens or persons with Canadian domicile. \"Deportation\" does not apply to them. The same situation exists under the provisions of the Chinese Immigration Act R.S.C. cap. 95; Shin Shim v. The King[35].\nAgain by The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act R.S.C., cap. 144, section 24, any alien convicted of certain enumerated offences may be deported under the provisions of the Immigration Act \"relating to enquiry, detention and deportation.\"\nWe have not been referred to and I have not been able to find any other statute of Parliament where the word \"deportation\" is used. In Eshugbayi Eleko v. Government of Nigeria[36], the legislation there in question used the word \"deported\" with reference to the removal of a citizen from one part of Nigeria to another. I have not been able to find, however, any instance in which the word has been used in any statute in modern times with the connotion for which counsel for the Attorneys-General contend.\nApart from its now suggested meaning in the War Measures Act, therefore, the word has not been used previously in Parliament in any statute with regard to natural born citizens. This being so and the word itself having, in varying contexts, as set out above, a wider or a narrower meaning, I think it is the duty of the Court in such circumstances to adopt the canon of construction expressed in the passages from the judgments already cited and by Lord Hewart, L.C.J. in Rex v. Chapman[37] where referring to Maxwell on Statutes 7th Ed. p. 244, he said:\nwhere an equivocal word or ambiguous sentence leaves a reasonable doubt of its meaning which the canons of interpretation fail to solve, the benefit of the doubt should be given to the subject and against the legislature which has failed to explain itself.\nWhen one looks at the enumerated powers in clause (b), \"arrest, detention, exclusion and deportation,\" it is not unreasonable to conclude that in the case of citizens the powers of arrest, and detention added to the existing sanctions of the criminal law might well have been regarded by Parliament as ample, with the additional powers of exclusion and deportation in the case of other persons. All the powers given to the executive by the statute are emergency powers and in the scheme of things laid down in the statute it is not easy to see how Parliament either did or would contemplate the extension to natural born citizens, at least, of the power of removal from the state. These considerations, therefore, lead also to the conclusion which I have already expressed.\nWhen once it is determined that the specified power of \"deportation\" is not as wide as the definition in P.C. 7355, I do not think that what is lacking can be made up, in a case like the present, by the general words with which the subsection begins. These words, or indeed, the particular word \"deportation\" itself, are not to be interpreted as authorizing what is really an illegal act, namely the infringement of the sovereignty of another country, unless that intention is clearly expressed. In my opinion, therefore, in so far as the Orders in Council provide for the removal of natural-born Canadian citizens against their will, they are invalid. Consequently, the provisions which purport to prevent such persons withdrawing their requests at any time and in any manner cannot be supported.\nMr. Geoffrion also founded himself upon the word \"exclusion,\" but admitted that, as commonly used at least, it means \"to prevent entry\": In Murray's New English Dictionary it is defined as \"to bar or keep out (what is already outside);\" \"to shut out (persons, living things);\" \"to hinder from entering.\" It is by the same authority also defined as \"to put out,\" \"to banish,\" \"expel.\" As used in section 3 of the War Measures Act in the context of clause (b) of section 3 (1) I think it is used as the equivalent of expulsion. In Attorney General for Canada v. Cain[38], Lord Atkinson, dealing with validity of section 6 of the then Alien Labour Act of Canada, 60 and 61 Victoria, cap. 11 as amended by 1 Edward VII Cap. 13, section 13, said at 547,\nthe power of expulsion is in truth but the complement of the power of exclusion. If entry be prohibited, it would seem to follow that the Government which has the power of exclusion should have the power to expel the alien who enters in opposition to its laws.\nI cite this passage only as an illustration of the use of the word \"exclude\" in relation to a subject matter allied to the subject matter here under consideration. The power of \"deportation\" is used in the statute in my opinion as the complement of the power of \"exclusion.\"\nMr. Cartwright further argued that at the time that the War Measures Act was passed in 1914 and also at the time of the revision of 1927, Parliament could not have authorized the Governor in Council to make orders or regulations repugnant to Part II of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914, as Parliament, apart from a rescission of the adoption of that Act had not that power itself. He contends that the orders here in question, in so far as they affect naturalized British subjects of the Japanese race are repugnant to the provisions of the Imperial Act, and he contends that even had Parliament purported to legislate with respect to this class of person as in the Orders in Council, such legislation would be invalid by reason of the provisions of the Colonial Laws Validity Act. Mr. Cart-wright further contends that although Parliament, since the passing of the Statute of Westminster in 1931 is not subject to such a limitation, nevertheless, Parliament was so subject in 1914 and 1927 and has not since 1931 reenacted the War Measures Act so that there is no \"law made after the commencement of this Act\" (the Statute of Westminster) \"by the Parliament of a dominion\"; (section 2 (1) of the Statute of Westminster). Mr. Geoffrion submits on the other hand that the Imperial Act of 1914 was never adopted by Canada.\nIn view of subsection 4 of section 9 of the Imperial Act which provides for rescission at any time by a dominion which has adopted the provisions of Part II of the Act, it does not seem necessary to consider the bearing, if any, of the Colonial Laws Validity Act. It is first necessary to consider the question as to whether or not there was an adoption of Part II by Canada.\nWhile it would doubtless have been sufficient and perhaps preferable for Parliament to have adopted the provisions of Part II merely by legislating in express terms to that effect, I think that Parliament has done the same thing in another way. By 10-11 George V, cap. 59, passed in 1920, the provisions of the former Naturalization Acts of 1914 were revived. Mr. Geoffrion points out that the first Act of 1914 was in fact passed by Parliament before the date of the passing of the Imperial Act and that the latter when passed differed from the Canadian Act. In the second Act of 1914 the differences between the Canadian and the Imperial legislation were enacted by Parliament and this Act contains a recital that Parliament had \"adopted\" the Imperial Act by the first Act of 1914. Mr. Geoffrion contends that in fact that was not so. However that may be, I think the Act of 1920 by reviving the Acts of 1914, both of which had been repealed in 1919, which would include the declaration in the second Act as to the adoption of the Imperial Act, is a declaration by Parliament in 1920 that the Imperial legislation was adopted. In Foote's Private International Law, 5th ed. p. 35 the author states that Canada, Australia and Newfoundland did adopt the Act and I think that as to Canada that is a correct statement.\nThere has been no rescission of this adoption by Parliament and there is no attempt at rescission in the Orders in Council in question and it is provided, in any event, by section 9 subsection 4 of the Imperial Act that rescission is not to affect legal rights previously acquired. Section 26 subsection 1, however, provides that nothing in the Act shall prevent any legislature or Government of any British possession from treating differently different classes of British subjects. As to persons whose Certificates of Naturalization have been granted under the Act elsewhere than in Canada, it is provided by subsection 5 of section 7 of the Imperial legislation of 1918, 8 and 9 George V, cap. 38, that such a Certificate may be revoked in accordance with the section\nwith the concurrence of the Government of that part of His Majesty's Dominions in which the Certificate was granted.\nAs to naturalized persons, therefore, whose certificates were granted outside of Canada their status, by virtue of the Imperial Act, may not be affected by unilateral action on the part of Canada, but by reason of the provisions of section 26 subsection 1 the rights and liabilities incidental to status are left to Canada. This provision was the law existing before the statute as applied in the case Re Henry Adam[39]. No one would suggest that the provisions of the Immigration Act R.S.C. cap. 93 which excluded from Canada British subjects coming within the classes mentioned in section 3 of that Act are in any way in conflict with the provisions of Part II of the Imperial statute and the same may be said of the provisions of the Chinese Immigration Act R.S.C. cap. 95. It follows, therefore, that it is competent for Parliament to deny to British subjects naturalized outside of Canada the right of residence in Canada, but not to interfere with their status except upon the terms set forth in the Imperial Act, including the concurrence of whatever other government is concerned, nor in the case of persons naturalized in Canada to revoke naturalization except upon the terms of the Imperial Act, but again in the case of such persons it is competent to interfere with the rights and liabilities growing from such status.\nOrder P.C. 7355 recites in the case of Japanese nationals that they have manifested their sympathy with or support of Japan by making requests for repatriation to Japan and otherwise, but there is.no similar recital in the case of naturalized or natural born subjects. The recital with which P.C. 7356 begins is not to be interpreted, in my opinion, as broadening the scope of the recital in P.C. 7355. The loss of naturalization declared by Order 7356 is merely consequent upon physical removal of the persons concerned from Canada. It is not put upon any ground of disaffection upon which it might have been put under the provisions of section 7 of the Imperial Act as amended in 1918. The omission so to place it must, in my opinion, be taken to be deliberate, and as the ground upon which it is in fact put is not available under the terms of the Act in question, Order 7356 is invalid in so far as it purports to revoke naturalization but valid otherwise, and the provisions of Order 7355 which deny to naturalized persons the right of continued residence in Canada are valid.\nAs to the fourth class of persons dealt with by the orders in question, namely, the wives and children under 16 years of age \"of any person for whom the Minister makes an order for deportation to Japan\" my opinion is that the Orders in Council are invalid. It may be that some of the persons within this class are also within some one or other of the other classes and their position to that extent has already been dealt with. As to those who are not, however, there is nothing in any of the Orders to show that the Governor in Council considers their removal necessary or advisable within the ambit of the War Measures Act. The only attempt made in argument to support the Orders in the case of this class of person was the contention that the provision for their enforced removal was a humanitarian measure to prevent separation of families. That is not sufficient however. In Rex v. Comptroller of Patents[40], Clauson L.J. said:\u2014\nIt has been said that there might be a case where, on the face of it, the regulation was bad * * * If that means that, if, on reading the Order in Council, it appeared that in fact it did not appear to His Majesty to be necessary or expedient for the relevant purposes to make the regulation, I quite agree that, on the face of the order, it would be inoperative under this section.\nThis was referred to by Duff C.J.C. in the Chemicals case[41]. In my opinion, the Orders in Council here in question fall within the circumstances described by Clauson L.J. and are to the extent already indicated, invalid.\nMr. Cartwright further argued that section 9 of P.C. 7355 was invalid as contrary to section 5 of the War Measures Act itself, in which it is implicit that a person held for deportation may with the consent of the Minister of Justice have the ordinary remedy by way of Habeas Corpus. Mr. Cartwright argued that the words \"be deemed to be in legal custody\" in section 9 rules out this remedy.\nI do not think this argument is well founded. The argument is that an order valid on its face would, by reason of the words quoted, preclude all Habeas Corpus proceedings, even although the person held on the basis of such order did not belong to any of the classes mentioned in the Order in Council.\nThe point arose in R. v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs, ex parte Green[42]. In the Court of Appeal, at p. 121 Goddard L.J. said:\u2014\nI am of opinion that, where on the return, an order or warrant which is valid on the face is produced, it is for the prisoner to prove the facts necessary to controvert.\nA little lower down on the same page he said:\u2014\nBefore dealing with the subsidiary points raised by counsel for the appellant, I will deal with the question whether para. (8) of the regulation itself takes away the right to apply for a writ. It is said that, if it does not, the words \"shall be deemed to be in lawful custody\" are otiose, and it is claimed that, if the order purports to show that the prisoner is detained under the regulation, he must be deemed to be in lawful custody. I do not think that this is the meaning of, or the reason for, the clause. If the order has been irregularly made, the prisoner is not detained in pursuance of but despite the regulation. It is to be noted that the Aliens Restriction Order, 1916, contained a similar provision. It provided that an alien might be put on board a ship and detained in such manner as the Secretary of State directed and that, while so detained, should be deemed to be in lawful custody. In R. v. Chiswick Police Station Superintendent, Ex. p. Sacksteder[43], I think that Pickford L.J., at p. 584 took the same view as that which I have expressed of this provision. The object of the clause, in my opinion, is to provide that, once an order of detention is made, the person named in the order may be kept in custody anywhere, and not only in a lawful prison, even if the Secretary of State has not specified in the order a particular place for his internment.\nSee also the judgment of MacKinnon L.J. at p. 116. In the House of Lords, I refer to the judgment of Viscount Maugham at 394; Lord Wright, at 402 and 403. In my opinion the principles enunciated in these judgments are applicable to the point raised by Mr. Cartwright and I do not think that the paragraph objected to is other than valid.\nMr. Cartwright further argued that the provisions of Order 7355 relating to the sale of real and personal property of deportees by the Custodian of Enemy Property was invalid as repugnant to section 7 of the War Measures Act.\"Appropriation\" is defined by Murray among other definitions as \"to take possession for one's own.\" I think it is in this sense that \"appropriation\" is used in the War Measures Act and I do not think that the provisions of P.C. 7355 amount to appropriation in that sense.\nMr. Cartwright next argued that the Orders in Council constitute one scheme and the invalid parts are not severable from those parts which are valid. In fact it is stated in the factum of the Attorney General of Canada that\nthe latter two Orders in Council have no operation except by reason of the first Order in Council. The three Orders in Council constitute one scheme the validity of which depends on the first Order in Council P.C. 7355.\nIn my opinion, however, applying the proper principle to this question the orders are severable.\nThe question submitted on this reference is as follows:\nAre the Orders in Council dated the 15th day of December, 1945, being P.C. 7355, 7356 and 7357 ultra vires of the Governor in Council either in whole or in part and if so in what particular or particulars and to what extent.\nI would answer the question as follows:\n1. Order P.C. 7355 is valid except in the following particulars:\n(a) Subsection 3 of section 2 and section 3 are invalid in so far as they authorize the deportation of natural born British subjects who do not wish to leave Canada, and in so far as it prevents such persons from withdrawing consents at any time and in any manner.\n(b) Subsection 4 of section 2 is invalid in toto.\n2. Section 1 of Order P.C. 7356 is invalid in so far as it provides for loss of the status of a British subject.\n3. Order P.C. 7357 is valid save in so far as it may purport to authorize a departure from the provisions of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914.\nI hereby certify to His Excellency the Governor General in Council that the foregoing are my reasons for the answer to the question referred herein for hearing and consideration.\nR. L. KELLOCK Estey J.:\u2014The three Orders in Council numbered P.C. 7355, 7356 and 7357, with which we are here concerned, were passed under the authority of the War Measures Act, 1927, R.S.C., c. 206, on the 15th of December, 1945, and continued by Order in Council P.C. 7414 passed under the authority of section 4 of the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, (Dom. 9-10 Geo. VI, c. 25).\nCounsel for the Committee submits, apart from any other question respecting the validity of these Orders, they ceased to be effective when The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act came into force on January 1st, 1946. He points out that these Orders to be valid must be within the ambit of the War Measures Act and therefore passed as provided in the third section thereof \"by reason of the existence of real or apprehended war.\" That Parliament in enacting the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act embodied in section 5 thereof a declaration that on and after the 1st day of January, 1946, the war against Germany and Japan, for the purposes of the War Measures Act, should be deemed no longer to exist, and that therefore these Orders, even if valid when made on the 15th day of December, 1945, ceased to be effective as of the 1st day of January, 1946. Section 5 of the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, reads as follows:\n5. This Act shall come into force on the first day of January, one thousand nine hundred and forty-six, and on and after that day the war against Germany and Japan shall, for the purposes of the War Measures Act, be deemed no longer to exist.\nThis provision that \"the war against * * * Japan shall * * * be deemed no longer to exist\" is specifically limited in its application to the provisions of the War Measures Act and in effect merely removes the basis on which Orders in Council may be passed under that Act. It is not and does not purport to be a proclamation under section 2 of the War Measures Act declaring \"that the war, invasion or insurrection no longer exists.\" Section 2 of the War Measures Act provides:\n2. The issue of a proclamation by His Majesty, or under the authority of the Governor in Council shall be conclusive evidence that war, invasion, or insurrection, real or apprehended, exists and has existed for any period of time therein stated, and of its continuance, until by the issue of a further proclamation it is declared that the war, invasion or insurrection no longer exists. This section contemplates a period after the conclusion of actual combat during which the period of emergency caused by the war will continue. Parliament gave expression to the same view when it passed The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, and embodied in the preamble thereof:\n* * * the national emergency arising out of the war has continued since the unconditional surrender of Germany and Japan and is still continuing;\nParliament did recognize that the intensity and magnitude of the emergency had changed and diminished and under the provisions of this Act curtailed the extensive powers exercised by the Governor in Council under the War Measures Act.\nThe question whether an emergency exists or not is primarily a matter for Parliament, and through the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, Parliament is doing in a general way what was done in special cases following the last war. One of these was considered in Fort Frances Pulp and Power Co. v. Manitoba Free Press[44], where at p. 310 of Cameron, vol. 2, Viscount Haldane, in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, stated:\nBut very clear evidence that the crisis had wholly passed away would be required to justify the judiciary, even when the question raised was one of ultra vires which it had to decide, in overruling, the decision of the Government that exceptional measures were still requisite.\nAnd at p. 311:\nAt what date did the disturbed state of Canada which the war had produced so entirely pass away that the legislative measures relied on in the present case became ultra vires? It is enough to say that there is no clear and unmistakable evidence that the Government was in error in thinking that the necessity was still in existence at the dates on which the action in question was taken by the Paper Control Tribunal.\nApart from the provision embodied in section 5 of The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, there was no suggestion that the emergency arising out of the war no longer existed.\nThen it is provided in section 4 of the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945:\n4. Without prejudice to any other power conferred by this Act, the Governor in Council may order that the orders and regulations lawfully made under the War Measures Act or pursuant to authority created under the said Act in force immediately before the day this Act comes into force shall, while this Act is in force, continue in full force and effect subject to amendment or revocation under this Act.\nParliament by this provision expressly authorized the Governor in Council to continue not some but any or all of the Orders in Council already passed and still in force under the War Measures Act. The Governor in Council, acting under this authority, on the 28th day of December, 1945, passed Order in Council P.C. 7414 whereby it was ordered that:\n* * * all orders and regulations lawfully made under the War Measures Act or pursuant to authority created under the said Act in force immediately before the day The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, comes into force shall, while that Act is in force, continue in full force and effect subject to amendment or revocation under that Act.\nThis Order in Council, passed under said section 4, continues as effective the Orders in Council here in question, namely P.C. 7355, 7356 and 7357.\nThe fact that Order in Council P.C. 7414 was made and dated the 28th day of December, 1945, and therefore prior to the coming into force of The National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, 1945, on January 1, 1946, does not affect its validity as such a procedure is provided for in section 12 of the Interpretation Act, 1927, R.S.C., c. 1.\nCounsel for the Committee submitted that if these Orders were still effective as above indicated that the provisions thereof, at least in part, exceeded the powers delegated by Parliament under the War Measures Act to the Governor in Council. That the Governor in Council can only legislate by Order in Council within the powers so delegated is stated by my Lord The Chief Justice in Re Chemicals[45],\nThe powers conferred upon the Governor in Council by the War Measures Act constitute a law-making authority, an authority to pass legislative enactments such as should be deemed necessary and advisable by reason of war; and, when acting within those limits, the Governor in Council is vested with plenary powers of legislation as large and of the same nature as those of Parliament itself (Lord Selborne in The Queen v. Burah[46]). Within the ambit of the Act by which his authority is measured, the Governor in Council is given the same authority as is vested in Parliament itself. He has been given a law-making power.\nThat it is an enactment to enable the government to deal effectively in time of emergency with matters of security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada, and that its language should be so construed has been emphasized in this Court. Fitzpatrick C.J.:\nIt seems to me obvious that parliament intended, as the language used implies, to clothe the executive with the widest powers in time of danger. Taken literally, the language of the section contains unlimited powers. In re Gray[47].\nKerwin J.:\nThe provisions of subsection 1 of section 3 are in as wide terms as may be imagined. As Mr. Justice Anglin stated in In re Gray,[48], \"more comprehensive language it would be difficult to find\". In Re Chemicals[49].\nIt is under the War Measures Act that these three Orders in Council have been passed. There is much to be said for the view that they should be read and construed as a code or a unit designed in the main to carry out the express desires of those of the Japanese race who have requested the government to arrange for their going to Japan. It is true that in addition to those who have made requests, these Orders provide for the return to Japan of those Japanese nationals who were interned during the war and remained so on September 1st, 1945. They also provide for a Commission to inquire and recommend with respect to certain Japanese nationals and naturalized persons of the Japanese race in Canada. They also provide that the wives and the children under sixteen of any one with respect to whom an order for deportation has been made \"may be included.\" These provisions will be more particularly discussed hereafter, but they do not detract from the main intent and purpose underlying the passage of these Orders in Council.\nThat these Orders do not apply to all of the Japanese race in Canada but in the main to those only who have requested that they be sent to Japan is made plain in the recitals to P.C. 7355:\nWhereas during the course of the war with Japan certain Japanese nationals manifested their sympathy with or support of Japan by making requests for repatriation to Japan and otherwise;\nAnd whereas other persons of the Japanese race have requested or may request that they be sent to Japan; And whereas it is deemed desirable that provisions be made to deport the classes of persons referred to above;\nAnd whereas it is considered necessary by reason of the war, for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada, that provision be made accordingly;\nThis Order includes provisions for revocation of the request on the part of those of the Japanese race who were naturalized or born in Canada. It seems appropriate that this purpose and intent be kept in mind throughout an examination of the provisions and construction of these Orders in Council. Such was the position taken in England as evidenced by the statement of Lord Maugham:\nMy Lords, I think we should approach the construction of reg. 18B of the Defence (General) Regulations without any general presumption as to its (meaning except the universal presumption, applicable to Orders in Council and other like instruments, that, if there is a reasonable doubt as to the meaning of the words used, we should prefer a construction which will carry into effect the plain intention of those responsible for the Order in Council rather than one which will defeat that intention.\nLiversidge v. Sir John Anderson[50]\nCounsel for the Committee submitted that the word \"deportation\" as used in section 3 of the War Measures Act is restricted to the deportation of aliens, and as these Orders made under that Act deal with other than aliens, the Governor in Council has exceeded his authority. The standard dictionaries do not agree as to the precise meaning of this word. It is restricted to aliens in Fong Yue Ting v. U.S.A.[51]. It is applied to native-born in Eshugbayi Eleko v. Government of Nigeria (Officer Administering),[52]. As defined in the Immigration Act, 1927, R.S.C., c. 93, it is not restricted to aliens. Upon this reference it is not necessary to precisely define the word. It is enough to emphasize that as it is applied in law it is a compulsory sending out of, or as stated in the Oxford Dictionary \"a forcible removal,\" and that, while it need not be restricted to aliens, it does apply to them.\nThe first of these Orders in Council, P.C. 7355, deals with four groups. Para. 2(1) provides for those Japanese nationals who either have made a request for repatriation since December 8th, 1941, or were detained under the Defence of Canada Regulations and so detained on September 1st, 1945. These Japanese nationals are aliens and as such are subject to deportation. The provision of the Order in Council for their deportation is valid. Attorney-General for Canada v. Cain[53], where Lord Atkinson at p. 634 states as follows:\nOne of the rights possessed by the supreme power in every State is the right to refuse to permit an alien to enter that State, to annex (what conditions it pleases to the permission to enter it, and to expel or deport from the State, at pleasure, even a friendly alien, especially if it considers his presence in the State opposed to its peace, order, and good government, or to its social or material interest.\nThe second group is dealt with under para. 2 (2) of P.C. 7355. It provides for the deportation of those of the Japanese race who have become naturalized, who have requested repatriation since the declaration of war and who have not revoked that request prior to midnight of the first day of September, 1945. It is contended that the Parliament of Canada has no power to revoke this naturalization except by virtue of the provisions of the Naturalization Act, 1927, R.S.C., c. 138. More particularly because it adopts, as Part II of the Naturalization Act, Part II of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914, being c. 17, 4 & 5 Geo. V, and amendments thereto as contemplated by the latter Act; the purpose and intent being to make for greater uniformity in the procedure and requirements of British nationality and the granting of naturalization certificates throughout specified parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations. It also provides for the revocation of these certificates. Section 9 in part reads as follows:\n9. (1) Where the Governor in Council, upon the report of the Minister, is satisfied * * * that the person to whom the certificate was granted has shown himself by act or speech to be disaffected or disloyal to His Majesty, the Governor in Council shall by order revoke the certificate.\nThis provision was enacted by the Parliament of Great Britain in 1918, being an Act to amend the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914 (8 & 9 Geo. V, c. 38), and was enacted in Canada by an Act to revise and amend the Naturalization Act, 1914 (1920, R.S.C., c. 59). These amendments were made as a result of the experiences arising out of the last war and deal specifically with and greatly enlarge the provisions for revocation of naturalization. Westlake's Private International Law, 7th ed. at p. 371, referring to this particular legislation:\nThe powers of revocation are large and somewhat vague; and the idea of a nationality conditional on good behaviour and on keeping in close touch with the British dominions is one new in English law. Experience alone will show whether it will be desirable to keep it as a permanent variety of citizenship.\nAnd again, referring to the same legislation, at p. 372:\nThe legislature or government of any British possession has the same power to grant a certificate of naturalization as the secretary of state has under the Act; and the provisions of the Act as to the grant and revocation of the certificate of naturalization apply.\nThis section 9 provides authority for the revocation of a certificate of naturalization when the recipient thereof shows \"himself by act or speech to be disaffected or disloyal to His Majesty.\" A revocation at least by that government which has granted same and issued the certificate therefor. This appears from the entire section, but is made abundantly clear by subsection (6) hereafter quoted, which goes further and envisages the cancellation by one government of a naturalization granted by another government in some other part of His Majesty's dominions. It was contended by Mr. Geoffrion that Canada had not adopted Part II but had enacted a new Act modelled after the British Act. In either view, in my opinion the legislation provides for revocation by the government granting the naturalization.\nIt seems to me that if during a state of war and the emergency resulting therefrom one so naturalized makes a request in writing for repatriation, he does so because of the war and matters associated therewith. The making of such a request and the persistence therein, as in this case to September 1st, 1945, a date after the cessation of hostilities, provides evidence that with respect to such a person his affections are not with Canada, the land of his adoption, but rather with the country from which he originally came. The effect of such conduct is a matter for the consideration of the responsible authorities of the State.\nThe only question with which we are here concerned is whether the Governor in Council had authority under the War Measures Act to provide for the deportation and the revocation of certificates of naturalization by Order in Council P.C. 7355. In my opinion the authority here exercised could in peacetime be exercised under the Naturalization Act. In time of emergency this can be accomplished under the War Measures Act through the medium of the Governor in Council passing an Order in Council and therefore in my opinion this paragraph in Order in Council P.C. 7355 is valid. In Re Gray.[54]\nThe same section 9 contains a sub-paragraph (6) reading as follows:\n6. Where a person to whom a certificate of naturalization has been granted in some other part of His Majesty's dominions is resident in Canada, the certificate may be revoked in accordance with this section by the Governor in Council, with the concurrence of the Government of that part of His Majesty's dominions in which the certificate was granted.\nA paragraph to the same effect is in the Imperial Act (Sec. 7 (5), c. 38, 8 & 9 Geo. V). It expressly contemplates the revocation of naturalization certificates granted by some other government in His Majesty's dominions, but that this right will not be exercised without the concurrence of that government which granted it. This may conceivably affect some parties, although we were supplied with no information upon the point. If there be some, we can rely upon the government in the exercise of these powers to respect any statutory obligations which it has assumed toward other component parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations. I do not think the existence of such an undertaking invalidates this paragraph.\nThe third group is dealt with under para 2(3) of P.C. 7355. It is the natural-born British subject of the Japanese race who has \"made a request for repatriation,\" and who has not \"revoked in writing such request prior to the making by the Minister of an order for deportation.\" It is not only the request but the persistence in that request that is emphasized by paras. 2(2) and 2(3). The naturalized citizen of the Japanese race might have revoked up to midnight of the 1st day of September, 1945. The natural-born British subject of the Japanese race may revoke at any time up to the moment of the Minister making his order. At the hearing counsel stated no order had been made and would not be made until after this decision is handed down. With respect to this group the right to revoke still remains, but unless that right to revoke is exercised as above indicated the Governor in Council concluded that with respect to such a person it was \"necessary by reason of the war for the security * * *\" he should go to Japan.\nIt is contended that these people are being compelled to go, are being deported. In reality they are going because they made the request to go and have persisted in that request as evidenced by their not revoking same. The government, in compliance with their request, has arranged for their transportation, the cost thereof, the disposition of their property and the dispatch of the proceeds therefrom to them in Japan, and has arranged for their own reception in Japan. In making these arrangements pursuant to the requests of the parties, it was only reasonable, if not necessary, that some date be fixed when revocation could not be made. It appears that this Order in Council fixes the last practical date upon which revocation ought to be permitted.\nIn no real sense can this be regarded as deportation. It is the procedure of deportation founded upon the request of the respective individuals to go to Japan and to become a citizen of Japan. It is not a \"forcible removal.\" There is no element of compulsion, a going against the will that is present in deportation. For reasons of their own these British subjects, entitled to the benefits and privileges and obligated to discharge the duties and responsibilities of British subjects at a critical time in the history of this country, intimate a desire to return to the country of their racial origin and to remain and become citizens of that country.\nIf these same parties went to Japan and acquired a citizenship there, the Naturalization Act, 1927, R.S.C., c. 138, s. 16, provides for their being deprived of British citizenship. A similar provision is contained in the Imperial Act, 4 & 5 Geo. V, c. 13, s. 17. This cancellation of citizenship is recognized by the comity of nations. The basis, therefore, is disaffection as evidenced by the voluntary acquisition of nationality in the country of their now residence. The people with whom we are here concerned have expressed their disaffection for Canada and set forth their affection for Japan. They have coupled therewith a desire to go to Japan. The Governor in Council under the circumstances decided to facilitate their going by perfecting the arrangements therefor as above indicated. This is more a matter of policy for the government than a question of jurisdiction for the courts.\nIt should be observed that their British citizenship is not cancelled by these Orders in Council. It is therefore suggested that at some future date they may return to Canada. That is a matter for the authorities and one which they have no doubt considered. In any event, it does not affect the validity of the Order and is not a matter to be considered upon this reference.\nIn my opinion the Parliament of Canada could so legislate and this paragraph is valid.\nThe fourth group is dealt with in para. 2(4). It affects the wife and children under sixteen years of age of any person for whom the Minister makes an order for deportation to Japan and provides that they \"may be included in such order and deported with such person.\" It is possible that some of the wives may be classed under para. 2(1), 2(2) or 2(3), but apart from those it will be observed that they may be sent away notwithstanding they have not signed a request, nor is there any recital or statement on the part of the Governor in Council that \"such is necessary or advisable for the security * * *\" as required by the War Measures Act. Moreover, under the Naturalization Act, and particularly the amendments thereto in 1931, it may be that many of the wives were born in Canada, still retain their British citizenship and desire to remain here. There is, therefore, involved with respect to them an element of compulsion which under this Order in Council cannot be justified.\nIt was suggested that this paragraph was included that families might not be separated. That is desirable, and that may be all that was contemplated. As passed the paragraph goes much further. It may be amended under the provisions of section 4 of the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act to take care of such cases and not involve the possibility of a British subject who has not signed a request, and therefore entitled to remain in Canada, being compelled to go to Japan because her husband has requested that he go. It is difficult to phrase a rule that should apply to all of the children, but generally speaking the children ought not to be sent unless both parents are going. In my opinion, as drafted this paragraph cannot be supported as valid.\nCounsel for the Committee submits that para. 6 of P.C. 7355 is beyond the powers of the Governor in Council because it is in conflict with section 7 of the War Measures Act. I do not think that contention is tenable. Section 7 of the War Measures Act is dealing with the appropriation of property by His Majesty for which compensation is to be made, and in the event of no agreement as to the compensation it will be determined by the Exchequer or other designated Court. In para. 6 of P.C. 7355 His Majesty is not appropriating property in that sense, but is taking possession of the property, disposing of same and transmitting the proceeds, less expenses incurred therewith, to the owner who has gone to Japan under one of these Orders. No question of compensation is involved. The sections deal with entirely different matters with respect to which there is no conflict.\nCounsel for the Committee also submits that para. 9 of P.C. 7355 is ultra vires in that it is contrary to the provisions of section 5 of the War Measures Act. Para. 9 reads as follows:\n9. Any person for whom an order for deportation is made and who is detained pending deportation or who is placed under restraint in the course of deportation by virtue of any order or measure made or taken under section 4 of this Order shall, while so detained or restrained, be deemed to be in legal custody.\nSection 5 of the War Measures Act reads as follows:\n5. No person who is held for deportation under this Act or under any regulation made thereunder, or is under arrest or detention as an alien enemy, or upon suspicion that he is an alien enemy, or to prevent his departure from Canada, shall be released upon bail or otherwise discharged or tried, without the consent of the Minister of Justice.\nIn particular Counsel contends that para. 9 deprives a person detained under Order in Council P.C. 7355 of the right to have the legality of his detention inquired into under habeas corpus proceedings because by its express provisions the legality of the custody is finally determined in the words \"deemed to be in legal custody,\" and therefore a return to the writ that the person was so detained would preclude further inquiry. While section 5 of the War Measures Act specifically contemplates such proceedings with the consent of the Minister of Justice, this para. 9 purports to take away the right thereto and is therefore beyond the powers of the Governor in Council.\nIt should be observed that there are no express words in para. 9 which deny the party detained the right to apply for a writ of habeas corpus nor provide that a return as above indicated would preclude further inquiry. This writ and its availability to the subject is jealously guarded by the courts. It is one of the methods by which the subject may question the legality of his detention and is regarded as an assurance to the subject that he will not be illegally held under arrest or detention. Therefore, it has become an established rule that only express language or language so definite as to point directly and imperatively to such a conclusion that will be sufficient to deprive the subject of the benefit of this writ. In Shin Shim v. The King,[55] notwithstanding the strong language of the Chinese Immigration Act, 1927, R.S.C., c. 95, a procedure by way of a writ of habeas corpus was held to be open to a party detained under that Act who desired to raise the question that she was a British subject, notwithstanding the decision of the Controller of Chinese Immigration to the contrary.\nThe Defence (General) Regulations, 1939, as adopted by the Government of Great Britain, include as section 8:\n8. Any person detained in pursuance of this regulation shall be deemed to be in lawful custody and shall be detained in such place as may be authorized by the Secretary of State and in accordance with instructions issued by him.\nThe words \"deemed to be in lawful custody\" are identical in meaning and effect to those used in section 9 of P.C. 7355, and yet an application for writ of habeas corpus was heard notwithstanding the provisions of section 8. The King v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs,[56] Green v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs,[57]. In the former case section 8 was not referred to, or if so not seriously pressed. In the latter is was specifically raised as a bar to the writ of habeas corpus both in the Court of Appeal and before the House of Lords. In the Court of Appeal[58] Lord Justice Goddard at p. 116 specifically deals with this provision as follows:\nI will deal with the question whether para. (8) of the regulation itself takes away the right to apply for a writ. It is said that, if it does not, the words \"shall be deemed to be in lawful custody\" are otiose, and it is claimed that, if the order purports to show that the prisoner is detained under the regulation, he must be deemed to be in lawful custody. I do not think that this is the meaning or the reason for the paragraph. If the order has been irregularly made the prisoner is not detained in pursuance of, but despite, the regulation. It is to be noted that the Aliens Restriction Order, 1916, contained a similar provision. It provided that an alien might be put on board a ship and detained in such a manner as the Secretary of State directed, and while so detained should be deemed to be in lawful custody. In ex parte Sacksteder,[59] I think that Pickford L. J. took the same view that I have expressed of this provision. The object of the paragraph, in my opinion, is to provide that once an order of detention is made, the person named in the order may be kept in custody anywhere, and not only in a lawful prison, even if the Secretary of State has not specified in the order a particular place for his internment, which he can do later.\nIn the House of Lords Lord Wright speaks as follows:\nIn the first place, para. 8 of the regulation does not, in my opinion, render lawful a detention which is, apart from para. 8, unlawful and unwarranted by the Secretary's powers. It is inserted to settle possible doubts as to prison law and practice. Liversidge v. Sir John Anderson[60]\nA perusal of this section 9 will indicate how apt are the words of Lord Goddard in ascertaining its effect. It reads in part:\nAny person * * * who is detained * * * or who is placed under restraint in the course of deportation. * * * shall * * * while so detained or restrained, be deemed to be in legal custody.\nIt is his detention or restraint, wherever that may be, that will \"be deemed to be in legal custody.\" It does not preclude an inquiry as to whether that legal custody is justified or legal within the terms of the Order in Council. It does not therefore deprive the party so detained or restrained of his right to apply for a writ of habeas corpus. This suggested conflict between section 9 and section 5 in my opinion does not exist.\nIt is contended that the right of a British subject to reside and to remain in Canada is a civil right and further that para. 6 of Order in Council P.C. 7355 providing for the protection, sale and dispatch of the proceeds to Japan realized from the sale of property belonging to a party who has been deported, is also a matter of property and civil rights; that under the B.N.A. Act by section 92(13) such matters are of provincial jurisdiction and in so far as the Parliament of Canada may purport to legislate with respect thereto, that legislation will be ultra vires and therefore in so far as these Orders in Council being legislation purporting to deal with these matters they are ultra vires.\nThe validity and effect of these contentions under normal conditions need not be here examined. These Orders in Council constitute legislation passed under circumstances of an emergency when the relationship between the dominion and the provinces is for the time being somewhat changed. Similar questions were raised in Fort Frances Pulp & Power Co. v. Manitoba Free Press,[61] and the answer there given is applicable to this case. Viscount Haldane (2 Cam. at p. 309):\nIt is proprietary and civil rights in new relations, which they do not present in normal times, that have to be dealt with; and these relations, which affect Canada as an entirety, fall within s. 91, because in their fullness they extend beyond what s. 92 can really cover. The kind of power adequate for dealing with them is only to be found in that part of the constitution which establishes power in the State as a whole. For it is not one that can be reliably provided for by depending on collective action of the Legislatures of the individual Provinces agreeing for the purpose. That the basic instrument on which the character of the entire constitution depends should be construed as providing for such centralised power in an emergency situation follows from the manifestation in the language of the Act of the principle that the instrument has among its purposes to provide for the State regarded as a whole, and for the expression and influence of its public opinion as such. * * * Their Lordships, therefore, entertain no doubt that however the wording of ss. 91 and 92 may have laid down a framework under which, as a general principle, the Dominion Parliament is to be excluded from trenching on property and civil rights in the Provinces of Canada, yet in a sufficiently great emergency such as that arising out of war, there is implied the power to deal adequately with that emergency for the safety of the Dominion as a whole. The enumeration in s. 92 is not in any way repealed in the event of such an occurrence, but a new aspect of the business of Government is recognized as emerging, an aspect which is not covered or precluded by the general words in which powers are assigned to the Legislatures of the Provinces as individual units. Where an exact line of demarcation will lie in such cases it may not be easy to lay down a priori, nor is it necessary. In view of the foregoing authority, the contentions that the provisions of these Orders in Council are in these regards ultra vires the Governor in Council under the War Measures Act are not tenable.\nThe second of these Orders in Council, P.C. 7356, provides that:\nAny person who, being a British subject by naturalization * * * is deported from Canada under the provisions of Order in Council P.C. 7355 * * * shall * * * cease to be either a British subject or a Canadian national.\nIt concerns only those of the Japanese race who have been naturalized in Canada and have been dealt with under para. 2(2) of Order in Council 7355, and for the reasons there discussed, in my opinion this Order in Council is valid.\nThe third Order in Council, P.C. 7357, sets up a Commission of three persons:\n* * * To make inquiry concerning the activities, loyalty and the extent of co-operation with the Government of Canada during the war of Japanese nationals and naturalized persons of the Japanese race in Canada in 'cases where their names are referred to the Commission by the Minister of Labour for investigation with a view to recommending whether in the circumstances of any such case such person should be deported.\nThe authority of the government to order such an inquiry cannot be questioned. The power of Parliament to legislate with respect to Japanese nationals and naturalized persons of the Japanese race has already been discussed when dealing with para. 2(1) and 2(2) of P.C. 7355. In any event, this Commission is but a fact-finding body with power to recommend to the Minister. Any order for deportation as a consequence thereof is upon the recommendation of the Minister, and the Governor in Council may pass such under para. 2(1) or 2(2) of P.C. 7355.\nIn the second paragraph thereof the Commission has power to review the case of any person of the Japanese race who was naturalized in Canada and who made a request for repatriation notwithstanding the provisions of Order in Council P.C. 7355. This is obviously but providing an opportunity for the reviewing of the case of one who has been ordered to be deported as a consequence of his request and notwithstanding that he did not withdraw same before the 1st day of September, 1945. In my opinion these Orders in Council, except with respect to one group dealt with in para. 2(4) of P.C. 7355, are as passed within the competency of the Governor in Council under the War Measures Act; that para. 2(4) of P.C. 7355, being as passed invalid, does not affect the validity of the other provisions of the Orders in Council. In my opinion with respect to the different groups the provisions of these Orders in Council are severable. Brooks-Bidlake and Whittall, Ltd. v. Attorney-General for British Columbia (1).\nThe question submitted on this reference is as follows:\nAre the Orders in Council dated the 15th day of December, 1945, being P.C. 7355, 7356 and 7357, ultra vires of the Governor in Council either in whole or in part and, if so, in what particular or particulars and to what extent?\nIn my opinion all of the Orders in Council are intra vires of the Governor in Council, with the exception of para. 2(4) of P.C. 7355.\nI hereby certify to His Excellency the Governor General in Council that the foregoing are my reasons for the answer to the question referred herein for hearing and consideration.\nJ.

Ernest Laforce (Defendant) Respondent.\n1946: March 6; 1946: March 29.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin, Hudson, Rand and Estey JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nAppeal\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Petition for leave to appeal\u2014Appointment of respondent as civil service commissioner\u2014Whether irregular and illegal\u2014Respondent being over age limit of 65 and appointed as sole commissioner\u2014Alleged to be in violation of Civil Service Act\u2014Petition asking for writ of Quo Warranto and for payment of fine to the Crown by respondent\u2014Leave to appeal refused\u2014Sub-sections (b), (c) and (f) of section 41 of the Supreme Court Act not applicable.\nThe appellant, a registrar in charge of a lands registry office, was dismissed by orders in council. The respondent, sole member of the Civil Service Commission, had previously recommended, as required by the Civil Service Act, such dismissal to the Executive Council. The appellant then took proceedings (Quo Warranto), asking inter alia that it be declared that the respondent was usurping the office of commissioner, that he be expelled therefrom and that he be condemned to pay to the Crown a penalty not exceeding $400, with rights to damages reserved. The main grounds of the petition were that the respondent, when appointed, was beyond the age limit of 65 years prescribed by the Act as the retiring age limit (s. 6) and that the order-in-council appointing him as sole commissioner was passed in violation of section 4 of the Act. The respondent contended that he was lawfully exercising the functions of his office under the authority of an order-in-council, and that the matter of such functions and of the Civil Service Commission belong to the executive, and not to the judicial authority, especially under the circumstances of the case. The Superior Court dealt with the merits of the appellant's petition and dismissed it. The appellate court held, by a majority, that the appellant had not shown that he had the special interest required by article 987 C.C.P. to bring his proceedings, which were not, moreover, appropriate to the allegations and conclusions of his petition. Upon a motion for leave to appeal to this Court made by the appellant under sub-sections (b), (c) and (f) of section 41 of the Supreme Court Act.\nHeld that this Court has no jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal.\nThe sole fact that the respondent may be condemned to pay a fine to the Crown does not meet the requirements of sub-section (b), which applies to a claim filed by the Crown itself. Such fine is not part \"of the matter in controversy on the appeal,\" as the appellant's action could be maintained without any fine being imposed.\nThe \"rights in future\" of the appellant are in no way affected. Any rights he may have would be decisively determined by any decision rendered upon the proceedings taken by him. The provisions of sub-section (c), therefore, are not applicable.\nThe salary of which the appellant may be deprived and the damages he may be entitled to, even if exceeding $1,000, cannot be taken into account in order to make up \"the amount or value of the matter in controversy in the appeal\" within the provisions of subsection (f).\nMOTION for leave to appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming by a majority the judgment of the Superior Court, Gibsone J. and dismissing the appellant's action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nF. Choquette K.C. for the motion.\nL. E. Beaulieu K.C. contra. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice: L'appelant, qui a succomb\u00e9 tant devant la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure que devant la Cour du Banc du Roi (si\u00e9geant en appel), a fait \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re cour une requ\u00eate pour permission d'appeler \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada. Cette requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e (les honorables juges Gagn\u00e9 et Pratte dissidents) et il s'adresse maintenant \u00e0 notre Cour pour obtenir cette permission, en vertu de l'article 41 de la Loi de la Cour Supr\u00eame.\nLa proc\u00e9dure dont il s'agit est une requ\u00eate de la part de l'appelant pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure du district de Qu\u00e9bec et concluant \u00e0 ce qu'il \u00e9mane un bref ordonnant \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de compara\u00eetre pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la demande contenue dans cette requ\u00eate et prouver l'autorit\u00e9 en vertu de laquelle l'intim\u00e9 s'est permis d'occuper, de d\u00e9tenir et d'exercer la charge de pr\u00e9sident et membre unique de la Commission du Service Civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec; \u00e0 ce que par le jugement \u00e0 intervenir, il soit dit et d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9 exerce ill\u00e9galement cette charge sous toutes les peines que de droit; et que l'intim\u00e9 soit d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9 et exclu de cette charge; qu'au surplus il soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il n'a pas le droit d'assumer lui seul les pouvoirs de la Commission; qu'il lui soit fait d\u00e9fense d'assumer ainsi et d'usurper ces pouvoirs; \u00e0 ce que tous les actes que l'intim\u00e9 a pu poser pour et au nom de la Commission et en sa qualit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9sident et de membre unique de cette Commission, en tant que ces actes concernent l'appelant et sa fonction de R\u00e9gistrateur, ou son remplacement comme tel, soient d\u00e9clar\u00e9s ultra vires, nuls et annul\u00e9s \u00e0 toutes fins que de droit; et \u00e0 ce que l'intim\u00e9 soit condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 une amende n'exc\u00e9dant pas la somme de $400.00 payable \u00e0 la Couronne, suivant les formalit\u00e9s pr\u00e9vues par la loi.\nDans cette requ\u00eate, l'appelant se r\u00e9serve le droit de prendre telles conclusions ult\u00e9rieures qu'il sera n\u00e9cessaire de prendre, et il se r\u00e9serve particuli\u00e8rement tout recours contre l'intim\u00e9 pour le salaire dont il pourra \u00eatre priv\u00e9, ainsi que les dommages qu'il a subis et qu'il pourra subir par suite des actes pr\u00e9tendus ill\u00e9gaux de l'intim\u00e9. Le tout avec d\u00e9pens.\nA cette requ\u00eate, l'intim\u00e9 a produit une contestation o\u00f9 il nie chacun des paragraphes de la requ\u00eate et o\u00f9 il ajoute que les proc\u00e9dures de l'appelant sont mal fond\u00e9es en fait et en droit; qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 membre de la Commission du Service Civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, \u00e0 compter du premier novembre 1944, par arr\u00eat\u00e9-en-conseil du gouvernement de la province (dont il produit copie) et que depuis il exerce ses fonctions l\u00e9galement.\nIl all\u00e8gue que l'exercice des fonctions de membre de la Commission du Service Civil de la province de Qu\u00e9bec est de la comp\u00e9tence du pouvoir ex\u00e9cutif et qu'elles ne rel\u00e8vent pas du pouvoir judiciaire, sp\u00e9cialement et sans restrictions dans les circonstances all\u00e9gu\u00e9es par l'appelant et de la fa\u00e7on qu'il a adopt\u00e9e pour amener l'appelant devant les tribunaux.\nDans une premi\u00e8re r\u00e9ponse, l'appelant avait r\u00e9torqu\u00e9 que l'arr\u00eat\u00e9-en-conseil invoqu\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9 violait la Loi du Service Civil et qu'il \u00e9tait nul, illegal, inexistant et sans effet, et il en a demand\u00e9 l'annulation. Mais, quoique cela n'apparaisse pas au dossier qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis devant nous \u00e0 l'occasion de la requ\u00eate pour permission d'appeler, l'avocat de l'intim\u00e9 nous a dit que cette partie de la r\u00e9ponse avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e du dossier; avec la cons\u00e9quence que la r\u00e9ponse telle qu'elle y subsiste n'est devenue qu'une simple d\u00e9n\u00e9gation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate de l'appelant et la majorit\u00e9 des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi (en appel) a confirm\u00e9 ce jugement, bien que pour des motifs absolument diff\u00e9rents.\nLe jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure se prononce sur le m\u00e9rite de la requ\u00eate. Le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi, en appel, se base sur les articles 77, 87a, 987 et suivants du code de proc\u00e9dure civile.\nL'article 87a est celui qui prescrit que nulle proc\u00e9dure par voie d'injonction, de mandamus, ou toute autre mesure sp\u00e9ciale ou provisionnelle, n'est recevable contre le gouvernement de la province ou contre l'un de ses ministres ou contre un officier agissant en vertu d'instructions de l'un de ses ministres, pour toute chose faite ou omise ou projet\u00e9e dans l'exercice de ses fonctions, y compris l'exercice de toute autorit\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9e par un Acte de la l\u00e9gislature. Les articles 987 et suivants sont ceux qui traitent de l'usurpation de charges publiques ou corporatives ou de franchises, soit: la proc\u00e9dure commun\u00e9ment connue sous la d\u00e9nomination de quo warranto.\nLes motifs du jugement formel de la Cour du Banc du Roi, si\u00e9geant en appel, sont d'abord que la loi exige que toute demande en justice ne puisse \u00eatre port\u00e9e que par celui qui y a un int\u00e9r\u00eat, et que cette prescription de la loi est sp\u00e9cifiquement r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9e dans l'article 987 qui stipule que nulle autre qu'une\npersonne int\u00e9ress\u00e9e peut porter plainte lorsqu'un individu usurpe, prend sans permission, tient ou exerce ill\u00e9galement: (1) une charge publique, une franchise ou une pr\u00e9rogative dans la province;\nLe jugement poursuit en disant qu'il est n\u00e9cessaire qu'un tel int\u00e9r\u00eat soit personnel et qu'il ne peut \u00eatre l'int\u00e9r\u00eat d'une autre personne ou l'int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'une collectivit\u00e9, o\u00f9 le demandeur pr\u00e9tendrait poursuivre pour tous ceux qui font partie de ladite collectivit\u00e9; et que le requ\u00e9rant n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir l'existence de cet int\u00e9ret personnel, vu que, m\u00eame en accordant les conclusions de sa requ\u00eate, le jugement n'aurait pas pour effet de rendre vacante la charge de R\u00e9gistrateur qu'il occupait auparavant, et ne serait pas un\nmoyen de parvenir \u00e0 cr\u00e9er une vacance de cette charge permettant d'y r\u00e9installer ou d'y r\u00e9int\u00e9grer l'appelant;\nque, quant aux autres conclusions de l'appelant, celles en annulation \"des actes faits par l'intim\u00e9 le concernant et concernant sa charge de R\u00e9gistrateur\" ne sont pas autoris\u00e9es par les articles 989 et 990 du code de proc\u00e9dure civile et ne peuvent lui \u00eatre accord\u00e9es; sans compter qu'elles ne pourraient valois contre le titulaire actuel de la charge de R\u00e9gistrateur qui n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en cause; qu'il y a donc d\u00e9faut de la part du requ\u00e9rant d'\u00e9tablir l'int\u00e9r\u00eat personnel essentiellement requis.\nM. le juge Walsh a \u00e9t\u00e9, en plus, d'avis que la prohibition \u00e9dict\u00e9e par l'article 87a du code de proc\u00e9dure civile est indiscutablement fatale \u00e0 la requ\u00eate du requ\u00e9rant.\nEt la Cour conclut que le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance est donc bien fond\u00e9 dans son dispositif. L'honorable judge Errol McDougal, de son c\u00f4t\u00e9, declare concourir dans l'arr\u00eat qui rejette l'appel et il dit:\nWhatever may be the recourse of the appellant, I am firmly convinced that it is not to be exercised by proceedings in quo warranto directed to the Respondent.\nL'honorable juge Gagn\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 dissident et \u00e9tait d'avis que la requ\u00eate en quo warranto e\u00fbt d\u00fb \u00eatre maintenue; mais, pour les fins de la discussion au sujet de la requ\u00eate pour permission d'appeler qui nous est actuellement soumise, nous ne devons nous occuper que de l'effet du jugement de la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour du Banc du Roi.\nIl suit de tout ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de que le jugement qui subsiste en l'esp\u00e8ce, n'est pas celui de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, o\u00f9 le m\u00e9rite de la question a \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9, mais celui de la Cour du Banc du Roi (en appel) qui ne d\u00e9cide absolument rien sur les propositions au m\u00e9rite de l'appelant et qui a rejet\u00e9 sa requ\u00eate simplement parce que, de l'avis de la majorit\u00e9 des juges de cette Cour, le requ\u00e9rant n'avait pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il avait l'int\u00e9r\u00eat requis pour intenter sa proc\u00e9dure, et que, au surplus, la proc\u00e9dure qu'il avait adopt\u00e9e n'\u00e9tait pas appropri\u00e9e aux all\u00e9gations et aux conclusions de sa requ\u00eate.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi n'a nullement adopt\u00e9 les motifs donn\u00e9s par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour rejeter la requ\u00eate de l'appelant. Cela est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 en toutes lettres dans les notes du jugement.\nIl reste donc que le seul jugement qui se soit prononc\u00e9 dans la cause sur l'interpr\u00e9tation de la loi instituant une Commission du Service Civil, sanctionn\u00e9e le 23 juin 1943, ne subsiste plus, et qu'il ne pourrait \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 comme pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent dans une autre cause, vu que le jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi que nous avons maintenant devant nous a refus\u00e9 de l'accepter.\nCe qui reste est exclusivement le jugement qui rejette la requ\u00eate de l'appelant parce que, de l'avis de la Cour du Banc du Roi, l'appelant n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir son int\u00e9r\u00eat pour intenter la proc\u00e9dure qu'il a adopt\u00e9e, et que d'ailleurs, cette proc\u00e9dure n'\u00e9tait pas celle qui \u00e9tait appropri\u00e9e aux circonstances. Bien entendu, en vertu de l'article 41 de la Loi de la Cour Supr\u00eame, celui qui demande \u00e0 cette Cour la permission d'appeler doit d'abord d\u00e9montrer que l'affaire tombe parmi l'un des cas \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s aux sous-sections \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\" et \"f\" de cet article.\nL'appelant a invoqu\u00e9 alternativement les sous-sections \"b\", \"c\", et \"f\" de cet article.\nLa sous-section \"b\" ne s'applique pas. Le seul fait que la requ\u00eate en cours contient une demande incidente \u00e0 l'effet que l'intim\u00e9 soit condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 payer \u00e0 la Couronne une amende n'exc\u00e9dant pas $400.00 ne rencontre pas les exigences de cette sous-section. Celle-ci s'applique \u00e0 une demande faite par la Couronne elle-m\u00eame et non pas \u00e0 un cas, comme celui-ci, o\u00f9 il n'y a pas de r\u00e9clamation de sa part, mais o\u00f9 il s'agit seulement d'une condamnation facultative qui r\u00e9sulterait du maintien de la requ\u00eate en quo warranto, et o\u00f9 la Couronne n'est pas partie \u00e0 la cause. (Voir sur ce point, le dictum dans le jugement de cette Cour re O'Dell v. Gregory[1].\nL'on ne saurait dire qu'en pareil cas, l'amende fait partie \"of the matter in controversy on the appeal\". L'appel n'est pas port\u00e9 pour d\u00e9cider si oui ou non cette amende doit \u00eatre impos\u00e9e. La requ\u00eate en quo warranto pourrait parfaitement \u00eatre accord\u00e9e sans l'amende. Cette derni\u00e8re ne serait qu'une cons\u00e9quence secondaire du maintien de la requ\u00eate.\nQuant \u00e0 la sous-section \"f\", qui exige pour notre juridiction que le montant ou la valeur en jeu dans l'appel exc\u00e8de la somme de $1,000.00, l'on ne saurait \u00e0 cette fin tenir compte de ce que peut repr\u00e9senter pour l'appelant le \"salaire dont il pourra \u00eatre priv\u00e9\" ou \"les dommages qu'il a subis ou qu'il pourra subir\". Cette question ne fait pas, pour le moment, partie du litige. Au contraire, le requ\u00e9rant dans ses conclusions d\u00e9clare sp\u00e9cialement se r\u00e9server d'adopter plus tard des proc\u00e9dures pour recouvrer le salaire ou les dommages en question. Ils ne sont donc pas en jeu dans l'appel actuel. Comme il \u00e9tait dit dans l'arr\u00eat de cette Cour re: Lachance v. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Pr\u00eats et de Placements de Qu\u00e9bec[2], \"our jurisdiction does not depend on the possible consequence of a possible judgment\". (Voir aussi Gatineau Power Company v. Cross[3].\nIl pourrait y avoir plus de doute sur l'application de la sous-section \"c\" de l'article 41: \"other matters by which future rights of the parties may be affected.\"\nSur cette question, l'on ne saurait invoquer des pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, car il est \u00e9vident que les droits futurs des parties diff\u00e8rent suivant chaque cas.\nIci, il est important de faire observer que l'article exige qu'il s'agisse des droits futurs des parties en cause. (Campbell Auto Finance Company v. Bonin,[4]). M\u00eame si les \u00e9lecteurs de la province de Qu\u00e9bec peuvent avoir un int\u00e9r\u00eat futur dans la question de savoir si l'intim\u00e9 usurpe la position qu'il occupe actuellement, en ce qui concerne l'appelant, il ne s'agit pas de droits futurs dans le sens de la sous-section \"c\". Cette question, par rapport \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame, devait \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9e une fois pour toutes sur la proc\u00e9dure qu'il a intent\u00e9e. Ses droits \u00e0 l'encontre de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9taient soumis \u00e0 la Cour pour \u00eatre tranch\u00e9s nunc et tunc. La question de savoir si plus tard il pourrait recouvrer la position de R\u00e9gistrateur n'est pas impliqu\u00e9e dans l'appel qu'il nous demande de porter ici; elle pourrait seulement faire l'objet d'une autre cause.\nNous sommes donc d'avis que cette permission d'appeler ne peut s'appuyer sur aucune des sous-sections de l'article 41 et que nous n'avons pas juridiction pour l'accorder.\nLa demande de permission d'appeler doit donc \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e avec d\u00e9pens.\nLeave to appeal refused.\n[1] (1895) 24 Can.

The work to be done was the labour, including the scaffolding, for the brick-work (lambrissage) of four houses under construction by the bankrupt, the latter to furnish the bricks and nails. The mortar was in fact supplied by the bankrupt, though the appellant was to furnish it under the agreement. The work was actually performed by the appellant and by his son and some other workmen who were hired and paid by him. The appellant filed with the trustees in bankruptcy a claim for $1,018.20, being the amount due for his own work and the wages paid to his helpers, in order that the same be paid in priority under section 121 of the Bankruptcy Act, out of the distribution of the bankrupt's property. The trustees disallowed the claim for priority, the Superior Court sitting in bankruptcy affirmed such disallowance and the appellate court maintained that judgment.\nHeld, affirming the judgment appealed from, that the appellant's claim was not for \"compensation of * * * workman in respect of services rendered to the bankrupt\" within the meaning of paragraph 3 of section 121 of the Bankruptcy Act. The word \"compensation\" may include personal work or labour performed by the claimant personally, but does not include wages earned on the work by his son and the other helpers employed and paid by the appellant.\u2014Upon the facts of the case, the appellant should be considered as a sub-contractor and not as a \"workman.\"\nAPPEAL[1] from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court sitting in bankruptcy, Savard J. and disallowing the petitioner's claim filed with the trustees in bankruptcy that the same be paid in priority.\nGuy Hudon K.C. for the appellant.\nJacques Dumoulin K.C. and Jean Turgeon for the respondents.\nThe judgment of The Chief Justice and of Estey J. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice: Je ne vois aucune raison d'infirmer le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance confirm\u00e9 par celui de la Cour du Banc Roi (en appel).\nTout le litige d\u00e9pend de l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'article 121 de la Loi de Faillite.\nCet article a trait \u00e0 la priorit\u00e9 des r\u00e9clamations de certains ouvriers et il stipule au troisi\u00e8me paragraphe que:\ntoutes les dettes du failli ou du c\u00e9dant autoris\u00e9 en vertu de toute loi de compensation ouvri\u00e8re et tous les gages, salaires, commissions ou r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations des commis, domestiques, voyageurs de commerce, journaliers ou ouvriers, pour services rendus au failli ou c\u00e9dant durant trois mois avant la date de l'ordonnance de s\u00e9questre ou de la cession * * * doivent \u00eatre pay\u00e9s suivant l'ordre de priorit\u00e9.\nPour d\u00e9terminer le sort de cet appel, il s'agit d'interpr\u00e9ter dans le paragraphe que l'on vient de citer, les mots \"r\u00e9mun\u00e9rations\", \"ouvriers\" et \"services\".\nEn effet, ce que l'appelant r\u00e9clame ne peut \u00eatre class\u00e9 dans la cat\u00e9gorie des \"gages\", \"salaires\" ou \"commissions\"; non plus dans celle des \"commis\", \"domestiques\", \"voyageurs de commerce\" ou \"journaliers\".\nPour r\u00e9ussir, il fallait qu'il d\u00e9montre que sa r\u00e9clamation est pour \"r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration\" \u00e0 titre d'ouvrier \"pour services rendus au failli\".\nOr, les syndics intim\u00e9s ont, \u00e0 mon avis, justement repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 que l'appelant n'avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'emploi du failli \u00e0 titre de salari\u00e9, que les travaux qu'il avait faits pour le failli lui-m\u00eame \u00e9taient accord\u00e9s par contrat \u00e0 forfait et que sa r\u00e9clamation, par cons\u00e9quent, ne pouvait \u00eatre accept\u00e9e autrement que comme cr\u00e9ance chirographaire par opposition avec une cr\u00e9ance privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e. La r\u00e9clamation de l'appelant repr\u00e9sente: l'ouvrage en brique \u00e0 la maison de Yvon Lepage, situ\u00e9e dans la paroisse de St-Sacrement \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, et \u00e0 deux autres maisons situ\u00e9es sur la rue Vitr\u00e9; la construction d'une chemin\u00e9e \u00e0 une maison vendue \u00e0 un monsieur Marcoux.\nCes ouvrages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9s \u00e0 l'appelant au moyen d'un contrat sur lequel ce dernier s'est donn\u00e9 comme entrepreneur-ma\u00e7on. Il s'y est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 faire le lambrissage des maisons ci-haut mentionn\u00e9es pour le compte du failli, \u00e0 raison de $180.00 pour les petites maisons et $205.00 pour les plus grandes; la brique et les clous devaient \u00eatre fournis par le contracteur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral (le failli), le mortier et les \u00e9chafaudages devant \u00eatre fournis par le briquetier (l'appelant). Le failli s'y engageait \u00e0 payer un estim\u00e9 de 90% \u00e0 toutes les semaines.\nLe montant total, auquel l'appelant a droit pour ces ouvrages, s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 la somme de $1,018.20.\nLe mot \"r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration\" est sans doute tr\u00e8s large et, pour les fins de cet appel, je serais certainement dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre pour acquis qu'il peut comprendre les montants stipul\u00e9s au contrat en faveur de l'appelant et qui font l'objet de sa r\u00e9clamation.\nMais, d'autre part, il est admis que dans cette somme sont inclus les salaires qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s par l'appelant \u00e0 quelques ouvriers qui lui ont aid\u00e9 \u00e0 accomplir les travaux qu'il avait entrepris.\nIl ne s'agit donc pas ici exclusivement de sa r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration personnelle, mais \u00e9galement de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de ceux qui lui ont aid\u00e9 dans ses ouvrages.\nD\u00e9j\u00e0, par cons\u00e9quent, nous nous \u00e9loignons des \"services rendus au failli\". Il ne r\u00e9clame pas seulement pour ses services mais pour ceux de ses employ\u00e9s; et pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment o\u00f9 je ne puis me rendre \u00e0 l'argumentation de son procureur, c'est lorsqu'il s'agit de le faire entrer sous la d\u00e9signation d'ouvrier.\nJe crois que le savant juge de premi\u00e8re instance a eu raison de dire que nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence d'un contrat\ndont les termes laissent voir qu'il s'agit d'un contrat \u00e0 forfait\net que l'appelant\ndoit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un entrepreneur et non pas comme un ouvrier. Ce n'est pas n\u00e9cessairement parce que l'appelant devait fournir lui-m\u00eame ses \u00e9chafaudages et le mortier que cette stipulation du contrat l'exclut de la cat\u00e9gorie des ouvriers; mais c'est parce que dans l'ex\u00e9cution du contrat, il a engag\u00e9 des ouvriers qu'il a choisis, dont il devait le temps et qu'il a pay\u00e9s.\nC'est bien ainsi que le contrat devait \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 de la part de l'appelant, et c'est ainsi que les deux parties contractantes l'ont compris.\nA raison de cela, l'appelant agissait comme entrepreneur ind\u00e9pendant; il ne r\u00e9clame pas le loyer de son ouvrage, il r\u00e9clame le prix fixe de son contrat. Il ne peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un ouvrier au sens de l'article 121 de la Loi de Faillite. Il n'a donc pas droit \u00e0 la priorit\u00e9 qui y est mentionn\u00e9e, et je crois que les jugements dans cet appel doivent \u00eatre confirm\u00e9s.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nKerwin J.:\u2014The appellant David Guillot filed with the trustees in bankruptcy of El\u00e9odore Rousseau a claim to be paid $1,018.20 \"thirdly\" in priority in the distribution of the bankrupt's property under section 121 of the Bankruptcy Act. No question arises as to the amount or that the appellant is entitled to rank as an ordinary creditor but the trustees disallowed the claim for priority, a judge of the Superior Court in Quebec sitting in bankruptcy affirmed such disallowance, and the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side), by a majority, dismissed an appeal from the order of the Superior Court. By leave granted under section 174 of the Bankruptcy Act, Guillot now appeals to this Court.\nThe judge of first instance and the majority of the Court of King's Bench proceeded, in part at least, upon a reference to the provisions of the Quebec Civil Code, articles 1684 et seq., and particularly 1696. This is not a correct approach to section 121 of the Bankruptcy Act, which is a law of general application throughout the Dominion. The relevant part thereof reads:\u2014\nSubject to the provisions of section one hundred and twenty-six as to rent, in the distribution of the property of the bankrupt or authorized assignor, there shall be paid, in the following order of priority:\u2014\n* * * Thirdly, all indebtedness of the bankrupt or authorized assignor under any Workmen's Compensation Act and all wages, salaries, commissions or compensation of any clerk, servant, travelling salesman, labourer or workman, in respect of services rendered to the bankrupt or assignor during three months before the date of the receiving order or assignment:\nOnce a person falls within the enumeration \"clerk, servant, travelling salesman, labourer or workman,\" it would be difficult to exclude the remuneration to which he was entitled from the preceding words \"wages, salaries, commissions or compensation.\"\nBut there is an additional feature to be considered,\u2014that is as to whether such remuneration was \"in respect of services rendered to the bankrupt or assignor.\" Now it appears to have been generally assumed in the cases in the provincial courts to which our attention was drawn that it was not necessary that the workman should have rendered services exclusively to the bankrupt, and with that view I agree. Cases may be envisaged where he would be an independent contractor and still fall within the section and I am, therefore, unable to agree with certain expressions used in some of the decisions indicating that it was considered that the element of control must be present. In contracts for certain jobs to be done by workmen, the employer might, or might not, have the right of supervision over the manner of execution and for this reason it should not weigh against the appellant that the sheet of note-paper on which the first contract was written had a letter-head indicating that he was an \"entrepreneur-ma\u00e7on\".\nHowever, the services must, in the main, consist of personal work or labour on the part of the claimant but they will not lose that character merely because a claimant, in order to perform the labour, requires the use of the tools of his trade or the assistance of a helper. Just what would be included in tools may be a question of some nicety in particular circumstances. In the present case the use by Guillot of his own scaffolding and the ordinary bricklayers' tools could properly be included but the fact that he had the assistance of his son and several other workmen, all of whom were hired and paid by him, is fatal to his claim. Mr. Hudon relied upon two decisions, one of Chief Judge Bacon in Ex parte Allsop[2] and the other of Cave J. in Ex parte Hollyoak, Re Field[3]. While the first may fall within the rules mentioned above, it is difficult to say the same of the latter although the short report of the case that appears in the Weekly Reporter and in Morrell, may omit something of importance. In any event, if these decisions are at variance with what has been stated, they should not be considered as authoritative in Canada.\nAlthough a question was raised from the bench as to whether the appellant's claim could be divided so as to show the amount paid by Guillot to his helpers, leaving, presumably the balance of the claim to represent his own labour, no endeavour was made by counsel for either party to do this. Upon an examination of the record, I gather it was felt that this would be impossible since the appellant had contributed to the Workmen's Compensation Commission and to the Joint Committee of Construction in relation to the work done for the bankrupt.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Hudson and Rand JJ. was delivered by\nRand J.:\u2014The question in this appeal is whether the appellant is a workman within section 121 of the Bankruptcy Act, and entitled to be preferred as for compensation for services rendered to the bankrupt. The material part of the section reads as follows:\n121. (1) Subject to the provisions of section one hundred and twenty-six as to rent, in the distribution of the property of the bankrupt or authorized assignor, there shall be paid, in the following order of priority:\u2014\nFirst, * * *\nSecondly, * * *\nThirdly, all indebtedness of the bankrupt or authorized assignor under any Workman's Compensation Act and all wages, salaries, commission or compensation of any clerk, servant, travelling salesman, labourer or workman, in respect of services rendered to the bankrupt or assignor during three months before the date of the receiving order or assignment: Provided that any commissions earned more than three months before the date of a receiving order or assignment, but not payable (by the terms of the creditor's agreement) until the shipment, delivery or payment of the good sold, shall be deemed to have been earned within three months of the date of the receiving order or assignment, when the said good have been shipped, delivered or paid for within three months of the receiving order or assignment; and provided, moreover, that any advances made on account of such commissions shall be deemed to have been legally paid on account thereof.\nThe bankrupt was a general contractor who entered into an engagement with the appellant in the following terms:\nLe soussign\u00e9 s'engage \u00e0 faire le lambrissage de la s\u00e9rie de maisons de St-Pascal pour le compte de monsieur Rousseau.\nLa brique sera fournie par le contracteur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, monsieur Rousseau, ainsi que les clous.\nLa brique devra \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e pr\u00e8s des maisons.\nLe papier devra \u00eatre pos\u00e9 d'avance pour ne pas retarder les briquetiers.\nLe mortier, les \u00e9chafaudages seront fournis par le briquetier pour la somme de (cent quatre-vingt dollars) $180.00 pour les petites et deux cent cinq dollars) $205.00 pour les plus grandes.\n(This is in error as to the mortar: it was supplied by Rousseau.)\nLe contracteur monsieur Rousseau devra donner un estim\u00e9 de 90% \u00e0 toutes les semaines.\nGreater details of the work to be done were set forth in an exhibit to the proof of claim:\n(a) L'ouvrage en brique \u00e0 la maison de Yvon Lepage, situ\u00e9e pr\u00e8s du Chemin Ste-Foye, \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, o\u00f9 j'ai pos\u00e9 de la brique \u00e0 raison de $22.00 du mille, pour une somme globale de $607.20;\n(b) L'ouvrage en brique \u00e0 une maison situ\u00e9e sur la rue Vitr\u00e9, et construite sur le lot 114, pour lequel il m'est d\u00fb une somme de $182.00;\n(c) L'ouvrage en brique \u00e0 une maison situ\u00e9e sur la rue Vitr\u00e9, lot 115, pour lequel il m'est d\u00fb un montant de $207.00;\n(d) La construction d'une chemin\u00e9e \u00e0 une maison vendue \u00e0 un monsieur Marcoux, pour laquelle il m'est d\u00fb un montant de $22.00, soit une somme globale de $1,018.20;\nCette somme de $1,018.20 repr\u00e9sentant la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration comme briqueteur-ma\u00e7on, le failli m'ayant garanti un montant de $200.00 pour la premi\u00e8re maison de la rue Vitr\u00e9 et $207.00 pour la seconde.\nThe appellant holds himself out, as his business letterhead indicates, as an entrepreneur, although he is also a working mason. The work done is seen to have been the labour for the brick work including the scaffolding for four houses under construction by the bankrupt. It was actually performed by the appellant assisted by three or four helpers. They were his employees exclusively and were paid in full by him; his claim includes their wages earned on the work and the balance represents the work done by him personally and the overall profit. There is nothing to indicate that his personal labour was at all bargained for: the entire work could have been done by others.\nMr. Hudon assimilated the case to that of a mechanic's lien with subrogation to the appellant of claims which his employees might have asserted; but this conception disregards the plain language of the statute. The claim, in order to obtain a priority, must be by \"a workman\" in respect of \"services rendered to the bankrupt.\" \"Services rendered\" must be distinguished from work or labour furnished; and the enumeration of the persons shows the class and the nature of the service intended to be benefited.\nThe appellant in form and substance is a sub-contractor, and the logical conclusion of the contention made for him is that for the purposes of section 121 there cannot be a sub-contract for labour only. With that I am unable to agree.\nMr. Hudon relied on Ex. parte Hollyoak; In re. Field,[4]. But that was a case of group production by persons dismissible by the bankrupt who divided total earnings between them, but who chose one of their number to represent them for all purposes vis \u00e0 vis the employer. The representative was, in effect, treated as a trustee for the others. But the direct relations between the individual members of the group and the employer and between them and their representative distinguish the facts from those here.\nI think the judgment below is sound, and would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Guy Hudon and Ives Pr\u00e9vost.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Power, Bienvenue, Lesage & Turgeon and Dumoulin & R\u00e9millard\n[1] Leave to appeal to this Court was granted by The Chief Justice in Chambers.\n[2] (1875) 32 L.T. 433.\n[3] (1886) 35 W.R. 396; 4 Morre 63.\n[4] (1886) 35 W.R. 396.\n",

The appellant; corporation, carrying on business as a retail merchant, closed its doors to the public on three days by way of observance of the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement. Notice was also given that any employee desiring to work voluntarily would be at liberty to do so. All employees, whether working or not, were paid the regular daily rates. On behalf of those who did work, the respondent Comit\u00e9 Paritaire claimed payment of double wages in addition to the regular wages already paid, together with certain percentages provided by the Act. The trial judge allowed one-half the amount claimed for wages, as the regular wages had already been paid; and that judgment was affirmed by a majority of the appellate court.\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, that the obligation of the appellant company to pay double time must be confined to work performed on Sundays and on the days specifically set out in clause (e). Employees will receive their regular wages on days \"that employer keeps his establishment closed to respect his religion,\" but clause (m) does not then apply. Per The Chief Justice and Taschereau J.:\u2014The appellant corporation was at full liberty to open or close its premises on these three days. They were working days which were converted into holidays by the sole decision of the appellant, and that makes them distinct from the days mentioned in (e), which are holidays binding upon all employers without question of race or religion.\u2014Qu\u0153re whether a commercial corporation can have a religion.\nPer Hudson and Rand JJ.:\u2014Clause (e) is limited in its application to a shop that is closed generally as to employees on the days specified. The decree does not purport to require a closure either towards the public or the employees; but, once the shop is closed, the right to wages arises. The day of optional closing, which becomes a day mentioned in (e) only if it becomes generally a closed day, is by its nature excluded from (m) except in respect of special employees. In this case, the shop was admittedly open generally to the employees. As an open shop, it was not mentioned or enumerated in (e) which, in the optional case, means, to come under its operative effect.

La Cour a donc accord\u00e9 seulement la moiti\u00e9 du montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9. Cette moiti\u00e9, plus les dommages liquid\u00e9s par le d\u00e9cret, ne s'\u00e9l\u00e8ve qu'\u00e0 un total de $421.37, et jugement est intervenu pour cette somme contre l'appelante.\nLa Cour du Banc du Roi, en appel, a confirm\u00e9 ce jugement par une majorit\u00e9 de trois contre deux, les honorables juges Saint-Germain et Pr\u00e9vost se d\u00e9clarant dissidents.\nLa cause est maintenant devant nous par suite d'une permission sp\u00e9ciale d'appeler, qui \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire, vu que le montant en jeu n'atteignait pas la somme requise pour l'exercice de la juridiction de la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada.\nComme elle l'avait fait devant les tribunaux dont l'appel est port\u00e9 devant cette Cour l'appelante a propos\u00e9, entre autres, trois moyens qui, d'apr\u00e9s elle, devaient justifier cette Cour d'infirmer les jugements qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc du Roi.\n1er moyen: Le jour en question, l'appelante n'\u00e9tait pas tenue de fermer son \u00e9tablissement et, par cons\u00e9quent, rien ne l'emp\u00eachait de fermer au public seulement et non \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s.\n2i\u00e8me moyen: Le texte du d\u00e9cret ne concerne qu'un employeur tenant son \u00e9tablissement ferm\u00e9 pour respecter sa religion. L'appelante, \u00e9tant une corporation, n'a pas de religion.\n3i\u00e8me moyen: L'obligation de payer temps double ne s'applique qu'aux jours \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s au sous-paragraphe \"e\", c'est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 ceux-l\u00e0 seuls qui sont nomm\u00e9s un \u00e0 un.\nLe premier moyen de l'appelante me para\u00eet justifi\u00e9. Elle n'\u00e9tait pas tenue de \"respecter sa religion\", si toutefois l'on peut dire qu'une corporation peut en avoir une. La fermeture de son \u00e9tablissement, pour ce motif, \u00e9tait indiscutablement facultative. Or, il est admis que les 30 septembre, 1er et 9 octobre 1943 \u00e9taient des jours ouvrables.\nComme Ta fait remarquer M. le juge Pr\u00e9vost:\nils ne sont devenus des jours de ch\u00f4mage que par la volont\u00e9 de l'appelante, ce qui les distingue de fa\u00e7on manifeste des jours \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s au paragraphe \"e\" de l'article (III) du d\u00e9cret, qui eux sont des jours de cong\u00e9 obligatoires pour tous les patrons, sans distinction de race ou de religion.\nL'appelante avait donc pleine libert\u00e9 de laisser son \u00e9tablissement ouvert ce jour-l\u00e0 ou de le fermer. Pour M. le juge Pr\u00e9vost, ce motif seul suffisait au maintien de l'appel. Le m\u00eame juge \u00e9tait \u00e9galement d'avis que, par suite du deuxi\u00e8me moyen, l'action aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e parce que la condition fondamentale et essentielle \u00e0 l'application de ce texte, c'est que l'employeur tienne son \u00e9tablissement ferm\u00e9 \"pour respecter sa religion\".\nL'appelante \u00e9tant une corporation commerciale, ne peut professer une religion ni lui appartenir. Il fut d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans ce sens, dans un jugement de l'honorable juge Robidoux d'ans la cause des Syndics de la Paroisse St-Paul de Montr\u00e9al v. La Compagnie des Terrains de la Banlieue de Montr\u00e9al[1], qui fut unanimement confirm\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc du Roi le 14 juin, 1905. Voir aussi l'arr\u00eat de la Cour du Banc du Roi re: Riverside Mfg. Co. Ltd., v. La Fabrique de St-Fran\u00e7ois d'Assise[2].\nMais ce qui est d\u00e9cisif, c'est que, en vertu du sous-paragraphe \"e\", l'obligation de payer temps double ne s'applique qu'aux dimanches et aux jours d\u00e9sign\u00e9s que nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9s plus haut.\nC'est l\u00e0 le troisi\u00e8me moyen de l'appelante et celui sur lequel les deux juges dissidents en Cour du Banc du Roi se sont accord\u00e9s.\nA mon humble avis, c'est l\u00e0 la seule interpr\u00e9tation dont le sous-paragraphe \"e\" soit susceptible. Il y a dans ce sous-paragraphe, d'abord, l'\u00e9num\u00e9ration de certains jours de l'ann\u00e9e. Ces jours-l\u00e0 \"les magasins seront ferm\u00e9s\". Les jours o\u00f9 l'employeur tient son \u00e9tablissement ferm\u00e9 pour respecter sa religion ne sont pas \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s. Ces jours-l\u00e0, les patrons ne sont pas tenus de fermer leurs magasins et, en plus, ce sont des jours inconnus du d\u00e9cret, parce qu'il \u00e9tait impossible de pr\u00e9voir \u00e0 l'avance quels jours l'employeur jugerait \u00e0 propos de fermer son \u00e9tablissement \"pour respecter sa religion\".\nCes jours-l\u00e0, les ouvriers de la m\u00eame profession sont tous au travail dans les \u00e9tablissements des concurrents de l'employeur. Ce n'est pas le d\u00e9cret qui dicte \u00e0 l'employeur de fermer ces jours-l\u00e0. C'est sa religion et cela ne rel\u00e8ve que de sa conscience. Ses employ\u00e9s ne peuvent compter sur un ch\u00f4mage ces jours-l\u00e0, parce qu'il est facultatif \u00e0 l'employeur de d\u00e9cider de fermer son \u00e9tablissement ou de le laisser ouvert. Tels jours ne pouvaient donc \u00eatre \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans le sous-paragraphe \"e\" et ils ne le sont pas.\nN'\u00e9tant pas \"\u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s\" dans le sous-paragraphe \"e\", ils ne tombent pas sous le coup des prescriptions du sous-paragraphe \"m\", qui seul stipule que\ntout travail ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 durant ces jours sera r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 au taux double du salaire r\u00e9gulier de tel employ\u00e9.\nPour ces raisons, qui sont celles des juges dissidents dans la Cour du Banc du Roi, en appel, l'action de l'intim\u00e9 aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e, et je suis donc d'avis que l'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens dans toutes les Cours.\nKerwin J.: The appellant, Maurice Pollack Limit\u00e9e, is a corporation carrying on business as a retail merchant in the city of Quebec and as an employer is subject to the provisions of the decree relating to the retail trade in that city made by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council of the province pursuant to the provisions of the Collective Agreement Act, now chapter 163 of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1941. By section 3, paragraph (e) of the decree:\u2014\nAny regular employee shall be paid or the days when stores are closed: New Year's Day, the day after New Year's Day Epiphany, Good-Friday till 12.00 (noon), Ascension Day, St. John the Baptist's Day, Labour Day, All Saints Day, Immaculate Conception Day, Christmas Day and any other day the employer keeps his establishment closed to respect his religion.\nBy paragraph (m):\u2014\nNo employer shall compel his employees to work on Sundays and on the days mentioned in subsection (e) of the present section and all work performed on these days shall be paid double time with respect to the regular wages of the said employee. So far as relevant, the French version of this paragraph states:\u2014\nL'employeur ne pourra obliger ses employ\u00e9s \u00e0 travailler les dimanches et durant les jours \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s au paragraphe \"e\" du pr\u00e9sent article * * *\nOn September 30th, October 1st and October 9th, 1943, the appellant published notices in various newspapers to the effect that its store would be closed to the public because those days were, as to the first two, the Hebrew New Year, and as to the latter, the Hebrew Day of Atonement. Notices to its employees were also posted in its establishment stating that the store would be closed to the public that all employees would be paid as usual but that a specified entrance would be open to such employees who might have work to do and who would be willing to perform it voluntarily. All employees were paid their regular wages for those days whether they worked or not. On behalf of those who did work, the respondent Comit\u00e9 claimed payment of double wages in addition to the regular wages already paid, together with certain percentages provided for by the Collective Agreement Act. The Superior Court allowed one-half the amount claimed on the basis of the appellant's employees who worked on September 30th, October 1st and October 9th being entitled to double wages,\u2014but not in addition to the ordinary wages already paid. This judgment was affirmed by the Court of King's Bench (Appeal Side).\nI find it unnecessary to canvass all the grounds of appeal urged by the appellant because I am satisfied that on one which is relied upon by the two dissenting judges in the Court of King's Bench the appeal should be allowed. In paragraph (e) certain days are enumerated \"when stores are closed\" and it is provided that for them \"and any other day the employer keeps his establishment closed to respect his religion\" any regular employee shall be paid. The English version of paragraph (m) provides that no employer shall compel his employees to work on Sundays and on the days \"mentioned\" in (e) and that \"all work performed on those days shall be paid double time.\" Whatever one might think of the use of the word \"mentioned\", the English version must, of course, be read in conjunction with the French version where the corresponding word is \"\u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s\". So read the obligation to pay double time must be confined to work performed on Sundays and on the days specifically set out in paragraph (e).\nI would allow the appeal and dismiss the action with costs throughout.\nHudson J.: I am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs throughout, for the reasons given by my brothers Kerwin and Rand.\nRand J.: By a decree relating to the retail trade in the city of Quebec, made under the authority of the Collective Agreement Act, R.S.Q. (1941) chap. 163, it is provided:\u2014\n(e) Any regular employee shall be paid for the days when stores are closed: New Year's Day, the day after New Year's Day, Epiphany, Good-Friday till 12.00 (noon), Ascension Day, St. John the Baptist's Day, Labour Day, All Saints Day, Immaculate Conception Day, Christmas Day and any other day the employer keeps his establishment closed to respect his religion\n* * *\n(m) No employer shall compel his employees to work on Sundays and on the days mentioned in subsection (e) of the present section and all work performed on these days shall be paid double time with respect to the regular wages of the said employee * * *\nThe appellant is a corporation, and on three days, September 30, October 1 and October 9, 1943 its store was closed to the public by way of observance of the Jewish New Year and Day of Atonement. A notice was given that any employee desiring to work voluntarily on those days would be at liberty to do so. All of the employees, whether working or not, were paid the regular daily rates, but certain of them who did work have been awarded double wages, and the question is whether that is required by the clauses quoted.\nClause (e) is limited in its application to a shop that is closed on the days specified. Closed in what respect? Having regard to the object of the decree, which is to prescribe regulations to govern the relations between employers and employees, I should say it means closed generally as to employees. The decree does not purport to require a closure either towards the public or the employees: and its provision for double wages is the only pressure laid upon an employer to induce him to close. Once, however, that condition is present the right to wages arises. The day in that event becomes a holiday with pay.\nOn the other hand, clause (m) assumes a shop that is open generally or specially to employees. If generally, then the case cannot be within (e) because a shop cannot be generally closed and open at the same time. If specially, then the case remains in (e) and comes under the requirement of (m). In the latter case, there can be no compulsion to work, but double wages is the reward to the willing employee. In the former no compulsion is available to the employer in relation to the days mentioned in (e), but it is free to all employees to insist on working and at double rates.\nBut the day of optional closing, which becomes a day mentioned in (e) only if it becomes generally a closed day, is by its nature excluded from (m) except in respect of special employees. Here, the shop was admittedly open generally to the employees. As an open shop, it was not mentioned or enumerated in (e) which, in the optional case, means, to come under its operative effect. Clause (m) has, therefore, no application to it and the ordinary terms of employment must apply.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and dismiss the action with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed and action dismissed, with costs throughout.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Lazarovitz & Chaloult.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bh\u00e9rer, Beaudet & Fortier.\n[1] (1905) Q.R. 28 S.C. 493.\n[2] Q.H.

At the time of shipment, the horses were in good condition, but when they reached their destination and were delivered to the respondent, sixteen of them were mutilated and disfigured by being shorn of their tails. The respondent claimed that delivery in such a condition did not constitute valid delivery under the terms of the contract and that the disfiguration had caused damages amounting to $886.79. The appellant railway contended that the shipment was carried in conformity with the conditions of the contract signed by the respondent both as shipper and as attendant in charge of the horses, that the loss did not arise directly from the performance by the appellant of its contract of carriage and that whatever damage was caused resulted from the respondent's failure to provide an attendant to accompany and care for the horses en route as required by section 5 of the contract. The trial judge maintained the respondent's action and assessed the damages at $200; the judgment was affirmed by the appellate court and the appellant railway appealed to this Court. Leave to appeal was granted by the appellate court.\nHeld, The Chief Justice and Taschereau J. dissenting, that this appeal should be dismissed and the respondent's action maintained.\u2014It was not the intention of the contract that the shipper or his representative should at all times be present with the horses to act as a guard, but only at such times as it might be expected that the horses would require care and attention. It was common ground that neither the respondent, nor anyone on his behalf, accompanied the shipment. There is no liability, however, upon the respondent on that account, as there has been no evidence that failure to provide an attendant caused or contributed to the loss or damage suffered by the horses.\u2014As a result of the terms of the contract and upon a proper construction of the relevant provisions of the freight classification referred to in the contract and of the tariff applicable to the shipment, the onus of establishing the cause of the loss or damage was upon the appellant railway and the latter has failed to adduce sufficient evidence to satisfy such onus.\nPer The Chief Justice and Taschereau J. (dissenting)\u2014The appellant railway should not be held responsible for the loss or damage suffered by the respondent. The Special Contract is valid and binding and its terms and conditions are determinative of the issue. One of its relevant provisions is that the live stock to be carried thereunder was received subject to the Classification and Tariffs in effect on the date of its issue, under which the rates and weights may be either at \"carrier's risk\", subject to the terms and conditions of the bill of lading issued by the originating carrier or at \"owner's risk\" subject to the terms and conditions of the Special Contract signed by the shipper or his agent. The shipper of live stock may thus choose how and to what extent he wishes to be protected by the carrier against loss or damage which may occur to his shipment in transit. In the present case, the respondent could have had the carriage performed at carrier's risk, through the terms and conditions of a standard bill of lading and by paying double the rate he paid, but he executed the Special Contract, whereby he agreed to ship at his own risk, upon whose terms and conditions the carrier's obligations and its liability were restricted and under which the rate applicable was lower. The shipment was thus carried at owner's risk and the carrier was relieved from liability for damage even if resulting from its negligence and that of its servants, such conclusion not being inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the Special Contract. Therefore, the respondent agreed to assume the risk of loss or damage to his horses during the journey, unless he could establish that such loss or damage was due to the non-fulfilment of the appellant's obligations under the contract. The respondent has failed to do so or to prove any negligence of the appellant railway, which was not even alleged. Moreover, the damage, in any event, was attributable to the respondent's failure to accompany, attend to and care for his shipment during the journey, as he was bound to do under the contract.\u2014By force of article 1681 C.C., the special regulations made in accordance with the Railway Act must be recognized and applied in preference to article 1675 C.C., which is thereby superseded, and, therefore, the Special Contract in this case and the \"owner's risk\" clause forming part of it clearly eliminated the presumption created by article 1675 C.C.\nPer Hudson J.:\u2014The Special Contract itself does not contain any direct reference to the shipment being made at \"owner's risk\", as contended by the railway appellant; but it is expressed to be subject to the classification and tariff in effect on the date of the issue of the bill of lading. Upon a proper analysis of the provisions of the contract, the classification and the tariff, the shipper accepted the terms of the special live stock contract and nothing else. None of the causes of loss, other than failure to provide attendant, from which the carrier may be relieved from liability under section 6 of the contract, apply to the facts of this case, and the Railway Act does not give the appellant railway any immunity beyond that expressed in the contract, which was in a form approved of by the Board of Transport Commissioners.\nPer Kellock J.:\u2014The result of the various provisions of the contract, the classification and the tariff is that the shipment was carried \"at owner's risk subject to the terms and conditions of the special live stock contract\", under which the appellant railway agreed to carry the shipment to destination. The terms \"owner's risk\" cannot be construed here, as contended by the appellant railway, as throwing upon the respondent all risks including risk of loss or damage from negligence of the carrier, except wilful neglect or misconduct of the carrier. More particularly, section 6 of the contract presupposes that the appellant is liable as common carrier with some additional exceptions to that liability. Delivery of the horses in their mutilated condition was not a compliance with this underlying obligation resting upon the appellant, and it lay upon the latter, who contended that the loss fell within either one of two of those exceptions, namely \"the act or default of the shipper\" or \"causes beyond the carrier's control\", to adduce evidence bringing the case within the one or other of those exceptions. The appellant adduced no evidence to enable a finding to be made as to how the loss occurred, and it is insufficient to prove something equally consistent with the loss having been due to the respondent's default or to the default of the appellant railway.\nPer Estey J.:\u2014The provisions of the Special Contract were approved by the Board of Transport Commissioners pursuant to section 348 of the Railway Act. The phrase \"its liability\" as used in that section refers to the liability of the carrier at common law and under the Act, and, except as this liability may be impaired, restricted or limited under a contract, the liability of the carrier remains as determined by the common and statute law. In the determination of the rights of the parties under the present contract, the meaning to be ascribed to the phrase \"owner's risk\" is not that the entire risk is assumed by the shipper except only as that risk may be by the contract imposed upon the carrier. Such meaning would appear contrary to the plain intent of section 348 of the statute, and moreover, contrary to the form and phraseology of the subsequent sections of the contract itself. Sections 1, 4, 5, 6 and 9 of the contract deal with limitation of liability and liability for negligence on the part of the carrier, assumption of risk by the shipper and a list of specific causes from which if loss or damage result the carrier is liable. The \"terms and conditions\" of these sections are somewhat \"impairing, restricting or limiting its (carrier's) liability\" as contemplated by section 348, but they are not written on the basis that, if these conditions were not here, all the risk would be upon the shipper nor that the carrier is liable for only \"wilful neglect or misconduct or unreasonable delay\". A study of the contract, classification and the statute indicates that the Board of Transport Commissioners intended that the phrase \"owner's risk\" as used in the contract was, as expressed in rule 25 of the classification, \"intended to cover risks necessarily incidental to transportation, but no such limitation * * * shall relieve the carrier from liability * * * from any negligence or omissions of the company, its agents or employees\". The injury suffered in this case in no sense can be regarded as a risk \"necessarily incidental to transportation.\" Such loss or damage was caused by the deliberate act of a third person and no evidence has been adduced on the part of the carrier to indicate that it was covered by the provisions of the contract nor to establish on behalf of the appellant that it comes within any of the exceptions from liability at common law.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Tyndale J. and maintaining the respondent's action.\u2014Damages awarded were for an amount of $200, but leave to appeal to this Court was granted by the appellate court.\nLionel C\u00f4t\u00e9 K.C. and C. Perrault for the appellant.\nJ. A. Mann K.C. and K. H. Brown for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Taschereau J. (dissenting) was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014The respondent is a horse dealer at Montreal. On March 18, 1941, he shipped by rail from North Battleford and Maymont, Saskatchewan, 13 and 5 horses from each point respectively, the shipment being consigned to the Bodnoff Horse Exchange at Montreal under a contract with the appellant, approved by the Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada and known as a \"Live Stock Special Contract\".\nAt the time of shipment the horses were in good condition and of normal appearance, but when they reached their destination 16 of the 18 horses were mutilated and disfigured on account of the loss of their tails in transit. The respondent claimed that delivery in such a condition did not constitute valid delivery under the terms and conditions of the Special Contract and that the disfiguration had caused them damages amounting to $886.79.\nTo this action the appellant pleaded that the shipment was carried in conformity with the terms and conditions of the Live Stock Contract signed by the respondent, both as shipper and as attendant in charge of the horses, and that whatever damage was caused resulted from the respondent's failure and neglect to properly attend to and care for the horses en route and that the loss did not arise directly from the performance by the appellant of its contract of carriage.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court rejected the appellant's contention that the juridical basis of the relationship between the parties was to be found exclusively in the express terms of the Live Stock Contract as supplemented by the \"Owner's risk\" provision of both the Tariff and Classification incorporated therein by reference, and that this provision had the effect of placing the burden of proof upon the respondent who could not succeed without allegation and proof of negligence on the appellant's part.\nBriefly the learned trial judge held that the respondent apparently had based his action upon article 1675 of the Civil Code, because he had not alleged negligence, but that he had invoked the Live Stock Contract and all the conditions therein contained and implied; that the terms of the Live Stock Contract alone governed the issue and nothing else, and that the \"Owner's risk\" clause of the Classification and Tariff was without effect. From some indirect evidence that was made and on the balance of probabilities, the learned trial judge inferred that the missing tails were removed from the horses while they were in the car and while the car was stationary at some undetermined point. He further inferred, as the most reasonably probable conclusion, that the removal of the tails was performed by some unauthorized person or persons who gained access to the car while the latter was in the appellant's care, and this because the slats of the car were sufficiently wide apart to allow the operation in question to be performed presumably from outside the car. Moreover, the learned judge exonerated the respondent from any liability for his failure to accompany and care for the shipment in transit and, having referred to the appellant's obligation to provide suitable equipment under sec. 4 (2) of the Live Stock Contract, he concluded from the above inferences that the loss was attributable to the appellant's failure to provide suitable equipment and to prevent the access of unauthorized persons to the car, which failure, he held, constituted a breach of the contract as invoked by the respondent.\nThe damages were assessed at $200.00 at the rate of $12.50 per horse for the 16 horses affected. The appellant does not dispute the quantum of the damages as fixed, its appeal being restricted to the question of liability.\nOn appeal to the Court of King's Bench (appeal side) the judgment of the Superior Court was affirmed with costs. Walsh and St. Jacques JJ. agreed with the finding of the learned trial judge that there was a breach of the contract as alleged by the respondent. Francoeur J. thought the presumption of article 1675 of the Civil Code governed and that the Live Stock Contract only restricted the liability as to the damages to be paid and he found that there was a breach of the contract. Marchand J. concurred with Bissonnette J. who rendered the judgment for the Court and gave very elaborate reasons on the case. Bissonnette J. disagreed with the inference made by the learned trial judge that the trimming of the tails was done while the horses were in the car by someone operating from outside the car, through the slats, because he thought the presumptions which would lead to that conclusion were not sufficiently weighty, precise and consistent to permit such an inference. He expressed the view that, under the provisions of the Railway Act, the appellant could restrict its liability contrary to article 1675 of the Civil Code, but he found that the provisions of the Live Stock Contract, as supplemented by the terms and conditions of the Classification and Tariff, have not destroyed the presumption created by that article of the Code and that the appellant had the burden of proof. He agreed that under the contract the shipper would have to bear the damage to his live stock resulting from his neglect to care for the shipment, but that, as to any other damage not related to the duties of the attendant on board the train, the carrier is presumed liable and he has the burden of showing that such damage did not result from his fault or that of his employees. Further, he said that the evidence was such that he could not draw any conclusion as to how and under what circumstances the damage to the respondent's horses was caused and that, in order to invoke its nonliability clause and destroy the presumption of liability created by article 1675 of the Civil Code, the appellant had to adduce sufficient evidence on that point, which it had failed to do, and, therefore, it had to bear the loss.\nThe appellant is subject, for the carriage of traffic, to the provisions of the Dominion Railway Act. Moreover, the Civil Code of the province of Quebec provides that:\u2014\nArt. 1681. The conveyance of persons and things by railway is subject to certain special rules provided in the Federal and Provincial Acts respecting railways.\nIn my view, to determine the liability in the present instance, consideration must be given to the special rules provided in the Federal Acts with respect to railways.\nUnder section 348 of the Railway Act, a contract impairing, restricting or limiting the liability of the railway company in respect of the carriage of any traffic must be authorized or approved by order or regulation of the Board of Transport. In this case the appellant had such authorization, or approval, for its Live Stock Special Contract. Under the circumstances, this contract was valid and binding in conformity with the decision of the Privy Council in the case of Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Robinson[1]. (See also the decision of this Court in Ludditt v. Ginger Coote Airways, Ltd.[2].\nI think that the terms and conditions of the Live Stock Special Contract executed by the parties are determinative of the issue. I may add, moreover, that under the Railway Act (sections 52 and 348) the Board is the sole and exclusive judge of the reasonableness of the terms and conditions contained in that contract. One of the relevant provisions of the contract is that the live stock to be carried thereunder is received subject to the Classification and Tariffs in effect on the date of its issue, except where inconsistent therewith.\nFreight classification no. 19 in effect on the date of shipment of this carload of horses, March 18th, 1941, received the approval of the Board and the tariff applicable was Eastbound Tariff No. 116-A, which was then in full force and effect. By force of article 1681 of the Civil Code, the special regulations made in accordance with the Railway Act must be recognized and applied in preference to article 1675 of the Civil Code, which is thereby superseded.\nIn classification no. 19 the rating and regulations applicable are items 4 to 9 inclusive and, as we are dealing with a carload shipment in the present case, the rates and weights may be either at \"carrier's risk\", subject to the terms and conditions of the bill of lading issued by the originating carrier, or at \"owner's risk\", subject to the terms and conditions of the Live Stock Special Contract signed by the shipper or his agent.\nThe general rules (p. 163, item 3 (b)) provide that when the distance to be travelled by the shipment is in excess of 150 miles, the owner or his agent must accompany the shipment and, 3 (d), that the owner or his agent in such cases shall be carried free of charge.\nThe shipper of live stock may choose how and to what extent he wishes to be protected by the carrier against loss or damage which may occur to his shipment in transit.\nIn the present instance, if the respondent had wanted the protection afforded by the terms and conditions of a standard Bill of Lading under which the carriage is performed at Carrier's Risk, he could have had that protection by executing the straight Bill of Lading and paying double the rate he paid. Moreover, if he had wanted the additional protection of the carrier assuming liability for an amount in excess of $200.00 per horse, he could also have protected himself in that respect by paying the premium applicable in such a case, as determined by the provisions of item (1) (9), which deals with the transportation of high-priced animals. But in the present case the respondent executed the Live Stock Special Contract, as a result of which he agreed to ship at his own risk under the terms and conditions of that contract and the classification therein referred to, which restrict the carrier's obligations and its liability in many respects, apart from the limitation resulting from the agreed value. He agreed, on signing the contract, that the horses had a maximum value of $200.00 each and that they were to be carried at Owner's Risk, subject to the terms and conditions of the Live Stock Contract.\nThe difference as between a shipment at Carrier's Risk, under the straight Bill of Lading, and that at Owner's Risk, under the Live Stock Special Contract, are that the conditions of carriage vary according to the contract authorized in each case and that under the Live Stock Contract the rate applicable is lower.\nAs a result, the shipment in the present case was being carried at Owner's Risk, according to the acceptation of the term; the carrier was relieved from liability for damage resulting from its negligence and that of its servants, provided this was consistent with the terms and conditions of the Live Stock Special Contract. (See Rules and Conditions (2) and (3), at p. 21 of the Tariff.)\nWe may now turn to the Live Stock Contract and see whether there is in it any restriction limiting the \"Owner's Risk\" condition and which would, notwithstanding that condition, make the appellant liable in the case of loss or damage resulting from its negligence or that of its servants or employees.\nThe contract begins by stating that the appellant agreed to carry the carload of horses to its usual place of delivery at destination, and that it was mutually agreed that every service to be performed thereunder should be subject to all conditions therein contained; this was accepted for himself by the shipper, the respondent herein. The shipper agreed to pay all charges at a stated rate which is the\nlower published tariff rate, and is based on the express condition that the carrier shall in no case be liable for loss or damage or injury to said live stock, in excess of the agreed valuation, upon which valuation the rate charged is based, and beyond which valuation neither the carrier nor any connecting carrier shall be liable in any event, whether the loss, injury or damage occurs through the negligence of the carrier or any connecting carrier, or their or either of their employees, or otherwise. (Sec. 1)\nThe shipper agreed to load, unload or reload the live stock at his own expense and risk; feed, water and attend the same at his own expense and risk, while in transit. Moreover, in case any of the employees of the carrier should load, unload, reload, feed, water or otherwise care for the said live stock, or assist in doing so, it was agreed that they should be treated as agents of the shipper for that purpose and not as the agents of the carrier. There is an exception to that stipulation\u2014when these things are occasioned by some act or default of the carrier itself.\nThe carrier agreed to provide proper loading, unloading or reloading facilities and suitable equipment with secure car door fastenings for the transportation of said live stock.\nThe shipper agreed to properly and securely place all said stock in cars, and, except in case where the shipper or some person on his behalf accompanies the live stock, the carrier shall keep the doors securely locked or fastened until placed for unloading. (Sec. 4)\nIf the destination of the shipment of live stock is more than 150 miles from the point of shipment, the shipper or some person on his behalf (not an employee of the carrier) must, unless special arrangements are otherwise made in writing, accompany and care for the shipment throughout the journey. (Sec. 5)\nThe carrier shall not be liable for loss, damage, or delay to any of the live stock herein described caused by the Act of God, the King's or public enemies, riots, strikes, defects or inherent vice in the live stock, heat, cold, the authority of law, quarantine, the act or default of the shipper, or causes beyond the carrier's control, etc.\nExcept in case of the negligence of the carrier, (and the burden of proving freedom from such negligence shall be on the carrier) the carrier shall not be liable for loss, damage or delay occurring while the live stock is stopped and held in transit upon the request of the party entitled to make such request. (sec. 6)\nIn the contract the shipper acknowledged that he had the option of shipping the live stock at a higher rate of freight than that payable under the Live Stock Special Contract, and according to the classification and tariffs of the carrier, or connecting carriers, the effect of which the shipper stated he understood, would be to remove the limitation on the amount of damages for which the carrier or the connecting carriers might be liable,\nand the shipper has voluntarily elected to accept the limitation of liability herein contained to enable him to obtain the reduced freight rate above mentioned. Then on the reverse side of the contract form we find a special contract for the attendant in charge of the live stock, which is also signed by the respondent:\u2014\nI agree to give the live stock included in this shipment all care and attention needed en route. If anything goes wrong in connection with the shipment, or if it needs any care or attention that requires the help or co-operation of the train crew, I will promptly notify the conductor in charge.\nIt is common ground that the destination between the shipping point and destination in the premises much exceeded 150 miles, the actual distance by rail being 1,926 miles.\nTherefore, by accepting and signing the special contract, the respondent consented to the appellant's limitation of liability, but more particularly he agreed to assume the risk of loss or damage to his horses during the journey unless he could establish that such loss or damage was due to the non-fulfilment of the appellant's obligation under the contract.\nThis special contract, and the Owner's Risk clause forming part of it, clearly eliminated the presumption created by article 1675 of the Civil Code. The fact that under sections (1) and (9) of the Contract the liability of the carrier in no case was to exceed $200.00 per horse, whatever may have been the cause of the loss, carrier's negligence or otherwise, does not affect or destroy the special stipulations of the contract, the effect of which was to place the burden of proof upon the shipper. If the latter wished the carrier to be liable, he had the option of asking for a standard Bill of Lading and paying a higher rate. The fact that a shipment under the Live Stock Special Contract is declared to be at the Owner's Risk clearly establishes that there was no intention that the carrier should be presumed liable and that the burden of proof should be on it. Indeed the contract itself contains specific provisions to that effect whenever it was intended that the carrier should assume that burden.\nCanadian jurisprudence has fairly well settled the meaning of the words \"Owner's Risk\" when used in a Carrier's Contract. (See Brown v. Dominion Express Co.[3], Court of Appeal in Ontario, where, at p. 332, Maclaren J.A., refers to a decision in the case of Dixon v. Richelieu Navigation Co.[4], which decision was affirmed by this Court[5] and the following cases: Mason & Risch Piano Co. v. Can. Pac. Ry. Co.[6], Hotte v. Grand Trunk Railway[7], Turner v. Can. Pac. Ry. Co.[8], (Alberta court of appeal); Bayne v. Canadian National Ry.[9] (Saskatchewan Court of Appeal); Benoit v. Can. Pac. Ry.[10] and McCawley v. Furness Rly. Co.[11].\nIn Elliott on Railroads, 3rd edit., vol. IV, no. 2338, at p. 837, the governing rule is stated as follows:\u2014\nThe correct rule in such cases, therefore, is that the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff to show that a breach of duty upon the part of the carrier caused the injury or loss, and if the carrier is liable only for negligence, the burden is upon the plaintiff to show such negligence.\nNow the first consideration, I repeat, is that the respondent here has failed to prove negligence and has not even alleged it. On that score, therefore, I fail to see how the exception contained in section 6 of the Special Contract can be taken into consideration for the decision of the present case and the question of negligence of the carrier does not come up for discussion at all. (Canadian National Steamships Co. Ltd. v. Watson[12])\nBut in addition to the above reason, it seems to me inescapable that the damage in any event was attributable to the respondent's failure to accompany, attend to and care for his shipment during the journey. Had the respondent accompanied the shipment, as he was bound to do under the contract, and guarded and protected against intrusions of \"unauthorized persons\", surely the damage would have been avoided.\nSection (5) of the Special Contract provided specifically that, as the destination of the shipment was more than 150 miles from the point of shipping,\nthe shipper or some person on his behalf (not an employee of the carrier), must, unless special arrangements are otherwise made in writing, accompany and care for the shipment throughout the journey. There were no special arrangements in writing or otherwise and, therefore, the shipper completely failed to carry out his obligations under section (5) \"to accompany and care for the shipment throughout the journey\". It is not, as can be seen and as appears to have been assumed in the courts below, the mere obligation of accompanying the shipment, but the obligation to attend to and to \"care for\" it. It is evident that what happened to the horses is due to the lack of attention and of care and, as such care was the obligation of the shipper, the loss or damage is attributable to him. There is clearly a relation of cause and effect between the respondent's neglect and the loss he has suffered. (Chemin de fer du Midi v. Delcros Fr\u00e8res, Cour de Cassation in France,[13].)\nThe respondent's contention that the appellant waived that condition of the contract, by accepting the live stock while the respondent failed to accompany it or to put some of his employees in charge of it, cannot be accepted in view of the stipulations of the contract itself. The contract made it compulsory upon the respondent to load, unload or reload the live stock at his own expense and risk and to feed, water and attend the same, also at his own expense and risk, while in transit; and it also provided for the case where the respondent failed to carry out that obligation and it stated that if he failed to do so the employees of the carrier would do it and otherwise care for the live stock and under such circumstances\nthey shall be treated as agents of the shipper for that purpose and not as agents of the carrier.\nIt followed that there was no waiver on the part of the appellant since the contract itself provided for whatever had to be done in case the shipper elected not to accompany and care for the horses during the journey.\nThen section (6) of the contract expressly stipulated that the carrier was not to be liable for the loss or damage caused by \"the act or default of the shipper\".\nThe consequence is that, on the whole, the appellant cannot be held responsible for the loss or damage suffered by the respondent in the present case. The appeal should, therefore, be allowed and the action dismissed with costs in the Superior Court and in the Court of King's Bench (appeal side). However, the appeal only came to this Court from that Court on the ground that the question to be decided was of general importance, and there is no question that it is so. On the other hand, it would not be just for the respondent personally to bear the costs incurred by reason of the fact that this important question was carried to this Court, and, for that special reason, I would think the respondent should not be called upon to pay the appellant his costs in this Court.\nHudson J.:\u2014The respondent shipped eighteen horses over the defendant's railway from points in Saskatchewan, consigned to Montreal. In due course these horses arrived at Montreal but when delivered to the plaintiff sixteen of them had been shorn of their tails. Just when, how or by whom this mutilation took place was not clearly established in evidence by either party.\nThe plaintiff brought this action to recover for the loss sustained and at the trial before Mr. Justice Tyndale was awarded a verdict of $200.00. This was affirmed on appeal and the appellant now comes to this court by special leave.\nThe pleadings of both parties referred to the contract of shipment which is in a form approved of by the Board of Transport Commissioners and governs the case in so far as it applies.\nThe appellant seeks to avoid liability on two grounds:\nIn the first place, it is said that the respondent's loss was due to his failure to provide an attendant to accompany and care for the horses, as required by the contract of which section 5 provides:\nIf the destination of the shipment of said live stock is more than one hundred and fifty (150) miles from the point of shipment, the shipper or some person on his behalf (not an employee of the carrier), must, unless special arrangements are otherwise made in writing, accompany and care for the shipment throughout the journey.\nSection 4 (1) provides:\nThe shipper agrees to load, unload or reload said live stock at his own expense and risk; feed, water and attend same at his own expense and risk while in transit, except as provided in subsection 5 of this Section. In case any of the employees of the carrier load, unload, reload, feed, water or otherwise care for the said live stock, or assist in doing so, they shall be treated as agents of the shipper for that purpose and not as the agents of the carrier; except when such loading, unloading, reloading, feeding or watering is occasioned by some act or default of the carrier.\nIt is admitted that the destination of the shipment was more than 150 miles from the point of shipment and that neither the respondent himself nor anyone on his behalf accompanied the shipment. Whatever care and attention the horses received on the journey was provided by the appellant's employees.\nThe contract does not contemplate the continuous presence of an attendant, but only at such times as it might be expected that the horses would require care and attention, that is, loading, unloading, feeding, illness, etc.\nThe attendant was not required to be a watchman; in fact his movements were considerably restricted by a special collateral contract relieving the company from liability in case of personal injuries. It is certain that there were long periods of time on the journey when the train was stationary, other than those during which the horses would be expected to receive personal attention.\nNo explanation is given on behalf of the appellant of how and when the horses' tails were removed. It is possible that this was done at a time when the respondent or his agent should have been in attendance, but there is no evidence to justify a presumption that such was the case. What is certain is that it was brought about by the wilful and deliberate act of some human agency while the animals were in the sole possession of the appellant and its employees. It seems very strange indeed that an operation of this sort could be carried on without the knowledge of some of them.\nThe second contention of the appellant is that the shipment was made at \"owner's risk\". The contract itself does not contain any direct reference to the term \"owner's risk\", but it is expressed to be subject to the classification and tariffs in effect on the date of the issue of the bill of lading \"(except when inconsistent herewith).\"\nThe Canadian Freight Classification approved of by the Board of Transport Commissioners, rule 25, sec. 1, provides:\nArticles specified in this Classification to be carried under Owner's Risk conditions, shall, unless otherwise required by the shipper, be carried at Owner's Risk as so specified and defined, and special notation to that effect is not necessary on the bill of lading. These conditions are intended to cover risks necessarily incidental to transportation; but no such limitation, expressed or otherwise, shall relieve the carrier from liability for any loss or damage which may result from any negligence or omission of the company, its agents or employees.\nBut by section 4 of this rule it is provided:\nThis rule will not apply to live stock which will be carried only on the terms and conditions specified in the Classification.\nIn the detailed Classification under the heading \"Live Stock\" it is provided that live stock will be carried either (a) at carrier's risk, or (b) at owner's risk, as shipper may elect * * *\nIn carloads, at the undermentioned rates and weights:\n(a) At carrier's risk:\nSubject to terms and conditions of the bill of lading issued by the originating carrier.\n(b) At owner's risk:\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the special live stock contract signed by the shipper or his agent.\nThe tariff setting forth rates from different points applicable to this particular shipment is preceded by a number of rules and conditions, rule 2 being:\nRates named herein only apply when live stock is shipped at owner's risk, subject to the terms and conditions of the special live stock contract signed by the shipper or his agent.\nThe learned trial judge, after a careful analysis of the provisions of the contract and of the classification and tariff, came to the conclusion that the shipper accepted the terms of the special live stock contract and nothing else.\nWith this view I agree. Apart from statute, there is no generally accepted definition of the term \"owner's risk\". In the present case the only consideration for a limitation of the carrier's liability is a reduced freight rate and that consideration is exhausted by the limitations incorporated in the contract itself. This is made clear by the language used in sections 1 and 9. Section 1 provides that:\nThe shipper agrees to pay, if required, before delivery, all lawful and proper charges as well as freight thereon to the carrier at the rate of \u2026.. per one hundred pounds, which is the lower published tariff rate, and is based on the express condition that the carrier shall in no case be liable for loss of or damage or injury to said live stock, in excess of the following agreed valuation, or a proportionate sum in any one case, upon which valuation the rate charged for the transportation of the said live stock is based, and beyond which valuation neither the carrier nor any connecting carrier shall be liable in any event, whether the loss, injury or damage occurs through the negligence of the carrier or any connecting carrier, or their or either of their employees, or otherwise, viz.\u2014\nHorses or mules * * * not exceeding $200.00 each.\nSection 9:\nThe shipper hereby acknowledges that he has the option of shipping the above described live stock at a higher rate of freight than that payable hereunder, and according to the classifications and tariffs of the carrier, or connecting carriers, the effect of which the shipper understands would be to remove the limitation on the amount of damages for which the carrier or the connecting carriers might be liable as herein provided, and the shipper has voluntarily elected to accept the limitation of liability herein contained to enable him to obtain the reduced freight rate above mentioned.\nThe general limitation of liability is contained in section 6 as follows:\nThe carrier shall not be liable for loss, damage or delay to any of the live stock herein described caused by the Act of God, the King's or public enemies, riots, strikes, defects or inherent vice in the live stock, heat, cold, the authority of law, quarantine, the act or default of the shipper, or causes beyond the carrier's control; nor when caused by changes in weather or delay resulting therefrom, except such delay is due to the carrier's negligence, and the burden of proving freedom from such negligence shall be on the carrier; nor for loss or damage caused by fire occurring after cars have been placed for unloading at point of destination.\nExcept in case of the negligence of the carrier, (and the burden of proving freedom from such negligence shall be on the carrier), the carrier shall not be liable for loss, damage or delay occurring while the live stock is stopped and held in transit upon the request of the party entitled to make such request.\nThe only \"act or default of the shipper\" alleged is his failure to provide an attendant for the horses and, as already stated, there is no evidence here to afford any presumption that this caused the loss. None of the other causes of loss from which the carrier is relieved from liability by this section apply to the facts in this case.\nThe appellant, as a common carrier, is subject to the liabilities attached to anyone carrying on that occupation, unless otherwise provided by the Railway Act or a valid contract between the parties.\nSection 312 of the Railway Act provides that the company shall\nwithout delay and with due care and diligence, receive, carry and deliver all * * * traffic, and subsection 7 of that section provides that:\nEvery person aggrieved by any neglect or refusal of the company to comply with the requirements of this section shall, subject to this Act, have an action therefor against the company, from which action the company shall not be relieved by any notice, condition or declaration, if the damage arises from any negligence or omission of the company or of its servant.\nSection 348 prohibits contracts restricting or limiting the company's liability in respect of the carriage of any traffic unless said contract is first authorized or approved by order or regulation of the Board.\nThe contract between the parties here was in a form approved of by the Board. The statute then does not give the appellant any immunity beyond that expressed in the contract.\nThe action was brought in Quebec and it has been recognized by both parties that the laws of Quebec should apply, subject to the provisions of the Railway Act and any valid contract subsisting between the parties.\nThe Civil Code of Quebec provides by articles 1672, 1675 and 1681:\n1672. Carriers by land and by water are subject, with respect to the safekeeping of things entrusted to them, to the same obligations and duties as innkeepers, declared under the title Of Deposit.\n1675. They are liable for the loss or damage of things entrusted to them, unless they can prove that such loss or damage was caused by a fortuitous event or irresistible force, or has arisen from a defect in the thing itself.\n1681. The conveyance of persons and things by railway is subject to certain special rules, provided in the Federal and Provincial Acts respecting railways.\nIn Mignault, vol. 7, p. 383, it is stated:\nNotre article consacre la r\u00e9gie du droit commun qui met \u00e0 la charge de la personne qui l'invoque la preuve du cas fortuit ou de la force majeure (Art. 1200). Donc d\u00e8s que la chose confi\u00e9e au voiturier est avari\u00e9e ou perdue, la faute du voiturier est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e, et il lui incombe de repousser cette pr\u00e9somption, en prouvant que la perte ou avarie a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par cas fortuit ou force majeure ou provient des vices de la chose. C'est l'application au voiturier du principe de la faute contractuelle.\nThe common law liability of a common carrier is, I think, authoritatively stated in 4 Halsbury, at p. 12 and following pages:\nA common carrier is responsible for the safety of the goods intrusted to him in all events, except when loss or injury arises solely from act of God or the King's enemies. He is therefore liable even where he is overwhelmed and robbed by an irresistible number of persons. He is an insurer of the safety of the goods against everything extraneous which may cause loss or injury except the act of God or the King's enemies.\nIt is noteworthy that this article in Halsbury is contributed by Lord Wright.\nA case which has been cited on numerous occasions and the decision accepted as good law by all courts is that of Curran v. Midland Great Western Co.[14]. In that case the plaintiff shipped some pigs from Sligo to Manchester. The special conditions of contract were as follows:\nThe Company undertakes the conveyance of animals at the reduced rate stated above solely on the condition that they shall be free from all liability (including liability for loss, injury or delay) whether in the loading, unloading, transit, or conveyance of animals, or while in the vehicles of the Company, or on their premises, unless such injury or delay shall be occasioned by the intentional and wilful neglect or misconduct of their servants acting within the scope of their authority.\nWhen the shipment arrived at Manchester the number of pigs was short and the plaintiff claimed for the value. Palles C.B. gave the judgment of the court and stated the principle at p. 188:\nI have considered the question according to the strict principles of the law of evidence; and, applying one well-known doctrine, that is, that a state of facts once proved to have existed is presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to continue, I have arrived at a clear opinion that the above question must be answered in the negative. I view the matter in this way; the pigs, notwithstanding their delivery to the defendants, remained the property of the plaintiff, and continued to be his, unless and until some event happened, such as their absolute destruction by fire or otherwise, or the sale of them in market overt, or some other act which would have divested the property. All these events are such as are not to be presumed without evidence; and the evidence of any of them, if any such be relied upon, ought to come from the defendants.\nI say, therefore, that we have evidence here from which we may presume that at the time at which the defendants refused to deliver the pigs, they were in existence in rerum natura, and were the property of the plaintiff.\nNext, the pigs having been received into the possession of the defendants, there is a prima facie presumption that they continued to be in their possession until the contrary is shown, or until a different presumption arises from the nature of the subject\u2014neither of which states of fact exists here.\nLastly, the defendants failed to deliver some of the pigs, and allege no excuse.\nThese circumstances, in my opinion, are evidence from which a jury would be warranted in holding as matter of fact that the defendants had the pigs in their possession. If that inference in fact were drawn, then I hold as matter of law that their unaccounted-for refusal to deliver them, so continuing in their possession, upon the plaintiff's demand for them at the place and time at which they ought to have been delivered\u2014of which there is ample evidence\u2014amounted to wilful misconduct, for which this action will lie.\nUpon this short ground, I am of opinion that there is evidence of the defendants' liability in respect of the non-delivered pigs.\nIt is to be understood that I do not express any opinion as to the extent of the explanation which, in such cases as the present, it is incumbent on the Company to give.\nThe present case is not a case of injury or loss through direct negligence, or accident, or fortuitous event. There was here not merely an injury to the horses but an abstraction and non-delivery of part of the property shipped, i.e. the horses' tails. It was in evidence that the hair had a commercial value.\nIn essentials the reasoning of Chief Baron Palles in the Curran case[15] applies here. The onus is on the appellant and, for this reason, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nKellock J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, pronounced the 29th day of December, 1944, dismissing an appeal by the present appellant, the defendant in the action, from a judgment of the Superior Court, dated the 6th day of April, 1943, in favour of the respondent for damages with respect to certain horses shipped by the respondent from Saskatchewan to Montreal.\nEighteen horses had been shipped by the respondent on the terms of what is known as a Special Live Stock Contract, dated the 18th of March, 1941, thirteen of the horses having been loaded at North Battleford, and the remaining six at Maymont, both in the province of Saskatchewan. On arrival, sixteen of these horses had had their tails cut off in a rather ragged manner close to the tail bone, and it was established that this loss had occurred after shipment. The learned trial judge was of the opinion and so found that the loss had been occasioned by the act of some unauthorized person and that on the balance of probabilities the loss had happened while the horses were in the car and when the car itself was stationary.\nThe Special Contract, which was in a form approved by the Board of Transport Commissioners, provided that where a transit involved a journey in excess of 150 miles, the shipper, or some person on his behalf must, unless special arrangements were made in writing to the contrary, accompany and care for the shipment throughout the journey. In fact, no one on behalf of the respondent did accompany the horses which were unloaded for rest and feeding at three stations en route; namely, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan; St. Boniface, Manitoba, and Hornepayne, Ontario.\nThe car in question was an ordinary live stock car with open spaces between the boards or slats and it appears from the evidence that some of these spaces were capable of being enlarged, by movement of the slats over the original spacing at the time of the construction of the car, and the learned trial judge's view was that the damage had been done by a person outside the car working through the space between the slats. He also held the appellant guilty of a breach of contract in failing to provide proper equipment as he considered the spaces between the slats constituted the car an improper one. The learned trial judge was also of opinion that the failure of the respondent to have any one accompany the horses on his behalf as required by the contract had not been shown to have in any way been a contributing factor in connection with the loss and that the onus of showing this was upon the appellant.\nOn appeal to the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, the majority concurred in the view of the learned trial judge as to there being a breach of contract but all the members of the Court disagreed with the inference drawn by the learned trial judge that the trimming of the tails was done while the horses were in the car by someone operating from outside the car through the slats for the reason that the evidence was not sufficient. The Court held that the onus was upon the appellant to show that the loss arose from circumstances for which it was not responsible under the contract, which included the onus of showing that it arose from failure on the part of the respondent to have someone accompany the shipment. As the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient evidence to satisfy this onus, it was held that it must bear the loss.\nUnder the provisions of the contract itself, the appellant acknowledged receipt,\nsubject to the classification and tariffs in effect on the date of issue of this original live stock Bill of Lading (except when inconsistent herewith).\nof the live stock described in the contract\nwhich the said company agrees to carry to its usual place of delivery at said destination.\nThe document then proceeds as follows:\nthe live stock of the kind and number, and consigned and destined as indicated below, which the said Company agrees to carry to its usual place of delivery at said destination, if on its road, otherwise to deliver to another carrier on the route to said destination. It is mutually agreed as to each carrier of all or any of said live stock, over all or any portion of said route to destination, and as to each party at any time interested in all or any of said live stock, that every service to be performed hereunder shall be subject to all the conditions, whether printed or written, herein contained, and which are agreed to by the shipper and accepted for himself and his assigns.\nThe contract then sets out particulars of the car number, the consignee, the destination, the number of animals and the instructions for feeding and watering and completion of loading.\nThe document then continues:\n1. The shipper agrees to pay, if required, before delivery, all lawful and proper charges as well as freight thereon to the carrier at the rate of\u2014\u2014\u2014per one hundred pounds, which is the lower published tariff rate, and is based on the express condition that the carrier shall in no case be liable for loss of or damage or injury to said live stock, in excess of the following agreed valuation, or a proportionate sum in any one case, upon which valuation the rate charged for the transportation of the said live stock is based, and beyond which valuation neither the carrier nor any connecting carrier shall be liable in any event, whether the loss, injury or damage occurs through the negligence of the carrier or any connecting carrier, or their or either of their employees, or otherwise, viz.\u2014\nHorses or mules \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. not exceeding $200.00 each\nColts, under one year of age\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. not exceeding $100.00 each\nCattle (except calves)\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. not exceeding $150.00 each\nHogs\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...... not exceeding $40.00 each\nOther Domestic Animals\n(including calves 6 months old and younger) not exceeding $ 20.00 each If, upon inspection, it is ascertained that the live stock shipped is not as described in this Live Stock Bill of Lading, the freight charges must be paid on the live stock actually shipped, with any additional charges lawfully payable thereon.\n2. No carrier is bound to transport said live stock by any particular train, or in time for any particular market, or otherwise than with reasonable dispatch, unless by specific agreement endorsed hereon. Every carrier, in case of physical necessity, shall have the right to forward said live stock by any railway or route between the point of shipment and point of destination.\n3. By this contract the carrier agrees to transport only over its own line, and acts only as agent with respect to the portion of the route beyond its own line, except as otherwise provided by law; no carrier shall be liable for damage or injury not occurring on its portion of the through route, nor after the stock has been delivered to the next carrier, except as such liability is or may be imposed by law. Unless a different agreement is made with connecting carriers, in respect to transportation on their respective lines, the terms and conditions hereof shall apply to the transportation by each carrier on any portion of the route to destination.\n4. (1) The shipper agrees to load, unload or reload said live stock at his own expense and risk; feed, water and attend same at his own expense and risk while in transit, except as provided in sub-section (5) of this Section. In case any of the employees of the carrier load, unload, reload, feed, water or otherwise care for the said live stock, or assist in doing so, they shall be treated as agents of the shipper for that purpose and not as agents of the carrier; except when such loading, unloading, reloading, feeding or watering is occasioned by some act or default of the carrier.\n(2) The carrier agrees to provide proper loading, unloading or reloading facilities and suitable equipment with secure car door fastenings for the transportation of said live stock.\n(3) The shipper agrees to properly and securely place all said stock in cars, and the carrier shall, except in cases where the shipper or some person on his behalf accompanies the live stock keep said doors securely locked or fastened until placed for unloading.\n(4) If temporary partitions or decks are put in the cars by the shipper, the carrier shall not be responsible for the sufficiency thereof, or for any loss or damage caused by defects therein.\n(5) In the event of delay to said live stock caused by the negligence of the carrier, any consequent unloading, reloading, feeding or watering en route shall be at the carrier's expense and risk; and any expense incurred by the shipper in connection therewith shall be repaid to him by the carrier.\n5. If the destination of the shipment of said live stock is more than one hundred and fifty (150) miles from the point of shipment, the shipper or some person on his behalf (not an employee of the carrier), must, unless special arrangements are otherwise made in writing, accompany and care for the shipment throughout the journey.\n6. The carrier shall not be liable for loss, damage or delay to any of the live stock herein described caused by the act of God, the King's or public enemies, riots, strikes, defects or inherent vice in the live stock, heat, cold, the authority of law, quarantine, the act or default of the shipper, or causes beyond the carrier's control; nor when caused by changes in weather or delay resulting therefrom, except such delay is due to the carrier's negligence, and the burden of proving freedom from such negligence shall be on the carrier; nor for loss or damage caused by fire occurring after cars have been placed for unloading at point of destination.\nExcept in case of the negligence of the carrier (and the burden of proving freedom from such negligence shall be on the carrier), the carrier shall not be liable for loss, damage or delay occurring while the live stock is stopped and held in transit upon the request of the party entitled to make such request.\n7. Notice of claim on account of loss, damage or delay must be made in writing to the Agent of the carrier at the point of shipment, or to the Agent of the carrier at the point of delivery; or to a Divisional Superintendent, a District Freight Agent, a Claims Agent, or the General Counsel of the carrier, within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the live stock, or in case of failure to make delivery, then within thirty (30) days after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed. Unless notice is so given the carrier shall not be liable.\n8. No person accompanying the said live stock shall have the right to ride free or at a rate less than full fare in connection with this shipment, unless and until he has signed the special form of contract for such attendants, printed on the back hereof.\nThe carrier shall not be liable either for loss of life or personal injury to such persons accompanying said live stock, whether such person is being carried free or at a rate less than full fare, unless such loss of life or personal injury is caused by negligence on the part of the carrier, its servants or employees while the said persons are in the caboose or other car provided for their transportation, or while in the car provided for their transportation, or while in the car provided for the transportation of the live stock.\n9. The shipper hereby acknowledges that he has the option of shipping the above described live stock at a higher rate of freight than that payable hereunder, and according to the classifications and tariffs of the carrier, or connecting carriers, the effect of which the shipper understands would be to remove the limitation on the amount of damages for which the carrier or the connecting carriers, might be liable as herein provided, and the shipper has voluntarily elected to accept the limitation of liability herein contained to enable him to obtain the reduced freight rate above mentioned.\n10. Any alteration, addition or erasure in this Live Stock Bill of Lading shall be signed or initialled in the margin by an agent of the carrier issuing the same, and if not so signed or initialled shall be without effect, and this Bill of Lading shall be enforceable according to its original tenor.\nIt is the contention of counsel for the appellant that as the result of these terms and of the relevant provisions of the classification and tariffs referred to in the contract, the onus of establishing the cause of the loss was upon the respondent and not upon the appellant and that as the cause of the loss was not established, the action should have been dismissed.\nIt has been held under the provisions of the respective Railway Acts then in force that the liability of a railway is that of a common carrier; Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada v. Vogel[16] per Strong J. Grand Trunk Railway Company v. McMillan[17] and The Queen v. Grenier[18]. It has not been argued that there is anything in the provisions of the present statute R. S. C. ch. 170 which produces a different result. Such liability may be affected in accordance with the provisions of section 348 of the Act, which is the provision referred to in the phrase \"subject to this Act\" in subsection 7 of section 312, Grand Trunk Railway Company v. Robinson[19]. The question in the case at bar is as to the effect of the classification, the tariff and the provisions of the special Live Stock Contract.\nComing to the provisions of the classification incorporated by reference into the contract, this classification begins with a number of \"Rules and Conditions of Carriage.\"\nRule 25 reads in part as follows:\nSec. 1. Articles specified in this Classification to be carried under Owner's Risk Conditions, shall, unless otherwise required by the shipper, be carried at Owner's Risk as so specified and defined, and special notation to that effect is not necessary on the bill of lading. These conditions are intended to cover risks necessarily incidental to transportation; but no such limitation, expressed or otherwise, shall relieve the carrier from liability for any loss or damage which may result from any negligence or omission of the company, its agents or employees.\nSec. 2, Should the shipper decline to ship at \"Owner's Risk\" as specified and defined in this Classification any article shown as to be so carried, the articles will be carried subject to the terms and conditions of the bill of lading approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, in which case twenty-five per cent. over and above the rates which would be payable if such articles were shipped at \"Owner's Risk\" will be charged.\nSec. 4. This rule will not apply to live stock which will be carried only on the terms and conditions specified in the classification. Under the heading, \"Live Stock,\" it is provided in the Classification itself that\nlive stock will be carried either (a) at Carrier's Risk or (b) at Owner's Risk, as the shipper may elect, but in each case the value of the animals must be declared by the shipper or his agent.\nWhere, as in the case at bar, the value of each animal is declared not to exceed $200.00, the shipment is to be charged for\nat the rates and weights and be carried upon the terms and conditions following, that is to say:\nIn carloads at the undermentioned rates and weights (a) At Carrier's Risk\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the Bill of Lading issued by the originating carrier.\n(b) At Owner's Risk\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the Special Live Stock Contract signed by the shipper or his agent.\nAnd where, as in the present case, the shipper elected to ship at \"Owner's Risk,\" the freight rate provided in \"9th class\" whereas the rate applicable to a shipment at \"Carrier's Risk\" is double the 9th class rate.\nThe tariff incorporated by the terms of the contract is \"East-bound Tariff No. 116 (a).\" Rule 2 of this tariff provides that the\nrates named herein only apply when live stock is shipped at Owner's Risk subject to the terms and conditions of the Special Live Stock Contract signed by the shipper or his Agent.\nThe result of these various provisions is that the shipment here in question was carried \"at Owner's Risk subject to the terms and conditions of the special live stock contract.\" It is the contention of the appellant that the words \"owner's risk\" are to be construed as throwing upon the respondent all risks including risk of loss or damage arising from negligence of the carrier, the only exception being wilful neglect or misconduct of the carrier and Dixon v. Richelieu Navigation Company[20] is cited. Counsel argues that the terms of the written contract are to be considered against this background, and when so considered, there is nothing which throws upon the appellant any responsibility or any burden of proof.\nIt is of interest at this point to refer to a form of contract formerly in use with regard to the shipment of live stock under which such cases as Booth v. Canadian Pacific Railway[21] and others were decided. That form of contract provided that the carrier should not be liable\nfor any loss or damage in respect of the said live stock by reason of * * * any other injuries happening to said stock while in any railway car, except such as may arise from a collision of the train, or the throwing of the cars from the track during transportation * * * said stock is to be loaded, unloaded, fed, watered, and while in the cars cared for in all respects by the shipper or owner at his expense and risk.\nAt the end of what is now section 5 there followed:\nand unless the shipment is so accompanied the company shall be relieved from all obligation to carry the same. If the company carry such live stock without it being so accompanied, it shall not be liable for any loss or damage due to the live stock not being so accompanied and cared for.\nWhatever may have been the situation under such a form of contract in circumstances such as are here present, the provisions of the contract which have now to be construed are quite different. In view of these provisions, very little of the content contended for with respect to the words \"owner's risk,\" apart from the limitation in the amount of damages, would seem to be left in a case such as the present. The contract, in my opinion, proceeds on the assumption that there is the underlying responsibility of a common carrier to which I have already referred, resting upon the carrier which it restricts and modifies. Section 1 of itself does not impose any liability upon the carrier even up to the amount which it sets. The section assumes that, apart from its provisions, a liability does rest upon the carrier for loss or damage occurring through the negligence of the carrier \"or otherwise.\" That liability the section limits to $200.00.\nSection 6 would be largely meaningless apart from such a construction. It presupposes that the carrier is liable as a common carrier with some additional exceptions to that liability. To take the last sentence of section 6 by itself further illustrates the above view. The carrier is to be free from loss, damage or delay occurring while the live stock is stopped and held in transit upon the request of the party entitled to make such request, except in the case of its own negligence. If the shipper, as the appellant now contends, assumed all the risk of carriage, there would be no reason for the inclusion of this provision in the contract at all, and the inference from it is that if a stoppage occurs which is not due to a request of the shipper, the risk of loss is upon the carrier. In the case at bar, there was a delay of some twenty-five hours in the transit which is not accounted for.\nDelivery of the horses in their mutilated condition was not a compliance with the obligation resting upon the appellant and if, as I think, the terms of the special contract recognize this underlying obligation and provide certain exceptions from it, it lay upon the appellant, (on whose behalf the argument is in essence that the loss fell within either one of two of those exceptions, namely, \"the act or default of the shipper\" or \"causes beyond the carrier's control,\") to adduce evidence bringing the case within the one or other of those exceptions; London and North Western Railway v. Ashton[22]. The appellant adduced no evidence to enable a finding to be made as to how the loss occurred. Merely to prove, if it can be said that that has been done in the case at bar, something equally consistent with the loss having been due to the respondent's default or to the default of the appellant is insufficient; Taylor v. Liverpool and Great Western Steam Company[23]\nIn my opinion, it was not the intention of the contract that the shipper or his representative should at all times be present with the horses to act as a guard. In fact, the Special Contract required to be signed by the person accompanying the shipment contemplates the contrary. Sections 1 and 5 of that contract read as follows:\n1. I will remain in a safe place in the caboose or other car provided for my transportation, or in the car provided for the transportation of the stock, at all times while the train is in motion.\n5. I will always bear in mind that freight trains do not stop at stations or places especially prepared for passengers to alight; that freight trains frequently stop on bridges and places along the line where it is not safe to alight; I will therefore not attempt to alight from the caboose or other car, when a train may stop for any purpose, without first making a careful examination, (with a lighted lantern if at night time), and thus ascertaining that it is safe to alight at that point; and I will not omit taking these precautions because of anything said or done by employees of the carrier. It was not shown, therefore, that this default of the respondent was related in any way to the loss and I think the contention of the appellant with regard to this point fails. The contract provisions, as already pointed out, are substantially different in form from the contract under consideration in the cases relied upon by the appellant.\nCounsel for the appellant also pointed to the provisions of the ordinary Bill of Lading which would have applied had the respondent shipped at \"Carrier's Risk,\" and paid the higher rate. This Bill of Lading begins:\nThe carrier of any of the goods herein described shall be liable for any loss thereof or damage thereto except as hereinafter provided.\nAppellant argues that there is no corresponding provision in the Special Live Stock Contract here in question and that therefore the onus is not thrown upon the Railway Company. For the reasons already given, I do not think this argument entitled to prevail. Much clearer language than is found in the contract here under consideration would be required to effect such a result.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.\nEstey J.:\u2014On the 18th of March, 1941, the respondent shipped from North Battleford and Maymont, Saskatchewan, eighteen horses via the appellant railway company for delivery at Montreal. En route sixteen of the horses had their tails cut off at the end of the tail bone, and to recover damages thereby occasioned the respondent (plaintiff) brought this action. He pleaded delivery of the horses to the appellant under the provisions of the Live Stock Special Contract, executed by the parties covering this shipment, and the failure of the appellant to make a valid delivery of the horses at Montreal.\nThe appellant denied the allegations of the plaintiff; alleged the provisions of the same Live Stock Special Contract; and further that the loss or damage\ndid not take place while the horses were on the car and the loss alleged to result therefrom is solely due to plaintiff's neglect and failure to properly attend to and care for said horses, as he was obliged to do. This is the only allegation of negligence throughout the pleadings.\nThe car in question left North Battleford on March 18th, and arrived at Montreal on March 24th, a distance of about 1,926 miles. En route the horses were taken from the car at three feeding points: Saskatoon for 7 hrs. and 50 mins., St. Boniface for 24 hrs. and 40 mins., and at Hornepayne for 3 hrs. and 50 mins., a total of 36 hours. There is a further period of 25 hours en route which could not be explained nor accounted for.\nThat the loss was suffered en route is established, but no evidence is tendered to prove where, when or by what means it was inflicted. The nature of the injury makes it clear that it was the deliberate effort of some person or persons.\nThe provisions of this Live Stock Special Contract were approved by the Board of Transport Commissioners on the 2nd of June, 1920, pursuant to the provisions of section 348 of the Railway Act, 1927 R.S.C., c. 170:\n348. No contract, condition, by-law, regulation, declaration or notice made or given by the company, impairing, restricting or limiting its liability in respect of the carriage of any traffic, shall, except as hereinafter provided, relieve the company from such liability, unless such class of contract, condition, by-law, regulation, declaration or notice has been first authorized or approved by order or regulation of the Board.\nThe phrase \"its liability\" as used in this section refers to the liability of the carrier at common law and under the Railway Act, Except, therefore, as this liability may be impaired, restricted or limited under a contract, such as we are here concerned with, the liability of the carrier remains as determined by the common and statute law.\nThe first sentence of this contract reads in part as follows:\nReceived, subject to the classification and tariffs in effect on the date of issue of this; original Live Stock Bill of Lading.\nCanadian Freight Classification no. 19, also approved by the Board of Transport Commissioners, was in effect on the date of this contract and a reference thereto will indicate the different basis upon which live stock may be shipped. These horses were shipped upon the basis found in the classification under the general heading \"Live Stock\":\n5. In carloads, at the undermentioned rates and weights.\n* * *\n(b) At Owner's Risk:\nSubject to the terms and conditions of the special live stock contract signed by the shipper or his agent.\nIn the determination of the rights of the parties under this contract the meaning to be ascribed to the phrase \"Owner's Risk\" is of first importance. The appellant carrier contends that:\n* * * the shipment in the present case was carried at \"Owner's Risk\" taken in the ordinary, broad acceptation of the term, even relieving the carrier from liability for damage resulting from its negligence and that of its servants, provided such wider meaning is consistent with the terms and conditions of the Live Stock Contract.\nIn other words, that the entire risk is assumed by the shipper except only as that risk may be by the contract imposed upon the carrier. This appears contrary to the plain intent of section 348 of the statute, and, moreover, contrary to the form and phraseology of the subsequent sections of the contract itself.\nThis phrase \"Owner's Risk\" is familiar to those engaged in the carriage of goods and has been the subject of judicial decision.\nIt seems conceded that the words \"Owner's Risk\" alone would protect the carriers against all but wilful neglect or misconduct or unreasonable delay. Dixon v. Richelieu Navigation Co.,[24]\nSee also B. C. Canning Co. v. McGregor,[25]; Brown v. Dominion Express Co.,[26]; H. C. Smith Ltd. v. Great Western Ry. Co.,[27].\nA study of the subsequent sections of the Live Stock Special Contract will indicate that the Board of Transport Commissioners have not used the phrase \"Owner's Risk\" under the heading \"Live Stock\" in this classification in the sense or meaning contained in the appellant's submission nor the definition under the above quoted authorities. Section 1 of the contract provides in part:\nSec. 1. * * * that the carrier shall in no case be liable for loss of or damage or injury to * * * in excess of the following agreed valuation * * * whether the loss, injury or damage occurs through the negligence of the carrier * * * or otherwise.\nSection 4 specifically provides that the loading, unloading, feeding and caring for the live stock shall be done at the risk of the shipper unless it is occasioned by some delay caused by some negligence on the part of the carrier.\nSection 5 provides that if the destination of the shipment is a distance of more than 150 miles from the shipping point the shipper or some person on his behalf must accompany and care for the shipment throughout the journey.\nSection 6 provides as follows:\nSec. 6. The carrier shall not be liable for loss, damage, or delay to any of the live stock herein described caused by the act of God, the King's or public enemies, riots, strikes, defects or inherent vice in the live stock, heat, cold, the authority of law, quarantine, the act or default of the shipper, or causes beyond the carrier's control; nor when caused by changes in weather or delay resulting therefrom, except such delay is due to the carrier's negligence, and the burden of proving freedom from such negligence shall be on the carrier; nor for loss or damage caused by fire occurring after cars have been placed for unloading at point of destination.\nExcept in case of the negligence of the carrier (and the burden of proving freedom from such negligence shall be on the carrier), the carrier shall not be liable for loss, damage or delay occurring while the live stock is stopped and held in transit upon the request of the party entitled to make such request.\nSection 9 provides:\nSec. 9. The shipper hereby acknowledges that he has the option of shipping the above described live stock at a higher rate of freight * * * the effect of which the shipper understands would be to remove the limitation on the amount of damages for which the carrier * * * might be liable * * * and the shipper has voluntarily elected to accept the limitation * * *\nThese sections deal with limitation of liability and liability for negligence on the part of the carrier; assumption of risk by the shipper; and a list of specific causes from which if loss or damage result the carrier is not liable. It is obvious that the \"terms and conditions\" of these sections are \"impairing, restricting or limiting its liability\" as contemplated by section 348, and they are not written on the basis that if these conditions were not here all the risk would be upon the shipper as the appellant contends, nor that the carrier is liable for only \"wilful neglect or misconduct or unreasonable delay\" as the phrase \"Owner's Risk\" is construed under the foregoing decisions.\nAll of which makes it clear that the Board of Transport Commissioners did not intend to adopt in this classification either the definition of \"Owner's Risk\" suggested by the appellant or that which obtains under the authorities. If they had so intended these provisions with respect to negligence, and many, if not all, of the others would have been omitted because they would have been entirely unnecessary. The contract would have been written differently both as to form and substance.\nA study of the statute, the classification and the contract leads to the conclusion that the Board of Transport Commissioners have used this phrase \"Owner's Risk\" throughout in the same sense, and that the intention with respect to \"Owner's Risk\" conditions as expressed in rule 25 of the classification applies, including Live Stock. This rule 25 reads as follows:\nSec. 1. Articles specified in this Classification to be carried under \"Owner's Risk\" conditions, shall, unless otherwise required by the shipper, be carried at \"Owner's Risk\" as so specified and defined, and special notation to that effect is not necessary on the bill of lading. These conditions are intended to cover risks necessarily incidental to transportation; but no such limitation, expressed or otherwise, shall relieve the carrier from liability for any loss or damage which may result from any negligence or omission of the company, its agents or employees.\nSec. 2. Where \"Owner's Risk\" conditions are specified for articles in less than carloads, such conditions will also apply on the same articles in Carloads.\nSec. 3. Should the shipper decline to ship at \"Owner's Risk\" as specified and defined in this Classification any article shown as to be so carried, the articles will be carried subject to the terms and conditions of the bill of lading approved by the Board of Railway Commissioners for Canada, in which case twenty-five per cent. over and above the rates which would be payable if such articles were shipped at \"Owner's Risk\" will be charged.\nSec. 4. This rule will not apply to live stock which will be carried only on the terms and conditions specified in the Classification.\nIt will be observed that rule 25 refers to \"Owner's Risk conditions * * * so specified and defined\", and then provides that \"these conditions are intended to cover risks necessarily incidental to transportation; * * *\" It includes certain general provisions with respect to less than carload lots and the rates to be charged when the shipper refuses to ship at \"Owner's Risk\". These latter apply generally throughout the classification but under the heading \"Live Stock\" they are specifically dealt with. It was prudent, therefore, to include in rule 25 that such should not apply to live stock. Subsection 4 is intended to so provide and avoid any conflict between that rule and the provisions under the heading of \"Live Stock\". It would appear that it should be so read and construed.\nIt is significant that this important phrase \"Owner's Risk\" does not appear in the body of this Live Stock Special Contract and in the classification under the heading \"Live Stock\" it appears only as above quoted. The foregoing construction of rule 25 explains why it is not used in the contract as it provides \"special notation to that effect is not necessary on the bill of lading\". If either the meaning contended for by the appellant or that under the above authorities had been intended, one would have expected a special notation to that effect would have been required in the contract. Moreover, if the Transport Commissioners had intended to use \"Owner's Risk\" in rule 25 in the restricted sense and then in the Live Stock Classification, (and by virtue thereof in the contract),\nin the ordinary, broad acceptation of the term, even relieving the carrier from liability for damage resulting from its negligence * * *\nthey would have provided for this substantial difference by language clear and specific.\nIn any event, it appears clear from a study of the contract, classification and the statute that the Board of Transport Commissioners intended that the phrase \"Owner's Risk\" as used in this contract is, as expressed in rule 25,\nintended to cover risks necessarily incidental to transportation; but no such limitation * * * shall relieve the carrier from liability * * * from any negligence or omission of the company, its agents or employees.\nCertainly no other intention is expressed, and apart from the general words in subsection 4, \"this rule will not apply to live stock\", there is nothing which even suggests this expressed intention should not apply to live stock. On the contrary, the statute and the terms and conditions throughout both the classification and the Live Stock Special Contract support this construction.\nThe injury suffered in this case was obviously the deliberate effort of some person who committed an act in the nature of a theft or of malicious mischief and in no sense can this be regarded as a risk \"necessarily incidental to transportation\". That which is incidental is something which is usually or naturally associated with or arising out of the work of transportation. It is as the Oxford Dictionary states: \"something occurring or liable to occur in fortuitous or subordinate conjunction with something else\". The word \"necessarily\" further limits the word \"incidental\". It would appear that this general limitation is intended to cover those incidents and that other eventualities should be dealt with under the terms and conditions of the contract or left subject to the statute or common law.\nThen when we examine the terms and conditions of the contract itself, this loss or damage is not specifically covered. There are two provisions that should be mentioned and both are in section 6 quoted above. First, \"the act or default of the shipper\". This shipment was for a distance of over 150 miles and the contract provides that an attendant will \"accompany and care for the shipment throughout the journey\". The respondent shipper in this case signed another contract entitled \"Special Contract with Attendants in Charge of Stock\" which requires the attendant to provide \"all care and attention needed en route\". These contracts must be read and construed together. Section 4 of the Live Stock Special Contract provides specifically the duties of the shipper in this regard:\nSec. 4. The shipper agrees to load, unload or reload said live stock at his own expense and risk; feed, water and attend same at his own expense and risk while in transit, except * * * in the event of delay * * * caused by the negligence of the carrier.\nIt is the care and attention of this nature that is involved in the expressions \"accompany and care for the shipment throughout the journey\" and \"all care and attention needed en route\". This conclusion is emphasized by those provisions of the Attendant's contract which provide that the attendant will remain in a safe place in the caboose or other car provided for my transportation, or in the car provided for the transportation of the stock, at all times while the train is in motion.\nThis does not contemplate that the attendant shall remain in the car with the stock, particularly on a long journey such as this. Furthermore, this contract specifically requires the attendant to use caution in moving about the \"track, station or other premises\", and specifically provides\nI hereby release the said carrier * * * from all liability for any injury or damage suffered by me while violating any of the terms of this agreement.\nIt would be quite impracticable for the attendant to be at all times with the stock, nor in fact does the contract require that he do so. Moreover, its provisions do not relieve the carrier of its obligations to supervise and care for this freight as it is required to care for freight generally while in transit. It does not relieve the carrier of its responsibilities to carry freight qua freight safely.\nThere is no question but that the respondent shipper did not carry out the terms of his Attendant's Contract. His default in that regard is relevant in this action only in so far as it caused or contributed to the loss or damage suffered by these horses. Both of the parties hereto had obligations and responsibilities with regard to these horses while en route. The evidence makes it plain that the loss or damage was not a result or consequence of any default or failure to perform the obligations and duties devolving by virtue of the contracts upon the respondent. If it did so other important considerations would arise.\nThe appellant pleaded that this loss or damage\ndid not take place while the horses were on the car and the loss alleged to result therefrom is solely due to plaintiff's neglect and failure to properly attend to and care for said horses, as he was obliged to do.\nThis plea suggests that the appellant was liable while the horses were in the car but when outside thereof they were in the care of the attendant, but the evidence does not establish that the damage took place while the horses were outside the car. In fact one of the appellant's witnesses, when asked as to the possibility of this loss or damage being inflicted while the horses were in the car by one operating outside of the car, replied: \"It might be done\". Another witness for the appellant admitted: \"Yes, it was a bum job. It was done by someone who did not know the business\". This also suggests the possibility that it might have been done by some person operating under difficulties such as might exist when the horses were within the car. In my opinion, as above stated, the evidence does not establish whether the damage was done while the horses were within or without the car.\nThen in the same section 6 there is the phrase \"causes beyond the carrier's control\". This phrase, as will be observed in the above quoted section 6, follows a rather lengthy list of causes. If this phrase be regarded as a general phrase to be construed according to the well-known ejusdem generis rule, it is obvious that such a loss or damage cannot be included as coming under this heading. If, on the other hand, this phrase be regarded as a separate and distinct category and therefore not subject to the ejusdem generis rule, then the question arises, was this act beyond the control of the carrier?\nWhether such an act as that here in question was one beyond the control of the carrier cannot be determined apart from evidence directed to that issue. It has apparently been recognized throughout that the facts of this case do not warrant such a finding. The onus of adducing such evidence rests upon the appellant carrier who invokes the provisions of the contract to relieve it from liability. London and North Western Rly. Co. v. Ashton,[28]; London and North Western Rly. Co. v. Neilson,[29]; The Canadian Northern Quebec Rly. Co. v. Pleet,[30].\nThe appellant, while recognizing this general rule and that no specific provision in the contract places the burden of proof upon the shipper, contended\nthat indirectly with the Owner's Risk clause as part of the contract, it follows that the burden of proof is on the shipper;\nand further that the difference in the language used in the \"Carrier's Risk\" contract and the \"Owner's Risk\" contract for the shipment of live stock was such that \"the risk and the burden of proof\" were placed upon the shipper. The meaning and effect of the words \"Owner's Risk\" have already been dealt with. These two contracts:\nAt Carrier's Risk: Subject to the terms and conditions of the bill of lading issued by the originating carrier;\nand\nAt Owner's Risk: Subject to the terms and conditions of the special live stock contract signed by the shipper or his agent,\nclearly indicate that these terms \"Carrier's Risk\" and \"Owner's Risk\" are in this Freight Classification not used in their literal or precise dictionary meaning but rather as in the classification defined. The law has always placed upon the carrier the burden of proof and if this contract, prepared and approved as above indicated, was intended to shift the burden of proof it would have contained a provision to that effect or used such language as to point directly to that conclusion.\nThe appellant submitted that the phraseology of the contract did point directly to that conclusion and referred to two provisions in section 6 to support his contention.\nThe first:\nThe carrier shall not be liable for loss, damage, or delay * * * when caused by changes in weather or delay resulting therefrom, except such delay is due to the carrier's negligence, and the burden of proving freedom from such negligence shall be on the carrier * * *\nThe second:\nExcept in case of the negligence of the carrier, (and the burden of proving freedom from such negligence shall be on the carrier), the carrier shall not be liable for loss, damage or delay occurring while the live stock is stopped and held in transit upon the request of the party entitled to make such request.\nThis section 6 includes the act of God, the King's enemies and inherent vice; the carrier has always been relieved of liability by establishing one or other of these as the cause of the loss or damage. In effect, this section 6 enlarges the number of such causes that may be so established by the carrier but even with regard to the first three mentioned, and the others under this section would be so treated, the carrier was under an obligation to take reasonable care to avoid loss or damage being suffered therefrom.\nWith regard to the excepted perils, the carrier must use all reasonable care, skill, and diligence to avoid their consequences; and if damage occurs which is attributable to a breach of this duty, he is liable. 4 Halsbury, p. 13, para. 17. If the carrier established one of these causes it would succeed. On the other hand, it is clear that if the evidence indicated that even this consequence could have been avoided by the exercise of due care on the part of the carrier, the carrier would not succeed. In dealing with the provision that the carrier would not be responsible for loss or damage occasioned by the kicking, plunging, or restiveness of the animal, Lush J. stated:\nIt cannot, I think, be contended that this condition dispenses with the use of reasonable care on the part of the company in the receiving, carrying, and delivering cattle, any more than the exception of perils of the sea, in a bill of lading, relieves a ship-owner from the obligation to navigate with ordinary skill and care. The exception goes to limit the liability, not the duty. It is the duty of the carrier to do what he can, by reasonable skill and care, to avoid all perils, including the excepted perils. If, notwithstanding such skill and care, damage does occur from these perils, he is released from liability; but if his negligence has brought on the peril, the damage is attributable to his breach of duty, and the exception does not aid him. Gill v. Manchester etc. Rly. Co.,[31].\nSee also The Canadian Northern Quebec Rly. Co. v. Pleet,[32]. In the two foregoing provisions the appellant must not only establish in one the delay and in the other the loss, damage or delay occurring, etc., but in order to succeed must go further and establish that it was without negligence on his part. This does not have the effect of placing the onus of proof generally, as contended for by the appellant, upon the respondent.\nThis particular loss or damage not being covered by the provisions of the contract, it follows \"its liability\", as that term is used in section 348 of the Railway Act, has not been impaired, restricted or limited by the terms of the Live Stock Special Contract. The provisions of the Railway Act do not otherwise than under section 348 provide for the alteration of the liability of the carrier with respect to this type of damage and the carrier's liability therefore must be determined at common law.\nThe doubt expressed in Grand Trunk Rly. Co. v. Vogel[33] as to whether under the common law animals were included within the definition of goods to be handled by the common carrier has been settled in the affirmative in Prior v. The London & South-Western Rly. Co.[34]; see also Leslie in Law of Transport by Railway, 2nd ed. p. 46. In Canada the matter is determined by section 2 (10) of the Railway Act where the definition of goods is sufficiently broad to include horses.\nAt common law the carrier is liable for all loss or damage to goods in transit, or as it is often stated, the carrier is an insurer of the safe delivery of the goods, except where the loss or damage is caused by acts of God, the King's enemies or the inherent vice of the goods. This deliberate act of some third party does not come within any of these exceptions but is included within the statement:\nThe common carrier of goods is an insurer against harm occurring from outside which no care on his part can avert. 4 Halsbury, 2nd ed., p. 16, para. 22.\nThe appellant is therefore liable at common law for the loss or damage suffered by the respondent.\nThis action was brought in the province of Quebec and no question of jurisdiction has been raised. In any event, the liability of the appellant as a common carrier appears to be the same in both the provinces of Quebec and Saskatchewan. The Boston & Maine Railroad v. Ratzkowski,[35]; Bayne v. Can. Nat. Ry.[36].\nThe loss or damage here inflicted was caused by the deliberate act of a third person and no evidence has been adduced on the part of the carrier to indicate that it is a loss or damage covered by the provisions of the Live Stock Special Contract nor to establish on behalf of the appellant that it comes within any of the exceptions from liability at common law, and therefore the appellant must be held liable.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: C\u00f4t\u00e9 & Perrault.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Mann, Lafleur & Brown.\n[1] [1915] A.C. 740.\n[2] [1942] S.C.R. 406.\n[3] (1921) 67 D.L.R. 325.\n[4] (1888) 15 Ont.

Taschereau and Kellock JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC\nRailway\u2014Carrier\u2014Live Stock Special Contract\u2014Negligence\u2014Shipment of horses\u2014Mare found lying sick during trip\u2014Shipper's attendant not there\u2014Railway or stock yard's employees erecting gate partition\u2014Mare and another horse found dead later on\u2014Claim for damages by shipper\u2014Clause in contract that shipper should provide attendant\u2014Carrier not liable\u2014Failure of attendant, to \"care for\" and \"attend\" the mare, cause of the accident\u2014Railway's or stockyard's employees to be treated as agents of the shipper and not of the carrier\u2014\"Owner's Risk\"\u2014Articles 1675 and 1681 C.C.\nThe appellant shipped eighteen horses from three points in Saskatchewan to be delivered at Montreal under a contract with the respondent railway, known as Live Stock Special Contract,, approved by the Board of Transport Commissioners of Canada. The shipper, as he agreed to do under the contract, sent a person to accompany and care for the shipment on his behalf, but the evidence is not clear at what exact point the attendant boarded the train. When the horses were unloaded for feeding and watering at Saskatoon, it was found that a bay mare was lying on the floor, bruised and unable to rise to its feet. The appellant's attendant was not there at that time. After examination by a veterinary surgeon, a special gate partition was erected either by the railway's or by the stock yard's employees for the purpose of separating the bay mare from the rest of the horses. On arrival at Wynyard, Saskatchewan, a gelding which had travelled with the other horses in the main body of the car was found over the partition, and both it and the mare had died from suffocation. The appellant claimed from the respondent $227.98 for damages through non-delivery and loss of the two animals. The trial judge maintained the action, but the appellate court, by a majority, reversed that judgment.\nHeld, that, under the circumstances, the respondent railway should be relieved of any responsibility and, therefore, the appeal should be dismissed.\u2014If the appellant's attendant, while performing his duty as he was bound to do under the provisions of the Special Contract, had been there at the relevant time when the mare was found lying sick, it would have been his responsibility to \"care for\" and to \"attend it\", and he would have done what was necessary in the circumstances. As the attendant was not there, either the railway's or stock yard's employees had to \"care\" for the live stock, but, in erecting the gate partition, they should be treated as agents of the shipper for that purpose and not as agents of the carrier. Such employees may have been negligent in \"otherwise\" caring for the horses or the partition may be found to have been insufficient, but, in the events that happened, the real cause of the accident was the failure of the shipper to carry out his obligation.\nPer The Chief Justice and Taschereau J.:\u2014The shipper had the option of asking for a straight bill of lading whereby the shipment would have been at carrier's risk or for a special contract under which the shipment is made at owner's risk. In this case, the horses were carried at owner's risk according to the usual acceptation of the term and the carrier was relieved from liability for damages even resulting from its negligence or that of its employees, provided it was consistent with the terms and conditions of the Special Contract. No restriction is found in that contract limiting the \"owner's risk\" condition, and the respondent therefore should not be held responsible for the accident complained of by the appellant.\u2014Under article 1681 C.C. the provisions of article 1675 C.C. are superseded by the rules provided by the Railway Act.\u2014Canadian National Ry. v. Harris, reported ante p. 352.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing by a majority the judgment of the Superior Court, Duclos J. and dismissing the appellant's action for $277.98 damages. Leave to appeal to this Court was granted by the appellate court.\nJ. A. Mann K.C. and K. H. Brown for the appellant.\nL. G. Pr\u00e9vost K.C. and J. E. Paradis for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Taschereau J. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014In this case the appellant claimed $277.98 for damages suffered through non-delivery and loss of two horses out of a shipment of eighteen from three points in Saskatchewan to be delivered at Montreal.\nThe appellant alleged that the horses were shipped under a contract with the respondent, known as \"Live Stock Special Contract\" approved by the Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada; and that the respondent agreed to deliver the two horses in question at the point of destination.\nThe respondent denied being responsible under the terms of the contract and the Freight Classifications and Tariffs.\nNo issue is raised as to the quantum of damages. The action was maintained by the judgment of the Superior Court, Duclos J.; but that judgment was reversed by the Court of King's Bench (appeal side), Mr. Justice Franc\u0153ur dissenting.\nThe evidence discloses that when the horses were unloaded for feeding and watering at the Union Stockyards at Saskatoon, it was found that a bay mare was lying on the floor, bruised and unable to rise to its feet.\nA veterinary surgeon was called to examine the horse and, after examination, a gate partition (4 ft. 7 ins. high) was erected with the intention of separating the bay mare from the rest of the horses.\nOn arrival at Wynyard, Sask., a gelding which had travelled with the others in the main body of the car was found over the partition, and both it and the mare had died from suffocation.\nThe learned trial judge held that the burden was on the respondent to establish that the loss of the horses was in no way due to its fault, negligence or want of proper precaution and that it failed to do so; that the partition used was insufficient to properly separate the horses; that in virtue of the Live Stock Special Contract, the shipper consented only to limit the carrier's liability in case of loss to $200.00 per horse; and that, even if in erecting the partition the employees of the respondent acted as agents for the shipper, they were bound to execute such duty in a proper and safe manner and their failure to do so would bind the respondent company.\nAccording to the learned trial judge, the probable explanation of the accident was that the united weight of the sixteen other horses, pushing against the partition, might well have forced the gelding over it during shunting of the car or starting or stopping of the train, and that a higher partition would have prevented the accident.\nIn the Court of King's Bench, it was found inter alia that the partition used to separate the horses was standard equipment; that the respondent's employees in the handling of the car-load and the erection of the partition had acted \"en bons p\u00e8res de famille\" and that, moreover, in erecting the partition, the respondent's employees were acting as the agents of the appellant. In this Court, the substance of the appellant's argument was briefly that the responsibility of the respondent as a carrier, so far at least as the present case is concerned, is the agreed responsibility imposed by the Civil Code subject only to such modification thereof as may be expressly stated in the contract between the parties; and that, by force of article 1675 of the Civil Code, the respondent could only escape liability by proving affirmatively that the damage occurred by \"fortuitous event or irresistible force or * * * a defect in the thing itself\" or by one of the exculpatory causes set out in section 6 of the contract, which are similar in character; that the respondent has failed to prove that the cause fell within one of these exculpatory provisions; and that therefore, the appellant's action must succeed.\nI have already given out, in my reasons for judgment in the case of The Canadian National Railways v. Harris,[1] where judgment is to be rendered at the same time as the present one, my views on the question of the responsibility of a railway company towards the shipper under the Live Stock Special Contract; and, for that reason, I do not feel that I need repeat here, except in substance, an elaborate opinion in the matter.\nUnder article 1681 of the Civil Code,\nthe conveyance of persons and things by railway is subject to certain special rules provided in the Federal and Provincial Acts respecting railways.\nTo my mind, that means that article 1675 of the Civil Code is superseded in the present case by the rules provided in the Federal Act respecting railways.\nThe Live Stock Special Contract, in this case, is in standard form approved by the Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada, by Order No. 298, dated the 2nd day of June, 1920; and by force of section 348 of the Dominion Railway Act, the contract in question is valid; it is not only the agreement whereby the parties are bound, but, in a certain sense, it is really the law governing the relationship of all shippers and railway carriers to such an extent that it would not be open in the premises, for either the appellant or the respondent, to relieve themselves of the stipulations of such a contract. Moreover, under section 9 of the contract, the shipper acknowledged that he had the option of shipping his live stock at a higher rate of freight than that payable under the special contract, and according to the classifications and tariffs of the carrier, the effect of which the shipper understood, would be to remove the limitation on the amount of damages for which the carrier might be liable as thereunder provided,\nand the shipper had voluntarily elected to accept the limitation of liability therein contained, to enable him to obtain the reduced freight rate mentioned in the contract.\n(See the judgment of this Court in Ludditt v. Ginger Coote Airways Ltd.[2])\nThe special contract governing the parties starts by stating that it is made subject to the classifications and tariffs in effect on the date of its issue (except when inconsistent with the contract itself); and it follows that the live stock to be carried thereunder was subject to these classifications and tariffs.\nUnder these classifications and tariffs, we are dealing with a carload shipment; therefore, the rates and weights were at \"owner's risk\". I repeat that the shipper had the option of asking for a straight bill of lading whereby the shipment would have been made at carrier's risk and the special contract under which the shipment was made is at owner's risk.\nIn the present case, the horses were being carried at \"owner's risk\" according to the usual acceptation of the term, and the carrier was relieved from liability for damage even resulting from its negligence and that of its servants, provided it was consistent with the terms and conditions of the Live Stock Special Contract. (Refer to Rules and Conditions 2 and 3 at page 21 of the Tariff).\nIt follows that unless we find in the special contract a restriction limiting the owner's risk condition, the respondent in the present case cannot be held responsible for the accident complained of by the appellant.\nThe contract states that the respondent agreed to carry the carload of horses to its place of delivery at destination and that it was mutually agreed that every service to be performed thereunder should be subject to all the conditions therein mentioned.\nThis was accepted for himself by the shipper, the appellant herein.\nThe appellant agreed to load, unload, reload the live stock at his own risk;\nfeed, water and attend same at his own expense and risk while in transit, except as provided in sub-section 5,\nin the event of delay, which does not arise in the present case.\nSection 4 of the contract further stipulates that\nin case any of the employees of the carrier load, unload, reload, feed, water, or otherwise care for the said live stock, or assist in doing so, they will be treated as agents of the shipper for that purpose and not as agents of the carrier; except when such loading, unloading, reloading, feeding or watering is occasioned by some act or default of the carrier.\nUnder sub-section 3 of section 4 of the contract, the\nshipper agrees to properly and securely place all said stock in cars, and the carrier shall, except in cases where the shipper or some person on his behalf accompanies the live stock, keep said doors securely locked or fastened until placed for unloading.\nUnder sub-section 4,\nif temporary partitions or decks are put in the cars by the shipper, the carrier shall not be responsible for the sufficiency thereof or any loss or damage caused by defects therein.\nUnder section 6,\nthe carrier is not to be liable for loss or damage to any of the live stock caused by the act of God, the King's or public enemies, riots, strikes, defects or inherent vice in the live stock, heat, cold, the authority of law, quarantine, the act or default of the shipper, or causes beyond the carrier's control * * * and the burden of proving freedom from such negligence shall be on the carrier.\nIn the present instance, the shipper, or the appellant, did send a person to accompany and care for the shipment throughout the journey on his behalf. It is not clear at what exact point this person boarded the train. It would seem that he was not there when the horse was found lying in the car at Saskatoon.\nThe special partition appears to have been put up by the employees of the shipyards, and not those of the respondent at Saskatoon. At all events, it is not necessary to ascertain the exact situation in that respect, for it was the undeniable obligation of the appellant to accompany and care for the shipment throughout the journey, either by himself or by some person on his behalf. If the attendant was there when the horse was found lying sick, it was his responsibility to \"care for\" and to \"attend\" it at the shipper's \"risk while in transit\". If the attendant was not there, the employees of the respondent were to \"care\" for the live stock, but then they would be \"treated as agents of the shipper for that purpose and not as agents of the carrier\".\nAttending the live stock, caring for it, or \"properly and securely place\" it in the car would all be part of the obligations of the appellant under section 4, sub-sections 1 and 3, and under section 5 of the contract. And it is particularly stipulated in sub-section 4 of section 4, that\nif temporary partitions or decks are put in the cars by the shipper, the carrier shall not be responsible for the sufficiency thereof or for any loss or damage caused by defects therein.\nSo that whether the accident was caused through the lack of attendance or care of the live stock, or through the insufficiency of temporary partitions or decks, in either case it was caused by the failure of the shipper to carry on his obligations under the special contract.\nIt seems evident that when the horse was found sick in Saskatoon, it became the duty of the person who was to \"attend\" it or to \"care for\" it to do what was necessary in the circumstances. And when the partition was put up, it was for the purpose of protecting it and therefore included in the carrying out of the obligations to \"attend\" or to \"care for\".\nOn the other hand, if we limit the question to the fact of having erected a temporary partition in the car, that was also part of the obligations of the shipper \"to properly and securely place\" the stock in the cars; it was indeed, under sub-section 4 of section 4, a temporary partition put up by the shipper, since in doing so, the employees were to be \"treated as agents of the shipper for that purpose and not as agents of the carrier.\" In either case, what was done cannot be traced back to the responsibility of the respondent who, in such a case, (under sub-section 4),\nshall not be responsible for the sufficiency thereof or for any loss or damage caused by defects therein.\nNo partition was necessary for the other horses. It was put there only because the mare was sick in order to protect it; it was part of the care due to the mare and entirely part of the obligations of the shipper under the contract.\nIt was also the conclusion arrived at by St.-Jacques J. in the Court of King's Bench with whom Pr\u00e9vost J. and Stuart McDougall J. agreed, and with whom MacKinnon J., writing separately, agreed.\nI find myself fully in accord with these conclusions and for these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nKerwin J.:\u2014The Live Stock Special Contract upon which this action is based was in a form approved by the Board of Transport Commissioners under section 348 of the Railway Act. The contract states that there was\nReceived, subject to the classification and tariffs in effect on the date of issue of this original Live Stock Bill of Lading, except when inconsistent herewith.\na number of horses from different places in Saskatchewan for delivery to the appellant in Montreal. The particulars as to what occurred to a bay mare and a gelding appear elsewhere. Suffice it is to say that the action is brought to recover the agreed valuation of each animal, which action was contested by the respondent on several grounds.\nIn my view it is not necessary to consider more than one such ground. By section 5 of the Special Contract:\u2014\nIf the destination of the shipment of said live stock is more than one hundred and fifty (150) miles from the point of shipment, the shipper or some person on his behalf (not an employee of the carrier), must, unless special arrangements are otherwise made in writing, accompany and care for the shipment throughout the journey.\nIt is uncertain when any attendant joined the train. By sub-section 1, section 4:\u2014\nThe shipper agrees to load, unload or reload said live stock at his own expense and risk: feed, water and attend same at his own expense and risk while in transit, except as provided in sub-section (5) of this Section. In case any of the employees of the carrier load, unload, reload, feed, water or otherwise care for the said live stock, or assist in doing so, they will be treated as agents of the shipper for that purpose and not as the agents of the carrier, except when such loading, unloading, reloading, feeding or watering is occasioned by some act or default of the carrier.\nIt seems to me unquestionable that the appellant did not \"attend\" the horses at the relevant times and that in the events that happened, even if the employees of the respondent were negligent in \"otherwise\" caring for them, they must, under sub-section 1 of section 4 of the Special Contract, be treated as agents of the appellant. Therefore, assuming that the trial judge was right in finding such negligence, this sub-section serves to relieve the respondent from any liability. I say nothing as to the effect of anything in the classification and tariffs except to point out that, by the opening words of the Special Contract, nothing therein contained could apply where it was inconsistent with the terms of the Special Contract.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nHudson J.:\u2014The facts giving rise to this controversy are set forth in the judgment of my Lord the Chief Justice, which I have had an opportunity of reading.\nThe condition of the plaintiff's mare when the car arrived at Saskatoon was such as demanded the care and attention of those in charge. The occasion called for a decision as to what should be done. Neither the plaintiff nor any attendant representing him was there to act. As a consequence, after the mare had been examined by a veterinary, it was decided by the employees of the company and two employees, of the stock yard that a partition should be erected separating the mare from the other horses in the car and that she should then be allowed to proceed on the journey. A partition was erected and the car proceeded on the journey.\nThe only fault attributed to the defendant is that the partition was insufficient for the purpose and the subsequent death of the animal arose therefrom. The learned trial judge so found but a different view prevailed in the court of appeal. It appears from a perusal of the evidence that there were different opinions on the question of the sufficiency of this partition among men engaged in the shipping of live stock. It does appear, however, that none of them had known of a case where an injury had occurred under circumstances at all similar to those of the present case.\nThe contract of shipment provides:\n4. (1) The shipper agrees to load, unload or reload said live stock at his own expense and risk, feed, water and attend same at his own expense and risk while in transit, except as provided in sub-section 5 of this section. In case any of the employees of the carrier load, unload, reload feed, water or otherwise care for the said live stock or assist in doing so, they will be treated as agents of the shipper for the purpose, and not as the agents of the carrier, except when such loading, unloading, reloading, feeding or watering is occasioned by some act or default of the carrier.\n* * *\n(4) If temporary partitions or decks are put in the cars by the shipper, the carrier shall not be responsible for the sufficiency thereof, nor for any loss or damage caused by defects therein.\n5. If the destination of the shipment of said live stock is more than one hundred and fifty miles from the point of shipment, the shipper or some person on his behalf (not an employee of the carrier), must, unless special arrangements are otherwise made in writing, accompany and care for the shipment throughout the journey.\nIt appears that an attendant of the plaintiff was on the train but never gave any attention to the animal in question until after her death. Under these circumstances, I do not think that it lies in the mouth of the plaintiff to complain of any provision that was made for the care of his animal.\nIn my opinion, the employees of the defendant could not have been guilty of more than a lack of judgment and it is peculiarly a case for application of the provision that defendant's employees should be treated as the agents of the shipper himself. For this reason, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nKellock J.:\u2014Under the terms of section 5 of the Live Stock Special Contract here in question, the shipper, or some person on his behalf, was obliged to accompany and care for the horses throughout the journey. It is apparent from the evidence that although the Special Contract between the Railway Company and the attendant in charge was not signed, nonetheless an attendant did in fact accompany the shipment, although he did not board the train at Rutland, the original shipping point. After the train had left Wynyard, the attendant was found asleep in the car provided for shippers' attendants.\nAgain under the provisions of sub-section 1 of section 4, the obligation to load, unload and reload the horses, to feed, water and attend the same while in transit, was placed upon the appellant. In the attendant's contract there is the following provision:\nI agree to give the live stock included in this shipment all care and attention needed en route. If anything goes wrong in connection with the shipment, or if it needs any care or attention that requires the help or co-operation of the train crew, I will promptly notify the conductor in charge.\nAccordingly, when the horses arrived in Saskatoon, had the appellant's attendant performed his duty, he would have seen the condition of the horse which was there found to be down, and he would have been under obligation to take the proper steps to see that this horse was protected from the other animals for the remainder of the journey if its condition required this. When the stock yard employees put in the partition, which in their judgment was called for in the circumstances, I think they were acting as the appellant's agents in accordance with the provisions of the contract and the appellant, having failed in the obligation which lay upon him, cannot be heard to say that what was done was not done on his behalf. In my opinion the provisions of sub-section 4 of section 4 contemplate the very situation that arose. I think that the temporary partition was put in on behalf of the appellant and its insufficiency is not something for which the respondent is responsible.\nThe appellant's own witness, Arnold, gave the following evidence:\nQ.\u2014Have you ever shipped horses on the Canadian Pacific Railway?\nA.\u2014I ship them all the time.\nQ.\u2014Have you ever seen any other type of gate used than this one which is shown as exhibit D-3?\nA.\u2014No. Not provided by the CPU. But generally two gates are used or the gate is raised up. It is raised up two or three feet, and it is cleated. You put cleats on the side or you supplement it with a plank on top. Q.\u2014Have you ever done it yourself?\nA.\u2014Yes, often. Practically every week. Continually.\nQ.\u2014But it has not been done by railway employees?\nA.\u2014Well, sometimes it is, if we ask them to. It has been done.\nI think, therefore, that the loss complained of in this action was a loss for which the appellant himself was responsible.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Mann, Lafleur & Brown.\nSolicitor for the respondent: L.

These shares, being of the Royal Dutch Company, had been deposited with a bank named N. V. Commissie-en-Handelsbank, incorporated under the laws of Holland at Amsterdam; and they had been sent by that bank early in 1939 to Canada to be held for it by the Royal Bank of Canada. On May 10th, 1940, Holland was invaded by the German army; on the following day, by order-in-council, the Netherlands was declared proscribed territory and the above Regulations became applicable to it. Section 28 (1) deals with the reporting, to the Custodian, of enemy property in Canada by any person who holds or manages it. Section 44 (1) provides that \"the Custodian shall have power to charge against all property investigated, controlled or administered by him but which is subsequently released * * * an amount not exceeding two per centum of the value of all such property * * *\". On August 1st, 1940, the respondents claimed ownership and wanted to get possession of the shares, but the Custodian insisted on getting adequate proof of the respondents' claim and that they were not enemies. Later, the Custodian, on the basis of evidence adduced, agreed to release control over these shares, subject to the payment of a commission of two per cent. on their total value. The respondents contended that they were never enemies within the meaning of the Regulations, that the shares always belonged to them and were never subject to the Regulations and that the Custodian had no right to charge any commission against them. The President of the Exchequer Court of Canada agreed with the respondents' contentions and maintained their action. On appeal to this Court.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court below, that the respondents' property was within the time mentioned subject to both sections 28 (1) and 44 (1) of the Regulations and that, therefore, their action should be dismissed.\nHeld that the Custodian had power, under section 44 (1), to charge against the respondents' property \"investigated, controlled or administered by him but * * * subsequently released\" the amount of two per cent. of the value of such property. The language is precise to apply to the situation in this case: the property was held for an enemy; it became subject to the direction of the Custodian, and where other persons were claiming through that enemy, it must necessarily be investigated and either released or applied to the purposes contemplated by the Regulations.\nPer The Chief Justice and Kerwin, Rand and Estey JJ.:\u2014The Dutch bank was an enemy within the meaning of the Regulations and the property held by the Royal Bank of Canada was reportable to the Custodian under section 28. The residence of the bank on the 11th of May, 1940, must be deemed still to be in Amsterdam, in the absence of proof that, on the 10th, the central management and control and the seat of the bank's business had been transferred to a place outside of Holland. There was evidence that, early in 1939, the original books (duplicate remaining in Holland), securities and records had been sent to London, England, but there was still property in Amsterdam, including the premises occupied by the bank and some amount of cash; and to attribute sole residence to a corporation elsewhere than at the place of incorporation requires a more complete and collective migration of its faculties and activities.\nPer Hudson J.:\u2014The respondents' argument, that the securities, having been their property at all times, never did vest in the Custodian and as a consequence, the investigation was not done under the authority of the Regulations, is adversely answered by the fact that when Holland was occupied the securities were in Canada held here for a bank in Amsterdam which, by reason of the order-in-council of the 11th of May and the definition of \"enemy\" in the Regulations, became an enemy.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, declaring that certain bearer share warrants belonging to the respondents were never subject to the Consolidated Regulations Respecting Trading with the Enemy (1939) and that the Custodian of Enemy Property was not justified in levying any charge against the property under the provisions of section 44 (1) of the Regulations.\nD. L. McCarthy K.C. and W. G. C. Howland for the appellant.\nGustave Monette K.C. and Kenneth Archibald K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin, Rand and Estey JJ. was delivered by\nRand J:\u2014The question in these proceedings is whether or not certain property consisting of bearer share warrants, in part owned by the respondent, Baron de Rothschild, a citizen of France, (whose status and rights may be taken as representing those of the other respondents) has been at any time on or since the 2nd day of September, 1939 subject to the Consolidated Regulations Respecting Trading with the Enemy (1939).\nThe shares were of the Royal Dutch Company. The warrants had been deposited with a bank named N. V. Commissie-en-Handelsbank, incorporated under the laws of Holland at Amsterdam. By that bank they, with others, had been sent early in 1939 to Canada to be held for it by the Royal Bank of Canada at Montreal. An account was opened, and from time to time dividend coupons were sent to the Dutch Bank and service charges entered against cash remitted. Letters had been signed and given to the respondents as early as August, 1939, directing the Royal Bank to hold certain of the warrants for each, but these letters were retained until some time in July, 1940 when they were presented to the London branch of the Royal Bank and copies forwarded to Montreal. The respondent was unknown to the Canadian bank.\nOn May 10th, 1940 Holland was invaded by the German army. On the following day, by Order-in-Council P.C. 1936 the Netherlands was declared proscribed territory and the Regulations made applicable to it in these terms:\nWhereas the Secretary of State of Canada, with the concurrence of the Minister of Finance, reports that, in consequence of the invasion of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg by enemy forces, it is necessary and expedient, with the view of preventing any of the resources in Canada of residents of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg from falling under the control of the invading enemy or agents of the invading enemy, to place, temporarily, under protective custody all property, rights and interests in Canada of persons residing in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg and to regulate trading with such persons; and\nThat the most expedient measure which can be adopted to ensure such custody and regulation is to use the machinery of the Custodian's Office established under the Regulations respecting Trading with the Enemy (1939) and to confer on the Secretary of State the powers of regulation and control in respect to such property, rights and interests in Canada of persons residing in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg which are exercisable by him as Secretary of State and as Custodian under the Trading with the Enemy Regulations in respect to proscribed territory;\nNow, therefore His Excellency The Administrator In Council, on the recommendation of the Secretary of State of Canada, with the concurrence of the Minister of Finance, and under and by virtue of the War Measures Act (R.S.C. 1927, chapter 206) is pleased to order as follows:\nFrom and including the tenth day of May, 1940, the provisions of the Regulations respecting Trading with the Enemy (1939) are hereby extended to and deemed to apply to the territories of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg as proscribed territory;\nProvided that any transaction or act permitted by the Secretary of State of Canada, with the concurrence of the Minister of Finance, shall not be deemed to come within the provisions of this Order.\nSection 28 (1) of the Regulations deals with the reporting of enemy property in Canada, and is as follows:\u2014\nAny person who holds or manages any property for or on behalf of an enemy shall within thirty days after the commencement of the present war, or if the property comes into his possession or custody or under his control after the commencement of the present war, then within thirty days after the time when it comes into his possession or custody or under his control, by notice in writing communicate the fact to the Custodian, and shall furnish the Custodian with such particulars in relation thereto as the Custodian may prescribe and require and shall, on the Custodian's written request, deliver to him all documents or other evidence of title relating to such property. The word \"enemy\" is defined as:\u2014\n(ii) any person who resides or carries on business within territory of a State or Sovereign for the time being at war with His Majesty, or who resides or carries on business within territory occupied by a State or Sovereign for the time being at war with. His Majesty, and as well a person wherever resident or carrying on business who is an enemy or treated as an enemy and with whom dealing is for the time being prohibited by these Regulations or by statute or proclamation of His Majesty by and with the advice of His Majesty's Privy Council for Canada or by the common law.\nWhether or not Holland was on May 11th, 1940 a territory occupied by a State or Sovereign for the time being at war with His Majesty, it must, I think, be taken that that was the situation some time before July, 1940. From this it follows that the Regulations of their own force became applicable before the disclosure of ownership of the property to the Royal Bank in London. If P.C. 1936 modifies that application, then so far it controls. But its preamble seems to me simply to express in relation to the property of persons residing or doing business in proscribed territory what otherwise would be the effect of the Regulations; and I take the question then to be, what is that effect on the facts before us?\nWas the Dutch bank residing or carrying on business in Holland on May 11th, 1940? Its issued shares were owned solely by the respondent and his brothers. There was carried on a general banking as well as brokerage business, including the deposit and management of securities. Many months before, early in 1939, steps had been taken to meet the eventuality of invasion. Duplicate books had been set up and the originals sent to London, and new pages were sent over from week to week as transactions took place: these with securities were kept in a strong room. Instructions had been given to burn all records in Amsterdam on the outbreak of hostilities. On May 10th, powers of attorney to Polock and Jansen to sign on behalf of the bank were revoked and notice by cable given to correspondents in America and elsewhere. Of the members of the Managing Board and the Board of Directors, one, Geyer, had gone to London in 1939, another, Gans, managing director, to Paris in March, 1940, and Messrs. Van Straaten, managing director for Holland, and Esser, director, had remained in Amsterdam. We have no evidence of what took place in that city after the invasion, but under these officers holding some degree of managing powers there was a staff of nine or ten employees.\nNo doubt every effort was made to bring the active business of the bank in Holland to an end. I will assume that those efforts were successful and also the termination as between the bank and the respondent, of its agency in respect of the share warrants; but there remains the question of residence. That term is to be interpreted according to the law of this country. So long as a corporation continues with assets and organization, residence must be attributed to it; and in the absence of proof that on the 10th day of May the central management and control and the seat of the company's business had been transferred to a place outside of Holland, the residence of the bank on the 11th must, I think, be deemed still to be in Amsterdam. Such a transfer was, in fact, never intended; the cessation of business and the scattering of corporate authority were the objects of the steps taken. The preservation of records and property must continue, but there was property in Amsterdam, including the premises occupied by the bank and some amount of cash. To attribute sole residence to a corporation elsewhere than at the place of incorporation requires, in my opinion, a more complete and collective migration of its faculties and activities than that; and I cannot agree that a residence did not continue in Holland.\nThe bank was, therefore, an enemy within the meaning of the Regulations, and the property held by the Royal Bank of Canada was reportable to the Custodian under section 28.\nThere is next section 44, which is in these words:\u2014\n(1) The Custodian shall have power to charge against all property investigated, controlled or administered by him but which is subsequently released, in addition to any other charges authorized under these Regulations, an amount not exceeding two per centum of the value of all such property, including the income if any.\nIt is argued that the word \"investigated\" harks back to section 7.\n7. If the Secretary of State is satisfied that there is reasonable ground for suspecting that an offence under any of Regulations 2 to 5 inclusive has been or is about to be committed by any person he may, by written order, authorize a specified person to inspect all books or documents belonging to or under the control of the person named in the order, and to require any person able to give any information with respect to the business or trade of the suspected person, to give that information and if accompanied by a police officer to enter and search any premises used in connection with the business or trade and to seize any such books or documents as aforesaid.\nBut there what is investigated is a person suspected of an offence; here the investigation is of property. The language is precise to apply to the situation before us: the property was held for an enemy; it became subject to the direction of the Custodian; and where other persons were claiming through that enemy, it must necessarily be investigated and either released or applied to the purposes contemplated by the Regulations. Here it was found to belong to a citizen of France and its release is in order.\nAs we are not concerned with the quantum of charge made or to be made by the Custodian, the answer to the question submitted must be that the property was within the time mentioned subject to both sections 28 and 44 of the Regulations.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and dismiss the petition with costs in both Courts.\nHudson J.:\u2014The matter here in controversy is a claim by the Custodian of Enemy Property to a commission of two per cent. on the value of certain securities which were finally released by the Custodian to the respondents.\nThe claim was made under the authority of section 44 of the Consolidated Regulations respecting Trading with the Enemy which is as follows:\n44. (1) The Custodian shall have power to charge against all property investigated, controlled or administered by him but which is subsequently released, in addition to any other charges authorized under these Regulations, an amount not exceeding two per centum of the value of all such property, including the income if any.\n(2) The Custodian shall have power to retain out of the proceeds of all property vested in him under these Regulations sufficient moneys to pay the expenses incurred in the administration of such Regulations.\nThe facts giving rise to the controversy are fully stated in the judgment of the President in the court below.\nIt appears that early in 1939 a Netherlands bank known as N. V. Commissie-en-Handelsbank, and hereafter for convenience called \"Coha\", deposited with the Royal Bank of Canada in Montreal securities in the form of share warrants payable to bearer. There was nothing said or done at the time of such deposit to indicate any ownership or interest in such securities other than that of the bank itself.\nThese securities remained in the possession of the Royal Bank who collected and paid the income therefrom to, or to the order of, \"Coha\" until the Netherlands was occupied by German forces on the 10th of May 1940. Meanwhile, Canada had declared war on Germany and Regulations respecting Trading with the Enemy had been made by Order-in-Council under the authority of the War Measures Act. On the 11th of May 1940, these Regulations were made applicable to the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.\nNo question arises as to the validity of these Regulations but their application to the securities claimed by the plaintiffs is denied.\nThe purpose of the Trading with the Enemy Regulations was to supplement, strengthen and regulate the common law restraint on commercial dealings with alien enemies and the inhabitants of the enemy countries as well as to secure and control property in Canada belonging to enemies.\nBy the first section of the Regulations, clause (b), it is provided that:\n\"Enemy\" shall extend to and include\u2014\n* * *\n(ii) Any person who resides or carries on business within enemy territory or proscribed territory and, as well, a person wherever resident or carrying on business who is an enemy or treated as an enemy and with whom trading is, for the time being, prohibited by these Regulations or by statute or proclamation by His Majesty or by the common law.\n* * *\n(d) \"Enemy territory\" means any area which is under the sovereignty of, or in the occupation of, a State or Sovereign for the time being at war with His Majesty.\n(e) \"Proscribed territory\" means any area in respect of which the Governor in Council by reason of real or apprehended hostilities or otherwise, may order the protective custody of property of persons residing in that area and the regulating of trade with such persons.\n(h) \"Property\" as used in these Regulations shall extend to and include all real and personal property of every description, and all rights and interests therein, whether legal or equitable, and without restricting the generality of the foregoing, including securities, debts, credits, accounts and choses in action. Section 28 (1) reads as follows:\nAny person who holds or manages any property for or on behalf of an enemy shall within thirty days after the commencement of the present war, or if the property comes into his possession or custody or under his control after the commencement of the present war, then within thirty days after the time when it comes into his possession or custody or under his control, by notice in writing communicate the fact to the Custodian, and shall furnish the Custodian with such particulars in relation thereto as the Custodian may prescribe and require and shall, on the Custodian's written request, deliver to him all documents or other evidence of title relating to such property.\nBy the Order-in-Council of the 11th of May resources in Canada of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg were placed under protective custody and it was further provided:\nFrom and including the 10th May, 1940, the provisions of the Regulations respecting Trading with the Enemy, 1939, are hereby extended to and deemed to apply to the territories of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg as proscribed territory.\nOn the 31st of July, 1940, an order to the same effect was passed, extending the Regulations to French territory in Europe and Africa.\nThe Royal Bank did not formally notify the Custodian of the securities held by them in \"Coha\" until the 20th of August, when a return was made in Form B, as prescribed by section 28 of the Regulations. It showed that the securities were held for \"N. V. Commissie-en-Handelsbank, Amsterdam, Holland.\" But meanwhile, on or about the 31st of July, the manager of the Royal Bank had advised the Custodian that Baron and Baroness Edouard Rothschild claimed ownership and wished to get possession of the securities in question.\nThe Custodian then insisted on getting adequate proof of the claims of the plaintiffs and that they were not enemies.\nAfter a prolonged interchange of correspondence, verification of statements and many personal interviews the Custodian wrote a letter to the Royal Bank as follows:\nI have to advise you that on the basis of the evidence submitted the Custodian would not now appear to be interested in the shares of the Royal Dutch Company claimed by these parties. He is accordingly releasing control over them. However, since the shares become vested in the Custodian on the 10th of May, 1940, the date fixed in Order-in-Council No. 1936 proscribing the Netherlands, the release is subject to a commission of 2% on the total value of the assets released. The plaintiffs refused to pay the 2% claimed. Their position was fully stated in a memorandum submitted to the Custodian by their solicitor on the 13th of September, 1941, and summed up as follows:\nThe question at issue therefore is, whether the Custodian has a right, under the law, to investigate, control or administer the property of persons in general, and after proof of non-enemy status, to charge of percentage for doing so.\nThe scope of the regulations covers only enemies or persons dealing with the enemy. In order to prove who is an enemy or a person dealing with the enemy, it is naturally necessary to make an investigation. The general law permits this in all cases, but when a person is proved not to have merited suspicion, he resumes his place as an unsuspected person, and is in no case required to pay the cost of the investigation.\nThe Custodian replied to this memorandum stating that\nthe Custodian has not and does not now consider these applicants as having been enemies under The Consolidated Regulations respecting Trading with the Enemy.\nHe also stated:\nThe Custodian's claim to commission in this case is not based upon whether the property in question vested in him under section 21 of the Regulations, but upon the fact that on the 10th May, 1940, the property claimed was held in Canada for the account of a person whose address was in Holland.\n* * *\nIt is admitted by you and cannot be gainsaid that the property claimed was in the name of a bank in a country which was under the provisions of these Regulations \"proscribed territory\". Once these facts were brought to the attention of the Custodian by the Royal Bank of Canada, it was his obvious duty to place himself in control of that property as Custodian. Further, it is the Custodian's conclusion that the Regulations were established to cover such cases as the one now under discussion. The Royal Bank of Canada having reported the account to the Custodian, as it was bound to do, the Custodian was required under the Regulations to administer and control the property, and consequently, he is entitled to charge against this property when released by him, the commission already levied.\nTo sum up the Custodian's position, I would point out that it is not dependent in any sense upon the position of the applicants themselves under the Regulations, but entirely upon the status of the property under the Regulations on the 10th May, 1940.\nNo agreement having been reached the Custodian gave his consent to an action to decide this issue. The learned President who tried the case agreed with the plaintiff's contention and judgment was entered declaring that the property in dispute was never subject to the Consolidated Regulations respecting Trading with the Enemy 1939, and that the Custodian was not entitled to charge any amount against the said property. After much consideration, I have come to the conclusion that the Custodian has taken the right view. Section 44 (1) gives the Custodian a right to make a charge \"against all property investigated, controlled or administered by him.\" The fact that the property was investigated by him is not open to serious question.\nThe real argument on behalf of the plaintiffs is that, once it was established that the securities belonged to them at all relevant times, it must be held that such property never did vest in the Custodian and that, as a consequence, what was done in the interim was not done under the authority of the Regulations. This argument is answered, I think, by the fact that when Holland was occupied the securities were in Canada held here for a bank in Amsterdam which, by reason of the Order-in-Council of the 11th of May and the definition of \"enemy\" in the Regulations, became an enemy.\nUnder section 21 (1) and (2) of the Regulations it is provided:\n21. (1) All property in Canada belonging to enemies at or subsequent to the commencement of the present war, and whether or not such property has been disclosed to the Custodian as required by these Regulations, is hereby vested in and subject to the control of the Custodian.\n(2) This regulation shall be a vesting order and shall confer upon the Custodian all the rights of such enemies, including the power of dealing with such property in such manner, as he may in his sole discretion decide.\nBy reason of this section nobody could effectually deal with the property without the authority of the Custodian. When, as here, a claim was made by a third person, the onus was on such person to prove his title under section 58 (1):\n58. (1) The onus of proof in every instance shall rest upon the person who asserts that he or any property claimed or held by him is not within the provisions of these Regulations.\nThis, of course, was recognized by the Royal Bank. As a consequence, the plaintiffs themselves applied to the Custodian for a release and he rightly insisted on proof of their title beyond their mere assertion of ownership. This proof was furnished only after many inquiries and much delay. It may be that there was not such a complete vesting as would entitle the Custodian, after notice of plaintiffs' claim, to deal with the property without getting an order from the Exchequer Court of Canada under section 25 which reads as follows:\n25. (1) The Exchequer Court of Canada or any judge thereof, on the application of the Custodian, or any one acting on his behalf, may by order vest in the Custodian any property suspected of belonging to or of being held or managed for or on behalf of an enemy, and may by such order confer on the Custodian such powers of dealing with the property vested as to the court or judge may seem proper.\n(2) It shall not be necessary to give any notices of such application to the suspected enemy unless notice or notices shall be ordered by the court or judge before whom the application is made.\nBut here there was no immediate need to deal with the securities. They were held by the Royal Bank and could be left there with assurance of safety until the claim of the plaintiff could be investigated and determined. The primary object of section 25 is to give the Custodian an opportunity to prevent disposal of property which may be so placed as to create a risk of its transfer or loss.\nSection 27 under which the present action is taken was always available to the plaintiffs but they did not seek to take advantage of it until after the investigation had been carried on, and had an acknowledgment from the Custodian of their ownership of the property. It seems to me that the securities here fell well within the ambit of the Regulations and that the investigation made by the Custodian was such an investigation as falls within section 44 (1). It will be noted that section 44 (1) does not deal exclusively with the property vested in the Custodian as is mentioned in subsection 2.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the Custodian is entitled to charge such fee as he deems proper within the limits prescribed by section 44 and would allow the appeal and dismiss the action with costs here and below.\nAppeal allowed and petition dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: D. L. McCarthy.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Archibald & Cain.\n",

VI (Dom.), c. 28, s. 1.\nDuring the evening of October 10, 1942, a detachment of soldiers belonging to a Canadian regiment carried on military exercises on the course of the old Kent Golf Club, near the city of Quebec. During these manoeuvres some seventy five thunderflashes were used. On October 31st one unexploded thunderflash was found on the adjoining farm of one Giroux by two boys who had been looking for golf balls, one of them being Marcel, minor son of the respondent Dubeau. The boys opened the thunderflash and extracted bits of powder from it, which they ignited with matches and caused small explosions. Marcel took home with him the thunderflash containing the remaining of the powder. On the same evening, these two boys, with several others including Gaston, minor son of the other respondent Laperri\u00e8re, gathered on the street. After burning a small bit of the powder on the sidewalk, Gaston and the other boy who had found the explosive decided to ignite the remainder of the powder in the thunderflash all at once. After two attempts had been made with no result, Gaston and Marcel, respectively 11 and 12 years of age, thinking that the explosive had not been properly lighted, were about to pick it up, when it exploded causing severe injuries to the two boys. The respondents, in their qualities of tutors to their minor sons, by petitions of right, claimed damages from the Crown, alleging its liability for the negligence of its officers or servants in the exercise of their duties or employment. The Crown contended that there was nothing in the case which was of a nature to involve its liability, that the military exercises had taken place on private properties, that young Dubeau was illegally on such lands when he found the explosive and that there had been no negligence on the part of any of its officers or servants while acting within the scope of their duties or employment. The Exchequer Court of Canada maintained the respondents' petitions of right, fixed the amount of the damages to a sum of about $15,371.00 in each case and then reduced such amount by one third on the ground that the two boys were at fault to that extent. The Crown appealed to this Court, and the suppliants cross-appealed, claiming that the Crown should be held liable for the full amount of the damages.\nHeld, affirming the judgments of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1945] Ex. C.R. 53), The Chief Justice dissenting, that the appeals by the Crown should be dismissed and that the petitions of right of the respondents be maintained for the amount of damages awarded by that Court.\nHeld also that the cross-appeals by the respondents should be dismissed.\u2014Rand J., dissenting, was of the opinion that the full amount of the damages should be granted.\nPer The Chief Justice (dissenting)\u2014A child, who is of sufficient age (at least over 7 years) and who also possesses requisite intellectual capacity and rational judgment, is legally liable to account for his acts: such doctrine is adopted by noted French authors and by a jurisprudence derived from many decisions rendered by the Quebec courts. Thus, when a child is found to be guilty of contributory negligence, he is evidently guilty of negligence and answerable for the full liability attached to his illegal act, unless there is evidence that another person has contributed with him to cause the damages: he is solely responsible, being the causa causans. In the present case, the military men cannot be charged with gross negligence for having willingly and knowingly left on the ground a dangerous explosive, as, upon the evidence, they were ignorant of the fact that a thunderflash had remained unexploded. Assuming that, because the military men did not ascertain before leaving that no thunderflash was left unexploded, it would constitute negligence on their part, there is no evidence that they were aware, or should have been aware, that children would enter the ground after the man\u0153uvres had taken place; on the contrary, the evidence shows that there could not be such possibility Moreover, in view of the opinion expressed by the trial judge that the two boys possessed sufficient intelligence to have foreseen the possible consequences of their acts, they should be treated the same as if they had been adults; and the Crown would not have been held liable if adults had committed these acts. On the whole, the minor sons of the respondents have conducted themselves with the full knowledge of the possible consequences of their acts and they have suffered injury through their own want of prudence. In any event, there has been, from the time the explosive has been found to the time when the accident occurred, a sequence of intervening events which makes of the alleged negligence of the military men a most remote cause (causa sine qua non) of the accident and of the damages resulting from it, but not a causa causans. Per Kerwin J.:\u2014On the facts of the case, there was negligence on the part of the officers in charge of the military exercises, their acting within the scope of their duties or employment, in leaving, without making a search, the unexploded thunderflash, a dangerous article, on Giroux's farm, where the two boys on the day in question went with at least the implied permission of the owner. Under all circumstances, steps should have been taken to see that all the thunderflashes used had been exploded; and, in the absence of such steps, it should have been anticipated that an unexploded one would be found by children on Giroux's farm and that such children might so play with it as to cause injuries to themselves. While the two boys were normal and intelligent enough to understand to a certain extent the imprudence of their acts, they were, nevertheless, of such an age as not fully to comprehend the dangerousness of their actions: such was the finding of the trial judge and it should not be disturbed.\nPer Hudson and Estey JJ.:\u2014The Crown appellant has failed to prove that after the manoeuvres all the thunderflashes were accounted for and had, in fact, exploded. Notwithstanding that no permission had been obtained to use Giroux's land in any way, and in spite of the fact that these thunderflashes were thrown from a point adjoining it and in its direction, no effort was made to see that these thunderflashes did not reach it, nor to warn Giroux of the possibility that some of them might have reached his farm, upon which the boys who found the explosive were not trespassers. Under the circumstances, these facts constituted negligence. The conduct of the two boys, having regard to their capacity, knowledge and experience, constituted also negligence, but that the boys were negligent, however, does not necessarily relieve the first party negligent of liability. Nevertheless, in spite of their partial knowledge of the possibility of injury with which they were confronted, they cannot be entirely excused because in part their negligent conduct has contributed to their own injuries.\nPer Rand J. (dissenting on the cross-appeal):\u2014A highly dangerous explosive has been unlawfully placed and left on land where two boys who shortly thereafter found it had permission to be. The high degree of care required of those who control such articles means the anticipation of a greater range of probable mischief and, in this case, reaching to the children injured. The natural consequences of that initial culpa extend then to the injuries suffered unless it can be said that at some point a new and independent actor has intervened. The intervening act in this case, if an adult had been concerned rather than a boy of 12, would be held to be new and independent; it was not a situation in which contributory negligence could operate; it would have been an intermeddling by a responsible person with what he would know could be dangerous. There are degrees of liability for consequences between two or more participants in a negligent cause, but there is no binding authority which attributes fractional liability or deprivation of right to an infant in proportion to his appreciation of a particular situation; in relation to a specific act, he must be either responsible or not responsible, there is no halfway culpability and these boys of 11 and 12 cannot be held to conduct that in the circumstances would have avoided the results which happened. The act of both boys, moving to pick up the explosive after the fuse had been lighted, not only negatives intelligence and general capacity which would have placed them in an older age or adult category, but demonstrates their inadequate appreciation of the danger they were courting. Their conduct then was normal, likely and, just as prudent behaviour in an adult, innocent: that excludes any qualification or limitation of the right to recover full damages from the Crown.\nThe Crown contended that its liability under section 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act is confined to cases where the injuries to person or property are exclusively \"resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown\", i.e. that there is no right of action against the Crown in a case of contributory negligence on the part of the Crown and the subject.\nHeld, per Kerwin, Hudson and Estey JJ. that the Crown's contention is not well founded when the cause of action arose in the province of Quebec. The Chief Justice and Rand J. expressing no opinion.\nPer The Chief Justice:\u2014There is no necessity to decide such question in view of the conclusion arrived at, that the Crown was in no way liable for the accident.\nPer Kerwin J.:\u2014In cases between subject and subject in Quebec, damages must be mitigated in the case of common fault. This being the general law in that province, it is the law to be applied to the Crown under section 19 (c): it has been so settled by decisions in this Court.\nPer Hudson and Estey JJ.:\u2014In many decisions of this Court as well as of the Exchequer Court of Canada, where action was brought under section 19 (c) and the cause of action arose in Quebec, damages were apportioned between the Crown and the subject, when the negligence on the part of servants of the Crown contributed to the loss, thus indicating a long accepted construction of that section.\nPer Rand J.:\u2014It is unnecessary to consider this ground of appeal, in view of the opinion above reported.\u2014Semble that there is nothing whatever anomalous in the view that what Parliament intended in creating liability of the Crown was to adopt the law then existing in each province, except as it might thereafter be amended or changed by Parliament, but that in any event the interpretation placed on section (19 (c) since its enactment has established a jurisprudence which would now be too late to modify.\nAPPEALS by the Crown and CROSS-APPEALS by the suppliants from the judgments of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Angers J.[1], maintaining the suppliants' claims made by way of petitions of right, for damages amounting to about $15,371.00 in each case and then reducing such amount by one third owing to the suppliants' minor sons being at fault to that extent.\u2014The Crown appealed to this court, praying for the dismissal of the petitions of right, and the suppliants cross-appealed, claiming that the Crown should be held liable for the total amount of damages found by the trial judge.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and Gerard Lacroix K.C. for the appellant.\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dorion K.C. and Camil No\u00ebl for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting): Ces deux causes nous viennent par voie d'appel de la Cour d'Echiquier du Canada qui a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 Dubeau une somme de $10,247.23 pour dommages, \u00e9tant les deux tiers d'une r\u00e9clamation de $15,370.84, (la diff\u00e9rence repr\u00e9sentant la somme que cette Cour a cru devoir retrancher parce qu'elle est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la conclusion que Dubeau s'\u00e9tait rendu lui-m\u00eame coupable de n\u00e9gligence contributoire), et accordant \u00e0 Laperri\u00e8re $10,248.39, \u00e9tant les deux tiers de sa r\u00e9clamation de $15,372.59, la diff\u00e9rence ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 retranch\u00e9e pour la m\u00eame raison que celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e dans le cas de Dubeau.\nLes deux causes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendues ensemble, sur la m\u00eame preuve, et nous pouvons en disposer pour des raisons \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s identiques. La nature des faits est tr\u00e8s importante pour la d\u00e9cision que nous avons \u00e0 rendre.\nLe ou vers le 10 octobre 1942, un d\u00e9tachement de militaires de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, sous les ordres du Ministre de la D\u00e9fense Nationale, s'est rendu sur un terrain appartenant \u00e0 la compagnie Quebec Power, situ\u00e9 dans la ville de Courville, et de l\u00e0 sur un autre terrain appartenant \u00e0 Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Giroux, cultivateur du m\u00eame endroit.\nLes militaires y firent des exercices dans le but de se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 un raid simul\u00e9 qui devait avoir lieu \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec quelques jours plus tard et qui, de fait, eut lieu apr\u00e8s ces exercices.\nAu cours de ces man\u0153uvres, le d\u00e9tachement s'\u00e9tait servi d'explosifs et il aurait apparemment lanc\u00e9 sur le terrain de Giroux un explosif commun\u00e9ment appel\u00e9 \"thunderflash\".\nLe samedi, 31 octobre, le fils du p\u00e9titionnaire, \u00e2g\u00e9 de 12 ans et accompagn\u00e9 d'un autre gar\u00e7on du m\u00eame \u00e2ge, trouva ce \"thunderflash\" en jouant sur le terrain de Giroux, et il s'amusa \u00e0 en retirer de la poudre en petites quantit\u00e9s et \u00e0 y mettre le feu. Cela produisit une explosion minime au cours de laquelle son compagnon se br\u00fbla le pouce.\nTous deux eurent alors l'id\u00e9e d'apporter le \"thunderflash\" au village de Courville et, le soir du m\u00eame jour, accompagn\u00e9s d'autres gar\u00e7ons du m\u00eame \u00e2ge, parmi lesquels se trouvait cette fois le fils du p\u00e9titionnaire Laperri\u00e8re, ils commenc\u00e8rent \u00e0 s'adonner au m\u00eame jeu apr\u00e8s avoir de nouveau retir\u00e9 du \"thunderflash\" une petite quantit\u00e9 de poudre; puis ils d\u00e9cid\u00e8rent de mettre le feu au \"thunderflash\" lui-m\u00eame afin de produire ce qu'ils ont appel\u00e9 un feu d'artifice.\nLe \"thunderflash\" ne s'alluma pas imm\u00e9diatement; ils crurent que le feu s'\u00e9tait \u00e9teint et alors le jeune Dubeau et le jeune Laperri\u00e8re voulurent prendre le \"thunderflash\" dans leurs mains dans le but d'en rallumer le feu lorsqu'une explosion violente se produisit, enlevant au jeune Dubeau et au jeune Laperri\u00e8re une partie de leur main droite, ce qui n\u00e9cessita plus tard, pour chacun d'eux, l'amputation compl\u00e8te de la main droite.\nLes deux p\u00e9titionnaires sont respectivement les p\u00e8res de ces deux jeunes gens et, par voie de p\u00e9tition de droit, ils r\u00e9clam\u00e8rent de la Couronne les sommes ci-haut mentionn\u00e9es, en all\u00e9guant que l'accident \u00e9tait d\u00fb \u00e0 la n\u00e9gligence, \u00e0 l'incurie et \u00e0 la faute des militaires qui, dans les circonstances, agissaient sous les ordres de Sa Majest\u00e9 le Roi par l'interm\u00e9diaire de son Ministre de la D\u00e9fense Nationale.\nLe Procureur-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, au nom de Sa Majest\u00e9, plaida que les exercices des militaires avaient eu lieu sur des terrains priv\u00e9s, que le jeune Dubeau, au moment o\u00f9 il trouva l'explosif, \u00e9tait ill\u00e9galement sur ce terrain, que d'ailleurs il n'y avait eu aucune n\u00e9gligence de la part ou des officiers en charge des exercices ou des militaires eux-m\u00eames, et que rien de ce qui s'\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 n'engageait la responsabilit\u00e9 de la Couronne.\nL'honorable juge de premi\u00e8re instance a appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 la preuve de la fa\u00e7on suivante:\nIl a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis que le \"thunderflash\" trouv\u00e9 sur le terrain de Giroux avait \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9 l\u00e0, non explos\u00e9, par les militaires; que tout s'\u00e9tait bien pass\u00e9 ainsi qu'il est rapport\u00e9 plus haut quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont l'accident s'\u00e9tait produit; que le jeune Dubeau, lorsqu'il trouva l'explosif, traversait la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Giroux qui est voisine d'un terrain de golf, pour chercher des balles de golf; que cependant le terrain de golf \u00e9tait hors d'usage depuis trois ou quatre ans; et, de l'aveu du jeune Dubeau, en passant sur le terrain de Giroux, il se trouvait sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 d'un \u00e9tranger, o\u00f9 personne ne lui avait donn\u00e9 la permission de passer bien que c'\u00e9tait son habitude de passer sur cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour se rendre au golf.\nQuant \u00e0 Laperri\u00e8re, il n'a vu l'explosif pour la premi\u00e8re fois qu'apr\u00e8s le souper lorsque les jeunes gar\u00e7ons se r\u00e9unirent et qu'ils d\u00e9cid\u00e8rent, au lieu de se contenter de faire br\u00fbler un peu du contenu de l'explosif, de le br\u00fbler tout ensemble pour produire ce qu'ils appel\u00e8rent un feu d'artifice.\nLe jeune Laperri\u00e8re, au cours de l'appel au proc\u00e8s, a admis qu'il savait que, quand on met le feu \u00e0 la poudre, cela explose et \"c'est dangereux\".\nTous deux avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 jou\u00e9 avec des p\u00e9tards ordinaires, mais ils ont avou\u00e9 que l'explosif en question n'\u00e9tait pas un p\u00e9tard comme ils avaient l'habitude d'en voir.\nLe jeune Dubeau, au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, d\u00e9clara d'abord qu'au souper il avait inform\u00e9 son p\u00e8re de sa d\u00e9couverte et que ce dernier lui avait dit de ne pas jouer avec l'explosif qu'il avait trouv\u00e9 parce que c'\u00e9tait dangereux.\nSon p\u00e8re et sa m\u00e8re lui auraient alors \"d\u00e9fendu de jouer avec \u00e7a;\" ils lui ont dit que c'\u00e9tait dangereux et \"malgr\u00e9 cela il a jou\u00e9 avec\". Il avoua que pour produire un feu d'artifice il lui fallait faire quelque chose que son p\u00e8re lui avait recommand\u00e9 de ne pas faire, en lui disant que c'\u00e9tait dangereux.\nMais plus tard, dans sa d\u00e9position, il se contredit d'une fa\u00e7on flagrante et affirma qu'il n'en avait parl\u00e9 ni \u00e0 son p\u00e8re ni \u00e0 sa m\u00e8re.\nComme cette derni\u00e8re affirmation du jeune Dubeau est corrobor\u00e9e par son p\u00e8re et par sa m\u00e8re, l'honorable juge de premi\u00e8re instance a cru devoir l'accepter.\nGiroux, le propri\u00e9taire du terrain, fut entendu comme t\u00e9moin et d\u00e9clara que le jeune Dubeau avait pass\u00e9 une partie de l'\u00e9t\u00e9 chez-lui \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque des foins; \u00e9galement que Dubeau et d'autres petits compagnons venaient jouer au golf, surtout \u00e0 l'automne, tant sur le terrain de golf que sur son propre terrain, et il ajouta qu'il ne les emp\u00eachait pas parce qu'il \"n'y avait pas grand tort \u00e0 faire\".\nD'autre part, les officiers et les militaires qui ont rendu t\u00e9moignage ont affirm\u00e9 que\nen autant qu'ils savaient, le public n'avait pas acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'endroit o\u00f9 les man\u0153uvres se faisaient, et qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 leur connaissance que ces man\u0153uvres s'\u00e9taient faites sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Giroux.\nOn aurait employ\u00e9 au cours de ces man\u0153uvres 75 \"thunderflashes\" contenus dans une bo\u00eete, et les instructions \u00e9taient d'\u00eatre prudents dans la distribution de ces explosifs et la fa\u00e7on de les allumer, vu qu'il \u00e9tait admis qu'ils \u00e9taient dangereux; mais, d'apr\u00e8s les affirmations des militaires, ces instructions avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 suivies.\nPersonne n'a eu connaissance qu'un explosif aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9 sans qu'il e\u00fbt subs\u00e9quemment explos\u00e9.\nLe constable en chef de la compagnie Quebec Power, en septembre et octobre 1942, s'occupait des terrains du club de golf Kent et du \"power house\", et il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que durant l'\u00e9t\u00e9 et l'automne de 1942 les terrains \u00e9taient ferm\u00e9s et que seules l\u00e9s personnes ayant un permis avaient le droit d'y aller.\nIl a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il a lui-m\u00eame renvoy\u00e9 des gens qui \u00e9taient venus sur le terrain sans permis et qu'il avait donn\u00e9 ordre \u00e0 ses hommes d'en faire autant.\nL'honorable juge de premi\u00e8re instance a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis qu'il \u00e9tait possible que le \"thunderflash\" en question ait \u00e9t\u00e9 lanc\u00e9 du terrain de golf sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Giroux. Il a cru qu'il n'y avait pas d'autre conclusion \u00e0 tirer du fait que l'explosif avait \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9 sur cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nDe l\u00e0 il a conclu que le fait d'avoir laiss\u00e9 dans un champ utilis\u00e9 pour des man\u0153uvres militaires un explosif constitue une n\u00e9gligence de la part des officiers qui avaient la direction de ces man\u0153uvres; que des officiers prudents auraient d\u00fb faire ou faire faire des recherches sur le terrain des man\u0153uvres pour v\u00e9rifier s'il y restait des explosifs non explos\u00e9s; or, comme rien de tout cela n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, d'apr\u00e8s le juge, ces omissions de la part des officiers et du quartier-ma\u00eetre, tous serviteurs de la Couronne aux termes de l'article 50A de la Loi de la Cour d'Echiquier du Canada, entra\u00eenent, \u00e0 son avis, la responsabilit\u00e9 de la Couronne. Mais, par ailleurs, le juge de premi\u00e8re instance fut d'avis que le jeune Dubeau et le jeune Laperri\u00e8re avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 chacun d'eux partiellement responsables de l'accident.\nIl dit de Dubeau:\nC'est un enfant intelligent qui savait que la poudre est une mati\u00e8re inflammable, explosive et dangereuse, qui \u00e9tait au courant du fait que Guy Bouchard s'\u00e9tait br\u00fbl\u00e9 un doigt en en faisant br\u00fbler une petite quantit\u00e9 provenant du \"thunderflash\" et qui, d\u00e9sireux de faire un feu d'artifice, a, avec son ami Gaston Laperri\u00e8re, d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de mettre le feu \u00e0 ce qui restait du \"thunderflash\" et de le faire \u00e9clater.\nIl cite Savatier dans son Trait\u00e9 de la Responsabilit\u00e9 Civile, et H. et L. Mazeau dans leur Trait\u00e9 Th\u00e9orique et Pratique de la Responsabilit\u00e9 Civile, D\u00e9lictuelle et Contractuelle.\nC'est d'ailleurs l'essence de la doctrine\nque les tribunaux ont \u00e0 rechercher si l'enfant avait l'intelligence assez d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e pour comprendre, sinon la malice, au moins l'imprudence de son acte. (Savatier, tome 1er, n\u00b0 199); (Mazeaud, tome 2, n\u00b0 1468 et la note sous ce paragraphe.)\nIl cite \u00e9galement Sourdat, Trait\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Responsabilit\u00e9, (tome 1, n\u00b0 17); Demolombe, Cours de Droit Civil, (tome 31, nos 494 et 495); Baudry-Lacantinerie et Barde, Trait\u00e9 de Droit Civil, (tome 15, n\u00b0 2864); Planiol et Ripert, Trait\u00e9 Pratique de Droit Civil, (tome 6, n\u00b0 497).\nTous ces auteurs sont d'avis que\nle mineur, nonobstant son \u00e2ge, est p\u00e9cuniairement responsable s'il a pu se rendre compte de la port\u00e9e de son acte.\nEn ce sens, ces auteurs adoptent la doctrine de Pothier qui, dans son Trait\u00e9 des Obligations, n\u00b0 118, al. 3, \u00e9dit. Dupin, 1, p. 63, \u00e9crivait:\nOn ne peut pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment d\u00e9finir l'\u00e2ge auquel les hommes ont l'usage de la raison, et sont, par cons\u00e9quent, capables de malignit\u00e9, les uns l'ayant plus t\u00f4t que les autres; cela doit s'estimer par les circonstances.\nL'honorable juge passa ensuite \u00e0 la jurisprudence de la province de Qu\u00e9bec et il r\u00e9f\u00e9ra \u00e0 la cause de Rowland v. La Corporation de la paroisse de Rawdon et autres[2].\nEn toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, cette cause fait bien voir la distinction qui existe avec celle qui nous est soumise.\nDans la cause de Rowland2, la corporation d\u00e9fenderesse avait entrepris la r\u00e9fection d'un chemin et, dans ce but, employait de la dynamite. Le contracteur proc\u00e9dait de cette fa\u00e7on \u00e0 trois ou quatre endroits simultan\u00e9ment. Pendant cette op\u00e9ration personne n'avertissait le public ni ne l'emp\u00eachait de circuler, personne n'\u00e9tait charg\u00e9 de surveiller les d\u00e9tonateurs et le public circulait librement.\nLe jeune Rowland trouva le bout d'une m\u00e8che, la prit, la mit dans sa poche, l'en sortit \u00e0 plusieurs reprises m\u00eame devant son p\u00e8re, l'apporta chez lui, tenta de l'allumer avec une allumette mais sans succ\u00e8s, alla alors ensuite derri\u00e8re la maison, l'alluma avec un feu de papier croyant que cela ferait l'effet d'une pi\u00e8ce pyrotechnique. L'explosion se produisit et lui causa des blessures aux mains et \u00e0 l'\u0153il.\nLa d\u00e9cision de la Cour fut que le contracteur, pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de la corporation d\u00e9fenderesse, aurait d\u00fb savoir qu'il \u00e9tait dangereux de laisser sans surveillance des explosifs \u00e0 un endroit o\u00f9 le public et surtout des enfants circulaient librement.\nLa n\u00e9gligence attribu\u00e9e au contracteur, et, par son interm\u00e9diaire, \u00e0 la corporation d\u00e9fenderesse, fut d\u00e9clar\u00e9e une faute r\u00e9sultant d'avoir permis au public de circuler sans l'avertir du danger.\nUne autre cause cit\u00e9e par l'honorable juge de premi\u00e8re instance, Cutnam v. L\u00e9veill\u00e9[3], est susceptible de la m\u00eame distinction car la faute sur laquelle s'appuie cet arr\u00eat est que le d\u00e9fendeur qui avait la garde d'explosifs, n\u00e9gligea \"de les tenir hors d'atteinte de personnes \u00e9trang\u00e8res et irresponsables\".\nL'honorable juge Archambault y r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e9galement \u00e0 la cause de Plante v. La Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, (portant le num\u00e9ro 75, 238 des dossiers de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure de Montr\u00e9al, lequel n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rapport\u00e9) qui est le cas d'op\u00e9rations de minage faites par la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, o\u00f9 l'enfant avait ramass\u00e9 un d\u00e9tonateur \u00e0 l'endroit des travaux et\nit has been shown that the spot where they were found is a public place, opened to pedestrians and where children are accustomed to play without hindrance.\nEncore, Makins v. Piggott & Inglis[4] couvre le cas d'un b\u00e2ton de dynamite trouv\u00e9 par un enfant de quinze ans qui l'avait ramass\u00e9 et fait \u00e9clater en le frottant.\nLe propri\u00e9taire du b\u00e2ton de dynamite fut trouv\u00e9 responsable; mais il s'agissait d'un proc\u00e8s par jury o\u00f9, par cons\u00e9quent, les jur\u00e9s \u00e9taient ma\u00eetres des faits, et la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada, en accordant jugement aux demandeurs, jugea que, en ce qui concernait l'enfant,\nif his negligence contributed to the accident, the jury should have so found; and that whether or not he was a trespasser, was also a question for the jury, who did not pass upon it.\nDans la cause de Lambert v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[5], un enfant de huit ans fut trouv\u00e9 coupable de n\u00e9gligence contributoire. Dans la cause de Morin v. Lacasse[6], le p\u00e8re d'un enfant de sept ans fut trouv\u00e9 coupable de faute commune pour \"n'avoir pas exerc\u00e9 une surveillance convenable sur cet enfant\".\nDans Burke v. Provencher[7], un enfant de huit ans fut trouv\u00e9 en faute\nlorsqu'il traversa une rue en faisant irruption derri\u00e8re un tramway sans s'assurer qu'il pouvait le faire sans danger.\nDans la cause de Desroches v. St-Jean[8], la Cour du Banc du Roi (en appel) a jug\u00e9 que\nquoiqu'on ne puisse attendre d'un enfant de neuf ans le discernement et la prudence d'un adulte, au. cas de faute de sa part, il sera responsable de l'accident dont il est victime mais dans une proportion moindre que celle d'un adulte.\nDans Normand v. The Hull Electric Company[9], o\u00f9 il s'agissait d'un accident survenu au fils du demandeur, \u00e2g\u00e9 de dix ans et demi, r\u00e9sultant du fait qu'il avait voulu monter sur un tramway en mouvement, la Cour de R\u00e9vision modifia le jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et diminua le montant des dommages accord\u00e9 par cette derni\u00e8re Cour \"vu son opinion qu'il y avait eu n\u00e9gligence de la part de l'enfant du demandeur\".\nDans Figiel v. Hoolahan et al[10], un enfant de dix ans avait \u00e9t\u00e9 bless\u00e9 par une automobile en traversant une ruelle \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re de la r\u00e9sidence de ses parents. Il fut jug\u00e9:\nThere was fault on the part of the victim of the accident in that he stepped from the vacant lot into a paved lane practically in front of the automobile, without looking to his left to see whether any traffic was coming, and as he was ten years old, he had obtained a sufficient degree of intelligence so that he could have some appreciation of the danger to which he was exposing himself. De m\u00eame encore dans la cause de Marquis v. Pr\u00e9vost[11] o\u00f9 un enfant de neuf ans s'\u00e9tait engag\u00e9 \u00e0 la course dans l'intersection de deux ruelles, sans se soucier de la circulation; et aussi dans la cause de L\u00e9gar\u00e9 v. Quebec Power Company[12], o\u00f9 un enfant de treize ans bless\u00e9 par un courant \u00e9lectrique provenant de fils appartenant \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse, rompus et tomb\u00e9s sur la voie publique et que l'enfant a touch\u00e9s, bien qu'il e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 conseill\u00e9 de ne pas le faire, il fut d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il y avait faute commune et 75% de la responsabilit\u00e9 fut imput\u00e9 \u00e0 l'enfant.\nDans la cause de Lauzon v. Lehouiller[13], il fut d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que\nil y a lieu de tenir compte de l'\u00e2ge de l'enfant et de faire supporter \u00e0 un enfant de huit ans une part de responsabilit\u00e9 moindre que celle qui devrait \u00eatre imput\u00e9e \u00e0 un enfant plus \u00e2g\u00e9.\nTout r\u00e9cemment, dans la cause de The Oliver Biais Company Ltd. v. Yachuk[14], qui pr\u00e9sentait de grandes similitudes avec celle-ci, cette Cour a confirm\u00e9 le jugement de la High Court d'Ontario qui avait imput\u00e9 75% de la responsabilit\u00e9 d'un accident \u00e0 deux jeunes enfants, \u00e2g\u00e9s respectivement de neuf et de sept ans.\nDans cette cause, l'honorable juge Urquhart, qui pr\u00e9sidait alors la Cour, d\u00e9clara entre autres choses:\nI have little hesitation in finding that he (the infant plaintiff) was so negligent. The first point that should be considered is whether a boy of 9 years and one month, as this boy was at the time, could be guilty at all of contributory negligence. I have examined a great many cases on this subject and my conclusion is that where the boy is an ordinary bright, alert lad as this boy appears to be, and was shown to be at the time, there has been a short dividing line fixed at seven years. Under seven years, unless there is extraordinary brightness, in scarcely any case has a child been held guilty of contributory negligence.\nEt l'honorable juge Urquhart passe en revue un certain nombre de causes pour appuyer son jugement.\nLe r\u00e9sultat de l'examen tr\u00e8s \u00e9labor\u00e9 que fait dans le jugement a quo l'honorable juge de premi\u00e8re instance est que:\nun enfant qui a atteint l'\u00e2ge de discernement, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement fix\u00e9 \u00e0 7 ans, doit \u00eatre tenu responsable de son acte de n\u00e9gligence et appel\u00e9 \u00e0 en supporter seul, ou conjointement avec d'autres, selon le cas, les cons\u00e9quences.\nComme le dit Savatier, (Responsabilit\u00e9 Civile, tome 1, n\u00b0 199)\nla minorit\u00e9 n'est pas, en soi, une impossibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9voir et d'\u00e9viter l'acte illicite, donc une cause d'irresponsabilit\u00e9. En somme, cette doctrine et cette jurisprudence impliquent que l'enfant qui a l'\u00e2ge, l'intelligence et le discernement voulus, est l\u00e9galement responsable de ses actes. En effet, il suffit d'y r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir: Etre tenu coupable de n\u00e9gligence contributoire \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 dire: \u00eatre tenu coupable de n\u00e9gligence et entra\u00eene la pleine responsabilit\u00e9 de l'acte. L'att\u00e9nuation ne provient que du fait qu'une autre personne a elle aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 responsable. Et si l'on arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que les deux responsabilit\u00e9s ont contribu\u00e9 aux dommages, alors on en fait supporter une partie par chacun de ceux qui y ont contribu\u00e9. Mais la n\u00e9gligence de l'un n'est appel\u00e9e n\u00e9gligence contributoire, cela est \u00e9vident, que si une autre personne a, pour sa part, contribu\u00e9 aux dommages.\nSi les circonstances ne permettent pas de relier \u00e0 ces dommages la contribution de cette autre personne, il s'en suit n\u00e9cessairement que la premi\u00e8re est uniquement responsable et est seule la causa causans. D'o\u00f9 il r\u00e9sulte que dire d'un enfant qui remplit les conditions voulues qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 coupable de n\u00e9gligence contributoire, cela \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 dire qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 coupable de n\u00e9gligence, qu'il en supportera seul les cons\u00e9quences, si nulle autre personne n'y a contribu\u00e9 avec lui.\nEt voici maintenant l'appr\u00e9ciation que fait le juge des deux jeunes victimes de l'accident qui a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente cause:\nMarcel Dubeau est un enfant normal, sain d'esprit, d'une intelligence suffisamment d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e et capable de comprendre, dans une certaine mesure, l'imprudence de son acte.\nGaston Laperri\u00e8re est un enfant normal, sain d'esprit, d'une intelligence suffisamment d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e et capable de comprendre, dans une certaine mesure, l'imprudence de son acte.\nL'honorable juge a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis que\nle fait d'avoir laiss\u00e9 des explosifs sur les terrains de man\u0153uvres constituait une n\u00e9gligence grossi\u00e8re, d'autant plus grossi\u00e8re qu'elle \u00e9tait facilement \u00e9vitable.\nMais, dans les circonstances, il a cru qu'il y avait lieu de tenir chaque enfant, respectivement, partiellement responsable de l'accident, conjointement avec la Couronne. Il a attribu\u00e9 la responsabilit\u00e9 dans les proportions de 33\u2153% \u00e0 chacun des jeunes gens, et 66\u2154% \u00e0 la Couronne. A l'argumentation devant cette Cour, la Couronne a soulev\u00e9 la question de savoir si la doctrine de la faute commune pouvait s'appliquer \u00e0 elle, et c'est l\u00e0 un point d'une grande importance qui est susceptible de se poser de plus en plus \u00e0 l'avenir.\nLa pr\u00e9tention du savant procureur de la Couronne, en l'esp\u00e8ce, est que l'article 19 (c) de la Loi de la Cour d'Echiquier du Canada, suivant sa v\u00e9ritable interpr\u00e9tation, stipule que la Couronne ne peut \u00eatre responsable en dommages vis-\u00e0-vis d'une personne ou \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 que si les dommages r\u00e9sultent exclusivement de la n\u00e9gligence d'un officier ou d'un serviteur de l'Etat dans l'exercice de ses devoirs ou de ses fonctions;\n(\"resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment\").\nIl a ajout\u00e9 que l'accident qui r\u00e9sulte de la faute commune est un accident qui est la suite de la combinaison des n\u00e9gligences de chaque participant, et non pas un accident qui r\u00e9sulte uniquement de la n\u00e9gligence de l'officier ou du serviteur de l'Etat.\nJe n'ignore pas l'arr\u00eat de cette Cour dans Canadian National Railway Company v. Saint John Motor Line Limited[15], o\u00f9 l'honorable juge Newcombe avait exprim\u00e9 l'opinion unanime des juges qui avaient alors si\u00e9g\u00e9 dans cette affaire; mais je n'ai pas \u00e0 me prononcer sur la question soulev\u00e9e ici par l'appelante (et o\u00f9 il aurait fallu examiner minutieusement le jugement dont je viens de parler), car je suis d'avis que, en l'occurrence, l'appelante ne peut pas \u00eatre tenue l\u00e9galement responsable de l'accident dont les fils des deux intim\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 les victimes.\nSi je pouvais \u00eatre d'accord avec le juge qui a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 ce proc\u00e8s en qualifiant de n\u00e9gligence grossi\u00e8re des militaires qui auraient volontairement et sciemment laiss\u00e9 sur le terrain un explosif du genre du \"thunderflash\" dont il s'agit, je ne puis le suivre lorsqu'il se prononce ainsi dans un cas o\u00f9, de toute \u00e9vidence, il n'y a eu de la part des militaires, aucun acte volontaire et conscient.\nIl est manifeste que les militaires ne savaient pas que ce \"thunderflash\" \u00e9tait rest\u00e9 sur le terrain sans avoir explos\u00e9. Le fait est que le juge de premi\u00e8re instance a \u00e9t\u00e9 amen\u00e9 \u00e0 faire consister la n\u00e9gligence dans le fait que les officiers n'auraient pas, avant de quitter le terrain des man\u0153uvres, fait un examen minutieux des terrains de golf et de celui de Giroux pour v\u00e9rifier si, par hasard, un \"thunderflash\" \u00e9tait rest\u00e9 sur les terrains sans exploser. Mais, \u00e0 supposer que ce d\u00e9faut de v\u00e9rification e\u00fbt pu \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une n\u00e9gligence\u2014ce qui ne me para\u00eet pas certain\u2014je crois que ce qui manque \u00e0 l'appr\u00e9ciation des faits dans le jugement dont est appel, c'est qu'il n'y a aucune preuve que les officiers ou les militaires savaient ou auraient d\u00fb savoir que des enfants se rendraient sur le terrain o\u00f9 les man\u0153uvres ont eu lieu.\nJe ne pense pas me tromper en disant que tous les jugements o\u00f9 des adultes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9s responsables d'accidents survenus \u00e0 des enfants et caus\u00e9s par l'abandon d'objets dangereux dans un certain endroit, ou le d\u00e9faut de surveillance d'appareils dangereux, ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus dans ce sens, parce que le juge saisi de la cause avait d'abord consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme prouv\u00e9 le fait que ces adultes savaient ou auraient d\u00fb savoir que le public ou des enfants avaient acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'endroit o\u00f9 se trouvait l'objet dangereux; comme par exemple: des objets laiss\u00e9s sur une rue ou une voie publique, ou des objets abandonn\u00e9s ou non surveill\u00e9s dans quelque r\u00e9gion o\u00f9 le public ou des enfants avaient l'habitude de se rendre ou de jouer. Telle fut la base du jugement de la Cour du Banc du Roi dans la cause de Canadian Pacific Railway v. Coley[16].\nMais ici il n'y a aucune preuve que les militaires savaient ou auraient d\u00fb savoir que des enfants pourraient venir sur le terrain des man\u0153uvres. Au contraire, tout indiquait qu'il n'y avait aucune possibilit\u00e9 de ce genre. Le terrain de golf \u00e9tait ferm\u00e9 depuis trois ou quatre ans; le terrain de Giroux \u00e9tait un terrain priv\u00e9, et le constable de la compagnie Quebec Power a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que lui et ses subordonn\u00e9s s'employaient \u00e0 emp\u00eacher tout le monde de se rendre sur l'un ou l'autre de ces terrains; les enfants, au moment o\u00f9 ils ont trouv\u00e9 l'explosif, n'\u00e9taient m\u00eame pas sur le sentier o\u00f9 Giroux tol\u00e9rait le passage, mais ils se trouvaient \u00e0 un tout autre endroit. Rien ne pouvait faire pr\u00e9voir aux militaires que des enfants se rendraient \u00e0 cet endroit, et il ne fut certainement pas \u00e9tabli, au cours de l'enqu\u00eate, que les militaires ou leurs officiers savaient ou avaient vu, ou auraient d\u00fb voir ou savoir que des enfants circuleraient autour de cet endroit. Dans les circonstances, il manque donc un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel pour que Ton puisse attribuer de la n\u00e9gligence aux militaires qui avaient employ\u00e9 des explosifs de ce genre dans l'exercice l\u00e9gitime et m\u00eame obligatoire de leurs man\u0153uvres.\nIl me faut donc \u00e9carter toute attribution de faute aux militaires et, par le fait m\u00eame, \u00e0 la Couronne.\nMais, en plus, vu la d\u00e9cision du juge de premi\u00e8re instance sur l'intelligence des jeunes Dubeau et Laperri\u00e8re, je ne vois pas bien comment l'on pourrait les traiter, pour le cas qui nous occupe, autrement que comme des adultes.\nDes adultes qui auraient fait ce que le jeune Dubeau et le jeune Laperri\u00e8re ont fait auraient pu difficilement convaincre une cour de justice que la Couronne pourrait \u00eatre tenue responsable de ce qui \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9.\nIl ne m'est pas possible de voir en quoi, dans les circonstances, le cas des deux jeunes gens peut \u00eatre distingu\u00e9 de celui d'un adulte.\nIls avaient, dit le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, toute l'intelligence n\u00e9cessaire pour comprendre ce qu'ils faisaient. Ils avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu un avertissement lorsque le jeune compagnon de Dubeau s'\u00e9tait br\u00fbl\u00e9 le pouce sur le terrain de Giroux, apr\u00e8s avoir mis le feu \u00e0 une petite quantit\u00e9 de poudre retir\u00e9e du \"thunderflash\". Et d'ailleurs, ce n'est pas au moment o\u00f9 ils ont trouv\u00e9 l'explosif que les dommages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9s. Il aurait pu y avoir une nuance si le \"thunderflash\" avait fait explosion au moment o\u00f9 ils le trouv\u00e8rent et s'en empar\u00e8rent. Mais le jeune Dubeau l'a emport\u00e9 avec lui, et ce ne fut que plus tard, plusieurs heures apr\u00e8s, dans la rue, alors qu'ils jouaient avec d'autres petits compagnons que l'accident s'est produit. D'apr\u00e8s leur propre t\u00e9moignage, ils savaient bien alors et appr\u00e9ciaient toute la port\u00e9e de leur acte. Ils ont encore commenc\u00e9 par extraire de la poudre et \u00e0 y mettre le feu. Puis lorsqu'ils d\u00e9cid\u00e8rent de mettre le feu au \"thunderflash\" lui-m\u00eame, ils ont eux-m\u00eames d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'ils voulaient faire un feu d'artifice. C'est bien \u00e0 cela qu'ils s'employ\u00e8rent et c'est bien cela qu'ils, esp\u00e9raient. Et m\u00eame l\u00e0 encore, l'accident ne s'est pas produit. Le moment fatal est venu lorsqu'ils ont cru que le feu s'\u00e9tait \u00e9teint; ils ont m\u00eame mis le pied sur le \"thunderflash\" pour s'en assurer davantage; puis tous deux, le jeune Laperri\u00e8re et le jeune Dubeau, ont pris l'explosif dans leurs mains et c'est alors qu'ils ont subi des dommages dont ils se plaignent maintenant.\nIl ne m'est pas possible de dire qu'ils n'ont pas agi en toute connaissance de cause et qu'ils n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 les vie times de leur propre imprudence.\nA tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, il y a eu entre le moment o\u00f9 Dubeau a trouv\u00e9 l'explosif sur le terrain de Giroux et le moment o\u00f9 l'accident s'est produit, toute une s\u00e9rie d'\u00e9v\u00e9nements interm\u00e9diaires qui rendent la pr\u00e9tendue n\u00e9gligence des militaires une cause certainement tr\u00e8s \u00e9loign\u00e9e (causa sine qua non) de l'accident et des dommages en r\u00e9sultant, mais non pas une causa causans.\nTout particuli\u00e8rement pour le jeune Laperri\u00e8re, il s'agit simplement d'un novus actus interveniens; ce qui, apr\u00e8s tout, n'est qu'une fa\u00e7on de dire que la pr\u00e9tendue n\u00e9gligence des militaires n'a pas contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'accident qui s'est produit. (Potvin v. Gatineau Electric Light Co.,[17] C.P.).\nComme le dit le juge de premi\u00e8re instance lui-m\u00eame:\nIl me semble \u00e9vident que l'explosif qui a bless\u00e9 le fils du p\u00e9titionnaire n'aurait pas explos\u00e9 s'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mani\u00e9 par lui.\nIl ne pouvait \u00eatre vraisemblablement pr\u00e9vu par les militaires ou leurs officiers que ce qui est arriv\u00e9 se produirait.\nA mon avis, les deux jeunes gens, avec l'intelligence les caract\u00e9risant, les connaissances qui leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9es par le juge de premi\u00e8re instance, sont uniquement responsables du malheureux accident dont ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 les victimes; et, toute participation des militaires\u2014si l'on peut dire qu'il y en a eu\u2014a certainement \u00e9t\u00e9 trop \u00e9loign\u00e9e pour que l'on puisse en tirer des cons\u00e9quences de responsabilit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale contre eux.\nJe suis d'avis de maintenir l'appel dans chacun des jugements a quo, et de rejeter chacune des actions avec d\u00e9pens dans les deux cours.\nKerwin J:\u2014These appeals from two judgments of the Exchequer Court of Canada were argued together. In one case the petition of right was presented by Omer Dubeau as tutor of his son Marcel Dubeau and in the other by Alfred Laperri\u00e8re as tutor of his son Gaston Laperri\u00e8re. Each boy was injured under circumstances which, in the opinion of the trial judge, Mr. Justice Angers, made the Crown liable as for the negligence of its officers or servants in the exercise of their duties or employment under the provisions of section 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act as enacted by chapter 28 of the 1938 statutes, taken in conjunction with section 50 (a) of the Exchequer Court Act as enacted by chapter 25 of the statutes of 1943-1944. The trial judge found the boys at fault to the extent of one-third and, therefore, reduced the sums which he otherwise would have allowed the suppliants. No question arises as to the amounts involved but the appellant argues that the suppliants are not entitled to succeed to any extent.\nOn October 10, 1942, a detachment of soldiers belonging to the 57th Quebec Field Battery engaged in a scheme on the old Kent Golf Club course at Courville, Quebec, and, in the course of this operation, seventy-five explosives known as thunderflashes were employed. The evidence accounts for their distribution and, on the whole, that every one who received a thunderflash was under the bona fide impression that each one used had actually exploded. The golf course had been closed to the public for some time but, whether the fact be that the men engaged in the scheme did not go outside the limits of the course, an unexploded thunderflash was found on or about October 31, 1942, on the adjoining Giroux farm. The evidence shows that at or about the spot where the thunderflash was found, the ground was disturbed in such a fashion that it might be proper to draw the inference that some of the men had actually used part of the Giroux farm but, whether that be so or not, it is undoubted that this particular thunderflash had been used during the course of the scheme.\nIt was found by Marcel Dubeau and another boy, Guy Bouchard. These two boys were playing on the farm without the knowledge of the owner but they had on various occasions worked there and had also looked for golf balls. It seems clear that on the day in question they were there with at least the implied permission of the owner. They extracted bits of powder from the thunderflash, which they ignited with matches and caused small explosions. Marcel Dubeau took home with him the thunderflash containing the remainder of the powder. At the trial, Marcel, at one stage, testified that he told his father about what he had found and that he was warned to be careful but, on re-examination he denied this, and in this he was confirmed by his father. The trial judge chose to believe the boy's latter story thus confirmed, and I can see no reason to interfere with that finding. That same evening Marcel was playing with a number of friends, including Gaston Laperri\u00e8re, and had burned a small bit of the powder on the sidewalk when Gaston and Guy Bouchard decided to ignite the remainder of the powder in the thunderflash all at once. After two attempts had been made to ignite it and it did not seem to be burning, Marcel and Gaston were about to pick it up when it exploded causing severe injuries to the two boys.\nOn these facts the appellant contends that there was no negligence on the part of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment. The trial judge found that there was negligence on the part of the officers in charge of the scheme in leaving the unexploded thunderflash on Giroux's farm without making a search, and with that I agree. It is evident that whether any of the men actually traversed part of Giroux's farm or not, the latter was in fact used as part of the area for the scheme and although in time of war considerable latitude must be allowed the armed services in their training operations in Canada, under all the circumstances in the present case, steps should have been taken to see that all the thunderflashes used had been exploded. Thunderflashes are dangerous articles and in the absence of any such steps it should have been anticipated that an unexploded one would be found by children on Giroux's farm and that such children might so play with it as to cause injuries to themselves. The fact that this particular one, while found on the farm, caused the injuries complained of at another spot, including those to one who is not the finder, can make no difference.\nThe appellant argues that the injuries did not result from such negligence but that it was caused by a novus actus interveniens, namely, the action of the two boys. Subject to the question discussed later, this, however, was the thing that the officers or servants should have anticipated, and the doctrine contended for has no application.\nThe suppliants cross-appeal and claim that the Crown should be held liable for the total amount of damages found by the trial judge. At the time of the accident, the boys were respectively eleven and twelve years of age. The trial judge saw them and came to the conclusion that while they were normal and intelligent enough to understand to a certain extent the imprudence of their acts, they were, nevertheless, of such an age as not fully to comprehend the dangerousness of their actions. This finding should not be disturbed. Bouvier v. Fee[18].\nIt is clear, I think, that in the words of Lord Sumner in Glasgow Corporation v. Taylor[19], infancy as such is not a status conferring right and that a measure of care appropriate to the inability or disability of those who are immature or feeble in mind or body is due from others, who know of or ought to anticipate the presence of such persons within the scope and hazard of their own operations. Lord Denman's statement in Lynch v. Nurdin[20] that \"ordinary care must mean that degree of care which may reasonably be expected from a person in the plaintiff's situation\" has always been accepted as an authoritative statement of the law relating to the contributory negligence of children; see, for instance, the statement of Duff J., as he then was, in Winnipeg Electric Railway Co. v. Wald[21] where he stated that the trial judge in that case might perhaps have told the jury that\nif they accepted the appellant's account, it would be a question for them whether the plaintiff's conduct had fallen below the standard of reasonable care to be expected from a child of her years;\nThis is as applicable in Quebec as in the common law provinces: Bouvier v. Fee18.\nTo revert to the negligence found against the Crown,\u2014it should be held to extend to the foreseeability that the thunderflash might be found by children but the extent of the liability must depend upon the age of the children playing with it. It was definitely settled in this Court in Price v. Roy[22], that in cases between subject and subject in Quebec, damages must be mitigated in the case of common fault; and see the decision of the Privy Council in The Montreal Tramways Company v. McAllister[23]. This being the general law in Quebec, it is settled by decisions in this Court that it is the law to be applied to the Crown under section 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act. In view of this, I am unable to agree with Mr. Geoffrion's argument that the Crown's liability under that section is confined to cases where the negligent act of the Crown's officer or servant is the sole cause of the injury.\nI would dismiss the appeals with costs and the cross-appeals without costs.\nThe judgment of Hudson and Estey JJ. was delivered by\nEstey J.:\u2014These appeals are from judgments rendered in the Exchequer Court of Canada apportioning damages suffered by the boys in the loss of their right hands when on the evening of October 31, 1942, a thunderflash exploded. The boys reside at Courville, Quebec, and at that time were respectively 12 years and 8 months and 11 years and 7 months of age.\nThe military authorities, having obtained permission to so use the premises, on the evening of October 10, 1942, conducted military manoeuvres at the Kent Golf Club. About 30 men were so engaged and in the course of these manoeuvres 75 thunderflashes were used. These were dangerous missiles about 10\" long and 1\" in diameter, manufactured for the purpose of representing \"gunfire and shellfire in training\". That they were dangerous is not disputed. The instructions for using them required that the cap be removed, the fuse ignited, and then, lest \"somebody could get hurt\", thrown some distance as they exploded in a few seconds.\nThese thunderflashes were thrown at distances varying from 25 to 100 feet. The learned trial judge finds that manoeuvres were not conducted on the farm of Mr. F. X. Giroux adjoining that of the Kent Golf Club, but it is clear that one group of the men was during the manoeuvres stationed near Giroux's farm and that this and other thunderflashes were thrown upon the farm of Giroux. The learned trial judge states:\nAu cas o\u00f9 j'admettrais, ce que je ne suis pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 faire, qu'aucun militaire n'est entr\u00e9 sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de Giroux durant les man\u0153uvres, je ne verrais pas d'autre conclusion \u00e0 tirer qu'un \"thunderflash\" a \u00e9t\u00e9 jet\u00e9 sur sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9\nIt is apparent that the officers in charge cautioned the men as to the dangerous character of these thunderflashes and at the trial the appellant sought to prove that after the manoeuvres all the thunderflashes were accounted for and had, in fact, exploded. The evidence indicates they were not able to do so. Notwithstanding that no permission had been obtained to use Giroux's land in any way, and in spite of the fact that these thunderflashes were thrown from a point near the Giroux farm and in the direction thereof, no effort was made to see that these thunderflashes did not reach the farm, nor to warn Mr. Giroux of the possibility that some of these thunderflashes might have reached his farm.\nThe law of England in its care for human life requires consummate caution in the person who deals with dangerous weapons.\nErle C. J., Potter v. Faulkner[24]; Beven 4th Ed. p. 201. Again:\nThe duty of the defendants on bringing this foreign and dangerous material on the ground and exploding it there was to keep all the results of the explosion on their own lands, and it escaped from their own lands at their peril.\nSwinfen Eady M. R. in Miles v. Forest Rock Granite Co. (Leicestershire) (Limited),[25].\nThis amounts to saying that in dealing with a dangerous instrument of this kind the only caution that will be held adequate in point of law is to abolish its dangerous character altogether.\nPollock, 14th Ed., p. 402.\nUnder the circumstances, the throwing of these thunderflashes upon the farm of Giroux, the failure to ascertain if any so thrown had not exploded, or to notify Giroux of their possible presence and dangerous character, constituted negligence.\nLater in the same month, on Saturday afternoon, October 31, Marcel Dubeau and Guy Bouchard (about 11 years of age) went out to play upon the premises of the Kent Golf Club where they had at times acted as caddies. It was their habit to look for golf balls, apparently both on the premises of the golf club and upon the farm of Giroux. At the time in question they were looking for golf balls on the farm of Giroux and there came upon the unexploded thunderflash (sometimes referred to in the evidence as \"b\u00e2ton\"). It looked to them like a large firecracker and they proceeded to examine it.\nMarcel Dubeau deposed as follows:\nQ. Quand vous avez vu ce b\u00e2ton, qu'est-ce qui est arriv\u00e9?\nR. On l'a ouvert.\nQ. Qui l'a ouvert?\nR. Guy, on voyait qu'il y avait de quoi dedans. On a mis \u00e7a \u00e0 terre, on en a vid\u00e9 un peu sur ce carton-l\u00e0, (No. 5), et l\u00e0, on a mis une allumette dedans, \u00e7a fait toute une boucane; il s'est br\u00fbl\u00e9 un peu le pouce; on a laiss\u00e9 tout \u00e7a l\u00e0, on est descendu avec ce qui restait dedans.\nQ. Vous avez laiss\u00e9 tous ces papiers (nos. 4 et 5).\nR. Oui, monsieur. On a descendu le b\u00e2ton, on a vu un tas de planches chez monsieur Giroux; c'\u00e9tait l'heure du souper; je l'avais dans mes poches; on l'a fait prendre un peu; je l'ai mis dans ma poche, et j'ai dit: on va aller souper, on se rencontrera \u00e0 soir dans la rue St-Joseph.\nQ. Et l\u00e0?\nR. On s'est rencontr\u00e9, on \u00e9tait plusieurs, il y en avait une gang, l\u00e0 on en a fait br\u00fbler l\u00e0 aussi; on mettait \u00e7a sur le trottoir; \u00e7a faisait une fum\u00e9e; il en restait pas beaucoup dans la bo\u00eete; on a dit: on va faire tout br\u00fbler, \u00e7a va \u00eatre beau. L\u00e0, Gaston Laperri\u00e8re, il a pris une allumette et il l'a mis sur le bout, il voyait que \u00e7a allumait pas, et il l'a \u00e9teint avec son pied; et il est all\u00e9 une deuxi\u00e8me fois pour l'allumer; il voyait pas de feu, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pour voir, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pour le prendre avec sa main, et l\u00e0 il s'est fait une explosion.\nBoth Marcel Dubeau and Gaston Laperri\u00e8re gave evidence at the trial and the learned trial judge had an opportunity to hear and to observe with respect to their knowledge and capacity. He finds with respect to Marcel Dubeau:\nJe suis d'opinion par ailleurs que Marcel Dubeau, le fils du p\u00e9titionnaire, a lui-m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 partiellement responsable de l'accident. C'est un enfant intelligent qui savait que la poudre est une mati\u00e8re inflammable, explosive et dangereuse, qui \u00e9tait au courant du fait que Guy Bouchard s'\u00e9tait br\u00fbl\u00e9 un doigt en en faisant br\u00fbler une petite quantit\u00e9 provenant du \"thunderflash\" et qui, d\u00e9sireux de faire un feu d'artifice, a, avec son ami Gaston Laperri\u00e8re, d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de mettre le feu \u00e0 ce qui restait du \"thunderflash\" et de le faire \u00e9clater. Le pauvre enfant ne savait pas \u00e9videmment qu'il y avait dans le \"thunderflash\" une quantit\u00e9 de poudre aussi consid\u00e9rable que celle qui s'y trouvait encore et il ne pr\u00e9voyait pas qu'une explosion si violente se produirait.\nHis finding with respect to Gaston Laperri\u00e8re is to the same effect. Marcel Dubeau and Guy Bouchard thought they had found a firecracker. They had neither seen nor heard of a thunderflash, and having regard to its size, the fact that the cap would have been removed before it was thrown, and its general appearance, one can understand how boys might well think they had found a firecracker. As Marcel Dubeau stated:\nJe pensais que c'\u00e9tait des petits p\u00e9tards qu'on achetait.\nThe boys knew that firecrackers contained powder and \"\u00e7a faisait seulement qu'un petit paff\".\nIn the evening on St. Joseph street one of them lighted the thunderflash and Gaston Laperri\u00e8re, not satisfied with the way it was burning, put it out with his foot and lighted it again, and when this time it did not appear to burn, the two boys, Marcel Dubeau and Gaston Laperri\u00e8re, picked it up with their right hands when it exploded.\nThey admitted they appreciated danger. Marcel Dubeau admitted: \"Je pensais que c'\u00e9tait pas dangereux\".\nGaston Laperri\u00e8re: \"Q. Quand \u00e7a explose, c'est dangereux? R. Oui, monsieur.\"\nbut then explains:\nR. Je le savais, mais je ne savais pas \u2026 je ne pensais pas que \u00e7a allait faire tant de dommage que \u00e7a.\nThese boys were not trespassers upon the Giroux farm. They and other boys were in the habit of going there and for the purpose they were pursuing when they found this thunderflash. Giroux knew of their doing so over a period of time and never made objection thereto. Indeed, Marcel Dubeau often worked on the Giroux farm, had in fact worked there that day and finished about 2.30 in the afternoon.\nMr. Geoffrion pressed that even if the military authorities were negligent, the conduct of the boys plainly indicated they were aware of the danger and therefore their conduct in these circumstances constituted an intervening act of a third person of such a character as to relieve the appellant of responsibility. He points out that the first time the powder was lighted Guy Bouchard's fingers were burned and that Marcel Dubeau, one of the injured boys, was present and witnessed that incident, and thereafter stood further back from the danger. That after supper when a group of about 25 boys gathered on St. Joseph street they lighted the powder on the sidewalk and it burned with a puff. They wanted a bigger puff and decided to burn all of the remaining powder at once. That when it was lighted and it did not burn as they anticipated from their experience with firecrackers, Gaston Laperri\u00e8re put it out with his foot,, Then when he re-lighted it and it did not appear to burn, he and Marcel Dubeau both took it in their hands when it exploded. He submits this constituted conduct so absurd and foolish in the light of their capacity, knowledge and experience and of what had taken place as to be quite beyond the field of reasonable foreseeability and the appellant ought not to be held liable therefor.\nThe conduct of these boys was in relation to what they believed to be a large firecracker. Upon their own admissions they knew it contained powder and was dangerous.\nWhere a child is of such an age as to be naturally ignorant of danger or to be unable to fend for itself at all, he cannot be said to be guilty of contributory negligence with regard to a matter beyond his appreciation, but quite young children are held responsible for not exercising that standard of care which may reasonably be expected of them.\n23 Halsbury, p. 688, para. 972.\nIn view of their admissions and the finding of the learned trial judge, it is impossible to say, at least with respect to a firecracker, that these boys were \"naturally ignorant of danger\", or that it was \"a matter beyond his (their) appreciation\". In my opinion, having regard to their capacity, knowledge and experience, their conduct constituted negligence. That the boys were negligent, however, does not necessarily relieve the first party negligent of liability.\nThat a thunderflash left unexploded in a field adjoining a golf course would be picked up and meddled with in a manner that might cause injury or damage is a consequence that in my opinion would be anticipated by a reasonably careful person. If within the field of that reasonable anticipation injury results, the fact that the party finding the dangerous missile is negligent does not relieve the first party from liability. A boy 17 years old found a gun and without realizing it was loaded he pointed it at and shot another boy. In an action against the party who had so left the gun, Holmes L. J., stated:\nThere is no evidence of how the path was used, but the jury were at liberty to infer that it was used to some extent; and their knowledge of the world would tell them that a gun casually laid aside has a great fascination for some people, who seem to have a natural impulse to handle and examine it, and who often do so in so careless and unskilful a way as that it is discharged without intention on their part. I do not attach much importance to the age of the defendant's son. He was old enough to know that it was dangerous to handle the gun on full cock, which had evidently been placed where he found it for some temporary purpose by a person who had been using it; and in my own reading and experience negligence in connection with firearms is as common in the case of men as of boys. Quite irrespective of the age of the persons who might use the path, I think that there was evidence from which the jury were at liberty to find that the defendant, when placing the gun against the fence, ought to have contemplated that it might fall into negligent hands. Sullivan v. Creed,[26].\nThen again, in Pollock on Torts:\nA wrongful or negligent voluntary act of Peter may create a state of things giving an opportunity for another wrongful or negligent act of John, as well as for pure accidents. If harm is then caused by John's act, which act is of a kind that Peter might have reasonably foreseen, Peter and John may both be liable; and this whether John's act be wilful or not, for many kinds of negligent and wilfully wrongful acts are unhappily common, and a prudent man cannot shut his eyes to the probability that somebody will commit them if temptation is put in the way. One is not entitled to make obvious occasions for negligence.\nPollock on Torts, 14th ed. at p. 376.\nLord Dunedin in another case:\nIt has, however, again and again been held that in the case of articles dangerous in themselves, such as loaded firearms, poisons, explosives and other things ejusdem generis, there is a peculiar duty to take precaution imposed upon those who send forth or install such articles when it is necessarily the case that other parties will come within their proximity; the duty being to take precaution; it is no excuse to say the accident would not have happened unless some other agency than that of the defendant had intermeddled with the matter.\nDominion Natural Gas Co. v. Collins,[27].\nGloster v. Toronto Electric Light Co.,[28]; Makins v. Piggott & Inglis,[29]; Whitby v. Brock,[30]. Conduct that will relieve the first party negligent of liability is described by Lord Wright:\nIt must always be shown that there is something which I will call ultroneous, something unwarrantable, a new cause coming in disturbing the sequence of events, something that can be described as either unreasonable or extraneous or extrinsic.\nThe Oropesa,[31].\nThe negligent conduct of the boys, Dubeau and Laperri\u00e8re, cannot be so described. It falls far short of that of the 14 year old boy who, while employed at his work, decided to quit. To do so he crawled over or under a barricade in front of an open door, jumped onto a smoke flue and when it gave way fell and lost his life. His death was due to his \"own rash act\": Dominion Glass Co. v. Despins[32].\nAnother illustration, a boy of 12 years walked on a trestle across a ravine 17 to 19 feet deep and 300 feet wide in the face of conspicuous danger signs. Recovery could not be had. It was just as if some person was saying to the boy: \"It is dangerous to go there\". As Anglin J. states:\nIt shocks my common sense to think that a boy or a person who had been warned in that way and does go there and is injured by something he did not anticipate to find, should be entitled to recover.\nShilson v. Northern Ontario Light and Power Co.[33].\nThat the boys believed they were playing with powder which they knew to be dangerous, that they were playing with a firecracker larger than they were familiar with, distinguishes this case and its facts from the case of Makins v. Piggott & Inglis,[34] where a boy scratched a detonator of which he was \"unaware of its character\" and did so \"in ignorance of its dangerous character\" and thereby caused an explosion that\ncould not be said to be his voluntary act in the sense that would incapacitate him from recovery.\nThe conduct of Marcel Dubeau and Gaston Laperri\u00e8re indicated that they appreciated the possibility of injury, not the possibility of an injury so great as that which they suffered, but an injury similar in character. The difference is one of degree rather than of kind. Therefore, in spite of their partial knowledge of that with which they were confronted, they cannot be entirely excused because in part their negligent conduct has contributed to their own injuries. In the language of Makins v. Piggott & Inglis[35] their conduct was voluntary with respect to a dangerous substance. In Clarke v. Army & Navy Co-Operative Society,[36], the defendants when they sold the tin of chlorinated lime appreciated the possibility of danger. No negligence was found on the part of the purchaser who recovered damages. Collins, M. R., stated at p. 161:\nI do not think it is very material whether he (the manager) attributed their being dangerous to the right reason or not. He clearly knew that the tins were potentially dangerous, for he instructed his assistants not to sell them without giving a warning to purchasers.\nIt would appear that when due consideration is given to the capacity, knowledge and experience and age of the boys in relation to all the facts and circumstances in this case, the law applicable is that set forth in the well-known case of Lynch v. Nurdin[37] and quoted with approval by Anglin J. (later Chief Justice) in Geall v. Dominion Creosoting Co.,[38].\nIf I am guilty of negligence in leaving anything dangerous in a place where I know it to be extremely probable that some other person will unjustifiably set it in motion to the injury of a third, and if that injury should be brought about, I presume that the sufferer might have redress by action against both or either of the two, but unquestionably against the first.\nThe appellant contends that if this be a case in which both parties contribute, and therefore a case of contributory negligence, the action on behalf of the boys must fail because section 19 (c), under which this action is brought, gives a right of action against the Crown only where the injuries are those \"resulting exclusively from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown\". Section 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act, being 1927 R.S.C., c. 34:\n19. (c) Every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment.\nThe phrase \"resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown\" has been in this section since it was enacted in 1887, and though twice amended, this phrase has remained unchanged. Referring to this enactment Mr. Justice Gwynne stated:\nThe object, intent and effect of the above enactment was, as it appears to me, to confer upon the Exchequer Court, in all cases of claim against the government, either for the death of any person, or for injury to the person or property of any person committed to their charge upon any railway or other public work of the Dominion under the management and control of the government, arising from the negligence of the servants of the government, acting within the scope of their duties or employment upon such public work, the like jurisdiction as in like cases is exercised by the ordinary courts over public companies and individuals.\nThe City of Quebec v. The Queen,[39].\nSir Charles Fitzpatrick C. J., referring to the same section stated:\nSince the judgment in The King v. Armstrong[40], it must be considered as settled law that the Exchequer Court Act not only creates a remedy, but imposes a liability upon the Crown in such a case as the present and that such liability is to be determined by the laws of the province where the cause of action arose.\nThe King v. Desrosiers,[41].\nThe law varies in the respective provinces and the Crown has in the past quite properly availed itself of any defence provided by the law of the province in which the cause of action arose. This is illustrated by decisions in which the fellow servant rule was pleaded. When the cause of action arose in the province of Manitoba where the fellow servant rule obtained the suppliant's action failed: Ryder v. The King,[42]. When the cause of action arose in the province of Quebec, where the fellow servant rule did not obtain, the suppliant recovered: The Queen v. Pillion,[43]. See also The King v. Armstrong,40.\nIn this Court the damages were apportioned where the negligence on the part of servants of the Crown contributed to the loss. The cause of action arose in the province of Quebec and action was brought under the present section 19 (c) (then sec. 20 (c)). Anglin C.J.:\nIt seems to follow that we have here a case of \"common offence or quasi-offence\" of the respondent company and of the appellant resulting in a joint and several obligation on their part to persons who have sustained consequential injury (art. 1106 C. C.), with the result that there must be an apportionment of responsibility between these co-debtors * * * The King v. Canada Steamship Lines Ltd,.[44].\nIn the Exchequer Court damages have been apportioned between the Crown and the subject where the cause of action arose in the province of Quebec: Lapointe v. The King,[45]; Rochon v. The King,[46]; Thiboutot v. The King,[47]; also two as yet unreported cases, Martial St. Jacques v. The King, and Joseph Bouchard v. The King.\nThe foregoing indicates the long accepted construction of section 19 (c). The insertion of the word \"exclusively\" in this section as suggested would make a substantial difference and at variance with the construction already established. It would therefore appear that the addition of any such word is a matter for the consideration of parliament rather than for the Court.\nIn my opinion the appeals should be dismissed with costs and the cross-appeals without costs.\nRand J.:\u2014The essential fact of these cases is that what is known as a \"thunderflash\", a tube between 10 and 12 inches long and 1\u00bd inches or so in diameter, loaded with powder, highly dangerous, and used in military field exercises, was unlawfully placed and left on land where two boys who shortly thereafter found it had permission to be. Apart from the continuing trespass, the high degree of care required of those who control such articles means the anticipation of a greater range of probable mischief and that it must reach to children in their position I do not doubt. The natural consequences of that initial culpa extend then to the injuries suffered unless it can be said that at some point a new and independent actor has intervened.\nThe conception of \"cause\" in article 1053 of the Civil Code does not differ, in a case of this nature, from that of the Common Law: and as put by Lord Sumner in S.S. \"Singleton Aubry\" v. S.S. \"Paludina\"[48] in language approved by Lord Wright in The Oropesa[49].\nCause and consequence in such a matter do not depend on the question, whether the first action which intervenes, is excusable or not, but on the question whether it is new and independent or not. But where we are dealing with persons in their normal state of mind and body acting deliberately, in the absence of special circumstances, the innocence or culpability of the intervening act, certainly as we have it here, must, as to the actor himself, fix it either as a consequence of the initial cause or a new and originating cause. The chain of events was such that if an adult had been concerned rather than a boy of 12, the intervening act would be held to be new and independent; it was not a situation in which contributory negligence could operate; it would have been an intermeddling by a responsible person with what he would know could be dangerous.\nAs I understand the judgment below, it holds there can be partial culpability, in the case of children, for a given act. We do admit degrees of liability for consequences between two or more participants in a negligent cause, but I know of no binding authority which attributes fractional liability or deprivation of right to an infant in proportion to his appreciation of a particular situation. In relation to a specific act he must be either responsible or not responsible for its consequences; there is no halfway culpability; and the question is whether or not these boys of 11 and 12 are to be held to conduct that in the circumstances would have avoided the results which happened.\nWhat is the standard by reference to which that question is to be answered? It has been declared by Baron Parke, in his customary terseness and clarity of language:\nThe decision of Lynch v. Nurdin[50] proceeded wholly upon the ground that the Plaintiff had taken as much care as could be expected from a child of tender years\u2014in short, that the Plaintiff was blameless and consequently that the act of the Plaintiff did not affect the question;\nLygo v. Newbold[51] (in argument).\nThe same rule is laid down by Duff, J. (as he then was) in Winnipeg Electric Railways v. Wald,[52].\n* * * it would be a question for them whether the Plaintiff's conduct had fallen below the standard of reasonable care expected from a child of her years.\nThat sets up an objective criterion: the prudent child of given years. But age is not to be taken too literally: understanding and care appear in rough categories. It is not, however, the actual capacity of the child whose conduct is being examined; on this basis, the standard would be that of the tribunal itself; and the inconvenience and uncertainty of that, long ago pointed out by Chief Justice Tindal in Vaughan v. Menlove[53] in relation to adults, increase as we take into account the instincts and impulses of the child, in certain circumstances so susceptible to excitement. But that mode of stating the standard does not affect the substantial identity of the conduct so defined with that from which, in the particular situation, there would be only the exceptional departure by persons of the same age class.\nAs with the adult, the standard would take into account any clearly shown special knowledge, and, probably, the fact that the child's intelligence and general capacity had indubitably placed him in an older age category. But there is nothing of the unusual here. The act of both boys moving to pick up the explosive after the fuse had been lighted not only negatives such a capacity but demonstrates their inadequate appreciation of the danger they were courting.\nIf, then, the child in all the circumstances has used as much care as the ordinary child of his years would have used or if he has acted as all save the exceptional child of his age would have acted, his act is innocent; if not, as regards his own injury it is culpable: and whether his responsibility is exclusive or contributory depends on the nature of the events into which he has projected himself.\nTo determine if he has met the standard, I ask myself what is the general opinion of prudent persons\u2014\"the common sense of the community\" as Holmes has put it\u2014as to the likely and expectable conduct of an ordinary boy of 11 or 12 who gets hold of such an explosive; and the answer is, I think, that it would be just what happened here. It follows that he should not be allowed to handle by himself and alone such a menace as a thunderflash; and the universal care and apprehension attending holiday celebrations in fireworks attests this. In the common understanding, the natural and probable consequence of the conjunction of a normal boy of that age and such a compact danger will be that he will pry and meddle to his own injury. There is the virtually inevitable external behaviour which adults must foresee in relation to acts which may, without justification or excuse, bring about that conjunction. The conduct of the boys here, then, was normal, likely, and, just as prudent behaviour in an adult, innocent. That excludes any qualification or limitation of the right to recover from the appellants.\nThis makes it unnecessary for me to consider Mr. Geoffrion's argument that the liability of the Crown under section 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act is limited to cases in which the act of the Crown's servant is the sole cause of the injury. I should perhaps say that I see nothing whatever anomalous in the view that what Parliament intended in creating liability of the Crown was to adopt the law then existing in each province except as it might thereafter be amended or changed by Parliament, such as for instance in the field of navigation and shipping; but in any event the interpretation placed on this section since its enactment has established a jurisprudence which I think it is now too late to modify.\nAs no question of quantum of damages has been raised, in each case I would dismiss the appeal with costs and allow the cross-appeal with costs both here and in the Court below.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nCross-appeals dismissed without costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: G\u00e9rard Lacroix.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Dorion, Dorion & Robitaille.\n[1] [1945] Ex.

Cloutier3.\nSi, dans le \"jug\u00e9\" qui figure en t\u00eate de ces deux causes dans les rapports de 1928, l'on a employ\u00e9 les expressions\nwhere the judgment of a court of first instance for recovery of a sum of money is affirmed by an appellate court.\nc'est uniquement parce que, dans chacune de ces causes, la cour d'appel avait confirm\u00e9 le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance. Il n'y avait nulle intention de d\u00e9clarer que le principe invoqu\u00e9 dans ces deux causes ne s'appliquait qu'aux cas o\u00f9 la cour d'appel avait confirm\u00e9 le jugement de premi\u00e8re instance. Le principe s'applique \u00e9galement lorsque la cour d'appel a infirm\u00e9 le premier jugement.\nEn effet, s'il fallait en d\u00e9cider autrement, il faudrait dire que lorsqu'une action de plus de $2,000.00 a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par la Cour de premi\u00e8re instance, il n'y aurait plus moyen de porter cette cause en appel devant la Cour Supr\u00eame. D'ailleurs, les termes dont s'est servi le juge en chef rejetant, au nom de la Cour, les deux motions dans ces causes invoquant le d\u00e9faut de juridiction, montrent clairement\nthat interest in the judgment of the trial court up to the date of the judgment of the appellate court, must be included in computing the amount in controversy in the appeal.\nNous devons donc maintenir que cette Cour a juridiction en l'esp\u00e8ce.\nReporter's note:\u2014On the merits this Court held that the appellate court was not justified, upon the facts and circumstances of the case, in setting aside the judgment of the trial court. Consequently, the appeal to this Court was allowed and the judgment of the Superior Court was restored, with costs in all courts to be paid by the respondent.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Dorion, Dorion & Robitaille.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Pierre de Varennes.\n[1] [1923] S.C.R. 1.\n[2] [1928] S.C.R. 154.\n[3] [1928] S.C.R. 396.\n3 [1928] S.C.R. 396.\n2 [1928] S.C.R. 154.\n1 [1923] S.C.R. 1.\n2 [1928] S.C.R. 154.\n3 [1928] S.C.R. 396.\n",

Mahaffy Appellant;\nand\nThe Minister of National Revenue Respondent.\n1946: May 6, 7; 1946: June 3.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin, Hudson, Rand and Estey JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nRevenue\u2014Income\u2014Expenses incurred by a member of a legislative assembly.\u2014While attending sessions of the legislature or travelling from seat of legislature to residence\u2014Whether member entitled to deduct such expenses when making his annual income tax return\u2014Income War Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 97, s. 5(1) (f) and s. 6(1) (a).\nThe appellant, a resident of Calgary, was in 1941 a member of the Legislature of the province of Alberta which meets at the capital city of Edmonton and received as such the sum of $2,000 as an allowance. In his income tax return for the year 1941, he deducted certain expenses and disbursements incurred for living expenses in the provincial capital while in attendance at legislative sessions and for travelling expenses from Calgary to Edmonton and return for week-ends during the time of such session. All of these deductions were disallowed by the Minister of National Revenue; and an appeal to the Exchequer Court of Canada was dismissed. Upon appeal to this Court,\nHeld that the expenses above mentioned are not such as the appellant is entitled to deduct under the provisions of the Income War Tax Act.\n2. Such expenses are \"not wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income\" within the terms of section 6 (1) (a) of the Act.\n3. Travelling expenses incurred by the appellant are not \"travelling expenses * * * in the pursuit of a trade or business \"within the meaning of the words used in section 5 (1) (f) of the Act.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1946]) Ex. C.R. 18) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Cameron, Deputy Judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing an appeal from the decision of the Minister of National Revenue confirming the appellant's assessment under the Income War Tax Act for the year 1941.\nLeave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was granted by the Chief Justice in Chambers.\nRedmond Quain K.C. for the appellant.\nF. P. Varcoe K.C., W. R. Jackett and J. G. McEntyre for the respondent.\nThe judgment of The Chief Justice and of Kerwin, Hudson and Estey JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014The appellant was, in 1941, a Member of the Legislature of the province of Alberta representing the constituency of Calgary.\nHe included his allowance of $2,000.00 (as a Member of the Legislature) as part of his income; but he deducted certain expenses, which deduction was disallowed by the Minister of National Revenue. These expenses as set out in the agreed facts consisted of:\n(a) The bill of the McDonald Hotel in Edmonton being the place at which the Provincial Legislature sits and in respect to which the appellant paid for a room at a monthly rate of $80.00 per month, making a total of \u2026\u2026 $144.35\n(b) Expenses for berths and other conveyances to and from Calgary to Edmonton for 14 single trips which the appellant took over each week end so as to be in Calgary on Saturdays and Sundays in order to be available to confer with his constituents who might wish to see him about various matters, making a total of\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 43.40\nAs to the above it is to be noted that the actual railroad fare, apart from berths, was provided by a pass issued to the appellant and in respect to which he has made no claim.\n(c) Additional expenses for meals and other incidentals while away from Calgary and in Edmonton over and above the cost of the same to the appellant while he is at home, which the appellant has calculated at $2.00 per day for 38 days, making a total of \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 76.00\n$263.75\nLess an item which had been reimbursed from the Provincial Government as against these expenses\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. 27.40\n$236.35\nHis appeal to the Exchequer Court of Canada was dismissed and the question is whether there was error in the judgment of that Court in not holding that:\n(1) The said expenses were wholly, exclusively and necessarily expended for earning the income as stipulated in section 6 (1) (a) of the Income War Tax Act; or,\n(2) The said expenses consisted of travelling expenses (including the entire amount expended for meals and lodging) while away from home in the pursuit of a business; and therefore should be deducted from income as provided by section 5 (1) (f) of the Act.\nTaxable income is defined in section 3 (d) (ii) of the Act and is said to include the\nsalaries, indemnities or other remuneration of * * * members of Provincial Legislative Councils and Assemblies.\nThe sole problem therefore is whether the expenses above mentioned are such as the appellant is entitled to deduct under the provisions of the Income War Tax Act. We do not think the words used in subsection 5 (1) (f) are apt to include the expenses now in question.\nThe provisions of that subsection are as follows:\n(1) (f) Travelling expenses, including the entire amount expended for meals and lodging while away from home in the pursuit of a trade or business.\nThe occupation of Members of Provincial Legislative Councils and Assemblies is neither a trade nor a business. The travelling expenses there mentioned are in the nature, for example, of expenses of commercial travellers. Bahamas General Trust Company et al. v. Provincial Treasurer of Alberta[2]; Ricketts v. Colquhoun[3] approved in the judgment of Lord Blanesburgh in the House of Lords in the same case[4].\nIn our view, this is sufficient to eliminate subsection (f) of paragraph (1) of section (5) of the Act as supporting the appellant's contention.\nAlternatively the appellant claims the benefit of the provisions of section 6 (1) (a) of the Act which is as follows:\nIn computing the amount of the profits or gains to be assessed, a deduction shall not be allowed in respect of\n(a) disbursements or expenses not wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income.\nThis clause was considered in the case of Minister of National Revenue v. Dominion Natural Gas Co. Ltd.[5] where the then Chief Justice of this Court, at page 22, said:\nIn order to fall within the category \"disbursements or expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income\", expenses must be working expenses; that is to say, expenses incurred in the process of earning the income.\nIn that judgment, the Court followed the decision in Lothian Chemical Co. Ltd. v. Rogers[6]; Robert Addie & Sons Ltd. v. Inland Revenue Commissioners[7]. In the Addie case (6) it was held that in order to be allowed, such expenditure must be laid out as part of the process of profit earning. Reference may be also made to the case of Montreal Coke and Manufacturing Company v. Minister of National Revenue[8] where it was held that expenditure to be deductible must be directly related to the earning of income from the trade or business conducted.\nIt cannot be said here that the expenses of the appellant had been incurred in the process of earning the income and more particularly such expenses cannot be considered as having been incurred \"wholly, exclusively and necessarily\" for that purpose. Moreover, section 6 of the Act, subsection (f) excludes \"personal and living expenses\" from the deduction which may be allowed \"in computing the amount of the profits or gains to be assessed\".\nFor these reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs.\nRand J.:\u2014The appellant is a member of the Provincial Legislature of Alberta, representing the constituency of Calgary. The Assembly sits in Edmonton, some 200 miles from that city. He receives from the province an allowance of $2,000.00 under The Legislative Assembly Act, R. S. A. (1942) c. 4, sections 54 and 57 of which are as follows:\n54. (1) In respect of each session of the Legislature which is first held in any year, there shall be allowed and payable to each member of the Legislative Assembly attending such session an allowance of $2,000.00 and no more;\n* * *\n57. There shall be allowed to each member five cents for each mile of the distance between the nearest railway station to the place of residence of the member and the place at which the session is held, reckoning the distance going and coming, according to the shortest railway route together with his actual travelling expenses between his place of residence and the railway station when the distance is greater than five miles.\nIn making his return of income to the respondent, he deducted from the sessional allowance the expenses of (a) lodging in a hotel at Edmonton in the sum of $144.35; (b) expenses for berths and incidental transportation between Calgary and Edmonton exclusive of regular fares incurred in seven round trips taken at weekends to enable the appellant to be in his constituency to confer with constituents on various matters in the sum of $43.40; (c) additional expenses for meals and other incidentals while in Edmonton over and above their cost to the appellant at home figured at $2.00 a day for 38 days, making a total of $76.00 less the sum of $27.40 representing the mileage allowance for one trip to Edmonton and return under section 57.\nThe deductions were disallowed by the respondent; an appeal to the Exchequer Court of Canada was dismissed, and the case is now brought to this Court.\nThe Income War Tax Act defines \"income\" as follows:\n3. (1) For the purposes of this Act, \"income\" means the annual net profit or gain or gratuity * * * and shall include the interest, dividends or profits * * * and also the annual profit or gain from any other source including\n* * *\n(d) The' salaries, indemnities or other remunerations of\n(1) members of the Senate and House of Commons of Canada and officers thereof;\n(2) members of Provincial Legislative Councils and Assemblies.\nExemptions and deductions are covered by sections 5 and 6 as follows:\n5. (1) \"Income\" as hereinbefore defined shall for the purposes of this Act be subject to the following exemptions and deductions:\n* * *\n(f) Travelling expenses, including the entire amount expended for meals and lodging, while away from home in the pursuit of a trade or business;\n* * *\n6. (1) In computing the amount of the profits or gains to be assessed, a deduction shall not be allowed in respect of\n(a) Disbursements or expenses not wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income;\n* * *\n(f) Personal and living expenses;\nThe question is whether the items deducted are travelling expenses \"in the pursuit of a trade or business\"; or\ndisbursements or expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income.\nand in my opinion they are neither. Whether or not attending a session of a Legislative Assembly can be deemed \"business\" which I think extremely doubtful, certainly making the extra trips and lodging in a hotel in Edmonton cannot be looked upon as \"in the pursuit\" of it. That expression had been judicially interpreted to mean \"in the process of earning\" the income: Minister of National Revenue v. Dominion Natural Gas Co.[9]. The sessional allowance is specifically for attendance by members at the legislative proceedings: it has no relation to any time or place or activity outside of that. The \"pursuit\" of a business contemplates only the time and place which embrace the range of those activities for which the allowance is made: the \"process of earning\" consists of engaging in those activities. To treat the travelling expenses here as within that range would enable employees generally who must, in a practical sense, take a street car or bus or train to reach their work to claim these daily expenses as deductions. Employees are paid for what they do while \"at work\"; and the legislators receive the allowance for their participation in the sessional deliberations: up to those boundaries, each class is on its own. For the same reason it cannot seriously be urged that the expenses are \"wholly, exclusively and necessarily\" laid out for the purpose of earning the allowance: they are for acts or requirements of the member as an individual and not as a participant in the remunerated field.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: S. J. Helman.\nSolicitor for the respondent: S. H. Adams.\n[1] [1946] Ex.

Suppliant claimed that the Crown, through the Board, had purchased or requisitioned its property and, alternatively, that it had suffered damages resulting from negligence of the Board. A question of law was set down for disposition before trial of the action as to whether a petition of right lies, assuming the acts or omissions alleged in it to be established. The President of the Exchequer Court of Canada held that the suppliant was not entitled to any of the relief sought in its petition. On appeal to this Court,\nHeld, reversing the judgment appealed from, that the appellant's claim under section 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act, \"arising out of * * * injury to * * * property resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment\" might still be valid, even if the Board has no power to purchase or to appropriate. Therefore, the suppliant is entitled to proceed to trial on its petition of right.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the President of the Exchequer Court of Canada (1)[1] adjudging that the suppliant is not entitled to any of the relief sought in its petition of right.\nRedmond Quain K.C. for the appellant\nF. P. Varcoe K.C. and D. W. Mundell for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014This is an appeal by the suppliant, Union Packing Company Limited, from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada declaring that the suppliant is not entitled to any of the relief sought in its petition of right. This judgment was delivered upon a question of law set down for argument pursuant to an order made on the application of the suppliant. The question as set forth in that order is as follows:\u2014\nIn view of the agreement dated the 30th day of October, 1940, between the Governments of the United Kingdom and of Canada for the purchase of Canadian bacon and hams, and in view of Order-in-Council P.C. 4076, dated the 13th day of December, 1939, as amended by P.C. 4353, dated 27th day of December, 1939, and assuming the acts or omissions alleged in the Petition of Right herein to be established, does a Petition of Right lie.\nThe first argument advanced by the respondent why a negative answer should be given to that question was that a petition of right does not lie against the Crown in this case because the Bacon Board, created by P.C. 4076, (referred to in the question) is not a servant or agent of the Crown but an independent body. The President of the Exchequer Court of Canada decided adversely to the Crown on that argument and on the opening of the appeal before us, Mr. Varcoe announced that he accepted that conclusion and would not seek to support the judgment appealed from on that ground. After disposing of that argument, the President proceeded to discuss the question whether a petition of right lies under the circumstances, and he held it did not. The circumstances, of course, mean the acts or omissions alleged in the petition, and according to the terms of the order granting leave to set down the question of law, these acts or omissions must, for the purpose of the motion, be taken as admitted. The first inquiry must therefore be as to what is so alleged.\nThe suppliant carries on business as meat packers and provisions. By a letter of February 5th, 1941, the Bacon Board, set up and acting as a servant and agent of the Crown, notified the suppliant that with respect to the week commencing February 10th, 1941, a put-down to the extent of 160,000 pounds of bacon and other pork products was authorized, and accordingly the suppliant placed into cure bacon and other pork products of the required weight and notified the Board accordingly. Contained in the said products so put into cure were seventy-three boxes of rib backs weighing 42,785 pounds. On February 28th, 1941, the suppliant was notified by the Board that it had booked shipment for this pork on a steamship scheduled to load at the Port of Saint John from the 12th to 15th March, 1941, and the suppliant proceeded to make arrangements accordingly, and so notified the Board. The product arrived at Saint John on March 11th, 1941, and was delivered at seaboard but no ship was available at that time for the purpose of having the product loaded thereon. The Board did not inspect the product until March 29th, 1941, when it advised the suppliant that the seventy-three boxes of rib backs were rejected for slime, odour and mould. The petition of right then proceeds to allege:\u2014\nThe Bacon Board on the arrival of the said pork, knowing that no ship was available, failed to notify the suppliant to take care of the said product and failed to take any steps to have the same put into cold storage. The suppliant says that the Bacon Board as the agent and servant of the Crown was negligent in its handling of the said lot of pork products and failed to use reasonable care in that\u2014\n(a) When it found that no ship was available as booked it should have taken steps to have the said pork products put into cold storage so that the same would not be damaged or permitted to deteriorate until shipping space was made available, or\n(b) It should have immediately notified the suppliant that the shipping space was not available and so have permitted the suppliant to have itself made arrangements for the care of the said pork products.\n(c) It permitted the said pork products to remain on hand at Calgary too long a period without arranging for the shipping thereof.\nParagraph 6 alleges that by reason of the said negligence and lack of care, the rib backs became slimy and developed mould, and were rejected, and the suppliant suffered damage in the amount thereinafter set out.\nParagraphs 7 and 8 set up alternative claims in the following language:\u2014\n7. In the alternative the suppliant says that the Crown took over the complete handling, care and shipping of the said pork products from the time it authorized the same to be put into cure until the said boxes of rib backs were rejected and that the suppliant acted at all times in accordance with the instructions received from the Crown relative thereto and that if any of the said pork deteriorated or was damaged such deterioration or damage was due entirely to the fault of the Crown and that the suppliant is entitled to be paid by the Crown the agreed price or value of such rib backs less any moneys it has received on account thereof from the resale of such rib backs.\n8. In the further alternative the suppliant says that the said 73 boxes of rib backs were delivered at seaboard in good condition as agreed and that the suppliant is entitled to be paid therefor at the agreed price from the moneys in the hands of the Crown paid by the United Kingdom Ministry of Food in respect thereof and that the suppliant has sustained loss as hereinafter set out by reason of the wrongful return of the said boxes of rib backs. The suppliant says that as against the agreed price owing to it the Crown is entitled to have credited the amount realized from the resale of the said products.\nParticulars of the damage and loss sustained by the suppliant are then given, showing a total amount claimed $4,508.86. There is another claim for another shipment in which the same allegations are made, the total amount of that claim being $4,085.89.\nLeaving aside for the moment the claim for negligence under section 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act, the respondent contends that the only claim made by the suppliant is in contract and that no allegation is made that the Board, acting for the Crown, appropriated the rib backs. I am unable to agree with that view as I consider the petition of right alleges facts in paragraphs 7 and 8 and I take it that the President construed the petition of right in the same way. However, he held that the Board has no power to appropriate for the use of the Crown and, therefore, that no claim on that basis could succeed. In that connection he referred to the decision of this Court in the Chemicals Reference (1)[2], where it was held that a certain paragraph of the Order in Council there in question was in conflict with section 7 of the War Measures Act. As to that, it might be pointed out that, if the Board has power to appropriate the boxes of rib backs or the use thereof, and does so appropriate, section 7 of the War Measures Act merely provides that the claim for compensation therefor shall be referred by the Minister of Justice to one of certain courts named therein, or a judge thereof, if \"Compensation is to be made therefor and has not been agreed upon.\" It might appear from the evidence, and in fact is a fair assumption from the petition of right, that the suppliant and the Board had agreed upon the price. In view of the disposition proposed to be made of this appeal, nothing further need be said at this time in connection with the matter and no opinion is expressed as to the correctness of the President's view.\nAs to the claim in contract, the President held that the Board has no power to purchase and that as a matter of fact any purchase from the suppliant was made by the United Kingdom Minister of Food and that the sale was made by the suppliant to it. He therefore held that there was no duty owing by the Board to the suppliant to arrange for the care of the rib backs but, on the contrary, that it was the duty of the suppliant to attend to such matters.\nNo opinion is expressed on this point because it seems to be clear that the claim under section 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act, arising out of injury to property, resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment, might still be valid even if the Board has no power to purchase or to appropriate. At present we do not know what was contained in the instructions from the Board to the suppliant, how the boxes of rib backs were shipped, and what communications passed between the suppliant and the Board.\nThe appeal should be allowed and in lieu of the judgment a quo there should be an adjudication that the Bacon Board is a servant of the Crown and that the suppliant is entitled to proceed to trial on its petition of right. It should, however, be pointed out that the\narrangements for the delivery at Canadian seaboard ports to the United Kingdom Ministry of Food, of bacon and hams during the period November 17th, 1939, to October 31st, 1940,\nreferred to in the first recital in P.C. 4076, would not be found in the later agreement between the Ministry of Food and the Canadian Government, dated October 30th, 1940, unless they happen to be the same as in an earlier agreement, nor are they the arrangements referred to in paragraph 2 of the petition of right since they are there stated to have been entered into in the year 1939. The disposition to be made of the costs of the argument on the question of law and this appeal causes some concern. It has been shown that some questions of law were raised by the statement of defence; that an ex parte order was made giving leave to have those points of law set down for argument at the sittings to be held in Calgary; that Mr. Justice Robson, sitting as an ad hoc judge, struck the case off the list to allow for further consideration since counsel for the Crown took the position that he thought the questions were not merely ones of law but of mixed fact and law. The suppliant then served a notice of motion for an order that the following question of law should be set down and disposed of before the trial:\u2014\nWhether a cause of action against His Majesty is disclosed in the Petition of Right herein or such other or additional preliminary question of law as is raised by the statement by defence herein.\nUpon that motion it was suggested that the agreement of October 30th, 1940, and P.C. 4076 as amended by P.C. 4553, should be considered, and the order was made accordingly. Under all the circumstances, the costs of that application and of the argument on the question of law and of this appeal should be costs in the cause.\nAppeal allowed, costs in the cause.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Helman, Mahaffy & Barron.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F.

Attorney-General for Canada, [1946] S.C.R. 462\nDate: 1946-05-20\nLeo Kincaid Greenlees (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nAttorney-General of Canada (Defendant) Respondent.\n1946: May 13, 20.\nPresent: Kerwin, Hudson, Taschereau, Rand and Estey JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nAppeal\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Liability to military service\u2014Exemption of \u201ca minister of a religious denomination\u201d\u2014Action by member of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses to be declared within exemption\u2014Dismissal of action\u2014Petition for leave to appeal\u2014\u201cRights in future\u201d\u2014Supreme Court Act, Section 41(c).\nThe appellant brought an action against the Attorney-General of Canada, claiming a declaration that he was \u201ca minister of a religious denomination,\u201d to wit. Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, within the meaning of section 3, subs. 2 (c), of the National Selective Service Mobilization Regulations, 1944, and that, therefore, the Regulations did not apply to him. The trial judge held that, even assuming that the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses were \u201ca religious denomination\u201d, the appellant was not \u201ca minister\u201d thereof; and that judgment was affirmed by the appellate court. The appellant moved for special leave to appeal to this Court, under the provisions of section 41 (c) of the Supreme Court Act. Held that this Court has no jurisdiction to grant leave, and the application must be refused, on the ground that the appellant\u2019s present or future pecuniary or economic rights are not in controversy in this appeal. The decision appealed from is confined to the point that the appellant is not \u201ca minister of a religious denomination\u201d, and the mere possibility that a lower Court might inappropriately use it against the appellant in connection with any rights he may have under other statutory enactments cannot alter the fact that, in the present appeal, his future rights are not involved.\nMOTION for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Hogg J.[2] and dismissing an action for a declaration that the appellant is exempt from the application of the National Selective Service Mobilization Regulations.\nW.G. How for the motion.\nW.R. Jackett contra.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nKERWIN J.:\u2014L.K. Greenless brought an action against the Attorney-General for Canada, claiming a declaration that he is a minister of a religious denomination within the meaning of section 3, subsection 2, of the National Selective Service Mobilization Regulations, 1944. By subsection 1, the Regulations are stated to apply to such age classes, or parts of age classes, of men as the Governor in Council may, from time to time, by proclamation in the Canada Gazette, designate for the purpose. Then comes subsection 2, which so far as material provides:\n(2) Notwithstanding subsection 1, these regulations shall not apply to the following:\u2014\n* * *\n(c) a regular clergyman or a minister of a religious denomination.\nA preliminary objection was raised that the appellant was not entitled to bring the action but the trial judge, Mr. Justice Hogg2, concluded that he had jurisdiction and that it came within such cases as Dyson v. Attorney-General[3]. However, while inclining to the view that there is a religious denomination known as Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, he held that the plaintiff was not a \u201cminister\u201d of that denomination, and dismissed the action.\nUpon appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario[4], the Chief Justice of the province, writing the judgment of the Court, expressed no opinion upon the preliminary objection. He concluded that notwithstanding the stand taken by Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses as to \u201creligion\u201d, it would be proper to say that the word \u201creligious\u201d in Regulation 3(2(c)) might be applied to them. He had more difficulty with the question whether they constituted a denomination, and he concluded that he was far from satisfied that, the onus being upon the plaintiff to bring himself within an exception, the evidence warranted a finding that those calling themselves \u201cJehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u201d constituted a \u201creligious denomination\u201d within the meaning of the Regulation. That was sufficient for the dismissal of the appeal but he agreed with the conclusion arrived at by Mr. Justice Hogg that, even assuming they were a religious denomination, the appellant was not a minister thereof.\nThe plaintiff sought leave from the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal from its decision but that leave was refused. He then applied to this Court for special leave and admitted that the only provision giving this Court power to grant leave must be found in clause (c) of section 41, Supreme Court Act, reading as follows:\n(c) the taking of any annual rent, customary or other fee, or other matters by which rights in future of the parties may be affected; or\nMr. How endeavoured to distinguish the decision of this Court in Bland v. Agnew[5], where it was held that section 41, when enacted substantially in its present form in 1920 by chapter 32, section 2, did not profess in terms to introduce any change in the well-settled practice that no appeal would lie unless the matter in controversy involved or affected something in the nature of a pecuniary or economic interest, present or future. It was there held that there was no jurisdiction in this Court to grant special leave to appeal from the Court of Appeal for British Columbia dismissing the applicant\u2019s appeal from an order allowing the adoption by respondents of the applicant\u2019s daughter. Mr. How argued that this rule had been broadened by this Court since that decision, and he referred to Forcier v. Coderre[6], Christie v. The York Corporation[7] and Le Comit\u00e9 Paritaire v. Dominion Blank Book Company Limited[8]. In the first of these cases the application was actually refused and the statement of the present Chief Justice, at page 551:\u2014\nsi la r\u00e8gle nisi avait \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue, la libert\u00e9 du sujet serait en jeu, et nous serions probablement d\u2019avis que le litige soul\u00e8ve une question suffisamment importante,\nmust be read in the light of what was involved, viz., the title to real estate under clause (d) of section 41. In the Christie case7 there was an economic interest involved as the plaintiff claimed, among other things, damages, while in the third case, the judgment at the trial was finally restored, as would appear by a reference to the report of that decision[9], wherein, besides other relief, damages in the sum of $33.80 had been ordered to be paid. None of these decisions has made any inroads upon the principle set forth in Bland v. Agnew[10].\nMr. How then sought what would really amount to a reversal of the jurisprudence of this Court in connection with applications for special leave to appeal under section 41 (c) by emphasizing the fact that the paragraph speaks of matters by which rights in future of the parties \u201cmay\u201d be affected; and he suggested that the plaintiff\u2019s right to exemption as a minister or clergyman in charge of a diocese, parish or congregation under Rule A to the First Schedule to the Income War Tax Act, or his claim to a railway pass under the provisions of the Railway Act, or his standing under various other enactments might be affected. That overlooks that Bland v. Agnew5 merely reiterates the well-settled jurisprudence set forth in a line of decisions, some of which are there referred to, that it is the matter in controversy in the appeal that must be looked at, and the mere fact, that, even in a case sought to be appealed to this Court, a judgment would deal with incidental matters involving a condemnation in money, would not give the Court jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. Furthermore, the decision of the Court of Appeal in the present case is that within section 3, subsection 2 (c) of the National Selective Service Mobilization Regulations, 1944, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses is not a religious denomination and the plaintiff is not a minister. It is confined to that point and the mere possibility that notwithstanding the explicit words of the Chief Justice of Ontario, a lower Court might inappropriately use it against the plaintiff in connection with one of the other matters referred to cannot alter the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s present or future economic rights are not in controversy in this appeal.\nOn the ground that we have no jurisdiction to grant leave, the application must be refused.\nLeave to appeal refused.\n[1] [1946] 1 D.L.R. 550.\n[2] [1945] 2 D.L.R. 641, 808.\n[3] [1911] 1 K.B. 410.\n[4] [1946] 1 D.L.R. 550.\n[5] [1933] S.C.R. 345.\n[6] [1936] S.C.R. 550.\n[7] [1939] S.C.R. 50.\n[8] [1943] S.C.R. 566.\n[9] [1944] S.C.R. 213.\n[10] [1933] S.C.R. 345.\n",

Beaver, belonging to His Majesty in the right of Canada, collided in the harbour of Saint John, N.B. during a fog. On a petition of right presented by the respondent, O'Connor J. in the Exchequer Court of Canada found that the injury to the Crown's vessel was insignificant, but that the damage to the tug boat amounted to $2,367 and that there was loss of earnings to the extent of $1,400. The trial judge, holding that such damage and loss were caused by the fault of both vessels and that the fault was in equal degree, directed that the Crown should bear half the damage and loss sustained by the suppliant, and pay the costs of the action. The Crown appealed to this Court from that judgment and further contended that it should not be made liable for costs, following a rule of the Admiralty Court. Held that the finding of the trial judge, that the damage and loss to the Ocean Hawk I was caused by the fault, in equal degree, of both vessels, and the direction that they should be apportioned equally between them, should not be disturbed; but\nHeld The Chief Justice and Kerwin J. dissenting, that the evidence as to loss of earnings was not sufficient to enable the Court to make any allowance and that the sum of $700 should be deducted from the amount of damages awarded to the respondent.\nHeld, also that the Crown could be made liable for costs of the action.\nPer The Chief Justice and Kerwin, Hudson and Estey J J.\u2014If the proceedings in this case, originated in a petition of right, are taken to be in the Exchequer Court of Canada in its general jurisdiction, the right to adjudge that the suppliant is entitled to recover its costs from the Crown is unquestionable, and, if the proceedings are treated as being on the Admiralty side of that Court, then section 12 of the Petition of Right Act would confer upon the Court power to award costs against the Crown.\nPer Rand. J.\u2014The proceedings are in the Exchequer Court of Canada proper and not in its Admiralty jurisdiction and, therefore, the costs are at the discretion of the Court unhampered by the rule of the Admiralty Court.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1945] Ex. C.R. 214) affirmed in part.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, O'Connor J.[1], maintaining a petition of right by the respondent to recover from the Crown damages for loss resulting from a collision, between the respondent's tug Ocean Hawk I and H.M.C.S. Beaver owned by the Crown, alleged to be due to the negligence of an officer or servant of the Crown acting within the scope of his duties or employment.\nH. A. Porter K.C. and C. Stein for the appellant.\nC. F. Inches K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin J. (dissenting in part) was delivered by\nKerwin J.: This is an appeal by His Majesty from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada on a petition of right presented by the respondent, Saint John Tugboat Company, Limited, the owner of the tug Ocean Hawk I. On September 17th, 1942, a collision occurred between that tug and its tow, on the one hand, and H.M.C.S. Beaver, belonging to His Majesty in the right of Canada, on the other. Mr. Justice O'Connor in the Exchequer Court of Canada found that the damage and loss to the Ocean Hawk I was caused by the fault of both vessels and that the fault was in equal degree. I am not prepared to disagree with this finding.\nThe trial was fought on the basis of the applicability of the rules of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea as they appear in Annex II to the Canada Shipping Act, 1934, chapter 44, where it is stated that\nThese rules shall be followed by all vessels upon the high seas and in all waters connected therewith, navigable by sea-going vessels.\nWhile Mr. Porter contended that these rules did not apply to the Crown, he admitted that the relevant ones provided a reasonable course of conduct to be followed by the Commander of the Beaver. In assessing one-half of the damages against the Crown, the trial judge referred to section 640 of the Canada Shipping Act but, as appears by section 712, this does not apply to His Majesty. That it applied to the suppliant was not controverted by Mr. Inches. No question was raised as to the power of the Exchequer Court of Canada to order that the Crown pay one-half the damages and loss sustained by the suppliant if it be held that both ships were equally to blame but it was argued that the Crown could not be made liable for costs.\nThese proceedings originated in a petition of right pursuant to the Petition of Right Act, R.S.C. 1927, chapter 158. By virtue of section 5 thereof, the Exchequer Court of Canada had exclusive original cognizance of the petition and by section 12 the suppliant is entitled to costs against His Majesty in like manner and subject to the same rules, regulations and provisions, restrictions and discretion, so far as they are applicable, as are or may be usually adopted or in force in respect to the right to recover costs in proceedings between subject and subject. Section 87 of the Exchequer Court Act empowers the President to make general rules and orders \"(e) for awarding and regulating costs in such Court in favour of or against the Crown as well as the subject\" and Rule 260 passed in pursuance thereof provides that costs may be awarded against the Crown. If these proceedings be in the Exchequer Court of Canada in its general jurisdiction and not on its Admiralty Side, the right to adjudge that the suppliant is entitled to recover its costs from His Majesty is unquestionable.\nBy virtue of the Admiralty Act, 1934, chapter 31, the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court of Canada on its Admiralty Side extends to and may be exercised in respect of all navigable waters. If it be taken that the direction in section 5 of the Petition of Right Act to file the petition and fiat in the Exchequer Court of Canada means in such a case as this to file it in that Court on its Admiralty Side, Rule 131 of the General Rules and Orders Regulating the Practice and Procedure in Admiralty must be considered. That rule provides:\u2014\nIn general costs shall follow the event; but the Judge may in any case make such order as to costs as to him shall seem fit.\nIt was pointed out that this is a reproduction of an order formerly in force in Britain under which it was held that the \"event\" referred to was that each party there succeeded and failed in equal degree since at that time the law did not inquire into degrees of fault. This is referred to by Mr. Justice Hill in The Modica[2] where that experienced judge also stated that it seemed to him that the old rule as to there being no costs in cases between subjects should not be treated as governing the changed conditions since the Maritime Conventions Act of 1911, which contains the provision found in section 640 of the Canada Shipping Act that\nthe liability to make good the damage or loss shall be in proportion to the degree in which each vessel was in fault.\nIn the Robert Koeppen, noted at page 81 of the same report, Mr. Justice Hill, while finding the plaintiff's ship one-fourth to blame, ordered the defendants to pay one-half of the plaintiffs costs. I quite agree that in view of section 640 of the Canada Shipping Act, Rule 131 confers a discretion upon the trial judge in cases between subject and subject and, even if these proceedings be treated as being on the Admiralty Side of the Exchequer Court, section 12 of the Petition of Right Act confers upon the Court power to award costs against His Majesty. The item of $1400 for loss of earnings, included by the trial judge in the loss sustained by the suppliant, was attacked on the ground of the absence of any evidence to justify it. While the evidence on the point is meagre, I think it is sufficient to warrant the allowance of the items. At the argument we declined to permit the appellant to raise the question as to whether the locus of the collision was in a narrow channel within the meaning of Article 25 of the Rules as the pleadings do not refer to the point and no evidence directed to it was introduced.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Hudson and Estey JJ. was delivered by\nHudson J.\u2014This is an action for damages arising from the collision in Saint John Harbour of a tug boat belonging to the suppliant and a naval vessel belonging to His Majesty.\nAt the trial Mr. Justice O'Connor found the vessels to be equally at fault and directed that damages should be apportioned equally between them.\nConsideration of the evidence does not to my mind justify any interference with this finding and direction of the learned judge.\nThe injury to the naval vessel was of an insignificant character and nothing was allowed in respect of same. The injury to the tug boat was more serious and the trial judge found it to amount to $2,367. He also found that there was loss of her earnings to the extent of $1,400. The amount of the damage to the boat is not seriously questioned but it is contended that no loss of earnings was established. On this point the evidence is very meagre indeed.\nThe onus is on the respondent to establish the actual loss and reasonable proof of the amount. It appears from the evidence that the respondent had a number of boats used in their business, some of which were idle from time to time.\nThe Superintendent of the respondents in cross-examination was asked very specifically if he could name any business that had been offering or available to the Tug Boat Company, during the time that the boat in question was being repaired, which the Tug Boat Company were unable to handle through the loss of the service of the Ocean Hawk. He was unable to state any.\nIn the case of The City of Peking[3] it was stated by Sir Barnes Peacock at p. 442:\nThere is no doubt as to the rule of law according to which compensation is to be assessed in cases of this nature, where a partial loss is sustained by collision. The rule is restitutio in integrum: citing The Black Prince,[4]. The party injured is entitled to be put, as far as practicable, in the same condition as if the injury had not been suffered. It does not follow as a matter of necessity that anything is due for detention of a vessel whilst under repair. In order to entitle a party to be indemnified for what is termed in the Admiralty Court a consequential loss resulting from the detention of his vessel, two things are absolutely necessary\u2014actual loss and reasonable proof of the amount (citing The Clarence,[5] and The Argentina[6].\nSee also 30 Halsbury, p. 861.\nFor this reason, I would allow the appeal and reduce the verdict by $700, with no costs in this Court.\nIt was pressed strongly on behalf of the appellant that no costs should be allowed at the trial but, for the reasons mentioned in the judgment of my brother Kerwin, I do not think that this point can be sustained.\nRand J.\u2014I see no reason to interfere with the finding of the Court below of negligence in the navigation of both vessels and of equal responsibility.\nOn that basis, it is argued that there should be no costs following the old rule of the Admiralty Court. But the proceeding here is in the Exchequer Court of Canada proper and not in its Admiralty jurisdiction. The costs are, therefore, in the discretion of the Court unhampered by the rule in question.\nThe point also is taken that there was no proof of damages through loss of profits. The vessel was one of four tugs operated by the respondent in Saint John harbour. The business was an entirety, and damages of this nature would appear in the lessened earnings over the 16 days during which repairs were being made. The following questions and answers of the respondent's Superintendent give the only evidence on the point:\nQ. And during the days that followed this collision was there any time that you were unable to do the business offering?\nA. No, I don't think so.\nQ. You had three boats with which to work and when anything was to be done you had a boat to send?\nA. We did use the whole four of them.\nQ. I am asking you whether in the days immediately after that\u2014it was a slack time in the harbour just then, wasn't it\u2014there was no time you were embarrassed for lack of the fourth boat?\nA. I can't say for sure now.\nWe cannot then infer an actual loss even in gross receipts during that time, and with no running expenses including wages of the crew, there was possibly a higher net return than if the tug had been kept in service. At any rate, there is no material before us from which a conclusion one way or the other can be drawn. In these circumstances, I think it impossible to make any allowance. A claimant must not only present facts which show that damage of this nature has been suffered, but they must be of a nature from which an amount can fairly be deduced: St. John Motor Line Ltd. v. Canadian National Railway Co.[7]. There is nothing of that sort here, and the sum allowed must be struck out.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and reduce the judgment by $700. In view of divided success, there should be no costs in this Court.\nAppeal allowed in part; no costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Porter & Ritchie.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Inches & Hazen.\n[1] [1945] Ex.

C.C.P.\nThe appellant company was vested with all the rights, prerogatives and privileges conferred to one J.P. in 1830 by a provincial statute of Lower Canada (10-11 Geo. IV, c. 56). Under that Act, J.P. was authorized to erect and exploit a toll-bridge with its dependencies, for a league round, in the upper and lower part of the river J\u00e9sus, opposite the village of Sainte-Rose and was granted the exclusive right to cross the river and to charge tolls in accordance with the tariff established by the Act. But it was also provided that, after the expiration of a period of fifty years, the Crown would have the right at any time \"to assume the possession and property\" of the bridge and dependencies, upon paying to the grantee the \"full and entire value\", and it was further stipulated that, from the moment of that taking of possession, the Crown would be substituted to all the rights of the grantee to charge and collect the tolls. The Crown took such possession on July 1st, 1940. Proceedings were taken by the appellant under the expropriation law (Arts. 1066 (b) and (c) C.C.P.) and the record was referred to the Public Service Board for the purpose of fixing the indemnity. Subsequently the Crown made an offer of $109,398 which was refused. The appellant then filed its claim for $2,387,093, $1,848,000 being the alleged value of the franchise and $539,093 as value of the physical assets, damages, interest and other items. The Public Service Board fixed the amount of the indemnity at $109,899. The Superior Court homologated that decision and the appellate court affirmed that judgment.\nHeld that the appeal should be dismissed. Upon a proper construction of the Acts of 1830 and 1940, under whose provisions the appellant's claim must exclusively be decided, the appellant company has been granted by the courts below the full amount of compensation to which it was entitled.\nHeld that, under the enactments of the Act of 1830, the taking of possession by the Crown, whenever effected, did not constitute an expropriation in its strict legal sense. The Crown, by taking possession, did not do more than exercising the rights which had been conferred to it by the Act and to which the grantee had acquiesced in advance. It is purely and simply the execution of the clauses of a contract passed between the Crown and the grantee.\nHeld, also, that, upon a proper construction of the Act of 1930, the franchise, which the grantee has acquired through that statute, ceased to exist from the moment of the taking of possession by the Crown and the grantee or his successors or assigns cannot lay any claim to the tolls collected thereafter.\nThe Act of 1930 stipulated that \"it shall and may be lawful for His Majesty * * * to assume the possession and property of the said bridge * * * upon payment to the said J.P. * * * the full and entire value which the same shall, at the time of such assumption, bear and be worth\". But by a subsequent Act, in 1940 (Que. 4 Geo. VI, c. 33), \"The Minister of Public Works (was) authorized to take possession, in the name of His Majesty, of the toll-bridge * * * and dependencies * * * and the Provincial Treasurer (was) authorized to pay * * * to the * * * assigns of the grantee J.P. the full and entire value of the whole at the time when the Minister of Public Works shall so take possession thereof.\"\nHeld that the stipulation in the Act of 1830 is susceptible of being so construed that the Crown could not have efficient possession, and become definitively owner, of the toll-bridge and dependencies, unless payment of their full and entire value had been made; but such preliminary condition, if it existed, has been set aside by the Act of 1940 and the Crown was granted the right, under that Act, to take possession and assume the ownership of those properties ipso facto without any previous obligation to pay the indemnity due the grantee or his assigns. The only consequence resulting from the taking of possession thus made by the Crown is that, at the time of the payment of the indemnity ultimately determined and granted, the Crown will be bound to pay interest on the capital of that indemnity from the date of the taking of possession.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, affirming a judgment of the Superior Court, McKinnon J. The latter judgment had homologated an order of the Public Service Board fixing at the sum of $109,899 the indemnity payable to the appellant company for the taking over by the Crown respondent of a toll-bridge crossing the river J\u00e9sus, opposite the village of Sainte-Rose, in the province of Quebec, with other dependencies.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nL. E. Beaulieu K.C. and Elie Beauregard K.C. for the appellant.\nJoseph Gingras K.C. and Guy Hudon K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014La compagnie du Pont Plessis-B\u00e9lair est aux droits de James Porteous, conf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 ce dernier en 1830 par la Loi du Bas-Canada, 10-11 George IV, chapitre 56.\nEn vertu de cette Loi, James Porteous \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 construire et \u00e0 exploiter un pont de p\u00e9age et ses d\u00e9pendances traversant la rivi\u00e8re J\u00e9sus, \u00e0 un endroit approximativement situ\u00e9 pr\u00e8s du village de Sainte-Rose, tel qu'il \u00e9tait alors.\nLa section (3) de cette Loi se lit comme suit:\nAnd be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that the said Bridge and the said Toll-house, Turnpike, and other dependencies to be erected thereon, or near thereto, and also the ascents or approaches to the said Bridge, and all materials which shall be from time to time found or provided, for erecting, building, or maintaining and repairing the same, shall be vested in the said James Porteous, his heirs and assigns for ever. Provided that after the expiration of fifty years from the passing of this Act, it shall and may be lawful for His Majesty's, his heirs and successors, to assume the possession and property of the said Bridge, Toll-House, turnpike and dependencies and the ascents and the approaches thereto, upon paying to the said James Porteous, his heirs, executors, curators, or assigns, the full and entire value which the same shall, at the time of such assumption, bear and be worth.\nLa section (5) de la Loi pourvoit au tarif des taux que James Porteous aura le droit d'exiger de ceux qui feront usage du pont. Mais pour l'intelligence de la cause, il est opportun de reproduire ici la section (7):\nAnd be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that the said tolls shall be, and the same are hereby vested in the said James Forteous, his heirs and assigns, for ever. Provided that if His Majesty shall, in the manner hereinbefore mentioned, after the expiration of fifty years from the passing of this Act, assume the possession and property of the said bridge, toll-house, turnpike, and dependencies, and the ascents and approaches thereto, then the said tolls shall, from the time of such assumption, appertain and belong to His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, who shall from thence-forward be substituted in the place and stead of the said James Porteous, his heirs, and assigns, for all and every the purposes of this Act.\nEn vertu de la section (9), les droits ainsi conf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 James Porteous \u00e9taient d\u00e9clar\u00e9s exclusifs en sa faveur dans un rayon de trois milles en amont et en aval du village de Sainte-Rose.\nEnfin, par la section XI, il fut stipul\u00e9 que le pont serait confisqu\u00e9 au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de Sa Majest\u00e9, sans indemnit\u00e9, si James Porteous ou ses successeurs et ayants droit faisaient d\u00e9faut de compl\u00e9ter la construction du pont dans un d\u00e9lai de cinq ans ou, par la suite, de le tenir en bon ordre.\nLe pont fut construit dans le d\u00e9lai prescrit, et il fut entretenu conform\u00e9ment aux engagements pris.\nEn 1857, le pont fut vendu par Walter Millar (qui s'en \u00e9tait rendu acqu\u00e9reur) \u00e0 Adolphe Plessis dit B\u00e9lair. Cette vente comprenait les terrains, \u00eeles et chemins d\u00e9crits dans l'Acte. Le pont est depuis rest\u00e9 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la famille Plessis-B\u00e9lair jusqu'\u00e0 ce que le Gouvernement de la province de Qu\u00e9bec se l'appropri\u00e2t en 1940.\nCette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0, par la Loi 4 George VI, chapitre 33, le Ministre des Travaux publics du Gouvernement de la province de Qu\u00e9bec fut\nautoris\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre, au nom de Sa Majest\u00e9, possession du pont de p\u00e9age construit sur la rivi\u00e8re J\u00e9sus vis-\u00e0-vis le village Ste-Rose, sous l'autorit\u00e9 de la Loi de la province du Bas-Canada, 10-11 George IV, chapitre 56, y compris la maison de p\u00e9age, le chemin \u00e0 barri\u00e8re et les d\u00e9pendances ainsi que les abords et mont\u00e9es dudit pont, et le tr\u00e9sorier de la province est autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 payer, \u00e0 m\u00eame le fonds consolid\u00e9 du revenu, aux h\u00e9ritiers ou ayants droit du concessionnaire James Porteous, la pleine et enti\u00e8re valeur du tout \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 le Ministre des Travaux Publics en prendra ainsi possession. Le Ministre des Travaux Publics \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 effectuer \u00e0 cette fin telles ententes qu'il croirait justes avec les h\u00e9ritiers ou ayants droit dudit concessionnaire et, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'entente,\nla prise de possession, la fixation et le paiement de la valeur dudit pont, avec ses accessoires ci-dessus \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s, seront effectu\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'expropriation alors en vigueur.\nCette Loi vint en force le 22 juin 1940, et la Loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'expropriation alors en vigueur \u00e9tait la loi 4 George VI, chapitre 71, reproduite depuis dans le chapitre XLVI-A du code de proc\u00e9dure civile de la province de Qu\u00e9bec (articles 1066 (a) et suivants).\nLe Gouvernement prit possession du pont le 1er juillet 1940. Les proc\u00e9dures pour la fixation et le paiement de la valeur du pont et de ses accessoires ne furent commenc\u00e9es que le 4 septembre 1942, au moyen d'une requ\u00eate concluant \u00e0 ce que l'intim\u00e9 soit tenu, conform\u00e9ment aux articles 1066 (b) et 1066 (c) du code de proc\u00e9dure civile, de signifier, sous 15 jours du jugement \u00e0 intervenir, un avis contenant:\n(a) l'indication des immeubles que l'intim\u00e9 entend acqu\u00e9rir de l'appelante;\n(b) un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 des motifs justifiant l'expropriation;\n(c) la mention de l'indemnit\u00e9 offerte;\n(d) un plan et une description des immeubles qu'il s'agissait d'acqu\u00e9rir;\net \u00e0 ce que le dossier, ainsi constitu\u00e9, soit r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la R\u00e9gie des Services Publics, pour la fixation de l'indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 laquelle avait droit le r\u00e9clamant.\nIl n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de r\u00e9f\u00e9rer aux avis, \u00e0 l'offre et au refus qui furent d'abord \u00e9chang\u00e9s entre les parties, parce que l'instance \u00e9tait \u00e0 peine engag\u00e9e devant la R\u00e9gie, que l'intim\u00e9 produisit un avis d'expropriation amend\u00e9 avec nouvelle description de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 requise par le Ministre des Travaux Publics et offre d'un montant diff\u00e9rent.\nCet avis amend\u00e9 d\u00e9clare que le Gouvernement a pris possession du pont le 1er juillet 1940,\ny compris la maison de p\u00e9age, le chemin \u00e0 barri\u00e8re et les d\u00e9pendances, ainsi que les abords et mont\u00e9es dudit pont, tel que le tout est indiqu\u00e9 et montr\u00e9 dans une description technique et sur un plan sign\u00e9s par un arpenteur-g\u00e9om\u00e8tre, annex\u00e9s au pr\u00e9sent avis pour en faire partie.

Au cours de cette enqu\u00eate, la R\u00e9gie a visit\u00e9 le pont Plessis-B\u00e9lair et les terrains avoisinants.\nPuis, le 18 juin 1943, la R\u00e9gie a rendu son Ordonnance qui est sign\u00e9e par son Pr\u00e9sident, monsieur Lucien Dugas. Cette Ordonnance, comme base fondamentale, commence par faire remarquer qu'il ne s'agit pas ici d'une expropriation au sens de la Loi, c'est-\u00e0-dire d'une d\u00e9possession forc\u00e9e faite contre le gr\u00e9 du propri\u00e9taire pour fins d'utilit\u00e9 publique, mais simplement, de la part du Gouvernement, de l'exercice du droit qu'il s'est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 et que Porteous lui a librement consenti lorsqu'il s'est adress\u00e9 au Parlement du Bas-Canada pour faire adopter la Loi de 1830.\nElle discute le sens des mots \"enti\u00e8re et pleine valeur\" mentionn\u00e9s dans les deux Lois qui r\u00e9gissent cette affaire, et arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que le mot \"valeur\" n'inclue pas les dommages de toutes sortes qui peuvent r\u00e9sulter \u00e0 l'appelante de la perte de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Elle fait remarquer la diff\u00e9rence qu'il y a \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard entre le texte des deux Lois sp\u00e9ciales et celui de la Loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'expropriation. Dans cette derni\u00e8re,\nl'indemnit\u00e9 est fix\u00e9e d'apr\u00e8s la valeur de l'immeuble * * * et les dommages caus\u00e9s \u00e0 l'expropri\u00e9.\nIci, il s'agit simplement de \"la pleine et enti\u00e8re valeur\" des immeubles dont le Ministre des Travaux Publics est autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre possession. Il n'est pas question des \"dommages\". Et, poursuit l'Ordonnance,\nceci suffirait \u00e0 \u00e9carter toute r\u00e9clamation pour autre chose que ce dont le Ministre s'est empar\u00e9, notamment pour perte de profits, dommages au r\u00e9sidu, travaux ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s en vue de la construction d'un nouveau pont, etc.\nPour ce qui est de $1,800,000.00 pour valeur de la franchise, l'Ordonnance fait remarquer que\nla m\u00eame Loi qui faisait une concession \u00e0 Porteous, d\u00e9clarait que la concession prendrait fin lorsque Sa Majest\u00e9 le jugerait \u00e0 propos.\nIl s'en suit que l'on ne saurait s\u00e9rieusement pr\u00e9tendre que la franchise Porteous se prolonge et se continue apr\u00e8s l'exercice par Sa Majest\u00e9 du droit de prise de possession du pont. Et encore:\nDans le cas pr\u00e9sent, la valeur actuelle du pont ne peut \u00eatre augment\u00e9e \u00e0 cause de cet espoir de profits futurs, parce que dans l'Acte de 1830 il est d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 et convenu que les profits n'appartiendront plus au concessionnaire \u00e0 compter du temps o\u00f9 Sa Majest\u00e9 reprendra le pont.\nEn conclusion, l'Ordonnance d\u00e9clare:\nque le r\u00f4le de la R\u00e9gie est de fixer la valeur des biens d\u00e9crits dans la description technique annex\u00e9e \u00e0 l'avis d'expropriation, sans ajouter \u00e0 cette valeur quoi que ce soit pour les dommages au r\u00e9sidu de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelante qui n'est pas expropri\u00e9e ou pour perte qui serait la cons\u00e9quence de la d\u00e9possession dont elle est l'objet et \u00e0 laquelle ses auteurs ont consenti d'avance pour elle.

Il se rend donc au raisonnement de son coll\u00e8gue, monsieur le juge Pr\u00e9vost.\nMonsieur le juge St-Germain, apr\u00e8s avoir fait l'analyse minutieuse des deux Lois sp\u00e9ciales, en conclut que les conditions stipul\u00e9es se trouvent \u00e0 pourvoir \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 Porteous ou \u00e0 ses ayants cause de\nl'enti\u00e8re et pleine valeur dudit pont, maison de p\u00e9age, barri\u00e8re, etc., et que telle indemnit\u00e9 est pr\u00e9vue par la franchise, du fait que les dits p\u00e9ages, par suite de la prise de possession du pont, appartiendront \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9, Ses H\u00e9ritiers et Successeurs qui seront d\u00e8s lors substitu\u00e9s au lieu et place du dit James Porteous, ses hoirs et ayants droit pour toutes et chacune des fins de cet Acte.\nLui aussi d\u00e9clare adh\u00e9rer enti\u00e8rement aux notes de son coll\u00e8gue, monsieur le juge Pr\u00e9vost.\nMonsieur le juge Barclay, dans une courte note, dit simplement:\nI think it is clear from the terms of the Statute in question that what was originally given to Porteous was not a perpetual franchise but a limited franchise. It was given for a minimum of fifty years and would continue so long as the Crown did not take up the option. When the Crown took up the option, its only obligation was to pay the value of the bridge and its approaches.\nWe are not concerned here with whether the extent of the expropriation was in conformity with the Statute. The extent of the expropriation had to be fixed by the Superior Court and it was fixed, and neither party appealed from that decision, so that question is no longer open.\nAu surplus, il d\u00e9clare \u00eatre d'accord avec monsieur le juge Stuart McDougall.\nMonsieur le juge Pr\u00e9vost, qui a mis au dossier les notes les plus \u00e9labor\u00e9es, se demande d'abord si l'appelante a droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 pour la perte des revenus que lui procurait l'exploitation du pont; et il est d'avis que cette pr\u00e9tention serait fort plausible, s'il s'agissait, en l'esp\u00e8ce, d'une expropriation; mais encore faudrait-il que l'appelante f\u00fbt propri\u00e9taire incommutable du pont, et que sa franchise f\u00fbt vraiment perp\u00e9tuelle. \"Or\", ajoute-t-il,\nil ne s'agit pas dans la pr\u00e9sente cause d'une expropriation; et, au 1er juillet 1940, lorsque la Couronne a pris possession du pont, le droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelante \u00e9tait depuis longtemps pr\u00e9caire, et son droit de percevoir des taux de p\u00e9age \u00e9tait limit\u00e9 \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e de son exploitation du pont comme propri\u00e9taire. Ce n'est pas, d'apr\u00e8s lui, dans l'exercice d'un droit d'expropriation que la Couronne a pris possession du pont, mais en usant d'un droit formellement stipul\u00e9 et convenu entre elle et le concessionnaire Porteous, dans le statut m\u00eame qui lui a conf\u00e9r\u00e9 le droit de construire le pont. Quand elle a exerc\u00e9 son droit de reprendre la possession et propri\u00e9t\u00e9 dudit pont, la Couronne a tout simplement proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution d'un contrat. Et ce n'est donc pas dans la Loi d'expropriation qu'il faut chercher les conditions] auxquelles est soumis le droit exerc\u00e9 par la Couronne, mais dans les termes m\u00eames de la convention.\nQuant au statut de 1940, il n'ordonnait pas une expropriation. Son seul objet est de d\u00e9signer le tribunal qui fixera la valeur du pont et de ses d\u00e9pendances, et d'indiquer la proc\u00e9dure qui sera suivie \u00e0 cette fin, sans alt\u00e9rer les droits respectifs des int\u00e9ress\u00e9s.\nPorteous et ses ayants droit \u00e9taient les propri\u00e9taires du pont pendant cinquante ans. Apr\u00e8s cette p\u00e9riode de temps, leur droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait r\u00e9vocable en tout temps au bon plaisir de la Couronne. Le droit de l'appelante de percevoir des taux de p\u00e9age \u00e9tait subordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e de son exploitation du pont comme propri\u00e9taire. Il leur \u00e9tait conserv\u00e9 \u00e0 toujours si la Couronne ne se pr\u00e9valait pas de la facult\u00e9 qu'elle s'\u00e9tait r\u00e9serv\u00e9e de reprendre la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du pont; mais les conditions de r\u00e9vocation se sont r\u00e9alis\u00e9es le 1er juillet 1940, et, \u00e0 cette date, la franchise de l'appelante a pris fin. Il ne peut \u00eatre question pour elle d'en \u00e9tablir la valeur ni de solliciter une indemnit\u00e9 pour la perte d'un droit qui s'est \u00e9teint du consentement de son auteur.\nQuant au statut de 1940, il n'ordonnait pas une expropria-et travaux qui ne font pas l'objet de l'\u00e9valuation soumise \u00e0 la R\u00e9gie, si l'appelante pr\u00e9tendait que ces chemins et travaux faisaient partie des accessoires du pont, comme en \u00e9tant des d\u00e9pendances ou des abords ou mont\u00e9es, pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l'article 3 du statut de 1830, elle aurait d\u00fb le faire d\u00e9clarer par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, en contestant l'amendement apport\u00e9 par la Couronne \u00e0 son avis d'expropriation. Le r\u00f4le de la R\u00e9gie devait n\u00e9cessairement se borner \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la valeur des biens d\u00e9sign\u00e9s dans l'avis. L'appelante a acquiesc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'amendement de la Couronne, et elle ne s'est pas oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 la motion demandant que le dossier, tel qu'amend\u00e9, soit r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 de novo \u00e0 la R\u00e9gie.\nCette derni\u00e8re a arbitr\u00e9 la valeur du pont et des accessoires d\u00e9crits dans l'avis amend\u00e9. C'est tout ce que la Loi 4 George VI, chapitre 33, l'autorisait de faire. Elle n'avait pas juridiction pour accorder des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 l'appelante. Et le savant juge conclut au rejet de l'appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nEnfin, pour monsieur le juge Stuart McDougall, il para\u00eet tr\u00e8s clair que le texte du statut de 1830 est \u00e0 l'effet que, du moment o\u00f9 la Couronne a pris possession du pont, l'appelante a cess\u00e9 d'avoir aucun droit au p\u00e9age. La section (7) le dit tr\u00e8s express\u00e9ment. Le droit au p\u00e9age d\u00e9pend naturellement de l'existence de la franchise, et la franchise a cess\u00e9 d'exister d\u00e8s la prise de possession du pont par la Couronne.\nIl est \u00e9galement d'avis, comme la R\u00e9gie et comme ses coll\u00e8gues \u00e0 la Cour du Banc du Roi, qu'il ne s'agit pas ici d'une expropriation en vertu de la Loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'expropriation et \u00e0 laquelle les r\u00e8gles ordinaires de l'indemnit\u00e9 s'appliqueraient, mais tout simplement de la reprise de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 par la Couronne, en vertu d'un contrat sp\u00e9cial qui pourvoit \u00e0 une m\u00e9thode d\u00e9finie d'\u00e9valuation des biens repris. La franchise est termin\u00e9e et ne peut plus \u00e0 l'avenir avoir de valeur pour l'appelante. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 explicitement convenu qu'en reprenant la franchise, les taux de p\u00e9age appartiendraient \u00e0 la Couronne, et d\u00e9cider autrement serait enlever tout sens au statut qu'il s'agit d'interpr\u00e9ter.\nC'est le statut de 1830 qui fixe la base de l'\u00e9valuation et de l'indemnit\u00e9 que la Couronne a \u00e0 payer. Le statut de 1940 ne fait que pourvoir \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure qui devrait \u00eatre suivie pour fixer cette indemnit\u00e9. Il s'accorde avec ses coll\u00e8gues pour rejeter l'appel.\nDevant la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada, les parties, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par leurs procureurs, ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ne pas contester le chiffre de l'\u00e9valuation fix\u00e9e par la R\u00e9gie des Services Publics \u00e0 la somme de $106,414.00, pour la valeur physique ou intrins\u00e8que du pont dont il s'agit; et l'appelante s'est attaqu\u00e9e \u00e0 la sentence arbitrale en pr\u00e9tendant que l'indemnit\u00e9 aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre fix\u00e9e d'apr\u00e8s la Loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et aurait d\u00fb comprendre non seulement la valeur physique des biens repris par la Couronne, mais \u00e9galement tous les avantages pr\u00e9sents et futurs que poss\u00e9daient ces biens pour son propri\u00e9taire.\nPar cons\u00e9quent, les dommages caus\u00e9s au r\u00e9sidu de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelante auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration pour fixer l'indemnit\u00e9. A tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, d'apr\u00e8s l'appelante, le droit au p\u00e9age ne se terminait que sur paie ment de la pleine et enti\u00e8re valeur des biens repris, et l'appelante a le droit d'en demander compte aux intim\u00e9s depuis la date de la prise de possession jusqu'au moment o\u00f9 l'indemnit\u00e9 sera pay\u00e9e.\nNous sommes d'accord avec l'Ordonnance de la R\u00e9gie et les opinions exprim\u00e9es par chacun des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi, pour dire qu'il ne s'agit pas ici d'une expropriation ordinaire.\nLa Loi de 1830 qui constitue le contrat qui doit servir de base \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision que nous avons \u00e0 rendre, pourvoyait d'avance au droit de la Couronne de reprendre possession du pont et de ses accessoires \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans cette Loi.\nEn plus, cette Loi d\u00e9clare express\u00e9ment ce qui devait se produire d\u00e8s que la Couronne d\u00e9ciderait d'exercer son droit de reprise.\nLa Couronne avait le droit\nto assume the possession and property of the said bridge, toll-house, turnpike and dependencies, and the ascents and the approaches thereto, upon paying to the said James Porteous, his heirs, executors, curators or assigns, the full and entire value which the same shall, at the time of such assumption, bear and be worth. (Section 3)\nPuis, comme cons\u00e9quence de cette reprise de possession et de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 par la Couronne,\nthe tolls shall, from the time of such assumption, appertain and belong to His Majesty, His Heirs and Successors, who shall from thence-forward be substituted in the place and stead of the said James Porteous, his heirs and assigns, for all and every the purposes of this Act. (Section 7)\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 ces deux textes nous semblent justifier l'attitude prise par la R\u00e9gie des Services Publics et par les honorables juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi. Tout au plus l'appelante pouvait-elle encore pr\u00e9tendre que la prise de possession ne devenait efficace en d\u00e9finitive que lorsque l'indemnit\u00e9 lui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement pay\u00e9e, bien que le texte de la section (7) serait certainement susceptible de l'interpr\u00e9tation que, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, d\u00e8s la prise de possession physique, les taux de p\u00e9age devaient appartenir imm\u00e9diatement et de ce moment \u00e0 la Couronne,\nwho shall from thence-forward be substituted in the place and stead of the said James Porteous * * * for all and every the purposes of this Act.\nMais il nous para\u00eet superflu d'entrer dans cette discussion parce que, \u00e0 notre avis, la Loi de 1940 aurait alors modifi\u00e9 cette interpr\u00e9tation possible.\nCette Loi, (chapitre 33 du statut de Qu\u00e9bec, 4 George VI) commen\u00e7ait par faire allusion aux privil\u00e8ges octroy\u00e9s sous la condition qu'apr\u00e8s 50 ans \u00e0 compter de la sanction de la Loi ant\u00e9rieure de 1930, Sa Majest\u00e9 aurait droit de prendre possession dudit pont et de ses d\u00e9pendances en en payant la valeur actuelle, et apr\u00e8s avoir ajout\u00e9\nque l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public exige que le gouvernement de cette province exerce ces pouvoirs,\nautorisa le Ministre des Travaux Publics \u00e0 prendre possession du pont au nom de Sa Majest\u00e9,\ny compris la maison de p\u00e9age, le chemin \u00e0 barri\u00e8re et les d\u00e9pendances, ainsi que les abords et mont\u00e9es dudit pont.\nIl n'est plus question l\u00e0 d'une prise de possession subordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 l'obligation de payer l'indemnit\u00e9 pr\u00e9alablement. Le statut ajoute sp\u00e9cialement que le tr\u00e9sorier de la province est autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 payer la pleine et enti\u00e8re valeur des biens ainsi appropri\u00e9s, telle que cette valeur existait\n\u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 le Ministre des Travaux Publics en prendra ainsi possession.\nPuis, le Ministre des Travaux Publics est autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 effectuer \u00e0 ces fin telles ententes qu'il croira justes avec les h\u00e9ritiers ou ayants droit du concessionnaire et, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d'entente, la prise de possession, la fixation et le paiement de la valeur du pont et de ses accessoires ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9s devront \u00eatre effectu\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'expropriation en vigueur.\nIl n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire, en l'esp\u00e8ce, d'avoir recours \u00e0 la Loi d'expropriation pour la prise de possession parce que l'appelante y a consenti. Elle l'a fait, il est vrai,\npour accommoder et coop\u00e9rer avec les autorit\u00e9s et \u00e9viter les proc\u00e9dures pr\u00e9vues par la Loi pour la possession pr\u00e9alable en mati\u00e8re d'expropriation, en ajoutant que\nd'autre part, la compagnie r\u00e9serve tous ses droits, pr\u00e9tention pour le transfert d\u00e9finitif de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, soit de gr\u00e9 \u00e0 gr\u00e9 ou par expropriation, tel que pr\u00e9vu au Bill n\u00b0 66\n(i.e. la Loi de 1940).\nCette r\u00e9serve \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 dire que l'appelante a r\u00e9serv\u00e9 tous ses droits, mais elle ne pouvait \u00e9videmment lui en conf\u00e9rer de nouveaux. Or, nous sommes d'avis que, en vertu de la Loi de 1940, toutes conditions pr\u00e9alables au droit de la Couronne de prendre possession, si l'on peut dire qu'il en existait en vertu de la Loi de 1830, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises de c\u00f4t\u00e9 par la Loi de 1940. En vertu de cette derni\u00e8re, la Couronne poss\u00e9dait le droit de prendre possession imm\u00e9diatement, sans conditions pr\u00e9alables et avec la seule obligation de payer l'indemnit\u00e9 pour la valeur actuelle des biens au moment de la prise de possession, et qui serait bien\n\u00e9tabli et fix\u00e9 au moyen de la proc\u00e9dure pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 la Loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'expropriation alors en vigueur.\nIl ne s'agit pas d'\u00e9tablir l'indemnit\u00e9 suivant les bases adopt\u00e9es et courantes en mati\u00e8re d'expropriation. Cette indemnit\u00e9 continuait d'\u00eatre r\u00e9gie par les termes de la Loi de 1830. Seule la proc\u00e9dure pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 la Loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'expropriation devait \u00eatre adopt\u00e9e pour arriver \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la \"pleine et enti\u00e8re valeur\" stipul\u00e9e \u00e0 la Loi de 1830.\nNous croyons donc que la R\u00e9gie et la Cour du Banc du Roi (en appel) n'ont pas commis d'erreur dans leur interpr\u00e9tation des deux Lois sp\u00e9ciales qui r\u00e9gissent l'affaire et que, en vertu de ces Lois auxquelles nous devons avoir recours exclusivement, l'appelante a obtenu tout ce \u00e0 quoi elle avait droit.\nNous sommes d'accord avec la Cour du Banc du Roi pour dire que ce litige, et en particulier l'appel dont cette Cour est saisie, doivent n\u00e9cessairement se borner \u00e0 l'avis d'expropriation tel qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9fini par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure lorsqu'elle a remis l'affaire entre les mains de la R\u00e9gie des Services Publics.\nL'indemnit\u00e9 se limite aux objets et aux biens qui ont fait le sujet de l'arbitrage de la R\u00e9gie. S'il est exact\u2014ce que nous ne pourrions d\u00e9celer au dossier qui nous est soumis\u2014que la Couronne a pris possession et s'est empar\u00e9e de biens autres que ce qui faisait l'objet de l'avis tel qu'amend\u00e9, il va sans dire que l'appelante n'a pas re\u00e7u d'indemnit\u00e9 pour ces biens additionnels et que tout recours \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard doit lui \u00eatre conserv\u00e9.\nMais nous croyons qu'elle n'a pas droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 pour ce qu'elle a appel\u00e9 la valeur de la franchise, vu que cette franchise s'est trouv\u00e9e \u00e9teinte le jour de la prise de possession du pont par la Couronne.\nIl s'en suit \u00e9galement qu'elle ne peut r\u00e9clamer de la Couronne les taux qui ont pu \u00eatre per\u00e7us \u00e0 partir du moment de la prise de possession du pont par cette derni\u00e8re. La Loi de 1830 est tr\u00e8s claire sur ce point; ces taux sont devenus la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la Couronne du moment de la prise de possession et, \u00e0 partir de ce moment, la Couronne a \u00e9t\u00e9 substitu\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appelante \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nLe pr\u00e9sent jugement ne doit, en aucune fa\u00e7on, \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme \u00e9liminant le droit de l'appelante \u00e0 toute r\u00e9clamation qu'elle pourrait avoir pour l'empi\u00e9tement de la Couronne sur des biens qui n'\u00e9taient pas d\u00e9crits dans l'avis d'expropriation.\nNous croyons qu'en effet cette question ne peut \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e dans le pr\u00e9sent appel; et l'appelante conserve tous ses recours \u00e0 raison des empi\u00e9tements, s'ils existent.\nMais sur l'appel tel qu'il est venu devant nous, nous sommes d'avis qu'il doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: L.

A collision occurred and D. was severely injured. The Crown (Dominion) disbursed a sum of $1,85524 for wages paid and medical and hospital services furnished through its Army organization during the period of incapacitation. The Attorney-General of Canada brought suit in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick to recover that amount from the respondent. Section 50 A of the Exchequer Court Act (enacted 1943-44, c. 25, s. 1) establishes a master-servant relationship between the Crown (Dominion) and a Canadian serviceman. Section 52 of the Motor Vehicle Act (N.B. 1934, c. 20) negatives any right of action against the owner or driver of a motor car for loss or damage resulting from injury to, or death of, a gratuitous passenger. The action was dismissed by the trial judge, and that judgment was affirmed by the appellate court.\nHeld that the appeal to this Court should be dismissed. The Crown, while bearing under section 50 A the relation of master towards a serviceman, has no direct or specific right of recovery against a third person for expenses incurred through injury caused by the latter to the serviceman: such right depends on whether the serviceman himself has any right of action arising from the act of the third person. Hence, where D., being a gratuitous passenger in the respondent's automobile at the time of his injury, could bring no action against the respondent, neither can the Crown.\nHeld also that the provisions of section 50 A applied not only to actions brought in the Exchequer Court of Canada, but also to proceedings brought in any provincial court.\nPer Kellock J.:\u2014The constitutional validity of section 50 A may be supported under section 91 (7) of the B.N.A. Act. APPEAL from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Appeal Division[1], affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Le Blanc J. and dismissing an action by the Grown (Dominion) to recover from the respondent, on the ground that he was a negligent driver of a motor car, amount of moneys paid to and on account of a Canadian serviceman injured while riding as a passenger.\nF. P. Varcoe K.C. and W. R. Jackett for the appellant.\nR. H. Allen, for the respondent at the hearing of the appeal.\nA. B. Gilbert K.C. for the respondent at the re-hearing ordered by the Court.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Taschereau, Rand and Estey JJ. was delivered by\nRand J.:\u2014This action arises out of injuries to a member of the Canadian Army in New Brunswick. The soldier, named Dunham, was on leave and was travelling to his home as a guest passenger with the respondent in the latter's auto. A collision occurred and the injuries resulted.\nThe claim is for wages paid and medical and hospital services furnished by the Crown through its Army organization during the period of incapacitation. It is based on negligence in the respondent, the relation of master and servant between the Crown and the serviceman, and the rule enabling a master to recover damages against one who negligently or wilfully injures his servant. This relation is put first as actual and alternatively as constructive by virtue of s. 50A of the Exchequer Court Act, enacted by c. 25, s. 1, of the statute of Canada 1943-44, as follows:\n50A. For the purpose of determining liability in any action or other proceeding by or against His Majesty, a person who was at any time since the twenty-fourth day of June, one thousand nine hundred and thirty-eight, a member of the naval, military or air forces of His Majesty in right of Canada shall be deemed to have been at such time a servant of the Crown.\nThe Motor Vehicle Act of New Brunswick, c. 20 of the statutes of 1934, has negatived any right of action of the serviceman against the respondent by s. 52, in the following language: 52(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 48, the owner or driver of a motor vehicle, other than a vehicle operated in the business of carrying passengers for hire or gain, shall not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from bodily injury to or death of any person being carried in or upon or entering or getting on or alighting from such motor vehicle.\nThe Supreme Court of that province has held that the relation was not that of master and servant in fact and that s. 50A of the Exchequer Court Act, being included\u2014as was assumed\u2014in a group of sections headed \"Rules for Adjudicating upon Claims,\" applied only to actions brought in that court.\nI do not find it necessary to decide the first of these questions. As to the second, it may be remarked that the amendment is embodied in an Act which contains nothing to indicate inclusion within the fasciculus mentioned; one could just as easily place it under the heading which immediately precedes s. 51 of the Exchequer Court Act, \"Effect of payment on judgment\". Its matter is foreign to rules for computing damages and its terms and purposes are clear. It might have been enacted as a separate statute and in that case it could hardly be contended that its wide provision did not apply to such a proceeding as the present: and I see no difference in the form which has been given to it.\nBut while the Crown, under the amendment, bears the relation of master toward the serviceman, the fact that the latter has no right of action arising from the act of the respondent puts, I think, an end to the controversy. The rule by which the master claims against a third person is an exception to the broad principle that one party to a contract cannot complain of negligence toward a co-contractor that interferes with the latter's performance of the contract: Cattle v. Stockton Waterworks Co.[2]. It applies whether the servant is at the time acting for the master or is engaged in his own affairs. There is no suggestion in the early cases that damages in loss of wages and medical and hospital expenses where those were actually suffered or incurred could not be recovered by the servant, and such claims are a commonplace today. Nor is it suggested that the master's right is independent of conduct or action by the servant which defeats the claim on his own part. What English authority there is tends to the contrary: Williams v. Holland[3]; Chaplin v. Hawes[4]. In Alton v. Midland R. Co.[5], Willes J. uses this language which is not within the criticism that has been made of the judgment in that case:\nIt must be admitted by the defendants that a long series of authorities has established that a master may sue for loss of services caused by a pure wrong, a trespass, to his servant, as by beating him. On the other hand, it is indisputable that no such action has ever been sustained in a case in which the injury to the servant was not actionable in respect of the civil wrong, but only in respect of a duty arising out of and founded upon a contract with the servant.\nAlthough it is the contrast between a civil wrong and the breach of a contractual duty that is being pointed here, nevertheless a civil wrong actionable by the servant seems to be indicated as a prerequisite to the right of the master. In Admiralty Commissioners v. S.S. Amerika[6] Lord Sumner says:\nThey are two separate causes of action in two different persons in respect of the same act.\nThe act here, in relation to the servant, is not in law culpable and unless we import into the right given to the master the conception of an independent duty running to him in addition to the duty to the servant\u2014an introduction which, in view of our ignorance of the principle underlying the rule and the comparative modernity of the concept of duty in negligence, I think wholly unwarranted\u2014we must conclude that it is the quality of the act vis-\u00e0-vis the servant which determines its significance for purpose of liability to the master. The notion of an act at once innocent and culpable would here be an innovation whatever the theory behind the liability; and I should say that if there is no wrong to the servant the act is innocuous toward the master. This qualification of the rule has been applied in Ontario where the claim was asserted by a parent for injury to his child, a right based on the same theory of deprivation of service: McKittrick v. Byers[7]. The United States authorities are uniform in the same view: Beach on Contributory Negligence, 3rd ed., p. 189. In these cases the cause of action of the (master was held to be dependent upon a right in the servant and to be defeated by the contributory negligence of the latter.\nThe case of Norton v. Jason[8], cited by Mr. Varcoe, decides only that the bar of the Statute of Limitations against the servant cannot be raised against the master. The case was of parent and child and there was no question of the existence of a cause of action in the daughter; but the fact that the point is raised would seem rather to assume the necessity of a right in the servant to support that of the master.\nThe injuria to the master is, then, a loss of service arising from an act which is an actionable wrong against the servant: and its effect is to permit the master to recover damages to a large extent the same as those in a proper case recoverable by the servant.\nThis view is indirectly supported by the reasoning in Attorney-General v. Valle-Jones[9], where it is said that if the wages and expenses had not been paid by the Crown they could have been recovered from the defendant by the injured serviceman. Conversely, if not recoverable directly by the servant, the law should not be circumvented through indirect but substantial recovery by the master.\nAs Dunham, then, could bring no action against the respondent, neither can the Crown. The amendment, s. 50A, does not purport to create a direct and specific right in the Crown: it places the Crown in a recognized common law relation only, and its rights are those arising from that relation under the rules of that law. The fact that jurisdiction over the civil right of the servant affects what might otherwise be a right in the Dominion Crown is immaterial. The Crown's right is of the same nature as that of a private person: it can arise here only from a wrong to the servant over which the jurisdiction of the province is exclusive.\nMr. Varcoe advanced the further contention that in any event the act of Jackson was a wrong against the Crown within the principle of Donoghue v. Stevenson[10]. There it was held by the House of Lords that a person who for gain engages in the business of manufacturing articles of food and drink intended for consumption by the members of the public in the form in which he issues them is under a duty to take care in the manufacture of these articles. Obviously the act of the manufacturer is specifically directed towards the consumer. If there were no consumer there would be no act, and it was not difficult to hold that, since a failure to observe care in that act might reasonably result in injury to the consumer, a duty toward the consumer to use care arose. But in the act with which we are dealing, only Dunham was in contemplation of the respondent. Conveying him to his home was a matter of fact to which the Crown was a stranger. Duty is annexed to prudent foresight of consequences in matter of fact and although we perhaps cannot say that a legal circumstance can never be a link in that fact, to apply the principle here would be to charge a person with a prevision of contractual relations with third parties, which Cattle v. Stockton Waterworks[11] decided cannot be done.\nThe claim thus failing because of a fatal defect in the cause of action, I do not find it necessary to consider the interesting constitutional questions bearing upon the legislative fields of the Dominion and the Province that were so thoroughly canvassed on the re-argument.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nKellock J.:\u2014This is an appeal by the plaintiff in an action brought in the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, King's Bench Division, for damages alleged to have been sustained by the Crown arising out of an injury to one Dunham, a member of the Veterans' Guard of Canada, on the 31st of October, 1940, the damages claimed being payments made by the Crown while Dunham was incapacitated. This soldier, a passenger in a motor vehicle owned and driven by the respondent, was injured when it came into collision with another motor vehicle occasioned, as it was alleged, by the negligence of the respondent. The trial judge found the respondent guilty of negligence, and this finding has not been interfered with by the Appeal Division. The trial judge, however, dismissed the action on the ground that the order in council under which payments had been made by the Crown had not been proven. The Appeal Division[12] did not proceed upon this ground but on the ground that the action did not lie. Baxter C.J., who delivered the judgment of the Court, held that the relationship of master and servant, essential for the maintenance of such an action, did not obtain as between Dunham and the Crown. It was held also that s. 50A of the Exchequer Court Act, enacted by c. 25 of the statutes of Canada 1943-44, is not applicable to an action in a provincial court, and that in any event the claim was barred by virtue of s. 52 of the New Brunswick Motor Vehicle Act, c. 20 of the 1934 statutes, Dunham being a gratuitous passenger in the respondent's car at the time of the accident.\nOn this appeal the Crown contends that:\n(1) the relationship of master and servant as between Dunham and the Crown did subsist at common law and that the point is now, in any event, concluded by s. 50A of the Exchequer Court Act;\n(2) that section is not limited to proceedings in the Exchequer Court of Canada;\n(3) section 52 of the Motor Vehicle Act does not affect the right of action of the appellant;\n(4) the damages were properly proven.\nIt will be convenient to examine the second ground of appeal.\nSections 47 to 50A, inclusive, of R.S.C. 1927, c. 34, entitled \"An Act Respecting the Exchequer Court of Canada\", constitute a fasciculus of sections under the heading \"Rules for Adjudicating upon Claims\". Section 50A was no doubt passed, partly at least, as a result of the decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada in McArthur v. The King[13]. That was the case of an action against the Crown under s. 19 (c) of the Act but the new section is made to apply to an action by, as well as against, His Majesty. The judgment below proceeds upon the footing that this group of sections is governed by the above heading and is confined to claims in the Exchequer Court of Canada.\nWhere the language of a section is ambiguous, the title and the headings of the statute in which it is found may be resorted to to restrain or extend its meaning as best suits the intention of the statute, but neither the title nor the headings may be used to control the meaning of enacting words in themselves clear and unambiguous: The \"Cairnbahn\"[14]; Fletcher v. Birkenhead Corporation[15].\nSection 50A taken by itself is not ambiguous. I think it is not to be applied only to proceedings in the Exchequer Court of Canada. It is not expressly limited as are ss. 47, 48 and 50. Section 49 is not limited in terms and there appears to be no reason why its terms should not apply to the subject-matter of proceedings taken by the Crown in a provincial court.\nSection 50A does not depend for its constitutional validity, in my opinion, upon s. 101 of the British North America Act. It may be supported under s. 91(7). In Grand Trunk Railway Co. v. Attorney General of Canada[16], Lord Dunedin at p. 68 said:\nIt seems to their Lordships that, inasmuch as these railway corporations are the mere creatures of the Dominion Legislature\u2014which is admitted\u2014it cannot be considered out of the way that the Parliament which calls them into existence should prescribe the terms which were to regulate the relations of the employees to the corporation.\nThis principle applies equally to the present question, namely, the relationship between a soldier and the Crown. I assume that there is no other question which would render the provisions of the section inapplicable at the time of the occurrence here in question to the relations between Dunham and the Crown.\nComing to the third question, s. 52 of the Motor Vehicle Act reads as follows:\n52(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 48, the owner or driver of a motor vehicle, other than a vehicle operated in the business of carrying passengers for hire or gain, shall not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from bodily injury to or death of any person being carried in or upon or entering or getting on or alighting from such motor vehicle.\nMr. Varcoe contends that the cause of action arising in favour of a master who loses the services of his servant through injury to the servant caused by the wrongful act of a third person is independent of any cause of action which may enure to the servant himself. He argues that an act, causing loss to the master through injury to the servant, may be wrongful quo ad the master and therefore actionable, even although, by reason of the existence of a statutory provision which disentitles the servant to sue but which does not affect the quality of the act, the servant himself has no remedy. Put another way, he says that if the injury to the servant is \"justifiable\", neither the master nor the servant has any cause of action but a provision which merely bars proceedings by the servant does not affect the cause of action vested in the master. He submits that the statutory provision here in question is of the latter character and does not purport to affect the quality of the act.\nMr. Varcoe referred to the judgment of Lord Blackburn in Darley Main Colliery Co. v. Mitchell[17] where in referring to the action \"per quod\" he said at p. 142:\n* * * but no amount of damage would give the master an action if the beating were justifiable.\nMr. Varcoe argues that \"justifiable\" is to be interpreted as \"innocent\" (Machado v. Fontes[18]) and as by reason of s. 37 of the Motor Vehicle Act negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle on a highway is made the subject of a penalty, the conduct of the respondent is not innocent.\nIt is important to keep in mind that the cause of action here in question is an anomalous one, having arisen at a time when the relationship of master and servant was based on status and that it is illogical in a society based on contractual obligation: per Lord Parker in The \"Amerika\",[19] at p. 45 and per Lord Sumner in the same case at pp. 54 and 60. In the words of Lord Sumner at p. 60:\nIndeed, what is anomalous about the action per quod servitium amisit is not that it does not extend to the loss of service in the event of the servant being killed, but that it should exist at all. It appears to be a survival from the time when service was a status.\nThe cause of action, therefore, is not to be extended beyond limits already marked out, however logical it might be to do so.\nA convenient statement of the action per quod is to be found in Blackburn and George on Torts, 1944 ed., p. 181, namely:\nIf A deprives B of his servant's services by a tort committed against the servant, B may sue A. In such a case B must prove (i) that A's actions are a tort against the servant; (ii) that B has thereby lost his servant's services. Accordingly, if the defendant's conduct does not constitute a tort against the servant, the master has no cause of action.\nThe provisions of sub-section (1) of section 52 of the Act eliminate any duty to take care civilly as between persons in the relative positions of the respondent and Dunham. That being so there is no negligence on the part of the respondent. There is therefore no tort which Dunham can rely on and there is no authority to which we have been referred or which I have been able to find establishing a right on the part of a master to sue in such circumstances. The fact that the respondent's conduct may render him liable to a penalty is not enough.\nThe action for seduction referred to by Lord Sumner in the case last cited (3) as the most artificial aspect of the action per quod is again itself anomalous in that the woman has no right of action: Salmond on Torts, 10th ed., pp. 356 and 361. In the case of a parent and child however, the parent's right to sue for damages for injury to the child was always affected at common law by contributory negligence on the part of the child: Blais v. Yachuk[20]; Hall v. Hollander[21]; Williams v. Holland[22]; McKittrick v. Byers[23]. I can find no authority showing that in the case of a true master and servant relation, the result was not the same. Unless therefore there be a wrong of which the servant can complain, with the single exception of seduction, referred to above, the master has no cause of action and in the case at bar there is no such wrong.\nIt is not necessary to deal with the other points argued. The appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: F. P.

In December 1942, it being considered that the goods had been undervalued, the Crown alleged that the Chief Dominion Customs appraiser, purporting to act under section 48, made fresh appraisals and sent the appellants a statement showing such appraised values and the amount of underpaid duty and taxes. Protests were made by the appellants and the matter was referred to the Minister of National Revenue, who, in August 1943, acting under the provisions of section 41, re-determined the value for duty of the goods imported by each of the appellants, and additional customs duty and taxes were demanded from them. Actions were brought to recover in each case such additional amount, or, in the alternative, the additional amount resulting (as contended) from the re-appraisal by the Chief Dominion Customs appraiser. The appellants submitted that the Minister had no jurisdiction under section 41 to determine increased values for duty purposes in respect of individual past importations on which duty had been assessed by the proper officer and paid and the goods released; and they also contended that the power vested in the Customs appraiser by section 48 was not and could not be exercised in these cases.\nHeld, The Chief Justice and Rand J. dissenting, affirming the judgments of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1945] Ex. C.R. 97 and 111), that the appellants were liable for the additional duty claimed by the Crown in accordance with the re-valuation determined by the Minister of National Revenue\u2014Section 41 is not solely prospective in its application. Parliament, when dealing in that section with cases where it was difficult to determine the value, was still dealing with goods that have actually been imported and appraised, upon which duty may also have already been paid; and the Minister was given power to determine the value for duty of such goods. Per Estey J.:\u2014Moreover, section 41 does not impose any time limit within which the Minister may act after importation.\nPer The Chief Justice and Rand J. (dissenting).:\u2014The Minister's power, under section 41, to determine the value for duty of imported goods, is not referable to past importations, which have already been legally appraised. Such power is restricted to future importations: it must be exercised at the time the importation takes place and the Minister's ruling must be antecedent to a valid allowance of the entry.\nHeld that the Crown cannot succeed on its alternative claim. There is no satisfactory evidence that a fresh appraisement under section 48 has been made by a Dominion appraiser and that there was any direction by him for an amended entry and payment of the additional duty. If that had been done, the appellants might have exercised their right to a re-valuation by a board selected under section 52.\u2014Per The Chief Justice:\u2014The alternative argument suggested by the Crown shows by itself that it has no basis in fact: both the Minister under section 41 and the Dominion appraiser under section 48 could not act at the same time, and the evidence establishes that what was done here was a determination by the Minister.\nAPPEALS from the judgments of the President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], maintaining actions by the Crown, on informations of the Attorney General of Canada, to recover from each of the appellants the additional amount of customs duty and taxes resulting from the determination by the Minister of National Revenue of the values for duty of certain goods imported into Canada in excess of those at which they had been entered for duty.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. for the appellants.\nJ. Singer K.C. and W. R. Jackett for the respondent.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting): These three cases were heard together and I intend to dispose of them by the same reasons.\nThe facts, as stated in the judgments of the learned President of the Exchequer Court[2], are as follows:\nDuring the years 1940, 1941 and 1942, the appellants imported into Canada large quantities of canned corn beef from Argentine, Uruguay and Brazil and paid custom duties based on the value at which the goods were entered for customs.\nOn December 16, 1942, the Commissioner of Customs of the Department of National Revenue notified the appellants that the importations appeared to have been undervalued and that he proposed to instruct the collectors at the various ports where their entries had been passed, to call for amending entries, accounting for additional duty on appraised values on all entries passed by them since January 1, 1940.\nAfter correspondence between the department and the appellants, or their representatives, the Department of National Revenue made an appraisal of the value of the imported goods, in excess of those at which they had been entered for duty, and directed the appellants to make amended entries and to pay additional customs duty and taxes; and, on April 6, 1943, it sent the appellants statements showing such appraised values and the amount of underpaid duties and taxes. No appeal from the appraisals was taken, but representations protesting against this were made to the Department by the appellants and their representatives.\nSubsequently, the matter was referred to the Minister of National Revenue, and, on June 29, 1943, the Minister advised the appellants' representatives, by letter, that it appeared that this might be a proper case in which to determine the value for duty under section 41 of the Customs Act, but that, before he decided what determination should be made, he would be glad to arrange an appointment to hear any further representations or to receive any further statement in writing.\nAn appointment was then arranged with the Minister on July 14, 1943, at which time he heard oral representations both by the appellants' representatives and by their counsel. Further written representations were also made. Finally, on August 19, 1943, the Minister made his determination to the effect that, on reviewing the circumstances and conditions of importation, it appeared to him and he found that such circumstances and conditions rendered it difficult to determine the value of the goods in question for duty, because:\n(1) Such goods are not sold for use or consumption in the country of production.\n(2) Such goods, by reason of the fact that the circumstances of the trade render it necessary or desirable, are sold under conditions or to a class of purchaser under or to which similar goods are not sold by the exporter for home consumption.\nThe Minister accordingly determined\nthat the value for duty of the canned beef imported into Canada from Brazil, Argentine and Uruguay, during the calendar years 1940, 1941 and 1942 by Messrs. Weddel Limited (and the other appellants), shall be as set forth in the statement attached as Schedule \"A\" hereto.\nIn the case of Weddel Limited, the schedule showed that the amount of additional customs duty and taxes payable by them amounted to $49,312.03.\nThe Deputy Minister of National Revenue (Customs and Excise) notified the appellant of the Minister's determination, sent a copy of the schedule and required the entries to be amended not later than September 2, 1943.\nOn the appellant's refusal to pay any additional duty or taxes, this action was brought, claiming the additional amount of customs duty and taxes resulting from the determination of the Minister, under section 41 of the Customs Act, (R.S.C. 1927, c. 42) and, in the alternative, the additional amount resulting (as contended) from the appraisal by the Chief Dominion Customs appraiser purporting to act under section 48.\nIn the Watt and Scott (Toronto) Limited case, the facts are the same except that the judgment is for $158,215.18; and the appellant suggests that there are two differences: no details were asked in this case, and the appellant is not a principal but only the agent of the owner.\nIn the Tees and Persse Limited case, the judgment is for $68,825.30, and it is subject to the same two differences as in the Watt and Scott case.\nAs already stated, the Minister purported to have acted under sections 41 and 48 of the Customs Act.\nThese two sections read as follows:\nSection 41. Whenever goods are imported into Canada under such circumstances or conditions as render it difficult to determine the value thereof for duty because:\n(a) such goods are not sold for use or consumption in the country of production; or\n(b) a lease of such goods or the right of using the same but not the right of property therein is sold or given; or\n(c) such goods having a royalty imposed thereon, the royalty is uncertain, or is not from other causes a reliable means of estimating the value of the goods; or\n(d) such goods are usually or exclusively sold by or to agents or by subscription; or\n(e) such goods by reason of the fact that the circumstances of the trade render it necessary or desirable are sold under conditions or to a class of purchaser under or to which similar goods are not sold by the exporter for home consumption; or such goods are sold or imported in or under any other unusual or peculiar manner or conditions;\nthe Minister may determine the value for duty of such goods, and the value so determined shall, until otherwise provided, be the value upon which the duty on such goods shall be computed and levied.\n(2) the Minister shall be the sole judge as to the existence of all or any of the causes or reasons aforesaid.\n***\nSection 48. If, upon any entry or in connection with any entry, it appears to any Dominion appraiser or to the Board of Customs that any goods have been erroneously appraised, or allowed entry at an erroneous valuation by any appraiser or collector acting as such, or that any of the foregoing provisions of this Act respecting the value at which goods shall be entered for duty have not been complied with, such Dominion appraiser or such Board may make a fresh appraisement or valuation, and may direct, under the valuation or appraisement so made, an amended entry and payment of the additional duty, if any, on such goods or a refund of a part of the duty paid, as the case requires, subject, in case of dissatisfaction on the part of the importer, to such further inquiry and appraisement as in such case hereinafter provided for.\nThe learned President gave judgment against each of the appellants for the amounts claimed by the respondent. On behalf of the appellants, it is contended that the Chief Dominion Customs appraiser did not make any appraisal of the value of the imported goods in excess of those at which they had been entered for duty, and did not direct the appellants to make amended entries and pay additional duty and taxes, as it is suggested in the judgment appealed from.\nAccording to the appellants, this was done by the Commissioner of Customs; and the point may be one of importance in connection with the alternative ground in the Minister's decision and in the action of the respondent.\nThe appellants submitted that these judgments were erroneous because, under section 41 of the Customs Act, the Minister had no jurisdiction to determine increased values for duty purposes in respect of individual past importations on which the duty had been assessed by the proper officer and paid, and the goods released. The appellants also claimed that the power vested in the Dominion Customs appraiser by section 48 of the Customs Act was not and could not be exercised in this case.\nUnder section 112 of the Customs Act, the true amount of Customs duty payable to His Majesty with respect to any goods imported into Canada shall, from and after the time when such duty should have been paid or accounted for, constitute a debt due and payable to His Majesty, jointly and severally, from the owner of the goods at the time of the importation thereof, and from the importer, as the case may be.\nUnder section 111, the importation is deemed to have been completed from the time the goods are brought within the limits of Canada.\nUnder section 35, whenever any duty ad valorem is imposed on any goods imported into Canada, the value for duty shall be the fair market value thereof, when sold for home consumption in the principal markets of the country whence and at the time when they were exported directly to Canada; and the Minister may determine the value of such goods and the value so determined shall, until otherwise provided, be the value upon which the duty on such goods shall be computed and levied, under regulations prescribed by the Minister.\nBut if the goods imported into Canada are under such circumstances or conditions as render it difficult to determine the value thereof for duty because of some of the reasons stated in section 41, the Minister may determine the value for duty of such goods, and the value so determined shall, until otherwise provided, be the value upon which the duty on such goods shall be computed and levied.\nIf one compares section 35 and section 41, it would seem, at first glance, that in the case of section 35 what is contemplated is a ruling (\"under regulations prescribed by the Minister\") which applies whenever the goods do not come under one of the conditions inserted in section 41.\nThere are some exceptions covered by sections 42 and 43 in respect of medicinal or toilet preparations or the valuation of imports considered as prejudicially or injuriously affecting Canadian producers.\nWe are not concerned with the latter.\nUnder ordinary circumstances, the Dominion Customs appraisers and every one of them, and every person who acts as such appraiser, or the collector, as the case may be, shall, by all reasonable ways and means in his or their power, ascertain, estimate and appraise the true and fair market value of the goods at the time of exportation and in the principal markets of the country whence the same have been imported into Canada, and the importer pays duties then and there upon taking possession of the goods.\nThe decision of any appraiser or collector as to the principal markets of the country, or as to the fair market value of goods for duty purposes, is subject to review by the Board of Customs; and, in that respect, the decision of the Board of Customs, when approved by the Minister, is final and conclusive, except as otherwise provided in the Act. Then, under section 52, if the importer is dissatisfied with the appraisement made of any such goods by the appraiser he may within six days give notice in writing to the collector of such dissatisfaction. Upon receipt of such notice, the collector shall at once notify the importer to select one disinterested and experienced person familiar with the character and value of the goods in question, and the collector shall select a second person of similar knowledge and notify the importer of such appointment.\nThen, the persons so selected, together with a third selected by the Minister from among the Dominion appraisers, shall examine and appraise the goods in accordance with the provisions of the Act, and the decision arrived at either unanimously or by a majority of them, shall be reported to the collector and shall be final and conclusive, and the duty shall be levied and collected accordingly.\nIt should be stated that all customs officers are local appraisers under the Act; and that, therefore, when the goods of the appellants in the present cases were imported into Canada and Were appraised by the Customs' officers acting as local appraisers and, the duties having been paid as assessed and asked for, the appellants took possession of their goods, everything required by the Customs Act had been complied with.\nI think the several sections to which I have just referred indicate correctly the whole scheme of the collection of duties for customs purposes provided for by the Act.\nSuch scheme therefore appears to be as follows:\nUpon arrival of the goods in Canada, the value thereof is ascertained by the local customs officer acting as appraiser; and, in the ordinary course of events, the duties are paid and the goods handed over to the importer. It may be that the value of the goods imported was already determined and has to be computed and levied under regulations prescribed by the Minister in conformity with section 35 of the Act.\nThe appraisal of the Customs officer is subject to review by the Board of Customs in accordance with subsection 4 of section 38, or may be made the subject of another appraisement by three disinterested and experienced persons, under the provisions of section 52.\nThe decision of the Board of Customs in the first case, when approved by the Minister, is final and conclusive; and so is the decision of the three appraisers under section 52.\nBut, if it should happen that the goods imported into Canada are under one or more of the circumstances or conditions mentioned in section 41, then the local Customs officers are not to act as appraisers; sections 35, 38 and 52 do not apply, and section 41 alone states what should be done:\nThe Minister may determine the value for duty of such goods, and the value so determined shall, until otherwise provided, be the value upon which the duty on such goods shall be computed and levied.\nIn those cases, the Minister is the sole judge as to the existence of all or any of the causes or reasons enumerated in section 41.\nIn the present case, the local appraisers, when the goods were imported, acted under sections 35 and 38 of the Act. There was no review of the decision made by the Board of Customs, under section 38, subsection 4, nor was there any notice of dissatisfaction and consequential appraisement under section 52.\nIn my view, therefore, there the whole matter lies. The several provisions of the Act covering the situation had been fully satisfied and there was no coming back against the importers, subject to what may be said about section 48.\nIt was only if, at the time of the importation (n.b. section 41: \"whenever goods are imported into Canada\" etc.,) on account of one or more of the reasons enumerated in section 41, the Customs officers acting as local appraisers found themselves unable to ascertain the fair market value, that the Minister was called upon to determine the value of the goods, upon which duty on such goods shall be computed and levied.\nBut it is only at that time and that is to say: at the time when the importation took place that the Minister could act under section 41. There is nothing in that section which authorizes the Minister and gives him jurisdiction to determine increased value for duty purposes in respect of individual past importations on which the duty has already been assessed by the proper officer, paid, and the goods released.\nThe alternative contemplated by the Customs Act is that either the appraisal takes place by the local Customs officers or it must be then and there made by the Minister, provided one of the conditions enumerated in section 41 applies.\nThe first alternative took place; the goods were appraised by the officer entitled to make the appraisal; the duty was paid; the goods were released; and that was complete compliance with the provisions of the Customs Act. The Minister had no jurisdiction to interfere and more particularly several years after the goods had been released.\nIf there was cause for dissatisfaction, the matter came under the jurisdiction of the Board of Customs or is covered by section 52 of the Act.\nThe Minister now says in his decision that these were not cases for the local appraisers, but rather cases coming under section 41 and where he alone could act.\nI could not find anything in section 41 giving him that power and authority, more particularly three years after the whole scheme of the Customs appraisal had been gone through in accordance with the Act.\nThere remains the new point very forcibly raised by Mr. Singer at the argument before this Court.\nHe said that even if the Minister, in the premises, was lacking of authority to act under section 41, in the alternative the Dominion appraiser could reopen the question by force of section 48; and he endeavoured to show that a re-appraisal had really been made by the Dominion appraiser in such a way that the determination of the value for duty of the goods in question was thereby made and supports the claims of the respondent in these several cases.\nSection 48 of the Customs Act may be again quoted here:\nIf, upon any entry or in connection with any entry, it appears to any Dominion appraiser or to the Board of Customs that any goods have been erroneously appraised or allowed entry at an erroneous valuation by any appraiser or collector acting as such, or that any of the foregoing provisions of this Act respecting the value at which goods shall be entered for duty have not been complied with, such Dominion appraiser or such Board may make a fresh appraisement or valuation and may direct, under the valuation or appraisement so made, an amended entry and payment of the additional duty, if any on such goods, or a refund of a part of the duty paid, as the case requires, subject, in case of dissatisfaction on the part of the importer, to such further inquiry and appraisement as in such case hereinafter provided for.\nUnder section 4 of the Customs Act,\nthere may be appointed * * * appraisers to be called Dominion Customs appraisers and assistant Dominion Customs appraisers, with jurisdiction at all ports and places in Canada; and Customs appraisers and assistant Customs appraisers with jurisdiction at such ports and places in Canada as are designated in an Order-in-Council in that behalf.\nThey shall, before acting as such, take a prescribed oath of office. If no appraiser is appointed in any port of entry, the collector there acts as appraiser, but without taking any special oath of office as such; and every appraiser is deemed an officer of Customs.\nThe Dominion appraiser is independent of the Department and, when he acts under section 48, he does so as a special officer with, as may be seen, the same powers as the Board of Customs.\nFor the purposes of section 48, they are both put on exactly the same footing.\nIt so happens that when the appellants were negotiating with the Department in connection with the announced intention that their goods were to be re-appraised and that the entries were to be amended, some of the correspondence exchanged between the Department and the appellants was signed by the then Dominion appraiser. But I could not interpret that correspondence to mean that the Dominion appraiser was at the time acting as such, and surely that intention was nowhere conveyed to the appellants.\nThe Department and the Minister were then purporting to act under section 41; the Dominion appraiser, who apparently was then also an employee of the Department, appears to have been carrying on some of the correspondence on behalf of the Department, and nowhere was it specifically mentioned that he was undertaking to act as a Dominion appraiser under section 48. It is not satisfactorily established that he made a reappraisal under that section, and that, under it, he directed an amended entry and payment of the additional duty.\nThe appellants were certainly not advised that he pretended to act under section 48; and one of the results to their prejudice, if it were to be so decided now, would be that they were deprived of the right to a re-valuation by a Board selected under section 52.\nI do not find in the record any satisfactory evidence that proceedings were ever gone through in conformity with section 48; and moreover, I am of opinion that, in the circumstances, that could not have been done, since the whole matter was then before the Minister, avowedly acting under section 41.\nBy force of that section, it is for the Minister to determine the value for duty of such goods, and it is upon the value so determined by him that the duty on the goods shall be computed and levied.\nMoreover, the Minister is the sole judge as to the existence of all or any of the causes or reasons enumerated in section 41.\nIt can not be contended that after the Minister has given his decision under section 41, the Dominion appraiser or the Board of Customs could yet review the case under section 48.\nThe Minister's determination is final for all purposes and the Dominion appraiser or the Board of Customs are ousted of any jurisdiction in the matter.\nLikewise, when the case stands to be decided by the Minister under section 41, the Dominion appraiser or the Board of Customs could not step in and proceed to make a re-appraisal so to say pendente lite.\nI simply look upon the suggestion that section 48 could be relied on to support the case of the respondent as a clever after-thought, upon the assumption that the assessments made in the present cases could not be otherwise supported.\nThe very fact that it is suggested as an alternative argument would in itself show that it has no basis in fact. Both the Minister, under section 41, and the Dominion appraiser, under section 48, could not act at the same time. It had to be one or the other; and the evidence is clearly to the effect that what was done here was a determination and a decision by the Minister under section 41.\nI am therefore of the opinion that, for the purposes of these cases, section 48 must be eliminated.\nWe have before us the decision of the Minister made under section 41, and I have already indicated that the Minister had no power to make those decisions under that section, in the circumstances.\nFor these reasons, I would allow the appeals and dismiss the Informations with costs in both Courts.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Hudson JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin J.:\u2014An information was filed in the Exchequer Court of Canada by the Attorney General of Canada on behalf of His Majesty the King, claiming from Weddel Limited the sum of $49,312.03 as being the additional amount of customs duty and taxes resulting from a determination of the Minister of National Revenue, purporting to act under section 41 of the Customs Act, R.S.C. 1927, chapter 42 and amendments, and, in the alternative, the sum of $50,415.12 as being the additional amount of customs duty and taxes resulting from an alleged appraisal by the Chief Dominion Customs Appraiser, purporting to act under section 48. The President of the Exchequer Court of Canada, before whom the matter came, determined that the claim for $49,312.03 was well-founded, and he accordingly gave judgment for that amount and costs without dealing with the alternative claim. From that judgment Weddel Limited now appeals.\nIn its factum, the appellant agrees with the following statement of facts appearing in the judgment of the learned President, subject only to what it describes as an important inaccuracy:\u2014\nDuring 1940, 1941 and 1942 the defendant imported into Canada large quantities of canned corned beef from the Argentine, Uruguay and Brazil and paid customs duties based on the values at which the goods were entered for customs. On December 16, 1942, the Commissioner of Customs of the Department of National Revenue notified the defendant that the importations appeared to have been undervalued and that he proposed to instruct the collectors at the various ports where its entries had been passed to call for amending entries accounting for additional duty on appraised values on all entries passed by it since January 1, 1940. After correspondence between the Department and the defendant or its Ottawa representative, the Chief Dominion Customs appraiser made appraisals of the values of the imported goods at $104,031.00 in excess of those at which they had been entered for duty and directed the defendant to make amended entries and pay additional customs duty and taxes amounting to $50,415.12, and, on April 6, 1943, sent the defendant a statement showing such appraised values and the amount of underpaid duty and taxes. No appeal from the appraisals was taken, but representations protesting against them were made to the Department by the defendant and its Ottawa representative. Subsequently the matter was referred to the Minister of National Revenue, and, on June 29, 1943, the Minister advised the defendant's Ottawa representative by letter that it appeared that this might be a proper case in which to determine the value for duty under section 41 of the Customs Act, but that, before he decided what determination should be made, he would be glad to arrange an appointment to hear any further representations or to receive any further statement in writing. An appointment was then arranged with the Minister on July 14, 1943, at which time he heard oral representations both by the defendant's Ottawa representative and by its counsel. Further written representations were also made. Finally, on August 19, 1943, the Minister made his determination as follows:\nMemorandum for: \"19th August, 1943,\nDavid Sim, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister of National Revenue,\nCustoms Excise.\nWhereas Messrs. Weddel Limited, Montreal, imported into Canada a quantity of canned beef duing the calendar years 1940, 1941 and 1942,\nAnd whereas, on reviewing the circumstances and conditions of importation, it appears to me and I find that such circumstances and conditions render it difficult to determine the value of the goods in question for duty, because\u2014\n(1) Such goods are not sold for use or consumption in the country of production:\n(2) Such goods, by reason of the fact that the circumstances of the trade render it necessary or desirable, are sold under conditions or to a class of purchaser under or to which similar goods are not sold by the exporter for home consumption.\nActing under the provisions of the Customs Act, I determine that the value for duty of the canned beef imported into Canada from Brazil, Argentine and Uruguay during the calendar years 1940, 1941 and 1942 by Messrs. Weddel Limited shall be as set forth in the statement attached as schedule \"A\" hereto.\nEncl.\nColin Gibson\nMinister of National Revenue.\"\nThe schedule showed that the amount of additional customs duty and taxes payable by the defendant amounted to $49,312.03. On August 21, 1943, the Deputy Minister of National Revenue (Customs and Excise) notified the defendant's Ottawa representative of the Minister's determination, sent him a copy of the schedule and required the entries to be amended not later than September 2, 1943. The appellant claims that the Chief Dominion Customs Appraiser did not make any appraisement of the values of the imported goods at $104,031.00 in excess of those at which they had been entered for duty, and did not direct it to make amended entries and pay additional customs and taxes amounting to $50,415.12. I may say at once that, in my opinion, the respondent is unable to succeed on its alternative claim. The correspondence and evidence make it clear that even if the Chief Dominion Customs Appraiser made a fresh appraisement under section 48, there was no direction by him for an amended entry and payment of the additional duty. If that had been done, the appellant, under section 52 of the Act, might have given notice in writing, within the prescribed six days, of its dissatisfaction and proceedings would thereupon have ensued for the selection of three persons to examine and appraise the goods, in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Any direction given was by the Commissioner of Customs.\nHowever, on the respondent's main claim, I have come to the same conclusion as the President although not for precisely the same reasons. The determination of this question involves a consideration of various sections of the Customs Act. Speaking generally, section 19 requires every importer of goods to make \"due entry\" of such goods, and by section 20, the person entering such goods is to deliver to the Collector of Customs, or other proper officer, an invoice and bill of entry in a prescribed form. This bill of entry, according to an exhibit filed, shows the importer's description of the goods imported, the quantity, the rate of duty, the value for duty in dollars, the total customs duty, the duty paid value, the war exchange tax, and the sales tax. In the present case the appellant paid, as it was obliged under section 22 to do, all duties and taxes so shown by it upon the canned corned beef it imported.\nBy subsection (1) of section 35:\u2014\nWhenever any duty ad valorem is imposed on any goods imported into Canada, the value for duty shall be the fair market value thereof, when sold for home consumption, in the principal markets of the country whence and at the time when the same were exported directly to Canada. By subsection (1) of section 38:\u2014\nThe Dominion Customs appraisers and every one of them and every person who acts as such appraiser, or the collector, as the case may be, shall, by all reasonable ways and means in his or their power, ascertain, estimate and appraise the true and fair market value, any invoice or affidavit thereto to the contrary notwithstanding, of the goods at the time of exportation and in the principal markets of the country whence the same have been imported into Canada, and the proper weights, measures or other quantities, and the fair market value thereof, as the case requires.\nIt will be necessary later to revert to some of the other subsections of these sections but, in the meantime, section 41, under which the Minister purported to act, should be read in its entirety:\u2014\n41. Whenever goods are imported into Canada under such circumstances or conditions as render it difficult to determine the value thereof for duty because\n(a) such goods are not sold for use or consumption in the country of production; or\n(b) a lease of such goods or the right of using the same but not the right of property therein is sold or given; or\n(c) such goods having a royalty imposed thereon, the royalty is uncertain, or is not from other causes a reliable means of estimating the value of the goods; or\n(d) such goods are usually or exclusively sold by or to agents or by subscription; or\n(e) such goods by reason of the fact that the circumstances of the trade render it necessary or desirable are sold under conditions or to a class of purchaser under or to which similar goods are not sold by the exporter for home consumption; or such goods are sold or imported in or under any other unusual or peculiar manner or conditions; the Minister may determine the value for duty of such goods, and the value so determined shall, until otherwise provided, be the value upon which the duty on such goods shall be computed and levied.\n2. The Minister shall be the sole judge as to the existence of all or any of the causes or reasons aforesaid.\nWhile other questions were apparently argued at the trial, the appellant's sole point in this appeal upon the Attorney General's main claim is on the construction of this section. Its contention is that the power given the Minister is either one to make a general ruling as to a class of importations for the future or, to quote its factum,\na power to choose individual past importations on which the duty has been assessed by the proper officer and paid and the goods released no matter how many years before, and determine a higher valuation and consequently, a higher duty whenever he thinks fit without there being any remedy. It may be conceded that if the section gives the Minister power to determine the value for duty of goods that have been imported and upon which duty has been paid, it may work a hardship in particular cases, depending, among other things, upon the length of time that has elapsed. However, it must be borne in mind that the Court does not know what information the Minister had before him and, as the appellant's counsel admits, this appeal is not, and could not be, on the merits of the decision of the Minister but is as to his jurisdiction.\nAlong with the relevant provisions of the Customs Act must be read subsection (1) of section 3 of the Customs Tariff Act, R.S.C. 1927, chapter 44 as amended, which, so far as pertinent, enacts:\u2014\n3. (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act and of the Customs Act, there shall be levied, collected and paid upon all goods enumerated, or referred to as not enumerated, in Schedule A to this Act, when such goods are imported into Canada or taken out of warehouse for consumption therein, the several rates of duties of Customs, if any, set opposite to each item respectively or charged on goods as not enumerated, in the column of the tariff applicable to the goods.\nProvision having thus been made for the levying, collecting and paying certain rates of customs duty upon goods imported into Canada, the value for duty of such goods, whenever any duty ad valorem is imposed, is taken care of by the general rule set forth in subsection (1) of section 35 of the Customs Act. That provision has been in the Act for some years and appeared as R.S.C. 1906, chapter 48, section 40. In 1922, by chapter 18, section 2, subject to an immaterial change, what are now subsections (2) and (3) of section 35 appeared as one paragraph, while what is now subsection (4) appeared as an unnumbered paragraph. The 1922 amendment reads as follows:\u2014\n2. Section forty of the Customs Act, chapter forty-eight of the Revised Statutes, 1906, is amended by adding thereto the following subsection:\u2014\n(2) In the case of importations of goods the manufacture or produce of a foreign country, the currency of which is substantially depreciated, the value for duty shall not be less than the value that would be placed on similar goods manufactured or produced in the United Kingdom and imported from that country, if such similar goods are made or produced there. If similar goods are not made or produced in the United Kingdom, the value for duty shall not be less than the value of similar goods made or produced in any European country the currency of which is not substantially depreciated. The Minister may determine the value of such goods, and the value so determined shall, until otherwise provided, be the value upon which the duty on such goods shall be computed and levied under regulations prescribed by the Minister.\nThe mere fact that in the revision of 1927 this enactment was divided into subsections (2), (3) and (4) cannot alter its proper construction.\nI pay some attention to this enactment because Mr. Geoffrion seeks to obtain some comfort from it. He points out that subsection (4) is the same as the last leg of subsection (1) of section 41 except for the words \"under regulations prescribed by the Minister\". Now, looking at subsection (1) of section 35, it seems to me that Parliament is there dealing with the fair market value of goods upon which an ad valorem duty is imposed by the Customs Tariff Act and saying in very plain terms that when such goods have been imported into Canada, the value for duty shall be as therein specified. Parliament is surely still dealing with goods that have been imported when in what are now subsections (2), (3) and (4) it takes care of the cases of the importations of goods, the manufacture or produce of a foreign country, the currency of which is substantially depreciated. In such cases the Minister is given power to determine the value of such goods that is goods that have been imported from such a foreign country. In order to make the Act work, the last part of subsection (4)\nand the value so determined shall, until otherwise provided, be the value upon which the duty on such goods shall be computed and levied under regulations prescribed by the Minister.\nmust mean that once the Minister has determined the value of such imported goods, such value, until otherwise provided, is to be the value upon which the duty, not only on the particular goods already imported, but also on goods of that class to be imported in the future, shall be computed and levied.\nWhen Parliament, in section 41, came to deal with cases where it was difficult to determine the value, it was still dealing, first of all, with goods that have actually been imported. Such, I think, is the fair and proper meaning of the opening words of subsection (1) \"Whenever goods are imported into Canada\", and the Minister was given power to determine the value for duty of such goods that had been imported. I would construe the last part of subsection (1) of section 41 in the same way as the last part of subsection (4) of section 35.\nThis is confirmed by the provisions of section 42:\u2014\nThe Minister shall in like manner and with the like effect determine the value for duty of all material imported to form medicinal or toilet preparations either alone or with other articles or compounds, and intended to be put up, labelled or sold under any proprietary or special name or trade mark: Provided that the Minister may refer to the appraising officers for valuation such of the materials as have a fair market value in the ordinary course of trade.\nWhen the Minister is empowered \"in like manner and with the like effect\" to \"determine the value for duty of all material imported\" Parliament was surely conferring upon him a power to be exercised with reference to material that had been imported. And finally, subsection (1) of section 43 demonstrates how Parliament proceeded when it intended to deal only with the fixing of the value for duty of any class or kind of goods for the future.\n43. (1) If at any time it appears to the satisfaction of the Governor in Council on a report from the Minister that goods of any kind not entitled to entry under the British Preferential tariff or any lower tariff are being imported into Canada either on sale or on consignment, under such conditions as prejudicially or injuriously to affect the interests of Canadian producers or manufacturers, the Governor in Council may authorize the Minister to fix the value for duty of any class or kind of such goods, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Act. the value so fixed shall be deemed to be the fair market value of such goods.\nMr. Geoffrion relied upon the words \"in any case or class of cases\" in subsection (4) of section 39:\u2014\n4. The Board of Customs may review the decision of any appraiser or collector as to the principal markets of the country, or as to the fair market value of goods for duty purposes; and the decision of the Board of Customs in regard to such principal markets, and value of goods for duty purposes in any case or class of cases, shall, when approved by the Minister, be final and conclusive, except as otherwise provided in this Act.\nThe Board of Customs is now the Tariff Board and some difficulties arose as to its power, which were considered in this Court (1). I am unable to perceive how the proper construction of this subsection really assists in the question before us. Even without relying upon section 2 of the Customs Act:\u2014\n2. All the expressions and provisions of this Act, or of any law relating to the Customs, shall receive such fair and liberal construction and interpretation as will best ensure the protection of the revenue and the attainment of the purpose for which this Act or such law was made, according to its true intent, meaning and spirit.\n(1) Reference concerning the Jurisdiction of the Tariff Board of Canada [1984] S.C.R. 588.\nI am of opinion that section 41 should be construed in the manner above indicated.\nIn the Weddel case the appellant is the owner but in each of the two other cases argued at the same time, the appellant is the importer, and by section 112 of the Act, the true amount of Customs duties payable with respect to any goods imported into Canada constitutes a debt due and payable to His Majesty jointly and severally from the owner of the goods at the time of the importation thereof and from the importer thereof. In all three cases this provision was referred to as indicating the severity with which the construction adopted might bear upon an importer who was acting merely as agent for the owner. This is quite true and the point has not been overlooked in arriving at a conclusion but as has already been stated, the Court is not seized of all the considerations that moved the Minister in proceeding as he did under section 41.\nThe appeals should be dismissed with costs.\nWeddel Limited v. The King\nRand J.:\u2014(dissenting): This appeal raises a question of the interpretation of section 41 of the Customs Act, which so far as it is material here is as follows:\nWhenever goods are imported into Canada under such circumstances or conditions as render it difficult to determine the value thereof for duty because\n(a) such goods are not sold for use or consumption in the country of production;\n***\n(e) such goods by reason of the fact that the circumstances of the trade render it necessary or desirable are sold under conditions or to a class of purchaser under or to which similar goods are not sold by the exporter for home consumption; or such goods are sold or imported in or under any other unusual or peculiar manner or conditions; the Minister may determine the value for duty of such goods, and the value so determined shall, until otherwise provided, be the value upon which the duty on such goods shall be computed and levied.\n2. The Minister shall be the sole judge as to the existence of all or any of the causes or reasons aforesaid.\nMr. Geoffrion argues that the determination by the Minister under this section is prospective only and is inapplicable to an entry of goods made before the Minister's decision. The point is narrow, but some light is thrown on it by other sections of the Act.\nThe value for duty is prescribed by section 35, and in certain exceptional circumstances special provisions are made as follows:\n35. Whenever any duty ad valorem is imposed on any goods imported into Canada, the value for duty shall be the fair market value thereof, when sold for home consumption, in the principal markets of the country whence and at the time when the same were exported directly to Canada.\n2. In the case of importations of goods the manufacture or produce of a foreign country, the currency of which is substantially depreciated, the value for duty shall not be less than the value that would be placed on similar goods manufactured or produced in Great Britain and imported from that country, if such similar goods are made or produced there.\n3. If similar goods are not made or produced in Great Britain, the value for duty shall not be less than the value of similar goods made or produced in any European country the currency of which is not substantially depreciated.\n4. The Minister may determine the value of such goods, and the value so determined shall, until otherwise provided, be the value upon which the duty on such goods shall be computed and levied under regulations prescribed by the Minister.\nSection 48 empowers a Dominion Appraiser or the Tariff Board to re-appraise and to direct amended entries and payment of additional duty. Dissatisfaction with a reappraisal is dealt with in section 52, which enables the importer to obtain the finding of a board of three valuators, one chosen by himself, one by the collector and the third by the Minister from among the Dominion appraisers. The decision of a majority of these valuators is final.\nI do not think it at all doubtful that the value determined by the Minister under section 41 does have a prospective application. The language\nand the value so determined shall, until otherwise provided, be the value upon which the duty on such goods shall be computed and levied\nis conclusive on that. The phrase \"until otherwise provided\" occurs likewise in subsection (4) of section 35 and there, beyond any doubt, it is restricted to future entries. But the question is whether section 41 is so limited. The language \"the value for duty of such goods\" is followed in the admittedly prospective sense by \"the value upon which the duty on such goods\" shall be computed. Now, what is the meaning, first, of the word \"value\" and then of \"such goods\" as they appear in both cases? Certainly in the second use, \"value\" must mean \"unit value\" and \"such goods\" must mean \"such class of goods\" for only in those senses could they have a future application. Can we fairly say that in their first use they mean something different? In the close context presented, I do not think so. If \"value for duty of such goods\" was intended to mean the fair market value of the goods of a specific entry, then the transfer of meaning would, ordinarily, have been accompanied by a corresponding verbal change. It is \"the value so determined\" that is prescribed for the future. If intended to be retroactive as well, surely there would have been some such word as \"also\" after the word \"shall\" rather than a precise repetition. It is not immaterial that the finding of the Minister is final and in a real sense arbitrary. This may be of no individual consequence for future importations, but it might be of utmost consequence for those of the past. I, therefore, treat the words in both cases as signifying \"unit value\" and \"such class of goods\"; and in that sense, the text does not permit us to relate the Minister's ruling to past entries that have been appraised.\nSection 42 is as follows:\n42. The Minister shall in like manner and with the like effect determine the value for duty of all material imported to form medicinal or toilet preparations, either alone or with other articles or compounds, and intended to be put up, labelled or sold under any proprietary or special name or trade mark: Provided that the Minister may refer to the appraising officers for valuation such of the materials as have a fair market value in the ordinary course of trade.\nBut by this language, the ascertainment of value is taken away from the appraisers except as it may be referred to them by the Minister. No appraisal can be made and no entry allowed until the Minister acts. His action is not retroactive in the sense of changing a valuation already made and used under the authority of the statute: it is precedent to valuation. But no one suggests that in this case initially value was not legally ascertained, the appraisal made, the entry allowed and the goods properly released; the Dominion appraiser and the Deputy Minister were acting, though in terms of unit value, in revision of the appraisal; and the contention really is that the Minister under section 41 may, in respect of an entry passed and allowed, supersede an appraisal validly made and make a new appraisal. If the entry here had been held for the Minister's decision whether the situation was one in which he should act, there would, in the proper sense, be no retroactivity; dealing with or passing the entry would be suspended, and the appraisal would be originally made on the basis of unit value laid down by the Minister. So interpreted, the two sections are identical in effect, and neither provides for action by the Minister affecting an entry of goods completed by payment of duty in accordance with an appraisal made under the authority of the statute: there is no ex post facto application of the Minister's arbitrary finding and the importer has preserved to him his rights of appeal under section 52.\nThis brings out clearly the distinction between fixing value and appraisal: the Minister does not appraise; he determines unit value in accordance with which the collectors and appraisers are to carry out their duty. But in such a case as the present, they have already legally appraised, and the entry has been made and allowed. Section 41 does not provide for a re-appraisal or an amendment to the entry, and section 48 does not apply. What the Crown sues for does not appear on the records of the collector at the port of entry, and the proceeding is based on the Minister's letter. Surely nothing could be more conclusive that the Minister's ruling must be antecedent to a valid allowance of the entry, and that when that is done there remains only revision by the Dominion appraisers or the Tariff Board under section 48.\nBut Mr. Singer raises a further point. He says that a re-appraisal by a Dominion appraiser had been made before the Minister entered the controversy, which the invalidity or inapplicability of the Minister's ruling leaves untouched. This necessitates a consideration of the communications which have passed between the Department and the importers. The first letter is from the Commissioner of Customs to the appellant, dated December 16, 1942, the whole of which I quote:\nOn reviewing past importations of canned corned beef, a wide discrepancy has been found between the values upon which your firm has paid duty and those declared by exporters of other Canadian suppliers. This discrepancy is so marked that I cannot conceive that it would be accounted for by market fluctuations or difference in quality and I can only conclude that your importations have been undervalued. In the circumstances, therefore, I propose to instruct our Collectors at the various Ports where your entries have been passed to call for amending entries accounting for additional duty on appraised values on all entries passed by your firm since 1st January, 1940. Before issuing these instructions, however, I am prepared to discuss the matter with you in order to arrive at a fair valuation for the purpose of these amendments and future importations.\nThe next was under date of March 29, 1943 from the Commissioner, and the material paragraphs are:\nA careful study of importations during the period under review shows that, based on values information now before the Department, the canned corned beef imported by your Company has been undervalued to the extent of $92,229.00, resulting in duty and taxes short-paid amounting to $45,425.74.\nYou are requested to forward a certified cheque for the above amount direct to the Department to cover the amendment of the entries in question.\nThe period under review was the years 1940, 1941 and 1942.\nThe appellant answered on March 31, 1943, and the Commissioner was asked for details of the additional value and duty; the reply was under date of April 6, 1943 by the Chief Dominion Customs Appraiser, which included a statement on the importations during the years mentioned and added\nUpon further review the undervaluation was found to be greater than as stated in the Department's letter addressed to you on the 29th ultimo.\nThere followed under dates of the 16th and 17th of April, communications from P. F. Jackson, a customs broker of Ottawa on behalf of the appellant, addressed to the Commissioner, asking an extension of time until the end of April to enable the appellant to obtain additional information from Argentina. A reply was sent by the Chief Appraiser under date of the 19th of April:\nAs advised verbally on the 17th instant, this matter has been discussed with the Acting Commissioner of Customs, Mr. Sim, and, in view of all the circumstances, he has agreed to an extension of time to the 5th May, 1943, on the distinct understanding that arrangements for the amendment of the entries, satisfactory to the Department, will be made by that time.\nOn May 4, Jackson addressed a further letter to the Acting Commissioner, in which a request was made to the Department \"to vacate their ruling in this matter, and to withdraw the assessment.\" On May 10, the Acting Commissioner wrote Jackson:\nThis is an interim acknowledgment of brief of the 4th May in the above regard which you left with me at our conference on the 4th May, and also of your letters of the 5th and 7th May dealing with the same case.\nThere are one or two points on which I feel I should have the benefit of advice from the law officers of the Crown, and when I have had an opportunity of consulting them I shall communicate with you again.\nThe next letter from the Department was dated June 29, 1943 addressed by the Acting Commissioner to Jackson:\nWith further reference to my letter of the 10th May in regard to the appraisal of Canned Corned Beef imported from South America by your clients, Messrs. Weddell Ltd., Watt & Scott, and Teese & Persse, following consultation with our legal advisers I have referred this matter to the Honourable, the Minister, and I understand that he is writing to you today.\nSuch a letter from the Minister followed, in which he stated that it appeared to him the matter was a proper case for him to proceed to determine the value for duty under the provisions of section 41 on the statutory grounds I have quoted. He then intimated that he would arrange an appointment to hear further representations. These apparently were made, but subsequently on August 19, 1943, a formal ruling was made by him on the alternative basis of which these proceedings have been brought.\nThis correspondence makes it clear to me that although a tentative re-appraisal appears to have been made by the Department, and although the correspondence does raise the matter of amendment of the entries, there was neither a specific re-appraisal by a Dominion appraiser nor a definitive requirement to amend; and the revised statement was withdrawn by the official who first submitted it to the appellant on his reference of the matter to the Minister.\nNow under a re-appraisal, the importer is entitled to a board of valuators; but to enable him to follow the procedure laid down, it is necessary that the steps taken by the Dominion appraiser be in accordance with that procedure, and carry some degree of formality and finality. These conditions not only were not present here, but the steps, attributing them to an appraiser, even in their provisional form, were abandoned. To hold the appellant to the inconclusive departmental negotiation and deprive it of its rights under section 48 would be a denial of elementary fairness.\nI would allow the appeal and dismiss the information with costs in both Courts.\nWatt & Scott (Toronto) Ltd. v. The King\nRand J. (dissenting): The facts of this case raise the same questions as are considered in the appeal of Weddel Limited, and as I see no material difference between the correspondence with the Department there considered and that here, I would hold the Department to have taken the same action in relation to the tentative re-appraisal.\nThe appeal should therefore be allowed, and the information dismissed with costs in both Courts.\nTees & Persse Limited v. The King.\nRand J. (dissenting): The facts of this case raise the same questions as are considered in the appeal of Weddel Limited, and as I see no material difference between the correspondence which the Department there considered and that here, I would hold the Department to have taken the same action in relation to the tentative re-appraisal.\nThe appeal should therefore be allowed, and the information dismissed with costs in both Courts.\nEstey J.:\u2014The appellants imported into Canada goods from Brazil, Uruguay and Argentine throughout the years 1940, 1941 and 1942. The duty was paid and the goods released when on December 16, 1942, the Commissioner of Customs intimated that there had been an undervaluation. This was followed by correspondence, conferences and submissions until June 29, 1943, when the Minister of National Revenue advised that these goods would be valued for duty purposes under section 41 of the Customs Act, (1927 R.S.C., c. 42). The values so determined by the Minister were greater than those disclosed in the invoices, and these actions were brought to recover the consequent increase in duty. The issues in each case are identical and were so presented upon the hearing of these appeals.\nThe appellants contend that in determining these valuations the Minister exceeded the authority vested in him by section 41. That under that section he had no authority\nto determine increased values for duty purposes in respect of individual past importations on which the duty had been assessed by the proper officer and paid and the goods released.\nSection 41 is included in a group of sections numbered 35-53, inclusive, under a heading \"Valuation For Duty\". The first of these sections, (sec. 35), provides \"the value for duty shall be the fair market value\" as determined by reference to the domestic market in the country of export. If that value could always be accepted or ascertained some of the following sections would be unnecessary.\nThe provisions of section 35 indicate how that market value will be determined where the currency in the exporting country is depreciated.\nSection 36 fixes a minimum value for duty purposes on new or unused goods and section 36A empowers the Governor in Council, whenever it is deemed expedient, to authorize the disregarding of import, excise and other duties and taxes in estimating the value for duty purposes. Section 38 deals with the methods of appraisers and collectors of customs duties in the determination of fair market value; and subsection (4) thereof provides as follows:\n38. (4) The Board of Customs may review the decision of any appraiser or collector as to the principal markets of the country, or as to the fair market value of goods for duty purposes; and the decision of the Board of Customs in regard to such principal markets, and value of goods for duty purposes in any case or class of cases, shall, when approved by the Minister, be final and conclusive, except as otherwise provided in this Act.\nSections 39 and 40 deal with drawbacks and deductions.\nThe intent and purpose of these sections is the determination of value for duty purposes in the more routine or usual conditions that obtain in the importation of goods into Canada. They indicate the basis for valuation, provide for certain special facts in appropriate cases, a review of the valuation as determined by the Customs Board and an appeal under section 52 by the importer if he be dissatisfied with the appraisement.\nWe then come to section 41 which deals with the more unusual cases where, for reasons therein set out, it is difficult to determine the value for duty purposes. This section places upon the Minister the responsibility of deciding whether these difficulties exist and if so, he may determine \"the value for duty of such goods\". It then continues,\nand the value so determined shall, until otherwise provided, be the value upon which the duty on such goods shall be computed and levied.\nSection 41 reads as follows:\n41. Whenever goods are imported into Canada under such circumstances or conditions as render it difficult to determine the value thereof for duty because\n(a) such goods are not sold for use or consumption in the country of production; or\n(b) a lease of such goods or the right of using the same but not the right of property therein is sold or given; or\n(c) such goods having a royalty imposed thereon, the royalty is uncertain, or is not from other causes a reliable means of estimating the value of the goods; or\n(d) such goods are usually or exclusively sold by or to agents or by subscription; or\n(e) such goods by reason of the fact that the circumstances of the trade render it necessary or desirable are sold under conditions or to a class of purchaser under or to which similar goods are not sold by the exporter for home consumption; or such goods are sold or imported in or under any other unusual or peculiar manner or conditions; the Minister may determine the value for duty of such goods and the value so determined shall, until otherwise provided, be the value upon which the duty on such goods shall be computed and levied.\n2. The Minister shall be the sole judge as to the existence of all or any of the causes or reasons aforesaid.\nAs already intimated, the sections preceding section 41 provide for the cases where the market value can be determined by the usual and routine commercial inquiries. Section 41 deals with the cases of goods where difficulties obtain in the determination of that value. These sections do not overlap. Both are necessary if the field of importation is to be adequately covered. Section 35 contemplates the determination of value for duty purposes after the goods have been \"imported into Canada\" as that phrase is interpreted in section 111:\nSec. 111. For the purpose of the levying of any duty, * * *\n(a) The importation of any goods * * * shall be deemed to have been completed from the time such goods were brought within the limits of Canada, * * *\nSection 35 commences \"whenever any duty ad valorem is imposed on any goods imported into Canada\". Apart from the words \"any duty ad valorem is imposed\" the opening words of that section are almost identical with those of section 41:\nSec. 35. Whenever any duty ad valorem is imposed on any goods imported into Canada * * *\nSec. 41. Whenever goods are imported into Canada * * *\nThere can be no question but that section 35 applies as and when goods are imported. In adopting almost the identical words Parliament indicated its intention that the value under section 41 should likewise be determined as and when goods are imported into Canada. It is \"whenever goods are imported\", or at any time when goods are \"brought within the limits of Canada\" and the difficulty as to valuation arises that the Minister is authorized to act under the provisions of section 41.\nThroughout section 41 the phrase \"such goods\" appears several times and each time relates back to the phrase \"whenever goods are imported\" as it appears in the first line of the section. It is the specific goods imported as distinguished from a class or kind of goods that may be imported, and it is the value of these specific goods which is determined by the Minister under section 41. In section 43 where Parliament uses the phrase \"to fix the value for duty of any class or kind of such goods\", it is dealing with future importations. The specific goods that \"are being imported\" have created a situation which Parliament authorizes the Minister to take steps to avoid in the future. In order to do so he deals not only with the specific goods that \"are being imported\" but with \"any class or kind of such goods\" that may make for a continuation of that condition. There is no such authority vested in the Minister under section 41; there he is restricted in the determination of value to the goods imported. It is obvious under section 41 that once the value is determined it will apply to future importations, but it would appear that had Parliament intended section 41 to apply only to future importations it would have used language that would have indicated that intention as it did in section 43.\nIt was the inadequacy of the preceding sections to deal with the difficulties specified in section 41 that prompted Parliament to pass that section, and it is only when such goods are imported that the Minister may determine their value under that section.\nMoreover, Parliament has provided in section 42 \"in like manner and with the like effect\" (as in section 41) the Minister shall\ndetermine the value for duty of all material imported to form medicinal or toilet preparations, * * *\nIn other words, whenever the goods described in section 42 are imported then the Minister shall determine the value for duty and that value so determined shall, until otherwise provided, be the value. Such would appear to be the meaning of the phrase \"in like manner and with the like effect\". It is the importation of the goods that vests in the Minister the authority to determine the value, and as under section 42 he alone can do so, this section appears to cover both past and future importations. It could not be suggested that Parliament intended by this provision that if the collector in error accepted the invoice price as the value for duty that that would prevent the Minister from determining the value for duty purposes as Parliament has specifically directed. Then too, in section 42 there is a proviso that if the Minister decides the said goods have a fair market value in the ordinary course of trade he may refer the matter back to the appraising officers to deal with them in the ordinary routine way. In other words, section 42 appears to provide for a return of the goods to the ordinary routine procedure when the Minister so decides, just as in section 41 they are taken out of that procedure when the Minister so decides.\nIt is submitted, however, that the words \"until otherwise provided\" are inconsistent with this construction and consistent only with a construction that restricts the application of section 41 to future importations. Such a construction would appear to be contrary to the opening words of the section and to what appears to be the intent and purpose of the section. It is the determination of the value of \"such goods\" and the value so determined that \"until otherwise provided\" shall be the value. The determination thereof by the Minister must involve considerable investigation and inquiry and in order to avoid the necessity of doing this work each time such goods are imported, it is provided that the \"value so determined shall, until otherwise provided, be the value\". The Minister is thereby enabled to avoid the time and trouble incident to inquiry and investigation in each case.\nThe same phrase \"until otherwise provided\" appears in section 35 (4). It is not at all clear that that subsection is necessarily restricted to future importations.\nIt was pointed out that such a construction may impose a hardship upon those called upon to pay additional duty some time after the importation and the payment of the duty as then determined. If so, it is the identical hardship that may at any time be imposed upon importers under sections 38 (4) and 48; indeed, had the Minister in this case seen fit to allow the matter to remain to be dealt with under the ordinary procedure the result would have been similar. In other words, such hardship as may from time to time occur must have been regarded by Parliament as unavoidable.\nThe contention of the appellants would raise the question that even if the Minister might determine the value of goods as and when imported, he cannot do so after \"the duty has been assessed by the proper officer and paid and the goods released\". Section 41 does not impose any time limit within which the Minister must act after importation. In this regard these provisions are identical with those providing for a \"review * * * as to the fair market value\" as in section 38 (4) and for \"a fresh appraisement or valuation\" as in section 48. The absence of any time limit is in keeping with the policy of the Act and was obviously not an oversight. Moreover, the difficulties of valuation contemplated by section 41 might appear at the port of entry but might not appear until the officials were considering the value of the goods and deciding whether any error or mistake existed and whether or not further proceedings should be taken. It is the presence and existence of the difficulty that Parliament is seeking to deal with whenever in the opinion of the Minister it may appear. If the usual methods of determination of value were inappropriate and unsuitable in the first instance, they are equally so upon proceedings taken under sections 38 (4) or 48. A construction of the section that restricts the intervention of the Minister as contended for would be to add words of limitation to the section which were not only not incorporated by Parliament but would appear to defeat the intent and policy of the Act in the determination of value for the purpose of duty.\nThe statute throughout contemplates the production at the port of entry of an invoice giving the quantity and value of each kind of goods so imported, the entry thereof and the payment of duty before the goods are passed through the customs and delivered to the consignee. That the value so declared and the duty there calculated are not final is made abundantly clear by the sections providing for a review and a fresh appraisal or valuation. The reason is obvious. It avoids delays at the port of entry and the loss and inconvenience necessarily incidental thereto to importers. It is after all this that the values may be checked and reviewed and adjustments made. If in the course of this checking and reviewing a proper case in the opinion of the Minister for his intervention under section 41 arises, it is his duty to so intervene.\nThe Act contemplates the intervention of the Minister to deal with an unusual situation, one that presents certain difficulties that cannot be dealt with under usual methods of procedure of the Act and therefore his decision is final. This Court has already ruled that the provisions of section 48 do not apply to determinations made by the Minister: Reference Concerning the Jurisdiction of the Tariff Board of Canada,[3] where my Lord the Chief Justice, at p. 549, states as follows:\nPerhaps it may be added that the jurisdiction of the Dominion appraiser or of the Board under s. 48 is only by way of appeal from a valuation or appraisal by an appraiser or collector as such. It would therefore appear that the exercise of the powers therein conferred presupposes a valuation or appraisement; and the consequence would be that when the value for duty is fixed by the Minister, and not by an appraisement, the section does not apply and the Dominion appraiser, or the Board, has no jurisdiction under it.\nIn view of the foregoing it is unnecessary to deal at length with the alternative claim made by the Crown on the basis that the appraiser under section 48 had fixed the valuation for duty purposes. After the intimation under date of December 16, 1942, by a letter signed by the Commissioner of Customs that there had been an undervaluation, further correspondence and interviews followed which were concluded by a letter dated June 29, 1943, signed by the Acting Commissioner of Customs intimating that the matter had been referred to the Minister of National Revenue. The Dominion appraiser, who was also a departmental official, signed a letter or two but not as Dominion appraiser. He did not sign the letter upon which the Crown relies nor is there any intimation that it contained his decision as Dominion appraiser. Moreover, there was no intimation that the provisions of section 48 were being or would be involved. It seems quite obvious that it never occurred to the appellants that action was being taken under section 48. There never was a direction for an amended entry or for payment of the additional duty under section 48. It would seem that after all the efforts to determine the valuation the officials in the department realized this was an importation of goods that should be referred to the Minister. After consideration the Minister concluded this was a proper case for the application of the provisions of section 41. In my opinion there was no appraisal made under section 48.\nI would therefore dismiss the appeals with costs.\nAppeals dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Geoffrion & Prud'homme.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Robert Forsyth.\n[1] [1945] Ex.

C.\nThe petitioner was convicted on September 22, 1944, in respect of three separate charges under section 436 Cr. C. and was sentenced on each charge to be fined $5,000 or, in default of payment, to serve consecutively two years in gaol and, in addition, was further sentenced on each charge to serve one year in gaol, such sentence to run concurrently. The petitioner paid the fines and served the additional sentence of one year. On October 18, 1944, the Attorney General for Ontario gave notice of appeal against the additional sentence; but the appeal was not heard until May, 1946, at which time the petitioner, having served the sentence, had been released from gaol. The appellate court ordered that the sentence be increased on each of the charges for a further term of one year to run consecutively. The petitioner was re-arrested and incarcerated. He then moved for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that he is detained illegally because there was no longer jurisdiction in the appellate court to increase the sentence imposed on him. The ground raised by the petition is that, under sections 1078 and 1079 Cr. C., the petitioner having undergone his sentence, this had \"the like effect and consequences as a pardon under the great seal\" and that, from that moment, he was \"released from all further or other criminal proceedings for the same cause\".\nHeld that the petition is not well founded and that the writ should not issue.\nHeld, further, that, as the same point has been submitted to the appellate court and that court had dismissed it, there would appear to be res judicata on the subject matter by a court competent to dispose of the objection; and the present petition, under the circumstances, might well be considered as an attempt to appeal indirectly from the judgment of the appellate court, where no direct right of appeal lies.\nMOTION before The Chief Justice of Canada in Chambers, for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus, the petitioner claiming that he was illegally detained in gaol on the grounds stated in the head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nS. A. Hayden K.C. for the motion.\nJohn J. Robinette K.C. contra.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014The petitioner was convicted on a plea of guilty on the 22nd day of September, 1944, in respect of three separate charges, under section 436 of the Criminal Code, as amended by 1939, chapter 30, section 8, and was sentenced on each charge to be fined $5,000 or, in default of payment, to serve two years in gaol, such sentence of two years to be served consecutively, and, in addition, was further sentenced on each charge to serve one year in gaol, such additional sentence to run concurrently.\nThe petitioner has paid the said fines and has served the said additional sentence of one year concurrently on each of the said charges.\nOn the 5th day of October, 1944, the Attorney-General for Canada gave notice of appeal against the sentence imposed, and, on the 18th day of October 1944, the Attorney-General for the province of Ontario gave similar notice. But through circumstances about which the petitioner does not complain, the appeal was not heard by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, until the 3rd day of May, 1946, at which time the petitioner had served the sentence of one year imposed on him, and had been released from the gaol where he had served his term of imprisonment.\nThe Supreme Court of Ontario, Appellate Division, ordered that the additional sentence of one year in gaol on each of the above charges be varied by increasing the sentence on each of the said charges by a further term of one year, and the said increased sentence to run consecutively. The petitioner was re-arrested on the 6th day of June, 1946, and is presently confined at Kingston penitentiary, serving the increased sentence imposed on him as the result of the appeal.\nIt is now claimed that the petitioner is being detained illegally because there was no longer jurisdiction in the Supreme Court of Ontario, Appellate Division, to increase the sentence imposed on Brown as a result of which the arrest was made on the ground that, under sections 1078 and 1079 of the Criminal Code, the petitioner having undergone his sentence and having endured the punishment adjudged by the trial judge, this had \"the like effect and consequences as a pardon under the great seal\" and that, from that moment, he was \"released from all further or other criminal proceedings for the same cause\" and the court of appeal could no longer deal with the matter.\nAfter having heard the very able argument on behalf of the petitioner pleading for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus, I am of opinion that the petition is not well founded and that the writ should not issue.\nUnder subsection (2) of section 1013 of the Criminal Code, the Attorney-General could, with leave of a court of appeal or a judge thereof, appeal to that court against the sentence passed by the trial court, unless that sentence was one which was fixed by law. This was done within the required delay.\nUnder section 1015, subsection (2), a judgment whereby the court of appeal increased the punishment of an offender, as happened in the premises,\nshall have the same force and effect as if it were a sentence passed by the trial court.\nReading that section 1015 (2), together with sections 1078 and 1079, as they should be, my opinion is that the \"punishment\" referred to in section 1078 and the \"imprisonment\" referred to in section 1079 mean the punishment or the imprisonment as finally determined by the court of appeal, in cases where there has been an appeal, and which, by force of section 1015 (2),\nshall have the same force and effect as if it were a sentence passed by the trial court.\nOtherwise, to my mind, in very many cases, the recourse to the court of appeal would be rendered useless and inoperative.\nHere, the notice of appeal was effectively served upon the petitioner, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario was regularly seized of the appeal, and that Court could either refuse to alter the sentence or diminish or increase the punishment imposed by that sentence. It increased that punishment and it had full jurisdiction to do so, under section 1015 of the Criminal Code.\nThe sentence or punishment so increased and imposed by the court of appeal had the same force and effect as if it were a sentence passed by a trial court; and the sentence, punishment or the imprisonment to which sections 1078 and 1079 have reference, is the sentence, punishment or imprisonment which was substituted by the Appellate Division to the sentence, punishment or imprisonment awarded in the first instance. They, in fact, became the sentence, punishment or imprisonment awarded in the first instance, and it had the same force and effect as if it were passed by the trial court. It is only the enduring of that sentence as finally determined by the Appellate Division which, according to the true meaning of the two sections 1078-79 is stated to \"have a like effect and consequences as a pardon under the great seal.\"\nIt cannot be held that there was any lack of jurisdiction in the Appellate Division to render the judgment it has rendered in the present case.\nThe above is really sufficient to dispose of the matter, because it contains a final answer to the petition for habeas corpus and it defines the limit to which I am entitled to go on such petition for the writ.\nI have carefully read the authorities referred to by the learned counsel for the petitioner. (Le Roi v. Levy[1]; Rex v. Lee Park,[2]; Rex v. Kirkham,[3]; Rex v. Jarvis,[4]; Rex v. Jarvis,[5]; and Ex parte Boucher,[6]) and either they support the opinion just expressed by me or, with respect, I feel bound to disagree with them.\nI fully concur with the passage in Chief Justice Rowell's judgment in the second Jarvis case,5 at page 197, that\nSections 1078-79 should receive if possible a construction which would not deprive either the Crown or the accused of the right of appeal given by the Code. This would be achieved by construing them as being subject to the right of appeal.\nAs for the passage in Sir Lyman Duff's judgment re: Royal Prerogative of Mercy upon Deportation Proceedings[7], where the opinion is expressed\nthat the phrase \"punishment adjudged\" in Section 1078 of the Criminal Code does not describe a punishment reduced by an act of the royal clemency, but is intended to designate the punishment nominated by the original sentence, I think it should be read in the way suggested by Chief Justice Rowell just mentioned, or suggested in the present reasons, that, when there is an appeal, the \"punishment adjudged\" is necessarily that finally determined by the court of appeal and which, under section 1015 (2), is substituted for the original sentence and thus becomes the original sentence.\nOf course, I need not add that habeas corpus is not applicable to review the judgment whereby sentence was imposed, more particularly in this case where the appeal to the Appellate Division was limited to the sentence; and no appeal in respect of the sentence lies to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nIt should be pointed out that the point on which the application for habeas corpus is based was submitted to the Appellate Division and that Court passed upon it. I cannot see that it had no jurisdiction to dismiss the point and, now that it has done so, there would appear to be res judicata on the subject matter by a Court which was competent to dispose of that objection.\nIndeed, the present proceedings, under the circumstances, might well be considered as an attempt to appeal indirectly from the judgment of the Appellate Division, where no direct right of appeal lies.\nThe latter objection would be fatal to the petitioner's present application, even if the point on which I am now deciding and which is based on the construction that, in my view, should be given to sections 1078-79, was not decisive.

Cr. C.\u2014Section 5 Canada Evidence Act.\nIn March 1946, the accused were charged with violation of the Official Secrets Act and conspiracy to violate that Act. They were committed for trial and subsequently entered a plea of not guilty. Their trials were to take place in September, 1946. In June, 1946, they were called as witnesses by counsel for the Crown in a case of The King v. Rose. They refused to be sworn and give evidence on the ground that their testimony may tend to incriminate themselves, although they were told by the trial judge that their refusal was in contradiction with the very wording of section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act. The petitioners were told to remain in attendance at the trial, and, being recalled later, still refused to give evidence. The trial judge then declared them in contempt of court and they were told to remain at the disposal of the Court. Some five days after the Rose trial terminated, the trial judge sentenced the petitioners \"under the common law\" to three months in jail, where they have been detained since. The petitioners moved for writs of habeas corpus, alleging that their detention was illegal and they were thus unable to prepare their full defence to the charges laid against them. The alleged illegalities are based on several grounds stated in the judgment now reported.\nHeld that the petitioners have not proved any illegality in the sentences and committals of the trial judge, who had full competence and jurisdiction to act as he did. There is no ground shown by the petitioners which would justify the ordering of the issue of the writs prayed for and the petitions, therefore, should be dismissed.\u2014The refusal by the petitioners to be sworn was a direct defiance of a lawful order of the Court and an attempt to frustrate the course of justice: it was, moreover, a contempt in the face of the Court.\u2014The explanation for their refusal cannot justify their conduct, because they could not then know that their answers might incriminate them and, moreover, they were acting in direct opposition to the very wording of section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act.\u2014The power to punish for contempt is inherent in courts of superior original jurisdiction, quite independent of enactments in codes or statutes relating to their disciplinary powers.\u2014The trial judge, when imposing the sentence, meant evidently to exercise that inherent power, when he stated he was proceeding \"under the common law\".\u2014Section 165 Cr. C. does not conflict or interfere with such inherent power.\u2014The trial judge was not compelled, either by the Criminal Code or the jurisprudence concerning contempt of court, to render his sentence immediately: he had the power of delaying it until the end of the Rose trial.\nMOTION before The Chief Justice of Canada in Chambers, for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus, the petitioners alleging that they were illegally detained in gaol.\nMarcel Marcus K.C. for the motion.\nF. P. Varcoe K.C. and Oscar Gagnon K.C. contra.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014These are two petitions for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus, based on identical grounds and which therefore can be disposed of upon the same reasons. The petitioners allege that they are at present illegally detained in the common jail at Bordeaux, in the city and district of Montreal, under the following circumstances:\nOn or about the 15th of March, 1946, the petitioners were charged in the Ottawa Police Court with violation of the Official Secrets Act and conspiracy to violate the Official Secrets Act and they were committed for trial, after preliminary hearing.\nThey were subsequently arraigned before the Honourable the Chief Justice McRuer of the Supreme Court of Ontario, at Ottawa, and they entered a plea of not guilty. It is stated that their trial is to take place at Ottawa, on the 9th day of September, 1946.\nOn the 13th day of May, 1946, they were served with a subpoena to attend as witnesses and give evidence in the case of Rex vs Fred Rose. They attended the trial and remained in attendance from the 20th day of May, 1946, until they were called as witnesses by counsel for the Crown, the petitioner Gerson on the 8th of June and the petitioner Nightingale on the 12th of June, 1946.\nThe Honourable Mr. Justice Lazure was presiding in the trial by jury in the case of Rose.\nThe petitioners refused to be sworn and give evidence. In doing so, each of them explained to the learned trial judge that his refusal to answer questions was not because he wished to show any disrespect to the Court, nor did he desire to obstruct the course of justice in any way, but because he was afraid of incriminating himself.\nThe petitioners further explained that they had already been examined by the R.C.M.P. and the Royal Commissioners inquiring into certain matters of spies, when, as they alleged, they were refused the benefit of counsel, either before or during said examination. Further, they said, the report of the Royal Commissioners dealing with the petitioners' evidence, given before them, had been widely publicized and the petitioners had been prejudged as guilty even before they had their trial by jury, as they had elected. The learned trial judge pointed out to the petitioners that, under section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act, no witness could be excused from answering any question upon the ground that the answer to such question may tend to criminate him, or may tend to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person.\nThat section further adds that if, with respect to any question, a witness objects to answer upon the ground that his answer may tend to criminate him, and if, but for the Canada Evidence Act, the witness would therefore have been excused from answering such question, then although the witness is, by reason of this Act, compelled to answer, the answer so given shall not be used or receivable in evidence against him in any criminal trial or other criminal proceeding against him thereafter taking place, other than a prosecution for perjury in the giving of such evidence.\nThe learned trial judge however denied Crown counsel's application to commit instanter the petitioners for contempt of court, but he required them to remain in attendance at the trial during its pendency.\nOn June 12, at the request of Crown counsel, the petitioners were recalled to the witness stand. The learned trial judge told them that, under section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act, they were compelled to answer the questions put to them.\nThe petitioners reiterated to the learned trial judge that they themselves were awaiting trial upon charges not dissimilar to those on which the accused Rose was being tried, and that they could not give evidence without serious danger of further criminating themselves and putting their liberty in jeopardy.\nThe learned trial judge then declared the petitioners in contempt of court and told them to remain at the disposal of the Court until the Rose trial terminated when he would tell them \"what he would do with them\". The petitioners were not detained.\nThe Rose trial terminated on the 15th day of June, 1946, and the petitioners were told to report to the Court on the 20th day of June, when the learned trial judge, without asking the petitioners whether they had anything to say or whether they had any lawful excuse or justification for refusing to obey the order of the Court to testify as required of them under section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act, sentenced the petitioners \"under the common law\" to three months in jail.\nThe petitioners were then taken to the Bordeaux jail and they have been detained there ever since.\nThey now allege in support of their petitions for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus that they are charged with the most serious offence of conspiracy, as well as the substantive offences under the Official Secrets Act, that their trial is set for September 9, 1946, and that while they are illegally detained at Bordeaux jail, they are unable to take the necessary steps to prepare their full defence to the charges laid against them and to make the necessary efforts to prove their innocence.\nThey claim that they are being detained illegally and without legal cause or justification and that the learned trial judge had no jurisdiction to sentence them to three months in jail, or at all, and that the sentence is illegal, irregular and invalid, and has no foundation in either law or in fact for the following reasons:\u2014\nA) In imposing the sentence of three months for contempt of court upon the petitioners, the learned trial judge stated that he was proceeding under the common law. Yet, under the common law, the petitioners were not compelled to give evidence which would criminate them.\nB) If petitioners committed an offence at all, it was in refusing to obey an order of the Court to answer questions as required under section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act.\nC) That such an offence is an indictable offence and is expressly covered by the Canadian Criminal Code.\nD) That under the provisions of the Canadian Criminal Code, the petitioners were not committing an offence if they had a lawful excuse for not obeying such order.\nE) That the petitioners should have been charged and tried under the provisions of the Canadian Criminal Code in that behalf, and on the hearing of such charge, the petitioners would have had the right to make a full defence showing their justification or lawful excuse, which in fact they have, for refusing to obey such order of the Court.\nF) That such justification and lawful excuse would be a complete defence as well under the Code as the common law.\nG) That the learned trial judge never asked the petitioners before passing sentence upon them whether they had justification or a lawful excuse for refusing to obey the order of the Court to testify under section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act.\nH) That inasmuch as the petitioners can be said to have committed an offence, it was in refusing to answer questions under the said section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act, and as the Canadian Criminal Code contains statutory provisions covering the offence of contempt of court, common law principles and practices did not apply in the premises.\nI) That if the learned trial judge had jurisdiction to sentence the petitioners, by reason of their refusal to testify as aforesaid, upon the ground that there was urgency or expediency, to sentence them instanter, once the trial was over, and Rose had been convicted, such expediency and urgency had disappeared. The learned trial judge no longer had jurisdiction to summarily dispose of the contempt of court charge instanter, but should have proceeded in the manner prescribed by the provisions of the Canadian Criminal Code in that behalf.\nI have no hesitation to say that the refusal of the petitioners to be sworn was a direct defiance of a lawful order of the Court and an attempt to frustrate the course of justice. Moreover, it was a contempt in the face of the Court.\nThe petitioners called as witnesses were not justified in refusing to be sworn or to be examined. The explanation of their refusal: that their testimony might tend to incriminate them, cannot be invoked in justification of their conduct for at least two reasons:\u2014\n(a) At that point in the case, the witnesses could not know that the answer to any question which might be put to them might incriminate them. (b) Section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act specifically enacts that no witness shall be excused from answering any question upon the grounds advanced by the petitioners as witnesses. Subsection 2 of section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act is clearly to the effect that, notwithstanding such circumstances, the witness is compelled to answer, but it adds that\nthe answer so given shall not be used or receivable in evidence against him in any criminal trial, or other criminal proceeding against him thereafter taking place, other than a prosecution for perjury in the giving of such evidence.\nThe petitioners in refusing even to be sworn, notwithstanding the order of the Court, were in flagrant violation of the law and in designed contempt of the Court.\nThe power to punish for contempt is inherent in courts of superior original jurisdiction, quite independent of enactments in codes or statutes relating to their disciplinary powers.\nAs was said by Cross J. in Fournier v. The Attorney-General[1],\nIt is to be observed that the power to punish for contempt by summary process is conceded on all hands to be a power inherent in every court of record.\n(And see also what was said by Archambault J. in the same case, at page 459.)\nIt was, no doubt, to the existence of such inherent power, independent of enactments in codes or statutes that Mr. Justice Lazure meant to refer by stating that he was proceeding \"under the common law\" and not under section 165 of the Criminal Code, which provides for the indictable offence of disobedience to the orders of a court. The imposition of the sentence was the exercise of the inherent power which exists independently of codes and statutes, but the contempt itself was the violation of section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act, which clearly state that the so-called explanation, put forward by the petitioners of their refusal to be sworn at all, constituted no lawful excuse.\nSection 165 of the Criminal Code does not conflict or interfere with the inherent power to punish for contempt by summary process. That section provides for contempt in its criminal aspect and disobedience of orders of the court is thereby made an indictable offence if the procedure there referred to is resorted to, but section 165 itself contains the proviso\nunless some penalty is imposed, or other mode or proceeding is expressly provided, by law.\nGiving to section 165 the meaning suggested by counsel for the petitioners would do away with the inherent power.\nIn Ex Parte Jose Luis Fernandez[2], upon the trial at the assizes of an information against one C. for bribery alleged to have been committed by him at the election of a member of Parliament, a witness was called, on the part of the Crown, who had been examined before a Royal Commission about to inquire into alleged corrupt practices at that election, and who had received from the Commissioners a certificate indemnifying the witness from\nall penal actions, forfeitures, punishments, disabilities and incapacities, and all criminal prosecutions to which he may become liable or subject at the suit of Her Majesty etc. for anything done by him in respect of such corrupt practice\n\u2014and being asked\nDid you in the month of April 1859, receive any sum of money from Mr. C.?\ndeclined to answer the question on the ground that his answer might tend to criminate himself; and, though told by the presiding judge that the certificate was a complete protection to him, and that he was bound to answer the question, he persisted in his refusal. The judge thereupon committed him to York Castle for six months\nfor having wilfully and in contempt of the Court refused to answer the said question\nand further imposed upon him a fine of 55 pounds. It was held by the Court of Exchequer that, the Court of Assize being a superior court, the judge had jurisdiction to commit and was not bound to set out at length in his warrant the cause of his commitment, his decision not being subject to review by the Court above.\nI find no substance in the contention of the petitioners that they were not, before sentence, asked whether they had any justification or lawful excuse for refusing to obey the order of the Court to be sworn and to testify. On the two occasions when the petitioners were called as witnesses, they had full opportunity to put forward any pretended excuse for their refusal and whatever justification they claimed was of no avail in view of section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act.\nNor was there anything wrong in delaying the sentence until the end of the Rose trial. There is nothing either in the Criminal Code itself or in the jurisprudence concerning contempt of court which compels the judge to render his sentence immediately.\nIn the case of State vs. Morrill,[3] referred to with approval by Mr. Justice Marshall in Re Shepherd,[4] at p.p. 261, 262, in the Supreme Court of Missouri, in 1903, it was stated, at p. 399 of Morrill case3, in words which I wish to make my own:\nThe cases above cited (and many more might be cited if deemed at all necessary), abundantly show that, by common law, courts possess the power to punish, as for contempt, libellous publications of the character of the one under consideration upon their proceedings, pending or past, upon the ground that they tend to degrade the tribunals, destroy public confidence and respect for their judgments and decrees, so essentially necessary to the good order and well being of society, and most effectually obstruct the free course of justice.\nBefore having cited the above passage, Mr. Justice Marshall said[5]:\nThe power to punish for contempt is as old as the law itself, and has been exercised so often that it would take a volume to refer to the cases. From the earliest dawn of civilization, the power has been conceded to exist. It has been exercised, or not, as a matter of public policy, but its existence has never been denied. * * * In fact, so well settled is the law of England in this regard that it is said in 3 Enc. of Laws of England, p. 313: \"A Court of justice without power to vindicate its own dignity, to enforce obedience to its mandates, to protect its officers, or to shield those who are instructed to its care, would be an anomaly which could not be permitted to exist in any civilized community \u2026. without such protection, courts of justice would soon lose their hold upon public respect, and the maintenance of law and order would be rendered impossible.\"\nI do not find therefore that the petitioners have proved any illegality in the sentences and committals by Mr. Justice Lazure. The learned trial judge had full competence and jurisdiction to act as he did and the petitioners show no ground upon which I would be justified in ordering the issue of the writs prayed for; and for the above reasons, their petitions should be dismissed.\nPetition dismissed.\n[1] (1910) Q.R. 19 K.B. 431, at 436.\n[2] (1861) 10 C.B.

The trial judge declared him in contempt of court and sentenced him \"under the common law\" to a term of imprisonment. The petitoner applied for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus before The Chief Justice of this Court, and the application was dismissed. The petitioner then appealed to the Full Court from that order.\nHeld that the appeal should be dismissed.\u2014The trial judge had the power and authority to make the committal order and, in proceeding to do so, had not infringed any rule of law.\nAPPEAL from an order of The Chief Justice of Canada, in Chambers,[1] refusing an application by the petitioner for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus.\nMarcel Marcus K.C. for the appellant.\nF. P. Varcoe K.C. and Oscar Gagnon K.C. contra.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nKerwin J.:\u2014This is an appeal from an order of the Chief Justice of this Court refusing an application for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus. Apparently no question was raised before the Chief Justice and certainly it was not raised before us as to his power, or ours, to order the issue of such a writ under section 57 of the Supreme Court Act and nothing, therefore, is said upon the point. The circumstances attending the committal of the applicant to three months in jail are set forth in the reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice and need not be repeated. It is sufficient to state that the applicant declined to be sworn as a witness for the Crown in a criminal trial against a third party although subpoenaed so to do, on the ground that the answer he might give to any question that might be put to him might tend to criminate him, and this notwithstanding the provisions of section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act:\u2014\n5. No witness shall be excused from answering any question upon the ground that the answer to such question may tend to criminate him, or may tend to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person.\n2. If with respect to any question a witness objects to answer upon the ground that his answer may tend to criminate him, or may tend to establish his liability to a civil proceeding at the instance of the Crown or of any person, and if but for this Act, or the act of any provincial legislature, the witness would therefore have been excused from answering such question, then although the witness is by reason of this Act, or by reason of such provincial act, compelled to answer, the answer so given shall not be used or receivable in evidence against him in any criminal trial, or other criminal proceeding against him thereafter taking place, other than a prosecution for perjury in the giving of such evidence.\nIt was argued that because Mr. Justice Lazure, before whom the trial was proceeding, stated that he sentenced the applicant under the common law the order for committal was void. The argument was, that since at common law the applicant would not have been compelled to answer any question that might tend to criminate him, and that it was only by the above section that this privilege was removed the common law had no application. However, as the Chief Justice of this Court pointed out in effect, it was the common law as to contempt of court to which Mr. Justice Lazure referred.\nReference was then made to section 165 of the Criminal Code:\u2014\nEvery one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to one year's imprisonment who, without lawful excuse, disobeys any lawful order other than for the payment of money made by any court of justice, or by any person or body of persons authorized by any statute to make or give such order, unless some penalty is imposed, or other mode or proceeding is expressly provided, by law. And to section 180 (d):\u2014\nEvery one is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to two years' imprisonment who\n***\n(d) wilfully attempts in any other way to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice.\nThe argument on this point was that the applicant could be prosecuted under either of these sections and that these proceedings being available the right of the Court to punish for a contempt of court had been abrogated. Without deciding whether either of these sections would apply in the circumstances, we are of opinion that even if that were so it is a necessary incident to every superior court of justice to imprison for a contempt of court committed in the face of it: Ex Parte Jose Luis Fernandez[2], a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas in which judgments were delivered by Chief Justice Erle, Willes J. and Byles J. That right persists and has not been abrogated by either of the sections of the Criminal Code referred to and the mere fact that the trial of the third party had been completed did not deprive the Court of the power to exercise its authority.\nMr. Marcus next argued that even if he admitted that a contempt of court had been committed by the applicant and that Mr. Justice Lazure had the power to punish the applicant for that contempt, no opportunity was given the applicant to make any representations as to what order should, under all the circumstances, be made. This is not like the case of In Re Pollard[3], because, undoubtedly, the present applicant took a position from the very commencement in direct conflict with the provisions of section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act and there was no doubt as to this being the basis of the order of committal made against him. Reliance, however, was placed upon another decision of the Privy Council in Chang Hang Kiu v. Piggott[4], but there what was in question was a section of an Ordinance and it was held that as it did not dispense with giving the appellants an opportunity before sentence of explaining or correcting misapprehensions of their statements, it was essential that it should be accorded to them. It was also held that the judge who had committed for contempt should, before sentencing the appellants,\nhave given them an opportunity of giving reasons against summary measures being taken.\nThat, however, must be read in connection with the Board's subsequent statement\nit would have given an opportunity of explanation and possibly the correction of misapprehension as to what had been in fact said or meant\nand also in connection with the Board's reference to the Pollard case[5]. Here, accepting what is stated in the petition for the writ of habeas corpus that the applicant in a polite manner expressed his respect for the Court and the presiding Justice and his desire not to obstruct the course of justice in any way, it is apparent from the petition itself that the applicant adhered to his original position that he would not answer any question because such answer might tend to criminate him. Mr. Justice Lazure had already been apprised that Gerson had been indicted and had pleaded not guilty; that he was at liberty on bail and that his trial would take place early in the following September; and it is not suggested that there was anything else that the applicant desired to say or in fact could say.\nReliance was placed upon the fact that in another prosecution in Ontario, Chief Justice McRuer had declined to make an order of committal against one Lunan for refusing to answer certain questions on the ground that they tended to criminate him. As Chief Justice McRuer stated, he was there dealing only with the circumstances of that particular case. This decision was brought to the attention of Mr. Justice Lazure but it has no application to the circumstances of any other case, including this. In fact, in this connection and also in connection with the suggestion that the applicant, instead of being imprisoned, might have been dealt with in some other way, it should be pointed out that these circumstances have nothing to do with the original application before the Chief Justice of this Court for a writ of habeas corpus or the present appeal. Neither proceeding is an appeal from the order for committal. The Chief Justice was, and the Court is, restricted to an inquiry as to whether Mr. Justice Lazure had the power and authority to make the committal order and whether in proceeding so to do he infringed any rule of law. We are of opinion that he had the power and that he did not transgress any rule of law and the appeal must be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] See ante p. 538.\n[2] (1861) 10 C.B. n.s. 3.\n[3] (1868) L.R. 2 P.C. 106.\n[4] [1909] A.C. 312.\n[5] (1868) L.R. 2 P.C. 106.\n",

Some years later, the Crown expropriated the property and the present action is to determine its value. The Crown offered a sum of $4,750, while the Company claimed an amount over $21,000. The Exchequer Court of Canada awarded $6,000 in all to the Company, after having estimated at $4,000 the fair market value of the land and improvements. The Company appealed to this Court.\nHeld, varying the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1945] Ex. C.R. 228), that the amount of compensation money to which the appellant company is entitled should be increased and that a sum of $8,697.88 should be awarded, consisting chiefly of the costs of the purchase of the land, of the making of a necessary fill-in and of the construction of the service station less fifteen per cent. for depreciation on the latter, plus expenses of removal and depreciation of equipment and compensation for compulsory taking.\nSection 23 of the Expropriation Act provides that \"The compensation money * * * adjudged for any land * * * acquired or taken * * * shall stand in the stead of such land * * *,\" and, by section 2 (d), \"'land' includes * * * damages, and all other things done in pursuance of this Act * * *\" Per The Chief Justice and Kerwin J.:\u2014The principle in this class of case is that the displaced owner should be left as nearly as possible in the same position financially as he was prior to the taking, provided that the damage, loss or expense for which compensation was claimed was directly attributable to the taking of the lands.\nPer Hudson J.:\u2014The value to be fixed is the value to the owner, bearing in mind its acquisition of the property for special purposes and the net earnings which it might receive therefrom until it had established other profitable outlets for its products.\nPer Rand J.:\u2014The use of the word \"damages\" and the further language \"and all other things done in pursuance of this Act\" in section 2 (d) indicate the comprehensive sense in which the word is used and that it is intended to cover not merely the value of land itself, but the whole of the economic injury done which is related to the land taken as consequence to cause.\nPer Estey J.:\u2014It is the market value of the property expropriated, plus allowances equivalent to the present worth of those advantages which the property possessed to the owner, that constitutes the compensation to which he is entitled.\nCedar Rapids Manufacturing and Power Co. v.

The Minister ([1914] A.C. 1083) ref.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, O'Connor J.[1], awarding to the appellant company the sum of $6,000 in full compensation for the property expropriated by the Crown under the Expropriation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 64. The Crown had offered $4,750 and the appellant company had claimed $21,544.30. The appellant appealed to this Court for an increase of the award granted by the Court below.\nC. F. Inches K.C. for the appellant.\nR. D. Keirstead and C. Stein for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin J. was delivered by\nKerwin J.:\u2014On July 8, 1943, under the provisions of the Expropriation Act, R.S.C. 1927, chapter 64, the Crown expropriated lands of the Irving Oil Company Limited, situate at the corner of Britain and Prince William Streets, in the city of Saint John, in the province of New Brunswick. It offered the Company for the property $4,750 and the proportionate share of the 1943 municipal taxes from July 8 to December 31, 1943, while the Company claimed some $21,000. The Exchequer Court of Canada awarded $6,000 and the Company now appeals.\nThe Company is a distributor of gasoline and other oil products, with its head-office at Saint John, and operates and maintains bulk stations and service stations throughout the Maritime provinces. It does not carry on business in the United States. In 1935, the Provincial Government announced plans for a system of paved roads, and the Company, expecting an influx of tourists, turned its attention to a consideration of the increased number that might be expected to travel by ship from Boston to Saint John. This ship made two trips each week during the summer, docking at Reed's Point, just across Prince William street from the land here in question. It did not run in the winter. The ship carried automobiles whose gas tanks, however, had to be emptied before being put on board.\nA business competitor, Provincial Oil Company, purchased a lot on the north side of Britain street for $1,600 and erected a service station thereon. In December of that year the appellant company purchased its corner lot for $3,000 and erected a service station thereon with a large sign in front. It cost $666 to fill-in the land, and the cost of the service station appears to be $3,938. In accordance with its usual practice, it leased the property to various lessees to run the service station at a rental of one cent for every gallon of gasoline sold by the lessee. After allowing for taxes and maintenance, and taking into consideration losses from the renting of the property in certain years, the Company estimated that it had a net annual revenue from it and from the profit of five cents per gallon for every gallon furnished by it to its lessees during the years 1937 to 1941.\nThe Company's object in buying the property and erecting the service station was, as one of its officers stated, to have it as an advertising medium. Not relying solely upon the building and sign, it had its men approach the passengers from the Boston ship with literature and maps and, of course, endeavour to sell its own products. The Provincial Oil Company was doing the same thing and the competition became so keen that the ship's officials finally took steps to keep the contending parties off the dock. The appellant company's premises are nearer to the dock than those of Provincial Oil Company. The Boston ship ceased running in the fall of 1939 or 1940 but it is a reasonable probability that it will start again.\nThe appellant's service station is not located in a desirable district from the point of view of residence, and in fact most of the buildings in the neighbourhood are stated to be in a condition of non-repair; railway tracks run along Prince William street and part, at least, of the section is more suited for manufacturing than anything else. The Company made up its claim on the basis of the original cost, or upon the replacement value in 1943 of the building, and claimed for loss of goodwill and loss of profits besides several small items to be mentioned hereafter. The Crown's evidence was directed towards showing the assessed value of this property and adjoining property which had also been expropriated by the Crown but as to which it had been able to arrive at a settlement with the owners. Assessment, of course, is not a deciding factor but merely one of the things that may be looked at in arriving at a final conclusion. In this case I think it has no bearing whatever. The evidence as to what other owners in the immediate vicinity accepted in payment of their holdings is not of assistance because, as it has been pointed out more than once, these owners may for various reasons prefer to take lower sums rather than enter into a dispute; and, furthermore, none of the properties is really comparable when one considers what the Crown is taking from the appellant.\nThe trial judge stated:\u2014\nWhile the fair market value to any one other than an oil company might be in the neighbourhood of $4,000. the competition between the companies still exists and for that reason another oil company would pay a higher price. It would gain an outlet for its own products and close the outlet of its competitor. This potentiality must be taken into account in arriving at a fair market value to the defendant. The price that another oil company would pay would certainly be based on the yearly gallonage of gasoline passing through the station and the evidence showed that over a five-year period this was small.\nWhile making no allowance for loss of profits, he found that the compensation money to which the appellant was entitled was $6,000. This is about the sum mentioned by the witness Lawton, called on behalf of the Crown. While the reading of his evidence does not impress me, if the trial judge had chosen to take his estimate in preference to others and had proceeded upon proper principles, I would, of course, not suggest any change. However, while expressions may be found in some of the cases that, where property expropriated is not ordinary agricultural or residential land, there should be added to the fair market value of land of that type an additional amount for the particular value to the owner, it is not meant by that, that two sets of figures should be set down and added together,\u2014at least not in all cases. In another respect the trial judge erred where he said that while damages are included in the definition of \"land\" in section 2 (d) of the Expropriation Act, that was clearly damage for land injuriously affected. That statement would cover but a few items of the amounts claimed and I shall revert to the question later.\nIn this type of case, two decisions of the Privy Council are always referred to. The principles set forth in Cedar Rapids Manufacturing and Power Company v. Lacoste[2] are well-known and need not be repeated but it is important to refer particularly to a passage in the judgment of Lord Moulton in Pastoral Finance Association Limited v. The Minister[3]. He pointed out that the owners in that case were not entitled to have the capitalized value of certain prospective savings and additional profits added to the market value of the land taken in estimating their compensation, and then continues:\u2014\nThey were only entitled to have them taken into consideration so far as they might fairly be said to increase the value of the land. Probably the most practical form in which the matter can be put is that they were entitled to that which a prudent man in their position would have been willing to give for the land sooner than fail to obtain it.\nAs pointed out by Mr. Justice Duff, as he then was, in Manuel v. The King (unreported), where this Court affirmed the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[4], this statement is not a preferable way of putting it for the purpose of a case where a residence long occupied by the owner had been expropriated. In the present case, however, the appellant company was not imprudent, in 1935, in purchasing this corner lot and expending the money they did upon it, and, therefore, they should receive the cost of the land, the cost of the fill, and the cost of the service station, less an allowance for depreciation of fifteen per cent. on the latter. This would mean $3,000 plus $666 plus 85 per cent. of $3,938. I agree with the trial judge that notwithstanding the fact that by a by-law of the city of Saint John, the erection of any service station from a point 100 feet north of Britain street is prohibited, and that by a provincial enactment of 1935 no retailer's licence for a new service station shall be issued unless in the judgment of the appropriate Minister, public convenience and necessity so require, the appellant will not lose the sale of all its products that had previously gone through this particular service station. Under the circumstances of this case, the appellant is entitled to ten per cent. for compulsory taking on the total of the above items, $7,013.50 or $701.33.\nUnder section 23 of the Expropriation Act,\nThe compensation money * * * adjudged for any land * * * acquired or taken * * * shall stand in the stead of such land,\nand by section 2 (d) \"land\" includes \"damages.\" It was argued in the Exchequer Court of Canada, before the late President Maclean, in Federal District Commission v. Dagenais[5], that no compensation could be allowed for certain items there claimed because they did not represent an estate or interest in the lands taken. While saying nothing as to the correctness of the list of things for which compensation has been allowed and enumerated by the late President, I agree with him that the principle in this class of case is that the displaced owner should be left as nearly as possible in the same position financially as he was prior to the taking, provided that the damage, loss or expense for which compensation was claimed was directly attributable to the taking of the lands. Examples may certainly be found of cases where allowances have been made for such things as would correspond to the cost of moving the present appellant's equipment, and depreciation thereon. There is no dispute as to the amounts of these items, $120 and $275. There is also no good reason why, in these cases, the Crown should not pay the proportion of municipal taxes from the date of expropriation to the end of the current year, $88.25, and as a matter of fact, that was offered by the Crown in addition to the sum of $4,750.\nThe total of the above items is $8,197.88, which I considered sufficiently large to include any loss of profits. However, as some members of the Court consider $500 more should be allowed under that heading, I do not disagree. The appeal should, therefore, be allowed and in lieu of the sum of $6,000 mentioned in the judgment, there should be inserted the sum of $8,697.88. The appellant is entitled to interest thereon at the rate of five per centum per annum from July 8, 1943, the date of the expropriation, to the date of this judgment, and is also entitled to its costs of the appeal.\nHudson J.:\u2014The matter for decision in this appeal is the amount of compensation payable to the respondent for rights owned by it and taken by the Crown in the right of the Dominion for public purposes.\nThe land in question is near the harbour of Saint John, N.B. It was purchased by the respondent in December, 1935, for $3,000 and the defendant erected thereon a building for a service station at a cost of $3,947.58.\nThereafter the respondent leased the premises to various tenants who operated same on the basis that the tenant should there sell exclusively gasoline and oil products of the respondent and should pay as a rental one cent per gallon for all gasoline sold.\nThe evidence of value at the date of expropriation is not satisfactory.\nThe learned trial judge puts the matter thus:\nWhile the fair market value to any one other than an oil company might be in the neighbourhood of $4,000, the competition between the companies still exists and for that reason another oil company would pay a higher price. It would gain an outlet for its own products and close the outlet of its competitor. This potentiality must be taken into account in arriving at a fair market value to the defendant. The price that another oil company would pay would certainly be based on the yearly gallonage of gasoline passing through the station and the evidence showed that over a five-year period this was small.\nI see no reason to question the finding of the learned trial judge as to the market value of the property, apart from its special usage. The purchase price is some evidence of the value but this depends on many circumstances. A purchaser may make a bad bargain or a good one. If he makes a bad bargain, he surely is not entitled to compensation, and if he makes a good one he should not be deprived of any advantage thereby gained. Moreover, conditions affecting value may change.\nIn the present case, the evidence makes it fairly clear that the value of the property to the respondents must be greatly affected by the revenue which they derived and might expect to receive from the sale of their products. It appears that on the basis of the rental the property did not carry itself but, on the other hand, the respondents did make profits from the sale to the tenant of its products. This should be taken into account.\nThe learned trial judge in the portion of his judgment above quoted refers to the amount another oil company might be expected to pay for the property. With respect, I do not think that this is the sole criterion of the value. It seems to me that here, where the owner had acquired the property for a specific purpose and had established a business thereon, there might well be a special value to him greater than to any other competitor. The statement put in evidence as to the net profits on the sale of products showed something in excess of $1,000 a year for a number of years preceding the expropriation.\nI am not satisfied that a thorough examination of circumstances might not reduce this sum substantially but, on such evidence as there is, it would appear to be sufficient to provide a return which would justify a valuation of somewhat over $8,000, if there be included therewith the miscellaneous items such as costs of moving equipment, etc., and special allowance for compulsory taking included by the trial judge in his computation.\nThe principles upon which compensation for compulsory taking should be based are very well settled by decisions of Canadian courts and the Judicial Committee. I would just quote again the statement of Lord Dunedin in Cedar Rapids Manufacturing and Power Co. v. Lacoste[6].\nThe value to be paid for is the value to the owner as it existed at the date of the taking, not the value to the taker. The value to the owner consists in all advantages which the land possesses, present or future, but it is the present value alone of such advantages that falls to be determined.\nIn the present case I think that the value to be fixed is the value to the owner, bearing in mind its acquisition of the property for special purposes and the net earnings which it might receive therefrom until it had established other profitable outlets for its products.\nFor these reasons, although I think the amount rather generous, I will not dissent from the amount proposed by the other members of the Court, namely, $8,697.88 and concur in the order that the appeal should be allowed with costs, and the amount awarded to the appellant increased to that figure, with interest from 8th July, 1943.\nRand J.:\u2014This is an appeal against the award of the Exchequer Court of Canada for land taken by the respondent under the Expropriation Act. The property consisted of a gasoline filling station with the ordinary facilities for persons and for washing and greasing cars. The land lay at the corner of Britain and Prince William streets in the city of Saint John, almost immediately opposite the wharf at which the steamships of the Eastern Steamship Company tied up. This service between Boston and Saint John has been in existence for many years.\nThe appellant in the course of establishing a system of gasoline distribution throughout the Maritime provinces came to the conclusion that the land in question would afford a desirable site from which to advertise its business to incoming tourists by boat to New Brunswick. In 1936 it purchased the land for $3,077, spent approximately $600 to make a necessary fill, and set up the building and gasoline service facilities at an expense of $3,938. From that time until the summer of 1942 the station was operated by several lessees. The arrangement tied the station to the purchase from the appellant of all gasoline, oil and other automobile supplies, and the rent was based upon 1c for each gallon so supplied. Some time in the late summer of 1942, the naval authorities at Saint John intimated to the lessee that the property was to be taken over for war purposes, and the lessee promptly gave up the station. The plan of expropriation was actually filed only in June, 1943. At that time there were three sets of restrictions upon opening gasoline stations. First, there was a zoning limitation in the city of Saint John which did not permit a filling station in this particular section of the city below a point 100 feet north of Britain street. There was, next, a provincial regulation which required that good ground be shown for a new facility before it would be authorized; and finally, the war regulations prohibiting absolutely new stations. From this it resulted that from the time of expropriation until the trial of the information, it was legally impossible for the appellant to have opened a substitute station for that taken over.\nThe appellant claimed:\u2014\n(a) For the value of the land and building;\n(b) The expense of taking up and removing certain parts of the facilities, such as gasoline tanks and pumps; and\n(c) Loss of profits.\nThe Court allowed the sum of $4,000 as the market price of the land and improvements, and estimated that for the special purposes of the business of the appellant, an additional value of $2,000 should be allowed; and from that award, the appeal is brought to this Court.\nThe provisions of the Expropriation Act dealing with compensation are in general language. Section 2 (d) defines \"land\" as follows:\n(d) \"Land\" includes all granted or ungranted, wild or cleared, public or private lands, and all real property, missuages, lands, tenements and hereditants of any tenure, and all real rights, easements, servitudes and damages, and all other things done in pursuance of this Act, for which compensation is to be paid by His Majesty under this Act.\nThe use of the word \"damages\" and the further language \"and all other things done in pursuance of this Act\", indicate the comprehensive sense in which the word is used and that it is intended to cover not merely the value of land itself, but the whole of the economic injury done which is related to the land taken as consequence to cause.\nThen section 3 provides:\nThe compensation money agreed upon or adjudged for any land or property acquired or taken for or injuriously affected by the construction of any public work shall stand in the stead of such land or property;\n*** This language must be construed, within the limits mentioned, in the sense of compensation \"by reason of\" the acquisition or taking of land or property. The clause \"shall stand in the stead of such land or property\" can only mean that, with the compensation money in the hands of the owner, he is in the equivalent position of holding his land or property instead of the money. He is, therefore, under that section, in the sense indicated, to be made economically whole.\nThere is nothing in the Exchequer Court Act which is in conflict with that view. Section 47 provides that\nthe Court, in determining the amount to be paid to any claimant for any land or property taken for the purpose of any public work * * * shall estimate or assess the value or amount thereof at the time when the land or property was taken, * * *\nThe word \"for\" taken with the language of section 50:\u2014\nThe Court shall, in determining the compensation to be paid to any person for land taken * * *\nsupports it.\nThis interpretation of the statute, in agreement with that given similar but not precisely the same statutory language in England, is assumed by this Court in the case of The King v. MacArthur[7], and the reference to that decision by Duff J. (as he then was) in City of Toronto v. Brown[8], does not challenge that interpretation in relation to the Expropriation Act or the Railway Act; and the long series of cases decided in the Exchequer Court of Canada since 1887 on the same assumption puts it beyond doubt that the effect of the Canadian Acts has been judicially determined to be the same as that of the Railway Clauses Act and the Land Clauses Act of England.\nThe statement of Lord Justice Moulton in Pastoral Finance Association Ltd. v. The Minister[9]:\nProbably the most practical form in which the matter can be put is that they were entitled to that which a prudent man in their position would have been willing to give for the land sooner than fail to obtain it.\nemphasizes the essential consideration to be regarded in determining compensation in a case of this kind. If the land is such as to have no special value to the owner, then the general market value, including the present worth of all possibilities, is the measurement of compensation. If a special value is actually realized by him, then the compensation must represent the sum which as a prudent man he would be prepared to pay rather than to fail to obtain or retain his property.\nAdmittedly here the property had a special value and a special adaptability to the appellant. It was purchased and developed in an unusual site for advertising the products of the appellant. For any other purpose suggested, the value of the land would be less than that which the appellant paid. There was a competing service station about 75 yards or so farther east on the north side of Britain street as well as the larger generalized competition prevailing in the whole of the gasoline supply field.\nBut the only evidence before the Court bearing upon the value to the owner is the amount which it cost the appellant to set the station up. As to this, there is no dispute, but it was not on that basis that the award was made. The Court considered rather the general market value of the property from evidence given of amounts paid for adjoining lots taken in conjunction with the improvement added. But for the $2,000 additional sum representing in effect the special value to the owner, there is nothing beyond what the appellant itself has presented. There is no suggestion in the case that the purchase was unprofitable or that the judgment of the company was poor or that the experience of six years showed that it was not when purchased or at that time worth what the appellant had laid out in it.\nIn this branch of the claim then I am forced to the view that the court below erred in the basis in fact of its computation; in the absence of any other evidence the actual outlay, with the prudence of judgment behind it unquestioned, should, in such a field, have been the support for the finding of the special value to the appellant. Under this heading I think the appellant is entitled to the amount which was actually expended, up to the time of expropriation, in the development of the property, less a depreciation of 15 per cent. on the building. To this should be added the expense of taking up and removing to its stock yard the tanks and pumps and other apparatus of the station, the possibility of their re-installation in a substitute station, and some allowance for their depreciation.\nThe final item is expressed in terms of loss of profits. It is said that profits are never recoverable under the principles of compensation so laid down, and in the true sense, that is so: they are not recoverable as such: and they cannot be used for the purposes of capitalization to reach the sale value of the land. They represent in this aspect the productive capacity of the owner as contrasted with rents which may represent the productive capacity of the land. But where a business is temporarily disrupted, then loss of profits may furnish the proper basis to estimate the damage suffered by reason of the loss of possession. The causal connection must of course be shown: but if it is, then the settled rule takes them into account generally as disturbance to or interference with the business. This is well issustrated in Jubb v. Dock Company[10]. In that case the language of the statute contained this clause:\nand also the sum to be paid by way of compensation for the damage occasioned to any such lands by the execution of the works.\nThe jury found a sum of \u00a3300 as compensation for the damage, loss and injury which the owner sustained by reason of having to give up his business as a brewer until he could obtain other suitable premises, and that allowance for damages was held by the Court to be within the language quoted.\nThere was a substantial gallonage of gasoline being sold at the station, the loss of which would be reflected both in the rent and in the company's general profits; but it is quite impossible to say how much if any went to other stations of the company. Obviously the cessation of sailings of the steamship company to Saint John during the war and the uncertainties of business after the war render estimates difficult. There can be little doubt, however, that between June, 1943, and the date of the trial or the end of the war, a measurable loss was suffered. For this damage, taking into account off-setting items, I think the appellant should be allowed the sum of $500. A recapitulation of the allowable items would then be as follows:\nPurchase of the lands and making of the fill\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026.\n$3,666 00\nConstruction of the building\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\n3,938 00\nExpenses of removal and depreciation of equipment, etc. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n395 00\n$7,999 00\nLess estimated depreciation of building at 15%....................................................\n590 70\n$7,408 30\nDamages through disturbance of business, etc. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n500 00\nForcible taking \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n701 33\nUnearned taxes\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026...\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n88 25\nTotal\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n$8,697 88\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs and increase the amount of the award to the sum mentioned with interest to the date of this judgment.\nEstey J.:\u2014The Government of Canada on July 8, 1943, expropriated, under the provisions of the Expropriation Act, 1927 R.S.C., c. 64, a parcel of land in the city of Saint John. The only part of that land we are here concerned with was owned by the appellant and situated at the corner of Britain and Prince William streets. The government tendered the sum of $4,750, together with interest thereon of 5 per cent. from the date of expropriation, and $88.25 being the taxes paid by the appellant to the city of Saint John for the year 1943 from the date of expropriation to the 31st of December, 1943. The tender was refused by the appellant and consequent proceedings commenced in the Exchequer Court of Canada to determine the compensation the government should pay for the said lot. The appellant before the Exchequer Court of Canada asked $21,544.30.\nThe learned trial judge in the course of his judgment stated:\nWhile the fair market value to any one other than an oil company might be in the neighbourhood of $4,000, the competition between the companies still exists and for that reason another oil company would pay a higher price. It would gain an outlet for its own products and close the outlet of its competitor. This potentiality must be taken into account in arriving at a fair market value to the defendant. He then fixed $6,000 as the amount of compensation to which the appellant was entitled.\nThe appellant is a distributor of gasoline and oil products and throughout the Maritime provinces maintains many service stations and bulk distributing centres. In 1935 the Provincial Government entered upon a policy of paved roads which it was anticipated would result in increased tourist traffic, particularly with automobiles. A regular boat service was maintained between Boston and Saint John in the summer months, and at Saint John this boat docked approximately opposite the lot in question. The automobiles of passengers were accommodated upon this boat and under the regulations the gas tank had to be emptied before the automobile could be placed on board. As anticipated, many tourists did come by boat and brought their automobiles. In fact the competition for this tourist business was so keen between the appellant and the Provincial Oil Company that those in charge of the unloading at the docks had to somewhat restrain their activities. There was, therefore, at this point an opportunity for doing business with the tourists, and particularly possibilities for advertising by distributing maps and information that would assist the tourists in their travel throughout the provinces. With these possibilities, particularly that of advertising, the appellant purchased the lot in question in December 1935 for $3,000 and after spending about $666 in levelling the lot and making it suitable for its purpose, erected a service station thereon at a cost of $3,938. It then installed its usual service station equipment. Apart from this latter equipment, which was removed by the appellant at the time of the expropriation, it had an investment of over $7,600.\nIn the same year, and with apparently much the same objects in view, the Provincial Oil Company purchased a lot nearby for $1,600 and erected thereon a filling station.\nSection 23 of the Expropriation Act reads in part as follows:\n23. The compensation * * * adjudged for any land or property acquired or taken for * * * any public work shall stand in the stead of such land or property; * * * Lord Dunedin in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Cedars Rapids Manufacturing and Power Company v. Lacoste[11], stated as follows:\nThe law of Canada as regards the principles upon which compensation for land taken is to be awarded is the same as the law of England, and it has been explained in numerous cases, nowhere with greater precision than in the case of In re Lucas and Chesterfield Gas and Water Board,[12], where Vaughan Williams and Fletcher Moulton L.J.J. deal with the whole subject exhaustively and accurately.\nLord Justice Fletcher Moulton in that case of In re Lucas and Chesterfield Gas and Water Board12, at p. 29, stated:\nThe principles upon which compensation is assessed when land is taken under compulsory powers are well settled. The owner receives for the lands he gives up their equivalent, i.e., that which they were worth to him in money. His property is therefore not diminished in amount, but to that extent it is compulsorily changed in form. But the equivalent is estimated on the value to him, and not on the value to the purchaser, and hence it has from the first been recognized as an absolute rule that this value is to be estimated as it stood before the grant of the compulsory powers. The owner is only to receive compensation based upon the market value of his lands as they stood before the scheme was authorized by which they are put to public uses. Subject to that he is entitled to be paid the full price for his lands, and any and every element of value which they possess must be taken into consideration in so far as they increase the value to him.\nMr. Justice Taschereau, writing the judgment of the Court in The King v. Elgin Realty Co. Ltd.[13], stated:\n* * * the value to the owner consists in all advantages which the land possesses, present and future, but it is the present value alone of such advantages that falls to be determined. The future advantages, therefore, may be taken into account in determining the value of the property, but in so far only as they may help to give to the property its present value.\nMr. Justice Idington, with whom Davies J. and Maclennan J. concurred, in Dodge v. The King[14], stated:\nThe market price of lands taken ought to be the prima facie basis of valuation in awarding compensation for land expropriated. The compensation, for land used for a special purpose by the owner, must usually have added to the usual market price of such land a reasonable allowance measured by possibly the value of such use, and at all events the value thereof to the using owner, and the damage done to his business carried on therein, or thereon, by reason of his being turned out of possession.\n***\nThe compensation must rest, not on what such a block may be worth to the Crown for the peculiar purpose involved in its acquisition, but upon the loss the owner suffers by the Crown taking it. These quotations emphasize that it is the market value of the property expropriated, plus allowances equivalent to the present worth of those advantages which the property possessed to the owner, that constitutes the compensation to which he is entitled. An application of the principles embodied in the foregoing quotations to the facts of this case results, with deference to the learned trial judge, in compensation to an amount quite in excess of $6,000. One witness valued the lot at $1,000 and another even a little less. The first condemned it as a suitable location for a service station and the latter based his conclusion upon figures supplied to him and admitted that, had he known that $3,000 had actually been paid for it, he might have so valued it.\nThe established facts are that in 1935 the appellant paid $3,000 for the lot in question, and the Provincial Oil Company in the same year paid $1,600 for a nearby lot which, for the purposes we are considering, was not so favourably located. Each company established a service station upon their respective lots and continued to carry on business there, until the appellant by these expropriation proceedings was compelled to discontinue. That though the officer of the appellant company who selected the lot deposed that in doing so its possibilities for advertising was \"the chief motive in mind at that time\", it has in fact been operated at a profit, even in the years after the Boston boats, because of the war, were discontinued. These lots were purchased in the open market and no evidence was adduced that indicated these lots had depreciated in value. The fact that they were operating at a profit and the value of the location for advertising purposes, particularly when the Boston boats resume their sailings, leads to the conclusion that the purchase price would be substantially the market value of these lots, particularly to oil companies, at the time of this expropriation.\nIn order to make the lot suitable for its purpose, the appellant expended $666 in filling and levelling the ground. This amount is accepted by both of the contractors who examined the plans and specifications. It then constructed a service station at a cost of $3,938, and there was evidence of replacement values by the two experienced contractors. After allowing depreciation of 15 per cent. they respectively estimated the replacement cost of the building in 1943 at $5,182 and $5,474.20. The only figure less than the cost deposed to was that of $3,000 by one who had neither inspected the building nor examined the plans and specifications. It would appear, particularly as the appellant was maintaining the business thereon at a profit, that under all the circumstances it is at least entitled as compensation to its original cost less the depreciation adopted by the contractors in the sum of 15 per cent.\nThe appellant had paid the taxes for the year 1943. The respondent has tendered the proportion thereof from July 8 to December 31, 1943, in the sum of $88.25.\nThe appellant, because of this expropriation, was required to remove its equipment, including two meter pumps and three 500 gallon storage tanks from this service station. The evidence indicated that this cost $120 and that in the moving this equipment depreciated in the sum of $275.\nThis expropriation not only involved the closing of this service station which was operating at a profit, but because of the Dominion Oil Control Regulations it could not open another service station. As Sir Louis Davies pointed out in Lake Erie and Northern Rwy. Co. v. Schooley[15]:\nThe true principle on which they should have proceeded is that laid down by the Judicial Committee in the Pastoral Finance Association v. The Minister, [16], namely, that this special suitability of the lands expropriated for the carrying on of an ice business and the additional profits which the owners will derive from so carrying it on, are proper elements in assessing the compensation, but the owner is not entitled to have the capitalized value of those savings and profits added to the market value of the lands.\nThis item, as well as an allowance for compulsory taking, ought to be taken into account in arriving at the compensation which is equal to, in the above quoted language of Lord Moulton[17]:\n* * * the full price for his lands, and any and every element of value which they possess * * * in so far as they increase the value to him.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the compensation should include the purchase price of the land, cost of the fill, cost of construction less depreciation, expense of removal and depreciation of equipment, proportionate share of 1943 taxes, and an amount for compulsory taking and damage to its business.\nI have had the advantage of reading the computation of the foregoing items in the judgment of my brother Kerwin and agree therewith, and that the judgment appealed from should be varied as he directs.\nThis appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs and judgment varied.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Porter & Ritchie.\nSolicitor for the respondent: R.

The draft was in charge of two non-commissioned officers, sergeant major W. being in command and lance-corporal H. assisting him. During the trip some soldiers in M.'s truck fired blank ammunition, and M. fired live ammunition at least once before reaching Anthony's barn. The live ammunition was property of the Crown, the soldiers were not to fire except under orders of a superior officer and the orders were that the soldiers should turn in the ammunition at the close of military exercises. When M. passed in front of respondent Anthony's barn, he directed a tracer bullet at a window, and the barn and its contents belonging to respondent Thompson, were destroyed by fire. In actions against the Crown under section 19 c of the Exchequer Court Act, the trial judge found that, while M. was not acting within the scope of his employment, there was liability on the Crown because of the negligence of the officers in charge of the draft in failing to stop the firing.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1946] Ex. C.R. 30), Kerwin and Estey JJ. dissenting, that the Crown was not liable.\nThe act of M. in shooting the incendiary bullet into the barn cannot, in any way, be treated as an act of negligence committed while acting within the scope of his duties; it was a wilful act done for his own purpose, quite outside of the range of anything that might be called reasonably incidental to them.\nThe failure of the officers, in charge of the draft, was a neglect of duty only in respect of military law; it did not constitute also a breach of private duty toward the respondents; and the rule of respondeat superior has no application.\nParagraph (c) of section 19 of the Exchequer Court Act creates a liability against the Crown through negligence under the rule of respondeat superior, and it does not impose duties on the Crown in favour of subjects. The liability is vicarious, based as it is upon a tortious act of negligence committed by a servant while acting within the scope of his employment; and its condition is that the servant shall have drawn upon himself a personal liability to the third person.\u2014If the liability is placed merely on the negligent failure to carry out a duty to the Crown and not on a violation of a duty to the injured person, then there will be imposed on the Crown a greater responsibility in relation to a servant than rests on a private citizen. But the words \"while acting\" clearly exclude such an interpretation.\nPer Kerwin and Estey JJ. (dissenting):\u2014W., an officer in charge of the draft, was a servant of the Crown as provided by section 50 A. of the Exchequer Court Act and the damages claimed by the respondents resulted from his negligence while acting within the scope of his duties or employment within the meaning of section 19 (c) of that Act.\nPer Kerwin J. (dissenting):\u2014W. should have known that the men in M.'s truck were discharging rifles and should have detected the live ammunition fired by M. before the truck reached the barn.\u2014W. owed to the respondents a duty to prevent M. from firing and should have foreseen that damage would occur as a result of his failure to stop him.\nPer Estey J. (dissenting):\u2014The failure of W. to use reasonable care to restrain M. was the cause of the destruction of the barn.\u2014W. owed the duty to use care towards the respondents as residents along the highway, and his breach of that duty constituted negligence. APPEALS by the Crown from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, O'Connor J.[1], maintaining their claims, made by way of petitions of right, for damages caused by the alleged negligence of members of the military forces of His Majesty in the right of Canada.\nF. P. Varcoe K.C., E. J. Henneberry K.C. and W. R. Jackett for the appellant.\nC. F. Inches K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Hudson and Rand JJ. was delivered by\nRand J.:\u2014The question in this appeal is whether on the facts a claim arises against the Crown under section 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act, which reads:\u2014\n(c) Every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or property resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment.\nBy section 50 (a) of the Act, a member of the Naval, Military or Air Forces of His Majesty is deemed a servant of the Crown for the purposes of that provision.\nI think it must be taken that what paragraph (c) does is to create a liability against the Crown thro\u00b5gh negligence under the rule of respondeat superior, and not to impose duties on the Crown in favour of subjects: The King v. Dubois[2]; Salmo Investments Ltd. v. The King[3]. It is a vicarious liability based upon a tortious act of negligence committed by a servant while acting within the scope of his employment; and its condition is that the servant shall have drawn upon himself a personal liability to the third person.\nIf the liability is placed merely on the negligent failure to carry out a duty to the Crown and not on a violation of a duty to the injured person, then there will be imposed on the Crown a greater responsibility in relation to a servant than rests on a private citizen. But the words \"while acting\" which envisage positive conduct of the servant taken in conjunction with the consideration just mentioned clearly exclude, in my opinion, such an interpretation.\nThis raises the distinction between duties and between duty and liability. There may be a direct duty on the master toward the third person, with the servant the instrument for its performance. The failure on the part of the servant constitutes a breach of the master's duty for which he must answer as for his own wrong; but it may also raise a liability on the servant toward the third person by reason of which the master becomes responsible in a new aspect. The latter would result from the rule of respondeat superior; the former does not.\nNow I think it quite impossible to say that the act of Morin in shooting the incendiary bullet into the barn can be treated as an act of negligence committed while acting within the scope of his duties; it was a wilful act done for his own purpose, quite outside of the range of anything that might be called reasonably incidental to them.\nBut it is argued by Mr. Inches that both the detachment and the particular truck were in charge of officers with responsibilities that link the Crown with what happened. Although in the case of the lance-corporal it seems doubtful, I will assume a degree of general authority and duty in both non-commissioned officers that would go to the extent of requiring Morin to hand over the live cartridges and on that footing examine this contention.\nThe evidence shows that at Fort Mispec, the military personnel on duty, because of the nature of their service, were normally furnished with live ammunition, but a careful check of it was kept, and each soldier was held to an accounting for what had been issued to him. Prior to military tests or exercises, it would be called in, as well as when transfers of men were made to another unit as here. On April 21st, a test had commenced, and accordingly all such ammunition had been given over; and when, on the 24th, the detachment started for Partridge Island none was supposed to be outstanding. But Morin had, by a tr\/?\/ick, obtained some, which was in his possession when the trucks set out. Now, this ammunition was property belonging to the Crown, and the soldiers were entitled to make use of it only as they were discharging their duties. The order to turn it in when military exercises were being carried out was primarily a safeguard against its accidental use, for those so engaged and presumably for civilians who might be within the range of the operations.\nMorin then was guilty of a breach of discipline in possessing the bullets and in discharging them; and when that fact became evident, the officer's military duty arose. There is some dispute whether the sergeant should have been able to distinguish the firing of live from blank ammunition, but I will take that to be so, and that there was a time before the barn was set afire when either could have acted.\nThis brings me to the question of the nature of this duty and whether, for its failure, either officer could be held personally responsible for the damage caused by Morin. The conditions under which a duty toward A may give rise to a contemporaneous and independent duty toward B are not clearly settled; but here we have a special situation in which the primary duty arises. In the national organization, military and police agencies are necessary for the preservation of the national life and its order. For this purpose, men must, among other things, be entrusted with instruments of danger, and laws, rules and authority are set up to regulate their behaviour. But the duties so arising are essentially for the public interest. They are created within a structure of general law which postulates as a basic principle to which there are few exceptions, that a person is responsible only for his own act: Moon v. Towers,[4] * * * Failure in relation to a duty undertaken or assumed directly toward the injured person becomes affirmative action in the obverse of actual conduct modified by the failure, and the actual conduct may be mere persistence in inaction; but where the injured person is not the one with whom the undertaking is made, then it must appear at least that he is within the intended range of benefit: B\u00e9langer v. Montreal Water and Power Co.[5]. In other circumstances, reliance by him on the undertaken conduct may be necessary to establish the link of legal duty. I see nothing of those elements in the duty of an officer under military discipline in relation to acts of subordinates. The military law is a body of rules by which, among other objects, the possibilities of illegal and injurious action, whether by means of dangerous weapons entrusted to soldiers or otherwise, may be restricted; but it is a proposition which I am unable to accept that persons bearing that authority must have regard to private interests before they may safely abstain, in any situation, from exercising it. It would introduce fundamental questions of conflicting responsibilities, of excuses for failure to act and of legal causation; and so far as counsel have been able to discover, in generations of experience with military activities and personnel, it has never before been suggested. We enter here the field of executive action and the hierarchy of command. In this case, the sergeant's excuse was that he had to get on with the military movement in which he was engaged. It was in a time of war. Are the courts to sit in judgment on decisions of that sort in a conflict between public and private interests? Citizens have no guarantee that they and their property can or will be kept inviolate against occasional wilfulness. Officers are accountable to military law for failing to exercise authority when exercise is called for; but the penalties prescribed by it for such delinquencies must, I think, be looked upon as the only sanctions intended, and the duties raised as not intended to enure to the private benefit of the citizen. An officer may make an injurious act of a subordinate his own, but in that case he becomes a principal and directly liable: and his act would be no more significant to the liability of the Crown under section 19 (c) than that of the subordinate. It is clear that an officer is not within the rule of respondeat superior for the act of one within his command, and it would be extraordinary if liability could be raised indirectly through a responsibility based not on his act but on his authority.\nThe failure of the sergeant or lance-corporal to act towards Morin was then a neglect of duty only in respect of military law; it did not constitute also a breach of private duty toward the respondents; and the rule of respondeat superior has no application.\nI would therefore allow the appeal and dismiss the action and if the Crown insists upon them with costs here and in the court below.\nKerwin J. (dissenting):\u2014His Majesty the King appeals from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada awarding the suppliants damages for the destruction by fire of a barn and its contents. The fire was caused by one Gunner Arthur Morin, firing a tracer bullet at the barn under the following circumstances.\nAt Fort Mispec in the province of New Brunswick, about fifteen miles from the city of Saint John, was stationed the Fourth Coastal Battery, of which Morin was a member. Usually live ammunition was carried by all ranks of the battery but when a test operation or scheme was to take place, each man was obliged to account for the live ammunition issued to him, turn it in, and then receive blank ammunition. A careful record of the live ammunition was kept at all times but it was impossible to check the blank ammunition as the officers were forced to accept the men's statements as to the quantities used in test operations.\nOn April 23, 1944, the live ammunition on hand was checked and found correct. A scheme had been proceeding since April 21st and was not due to finish until the 26th. Morin, who had been in charge of the gun stores, was on sick leave during part of this period but returned to duty on the morning of the 24th, on which date a draft from the battery was to be transferred to Partridge Island. Morin procured the keys of the gun stores from the man then in charge in order to secure some personal possessions of his own but took the opportunity to purloin a quantity of live ammunition.\nThe draft left in three trucks, the foremost of which carried the baggage. Although a commissioned officer should have been in command of the draft, Sergeant-Major Williams was sent in charge. He left Fort Mispec in the third truck which, however, passed the second one practically at the commencement of the trip when it stopped to permit an occupant to secure something from one of the huts. Morin was in this truck, which accordingly brought up the rear of the cavalcade. To go to Partridge Island, it was necessary, first, to traverse the fifteen miles to Saint John. A number of soldiers on Morin's truck fired blank ammunition and Morin fired live ammunition. He did this at least once before reaching a point opposite Anthony's farm when he fired at a window in the barn and it is that shot that caused the fire in question.\nIn the truck with Morin was Lance Bombardier Haynes and the trial judge found that both Williams and Haynes were negligent. Without evidence as to the authority of Haynes, I am unable to agree as to the relevancy of any negligence of his but that Williams was negligent I have no doubt. He was a servant of the Crown as provided by section 50 (a) of the Exchequer Court Act as enacted by chapter 25 of the statutes of 1943-1944, and the damages claimed by the petitions of right resulted from his negligence while acting within the scope of his duties or employment within the meaning of section 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act as enacted by chapter 28 of the 1938 statutes. He was in charge of the draft and knew, or should have known, that the men were not to fire except on an officer's order. He excused himself by stating that when the party left Fort Mispec they were passing through an area in which the scheme was being conducted and that while he heard shots, he assumed they were in connection with that operation. But Morin had fired at least one live shell before reaching Anthony's barn and Williams should have heard the shot and investigated immediately. He was in a hurry to arrive at the dock where the draft was to board a ship for Partridge Island and while he stated, \"it sounded to me like blanks\", he also said, \"I wasn't sure at the time it was blank shots,\u2014I couldn't swear to that,\". Under these circumstances it must be held that he should have known that the men in Morin's truck were firing and he should certainly have detected the live ammunition fired by Morin before the trucks reached Anthony's farm. I am unable to accede to Mr. Varcoe's argument that Williams owed no duty to the suppliants. On the contrary, I am of opinion that he did owe such a duty and that it should be expected that damage would occur as a result of his negligence. Mr. Varcoe also pointed out that the expression in section 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act is \"while acting within the scope of his duties or employment\" and not that used at common law in master and servant cases, \"in the course of his employment.\" It has already been pointed out in Lockhart v. Canadian Pacific Railway Company[6], that this is the correct formula at common law and not \"acting within the scope of his authority.\" While the latter and the wording used in section 19 (c) might appear linguistically similar, the statute should receive the same interpretation as the expression \"in the course of his employment\",\u2014particularly when one takes into consideration the wording of the French text,\npendant qu'il agissait dans l'exercice de ses fonctions ou de son emploi.\nSo treated, the mere fact that Morin's act was deliberate cannot excuse the want of care on Williams' part, and on this ground and without expressing any opinion as to the other questions argued before us, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nEstey J. (dissenting):\u2014The respondent (suppliant) William Anthony's barn was destroyed by fire caused by a bullet discharged from the rifle of Gunner Arthur Morin, a member of the armed services. The respondent (suppliant) Teman T. Thompson had certain chattels stored therein which were also destroyed. The respondents recovered judgments against the Crown in the Exchequer Court of Canada for their respective damages and from these judgments the Crown now appeals.\nOn April 24, 1944, the military authorities were transporting about 30 men of the 4th Coastal Battery from Fort Mispec, N.B., along the highway to Saint John en route to Partridge Island. Q.M.S. Williams was in charge of the men who left Fort Mispec in three trucks, a baggage truck with seven men and the balance of the men in two other trucks. When the trucks left Fort Mispec Williams and a number of men were in the third or last, and in the truck preceding Lance Bombardier Haynes and several men, including Gunner Morin. About a quarter of a mile from Fort Mispec the Haynes-Morin truck stopped to pick up a party and the Williams truck passed and remained ahead all the way to Saint John.\nWhile it was customary at Fort Mispec for the men to have an issue of live ammunition, at this time, in preparation for certain manoeuvres, it had been turned in and all accounted for. There was also an order requiring the men to turn in their blank ammunition, but a number had failed to do so. It was therefore contrary to orders for any of the men to have either blank or live ammunition. Each man did, however, carry his rifle, but here again it was contrary to orders to fire it using either live or blank ammunition except under orders of a superior officer.\nImmediately after starting from Fort Mispec the men began firing blank ammunition for amusement or pastime. Morin had no blank ammunition but the day before had taken from the gun stores 26 rounds of live ammunition which he began firing. He commenced near the B.O.P. station at Fort Mispec and continued to fire his live ammunition throughout the journey:\nI fired all along the road into the air. I fired the last shot in Saint John\u2014by the Marsh bridge. I fired to the sea.\nAt about six miles from Fort Mispec he aimed at the barn in question, fired a tracer bullet setting the fire that burned it to the ground.\nThe respondents pleaded negligence on the part of the servant of the Crown and gave in part as the particulars thereof that\nthe said Arthur Morin was not restrained from discharging live ammunition at or in the direction of the said barn.\nIn such an action the respondents can succeed only if there be upon the appellant a duty owing to the respondents to use due care, a breach of that duty, and consequent damage. The immediate issue is, did any person owe to the respondents a duty to restrain Morin? Williams, under orders from his superior officer, was in charge of the transportation of the men into Saint John and for that purpose he was utilizing the highway. Lord Russell of Killowen and Lord Macmillan adopted the statement of Lord Jamieson:\n\"No doubt the duty of a driver is to use proper care not to cause injury to persons on the highway, or in premises adjoining the highway, but it appears to me that his duty is limited to persons so placed that they may reasonably be expected to be injured by the omission to take such care.\" Hay or Bourhill v. Young,[7]. Charlesworth, Law of Negligence, p. 67.\nThis statement, applied here to a driver of an automobile, is equally applicable to persons generally who make use of our highways.\nThe duty of Williams may be placed upon another basis. The men began firing immediately they left Fort Mispec. This was contrary to orders in two respects. They were not supposed to have either live or blank ammunition in their possession, nor were they to discharge their rifles. Such orders exist for different reasons, one of which being that persons and property of both those in the services and of the public may not be injured or damaged.\nMorin began firing near the B.O.P. at Fort Mispec; whether that was before Williams passed the Haynes-Morin truck is not clear. It is clear that the boys commenced firing at the very outset and that Williams was in the last car as they left Fort Mispec. After proceeding approximately a quarter of a mile this car passed the Haynes-Morin car. Williams, exercising reasonable care would have known, or should have known at the very outset that the men were discharging rifles and that at least one of them was discharging live ammunition, all of which was contrary to orders, and all this was upon a public highway where people travelled and along which people reside. One who is in a position where he ought to know is in the same position in law as one who knows: White v. Steadman,[8].\nIn my opinion a man placed in the position of Williams would have foreseen the possibility of damage. Indeed, quite apart from any order, under such circumstances a reasonable man in the position of Williams would have foreseen the probability of damage and therefore in my opinion a duty rested upon Williams, acting in the place and stead of the master, to have exercised reasonable care.\nThe respondents were residents along the highway and as such those toward whom Williams owed a duty to use due care that neither their person nor property be damaged. Lord Russell of Killowen:\nIn considering whether a person owes to another a duty a breach of which will render him liable to that other in damages for negligence, it is material to consider what the defendant ought to have contemplated as a reasonable man. This consideration may play a double r\u00f4le. It is relevant in cases of admitted negligence (where the duty and breach are admitted) to the question of remoteness of damage, i.e., to the question of compensation not to culpability, but it is also relevant in testing the existence of a duty as the foundation of the alleged negligence, i.e., to the question of culpability not to compensation * * * In my opinion, such a duty only arises towards those individuals of whom it may be reasonably anticipated that they will be affected by the act which constitutes the alleged breach. Hay or Bourhill v. Young,[9].\nLord Atkin:\nYou must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour. Who, then, in law is my neighbour? The answer seems to be\u2014persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question. Donoghue v. Stevenson,[10].\nAnd the same learned judge in a later case:\n* * * every person * * * is under a common law obligation to some persons in some circumstances to conduct himself with reasonable care so as not to injure those persons likely to be affected by his want of care. East Suffolk Rivers Catchment Board v. Kent[11].\nAnd Lord Dunedin:\nIf the possibility of the danger emerging is reasonably apparent, then to take no precautions is negligence; but if the possibility of danger emerging is only a mere possibility which would never occur to the mind of a reasonable man, then there is no negligence in not having taken extraordinary precautions. Fardon v. Harcourt-Rivington,[12].\nThe conduct of Morin was such as to make the possibility of danger emerging reasonably apparent to those in the position of the respondents who, in the language of Lord Russell of Killowen (above quoted), would be included among\nthose individuals of whom it may be reasonably anticipated that they will be affected by the act which constitutes the alleged breach. Williams not only owed a duty as the person in charge of this operation upon the highway to use due care, but under the circumstances of this case a reasonable man in his position would have known that live ammunition was being discharged and would have taken reasonable care to prevent a continuation thereof. In my opinion he owed this duty to the respondents.\nWilliams, however, did not exercise reasonable care. That he heard the firing is clear, but as to the reports he said:\nI wasn't sure at the time it was blank shots,\u2014I couldn't swear to that,\u2014but it sounded to me like blanks.\nHe did not even know whether it was his men firing the shots but because he heard an alarm before leaving Fort Mispec he assumed that the infantry might be discharging rifles along the road or in the woods. This assumption might have some validity had the firing not started at the very outset when he was nearby and had he been sure only blank ammunition was being fired, as he knew that the men upon manoeuvres used only blank ammunition. He made this assumption without any investigation or any inquiry until he got into Saint John where he \"questioned the men and received no response\". This in itself indicates that Williams was not satisfied with his own assumption. Upon all the evidence it appears clear that he paid no attention whatever to what the men were doing en route and only sought to excuse himself on the ground that he was in a hurry and had but a limited time to catch the boat. Such excuse does not relieve him of any responsibility.\nReasonable care on the part of Williams would not have prevented Morin discharging the first or perhaps even the second bullet. This, however, is not the case of a servant taking a bullet, concealing it and suddenly and without warning firing it thereby causing damage. This is a case of a man taking live ammunition, using it and continuing to use it, contrary to orders, either in the immediate presence of the party in charge or where that party, in the discharge of his duty, would know that the man was firing live ammunition and yet who on his part made no objection or effort to stop him with the result that after at least four or five shots had been fired over a distance of about six miles damage resulted. The evidence clearly establishes that there was considerable firing but Morin alone was firing live ammunition. There is a difference in the report created by live as distinguished from blank ammunition, a difference known to and recognized by all the men, including Williams. All of the firing was contrary to orders. If Williams within the first five miles had discharged his duty he would have stopped the firing and avoided destruction of the barn.\nThat Morin's conduct was intentional and wrongful even to the point of constituting a criminal offence does not affect the duty or responsibility of Williams.\nThat the master may be liable for the failure of the servant responsible to use due care, when the immediate cause of the damage was the wrongful act of another employee, is illustrated by Engelhart v. Farrant & Co.,[13]; Ricketts v. Thos. Tilling, Ltd.,[14]. In the latter case the servant immediately responsible was convicted of a criminal offence, as was Morin for wilful damage to property. In the latter case Lord Justice Pickford at p. 650:\nIt is admitted that the driver was sitting by the man who was driving and he could see all that was going on\u2014he could control what was going on. It seems to me that the fact that he allowed somebody else to drive does not divest him of the responsibility and duty he has towards his masters to see that the omnibus is carefully, and not negligently, driven.\nCounsel for the Crown contended that if Williams failed to perform any duty it constituted a mere breach of military regulations and not negligence within section 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act. It is not his duty under the military regulations that we are here concerned with but rather to determine whether the person in charge of this transportation of the men upon a public highway exercised reasonable care under the circumstances, and if not, did his failure to do so cause the damages here claimed? In determining what here constituted due care we may look at the military regulations, not in the sense of enforcing them, but to determine what standard of care would be reasonable under the circumstances. These army regulations do provide a standard of conduct and for this purpose are in much the same position as the regulations of the Clyde Trustees in another case where Lord Dunedin spoke as follows:\nThere are by-laws and regulations of the Clyde Trustees published to regulate the river traffic, which must be here set forth. The by-laws have not the force of statute, but like the rules of the road they form a rule of conduct, so that an infringement of them would be held to be in law a fault which, if it led to damage, would infer liability. Anglo-Newfoundland Development Co. v. Pacific Steam Navigation Co.,[15].\nWhen one takes into account the requirements of these regulations which provide that the guns should not be discharged except under instructions of a superior officer, that there is a difference in the report made by live and blank ammunition, a difference known to all of them, and in any event the men were not to discharge their rifles using either live or blank ammunition, it would seem, measured by any standard required by the military regulations, that Williams was remiss in his duty. Quite apart from those regulations, any person in charge of a group of men passing along a public highway who permits the firing of live ammuntion at random or otherwise is endangering the public and disregarding his duty to those who are upon or near the highway and is in law negligent.\nUnder the circumstances of this case it was the failure of Williams, as the party in charge, to use reasonable care to restrain Morin from discharging live ammunition as he proceeded along the highway; that his failure in this regard was a cause of the destruction of the barn. He owed the duty to use care in this regard towards the respondents as residents along the highway and his breach of that duty constituted negligence.\nIn this case Williams, a member of the military services, as officer in charge was, under section 50A of the Exchequer Court Act (1943-44 Dom. c. 25), a servant of His Majesty and his conduct constituted negligence within section 19 (c) of the Exchequer Court Act, (1927 R.S.C., c. 34).\nThe learned trial judge found that Lance Bombardier Haynes was also negligent. With deference I cannot agree with that finding. Apart from the evidence that Williams was in charge of the men, there is no evidence as to the duty, if any, that rested upon any other officers or men. If, therefore, any duties rested upon Lance Bombardier Haynes these are not disclosed in the evidence, and without evidence of his duties there can be no finding as to a breach thereof. This, however, does not affect the result.\nIn my opinion the judgment of the learned trial judge should be affirmed and this appeal dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: F.

At the time of the grant to the appellant's predecessor in title, there was an access to the main river in front of the respondent's land and the island was separated from the eastern shore of the river by a narrow channel of water. But, in the course of a century, by gradual and imperceptible deposits of alluvium, the respondent's land has become extended upstream into a junction with the easterly bank of the island as it became extended by alluvium. The narrow channel was blocked up and the island connected with the respondent's land. At the time of the trial, the junction of these accreted lands was indicated by a narrow, wet, but apparent, depression. The appellant municipality claimed title to the extension of the island on the ground that through the years the island has been enlarged by the process of accretion up to the depression and brought the present action for damages for trespass and for an injunction. The respondent contended that the entire increase is an accretion to the mainland, and, in the alternative, that as riparian owner he is entitled either to the accreted land itself by virtue of adverse possession or to rights over it sufficient to maintain his riparian privileges; and, by counter-claim, he asked damages for interference with his occupation and for an injunction. The trial judge upheld the appellant's claim. The Appeal Division reversed that judgment and held that the accreted land, at some stage in the process of its formation, have become the respondent's property and that, as riparian owner, the latter had a right of access to the river over the accretions physically connected with the island.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Appeal Division (18 M.P.R. 317), that the judgment of the trial judge should be restored, which judgment upheld the appellant municipality's claim for a title to the extension of the island up to the depression shown at the junction of the accreted lands.\nHeld also, and the trial judge so found, that the claim advanced by the respondent to title founded on adverse possession should, upon the evidence, be dismissed.\nPer The Chief Justice and Hudson and Rand JJ.:\u2014The right of access of the riparian owner to the river is not the consideration underlying accretion; but even if it were, to extend its application to land formed quite otherwise than by accretion vis a vis the riparian owner is, in the law as laid down for centuries, quite out of the question. If, in the circumstances, the most efficient use of the newly formed land would lie in its connection with the original ripa, the legislature must bring about that change; but that, on such a ground, a court should forcibly re-allocate ownership, with all its possibilities of areas and values, is a proposition supported neither by authority nor principle.\u2014Upon the facts of the case, the Municipality has been in actual occupation of the accreted lands since their formation.\nPer Kerwin and Hudson JJ.:\u2014As a riparian owner, the respondent, or his predecessors, had certain rights at one time, among them being that of access to the river. \"The rights of a riparian proprietor, * * *, exist jure naturae, because his land has, by nature, the advantage of being washed by the stream: * * *\" (Lyon v. Fishmonger's Company [1875-76] 1 A.C. 662, at 682). But, once the advantage of being washed by the water is put an end to by an act of nature, this right of access disappears, as it has disappeared in this case. Then, no question of public policy can interfere with the title which, so far as the parties hereto are concerned, has been acquired by law by the appellant Municipality.\nPer Hudson and Estey JJ.:\u2014The riparian owner's rights are subject to the changes effected by nature. So long and to the extent that nature continues the riparian owner as such, he enjoys riparian rights, but nature or the act of any person in the exercise of his rights may from time to time alter or even destroy those of a riparian owner.\u2014In the present case, the relative positions of the appellant municipality and the respondent have thus been determined by nature: the first has been fortunate, while the latter unfortunate. APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick; Appeal Division[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Richards J. and dismissing the appellant municipality's action for trespass and an injunction.\nThe trial judge also dismissed a counter-claim by the respondent, who, alleging his own title to the land, claimed damages for interference with his occupation and an injunction and that judgment was affirmed by the Appeal Division.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above headnote and in the judgments now reported.\nA. McF. Limerick for the appellant.\nW. J. West K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Rand J. was delivered by\nRand J.:\u2014The respondent is the owner of land bordering on the Saint John river below tidehead. It was formerly a portion of a large tract which in the original grant in 1787 was bounded on the west\nalong the easterly bank or shore of the said River following its several courses upstream to the bounds first mentioned.\nThis language, under the established presumption, carries the title to the ordinary high water mark; and it is not disputed that the property in the bed of the river, including the shore, remained in the Crown.\nThe appellant Municipality is the successor in title to what was an island in the river, granted in 1819, then lying wholly below the respondent's land, which in the course of a century by gradual and imperceptible deposits of alluvium has become extended upstream into a virtual junction with the easterly bank from a point about four rods below the upper boundary of the respondent's line to a point a somewhat greater distance above it. There has also been a slight accretion to the mainland and the junction of these accreted lands is indicated by a narrow, wet, but clearly defined depression. When the river is at its highest, the westerly portion of the respondent's land near the river as well as the disputed lands opposite are flooded, and they are of little apparent use otherwise than for raising hay. Between the extended island and the mainland southerly of the junction is now a narrow backwater which is of no benefit for reaching the body of the river.\nThe appellants, Webb and Bridges, in 1942 under an agreement with the Municipality sowed barley on the disputed land, the crop from which was to be theirs. The respondent destroyed part of that crop, on various occasions pastured cattle on the land, and in many or most of the years between 1914 and 1942 cut hay from it.\nThe Municipality claims title to the extension of the island up to the depression and brought the action in trespass and for an injunction. The respondent contends that as riparian owner he is entitled either to the land itself or to rights over it sufficient to maintain his riparian privileges.\nOn these facts the Appeal Division[2], reversing Richards J., held the accreted land, at some stage in the process of its formation, to have become the property of the respondent as riparian owner, and dismissed the action.\nThe result of that judgment is that a body of land at one moment vested in the Crown or its grantee, in the next is found to have passed to the respondent without any act or consent of its proprietor. This extraordinary transfer is said to have been effected through the operation of law by way of fulfilment of implications of the original grant of the shore-bounded property and on the consideration in policy of the most efficient utilization of the dry soil won from the river bottom. More specifically it is said to be necessary to the proper and contemplated enjoyment of the right of access to the river to which the riparian owner, by his grant, became entitled.\nI should observe at the outset that no question of accretion arises directly. That doctrine applies to the encroachment of dry land on water-covered land following the slow retreat of the fluid boundary between them. It is based on the physical process of the gradual deposit of alluvium at and immediately below the boundary line by which the latter becomes imperceptibly pushed back towards the river or sea. There is also the like recession of the waters. The converse process is the slow erosion of the dry land. Contrasted with these are the sudden upheavals of shore or water-bed, the abandonment of the course of a stream or the violent invasion and cutting off of land by waters. It is obvious then that only between the Crown and the Municipality could the question of accretion arise here. But the doctrine has been invoked in two aspects: it is said to be founded on the maintenance of the riparian right of access, and that consideration has been extended to what are considered the analogous physical conditions existing here: and as it is put in a dictum in St. Louis v. Rutz,[3].\nThe right of accretion to an island in the river (Mississippi) cannot be so extended lengthwise as to exclude riparian owners above or below such island from access to the river as such riparian proprietor.\nI will deal with the latter first. In the case cited, the land over which the deposit moved belonged to the riparian owner. It was a contest between a riparian owner of the river bed and the owner of an island: it does not appear what portion of the river bed was annexed to the latter: but it was an invasion beyond the boundary of the river bed belonging to the riparian proprietor that was in question; and the dictum must be interpreted in the light of that fact. If in this case, the Crown owned not only the bed but the bank, a similar though not the precise question might arise: not precise because the boundary of the riparian owner's portion of the river bed was not a fluid line; and I quite agree that in a situation where the river bottom is parcelled out between riparian and island proprietors, the interests affected do raise considerations of the sort suggested. So does the case of adjoining owners of the bed of sea or river, without more.\nIn his work De Jure Maris, Lord Hale uses this language:\nThis jus alluvionis, as I have before said, is de jure communi by the law of England the King's, viz. if by any marks or measures it can be known what is so gained; for if the gain be so insensible and indiscernible by any limits or marks that it cannot be known, idem est non esse et non apparere, as well in maritime increases as in the increases by inland rivers. (6, II).\nNow that view of the effect on accretion of \"marks or measures\" cannot be said to have been followed; but the fact that it was held by such an authority is the strongest evidence that accretion is wholly involved in boundary and is inapplicable where that boundary is not a water line. In cases then where the stream bed is parcelled out in ownership by fixed or line limits, the essential condition of accretion is lacking: and the dictum in St. Louis v. Rutz[4] appears to be founded on that conception.\nBut here a third interest intervenes, the effect on which is precisely the same whether the emerged land is attributed to the Municipality or to the Crown and regardless of where it originated. The controversy must then be decided as if the emergence of the river bed had taken place through a process of deposit confined to the land of the Crown fronting that of the respondent.\nNow is it a fact\u2014and in the foregoing I have assumed it is not\u2014that accretion is a consequence of the right to continued access to the boundary waters? I think the query is answered by the language of Smith, L.J. in Hindson v. Ashby[5]:\nThe whole doctrine of accretion is based upon the theory that from day to day, week to week and month to month, a man cannot see where his old line of boundary was by reason of the gradual and imperceptible accretion of alluvium to his land.\nIt is a matter of fluid and unstable boundary between his land and adjoining water-covered land: the title itself at that line becomes fluid and the soil passes to the one or other proprietor with the progress of the process. The identity of the ripa remains notwithstanding the accretion and the rights inhere in all of its modifications.\nBaxter C.J. deduces from Atty.-Gen. for Nigeria v. Holt[6] the principle of preserving the right of access as fundamental to the original grant; but all the case decided was that the riparian owner, by constructing artificial works on the foreshore, did not, in the circumstances, abandon his riparian rights over it. The language of Lord Shaw, relied on by both the Chief Justice and Harrison J. was obviously directed to the conflicting interests of riparian and foreshore owners and the effect upon them of acts by either. It does not touch the effect of natural changes; and there is nothing in it that remotely countenances the divesting of Crown or other ownership following a natural change other than accretion.\nI have already observed that the case must be treated as if the accreted land had imperceptibly emerged wholly on the river bed opposite the respondent's land and unconnected with the island. But from the point of view of the principle invoked, the process that brings about the obstruction is irrelevant. If that portion of the stream bed had been thrown up by a natural convulsion, the effect on the respondent would have been precisely the same; but in that case what change in property rights would have followed? None whatever. It is conceded that the owner of the river bottom would remain owner of the disgorged land; and in my opinion that settles the controversy. Admittedly, also, the same result would follow from a sudden reliction. And on principle what distinction could be made between natural changes where the legal result follows not from the mode of change but from the physical consequence?\nWhat in fact is the position of a grantee of land along a river whose banks and shores and bed are, to a degree, in a state of slow flux? Is he, in effect, entitled to an implied grant or natural right to perpetual access regardless of natural changes? Or does he become the owner of land with horizontal dimensions, one boundary of which is fluid, which so long as the water contact remains carries certain rights related to the continuous waters, but which, if in the course of nature, it ceases to be riparian, ipso facto no longer supports those rights? The answer is furnished by the rule of law applicable to avulsion or sudden reliction; the fluid boundary becomes fixed and the land ceases to be riparian.\nI am then unable to accept the view that the right of access is the consideration underlying accretion: but even if it were, to extend its application to land formed quite otherwise than by accretion vis a vis the riparian owner is, in the law as laid down for centuries, quite out of the question. If, in the circumstances, the most efficient use of the newly formed land would lie in its connection with the original ripa, the legislature must bring about that desirable change; but that, on such a ground, a court should forcibly re-allocate ownership, with all its possibilities of areas and values, is a proposition supported neither by authority nor principle.\nThe case of Waring v. Stinchcomb[7], is treated as virtually identical with the facts here; but there the contest was between adjoining riparian owners, each of whom, by statute, had a right to build out in the water in front of his lands. This raises questions of the sort suggested between adjoining owners of submerged soil; and however they may be dealt with, the interests here are quite different and the considerations raised by them likewise.\nOn appeal the respondent was permitted to add a count to the counter-claim for an injunction against the continuance of a causeway across the lower end of the so-called creek between the island and the mainland. I find it impossible to say that we have all the evidence that might be brought forward for or against that claim; and I agree that, on the record before us, no judgment can be given on that question.\nI had thought that as the Crown is the owner of the river bed, the Attorney-General should have been made a party to the action. No finding of title here can, of course, affect the interest of the Crown; but in the absence of the Attorney-General, I think it inadvisable to place a judgment in favour of the appellant on the ground that as against the Crown, the Municipality has acquired title to the lands by accretion. The facts are clear that the Municipality has been in actual occupation of the accreted lands since their formation; in fact the claim of adverse possession was asserted as against the Municipality: and on that possession by the Municipality, the claim is sufficiently founded.\nThe trial court found against the respondent on the claim of adverse possession, a finding which the evidence, in my opinion, requires us to make.\nAs I have intimated, the disputed land is of very slight value and we were told that this was in the nature of a test case for a number of similar situations along the river. In those circumstances, I think the costs should be dealt with specially. I would allow the appeal and dismiss the cross-appeal, and restore the judgment at the trial. There will be no costs in this Court or in the Court of Appeal. This judgment will be without prejudice to the claim of the respondent in relation to the causeway.\nKerwin J.:\u2014The pecuniary value of the matter in controversy in this appeal is slight but important questions of law present themselves for determination. The Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[8] came to a conclusion opposed to that of Richards J., the trial judge, and gave leave to the plaintiffs to appeal to this Court.\nThe plaintiffs are the Municipality of Queen's County and Maurice Webb and Holland B. Bridges, and the defendant is Arthur I. Cooper. In 1787 a Crown grant was made to the defendant's predecessors in title of a tract of land, the westerly boundary of which is described as being\nalong the easterly bank or shore of the said river (Saint John) following its several courses upstream to the boundaries first mentioned.\nThe Saint John river, it is admitted, was at all material times, and is, a tidal and navigable river. In 1819, the predecessors in title of the County obtained a Crown grant of Thatch Island in the river. At that time the island had a length from south to north of 71 chains and 50 links and its head was about 15 chains below or south of the continuation of the southern boundary of the land now owned and in possession of the defendant. Since then mud and silt have been deposited in the area of the river at the head of the island and between that and the mainland, with the result that the island has been extended up-river northerly for a distance of about 40 chains and has become attached to the mainland along the upper portion of this extension for a distance of about 8 chains. The juncture with the mainland begins at a point about 4 rods below the defendant's upper line, and the remaining 7 chains of juncture of the island with the mainland is with the land of the next adjoining mainland owner, north of the defendant's land. The claim by the County is for damages for trespass to that part of the land so formed in front of the defendant's intervale lots and for an injunction, and by the individual plaintiffs for damages for cutting down barley sown thereon by them with the County's permission. By counter-claim the defendant set up his own title to and possession of the lands and claimed damages for interference with his occupation and an injunction.\nThe Crown is not before the Court but, as between the parties to this litigation, the findings of fact made by the trial judge must stand, that the alluvium, except for a small portion, formed an accretion to the head of the island, producing the latter's present extension; that the remaining portion of the alluvium formed a small accretion to the mainland; and that the boundary line between the accretion to the island and that to the mainland is a certain depression referred to in the evidence and in the judgment. On these findings of fact, Richards J. determined that in law the County was the owner of the land in question and directed judgment to be entered, with costs, for the County for $5.00 and for an injunction, and for the individuals, for $100 and dismissed the counter-claim with costs.\nThe Chief Justice of New Brunswick concluded that the County had no claim to the new made land as he considered that while, as between the island on the west and the bank owners on the east of the small channel between the island and the mainland, and also on the western side of the island, ex adverso of the western bank of the river, the owners of the island as originally formed were riparian proprietors, they were not so with respect to the head of the island, and he referred to a statement of Sir Louis Davies in Francis Kerr Co. v. Seely[9]. In that case, however, it should be noted that what Sir Louis Davies was dealing with was a water-lot and it was in that connection that he stated that the lessee thereof was not a riparian proprietor in any sense of the word.\nOn principle, the owner of an island is a riparian proprietor as to every part thereof; the fact that this island has always been ovoid in shape is merely an accident and can make no difference in the application of the principle. Their Lordships of the Privy Council were dealing with an island in Secretary of State for India in Council v. Foucar and Company, Limited[10], where, at page 24, appears the following:\u2014 The conclusions which their Lordships draw from these facts are that in each case the grant was of land forming part of the foreshore of tidal water, of which the south boundary and, in the material cases, the east boundary also, was the river.\nThe important holding was that the principle of accretion applied to Burma but it is significant that the point mentioned by the Chief Justice was never raised. It was also pointed out, at page 25, that the basis of the rule that gradual accretion enures to the land which attracts it has been differently stated at different times:\u2014\n* * * but their Lordships think it must be regarded as a rule of \"general convenience and security\": per Lord Shaw in Attorney-General of Southern Nigeria v. John Holt & Co. (Liverpool) Ltd.[11]; and as necessary for the \"mutual adjustment and protection of property\": per Lord Abinger In re Hull and Selby Railway[12].\nA single sentence in the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in St. Louis v. Rutz[13] is relied upon:\u2014\nThe right to accretions to an island in the river cannot be so extended lengthwise of the river as to exclude riparian proprietors above or below the island from access to the river.\nThat must be read in connection with the fact that there the riparian proprietor was the owner of the bed of the Mississippi river and with the prior holding of the Court that the law of title by accretion had no application since its progress was not imperceptible in the legal sense. Mulry v. Norton[14] also needs careful examination in order to ascertain exactly what the Court was dealing with. It is merely a decision that however accretions may be commenced or continued, the right of the one owner of uplands to follow and appropriate them ceases when the formation passes laterally the line of a coterminous neighbour. A number of other American cases have been referred to but in reading them care must be observed to differentiate between the decisions in States which have followed the English common law as to the title of an owner of lands bounded by water extending to the middle thread of a stream and those in which a different rule has been formulated. It will also be found that a number of these cases are concerned with the title to submerged land on its reappearance. Mr. Justice Harrison considered that:\u2014\nPublic policy is served by providing for the most efficient utilization of land formed by accretion and the most efficient utilization is obtained by giving accreted land lying in front of a shore lot to the riparian owner, where such accreted land blocks access to the navigable water.\nUndoubtedly, as a riparian owner, the defendant, or his predecessors, had certain rights at one time, among them being that of access to the river.\nBut the rights of a riparian proprietor, so far as they relate to any natural stream, exist jure naturae, because his land has, by nature, the advantage of being washed by the stream: * * *\nper Lord Selbourne in Lyon v. Fishmongers' Company[15] at 682, and again at 683:\u2014\nIt is, of course, necessary for the existence of a riparian right that the land should be in contact with the flow of the stream.\nOnce the advantage of being washed by the water is put an end to by an act of nature, the right of access disappears. Countenance is lent this conclusion upon a question of a private right by the decision in The King v. Montague[16] where it was held that a public right of navigation in a river or creek may be extinguished by natural causes such as the recess of the sea or an accumulation of silt and mud. The right of access having in this case disappeared, no question of public policy can interfere with the title which so far as the parties hereto are concerned has been acquired by law by the County.\nThe claim advanced by the defendant to title founded on adverse possession was quite rightly dismissed by the trial judge. At the hearing of the appeal before the Appeal Division, the defendant was allowed to amend his counterclaim by alleging that the plaintiff County built a bridge or causeway across the lower end of the creek or channel between the mainland and Thatch Island, which interfered with the rights of the defendant. No such question was raised at the trial and there being no evidence directed to the point, the matter should not be dealt with.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the cross-appeal dismissed and the judgment at the trial restored. Since this is in the nature of a test case, under all the circumstances, there might very well be no costs in this Court or in the Appeal Division. Hudson J.:\u2014For the reasons given by my brothers Kerwin, Rand and Estey, I agree that in this action, on the facts as found by the learned trial judge, the appeal should be allowed and the cross-appeal dismissed and the judgment at the trial restored, with no costs here or in the Appeal Division.\nEstey J.:\u2014This is an appeal in an action for trespass, the real purpose of which is to determine which of the parties has title to the accreted part of Thatch Island in the Saint John river. The parties are in agreement that by the process of accretion the original island has been extended for some distance up the river and joined to the mainland. The judgment of the learned trial judge in favour of the appellant county was reversed by the appellate court of New Brunswick.\nIn 1819, when Thatch Island was granted to the Justices of the Peace of Queens County (subsequently taken over by the county), it consisted of a parcel of land 71-50 chains in length, lying along the easterly shore of the river and separated therefrom by a channel of water in width about 1-20 chains which varied only slightly throughout its length. The respondent's parcel then fronted upon the river a distance of 16-42 chains. The head of the island was then 20 chains below or down the river from the respondent's lower or southerly boundary. By 1900 the head of the island had by the process of accretion reached a point about opposite the respondent's upper or northerly boundary. By 1935 the head of the island was about 7 chains above that boundary and at some date between 1900 and 1935 it joined to the mainland at a point about 4 rods below the upper or northerly boundary of respondent's land, and now from that point adheres to the mainland some distance beyond the respondent's upper or northerly boundary.\nThe dispute between the parties hereto commenced, so far as the records are concerned, with a resolution passed by the Municipal Council of Queen's on January 19, 1932, requesting the respondent to discontinue cutting hay on the end of Thatch Island, and authorizing the placing of stakes to indicate the boundary of its property. The respondent does not remember receiving notice of such a resolution and there is no evidence that these stakes were placed. Later a fence was erected by the county and by some person destroyed. The respondent, although admitting having seen the fence, denied having any part in the removal or destruction thereof. In 1942 the appellants, Webb and Bridges, under an agreement with the appellant county, planted a portion of the land in question with barley and timothy seed. The defendant, in August, entered upon the premises and cut and destroyed a portion of the barley. It is this alleged trespass upon the part of the defendant that provides the basis for this litigation. The parties agreed to the following statement of facts:\n1. That the Saint John river at the material times and places was and is a tidal and navigable river.\n2. That the plaintiff, the Municipality of Queens County, was at all material times and still is the owner and possessor of as much of that certain island lot situate in the Saint John river, known as Thatch Island as is bounded and described in the grant of the said island to the Justice of the Peace of Queens County by the Crown, the said grant being numbered 1145 and being dated on the 1st day of September, 1819.\n3. That the defendant was at all material times and still is the owner and possessor of certain intervale lands, situate in the parish of Canning in the county of Queens, known as lot no. 15 and the upper or northern one half of lot no. 16 as bounded and described in the grant to William Spry and others, the said grant being number 105 and being dated the 30th day of January, 1787, the said lots having been conveyed to the said defendant by one William S. Cooper by deed bearing date the 17th day of April, 1916, registered in Queen's County records in book P-4 at pages 312-3 as no. 31583.\n4. That the westerly boundary of the said lots 15 and 16 was at the date of the said grant in 1787, described as being \"along the easterly bank or shore of the said river (Saint John) following its several courses upstream to the bounds first mentioned.\"\nThe appellant county, as owner of the original island, submits that through the years this island has been enlarged by the process of accretion, and therefore it has at all times been the owner of the entire island.\nThe respondent submits that the entire increase is an accretion to the mainland. In the alternative that as the riparian owner he is entitled to all the island contained in the area bound by an extension of his upper and lower mainland boundary lines across the accreted area, and in the further alternative that he is entitled to that portion of the accreted land by virtue of the principles underlying adverse possession. The learned trial judge found as a fact\nthat the alluvion, except for a relatively small portion, formed as an accretion on the head of the island, producing the present extension to the island; that the remaining portion of the alluvion formed a small accretion to the mainland; that the boundary line between the accretion to the island and that to the mainland is the line of depression above referred to, as shown in the survey of C. R. Starkey of 1942, and as marked by him on the ground by stakes \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" and \"D\" during that survey.\nThis finding of fact is supported by the evidence and provides an answer to the respondent's first contention.\nThe respondent's alternative constitutes the principal issue in this appeal. He submits that under the circumstances this case cannot be decided solely upon the basis of the law of accretion. That his rights as riparian owner must be maintained and to do so it is necessary that he be declared owner of that part of the accreted island land lying in front of his mainland. His submission on this point is as follows:\nIn other words where there are competing rights the right of the riparian owner of access will prevail over that of another owner, particularly where the latter suffers no detriment. This is because of benefit and convenience and of the necessity for the permanent protection and adjustment of property and not because of physical attachment. Otherwise the land of the riparian owner would become a hinterland.\nAt common law as and when land was increased by the process of accretion the newly formed land became the property of the owner of the land to which it attached. The accumulation under that process is so slow and imperceptible that for practical and convenient purposes in the \"mutual adjustment and protection of property\" it is regarded as never having taken place and the owner of the land affected by the accretion as having always owned both the original and the accreted portion. In re Hull and Selby Rly. Co.[17]; Secretary of State for India in Council v. Foucar[18].\nThe riparian owner acquires his rights not by grant or prescription but \"as a natural incident to the right of the soil itself: Chasemore v. Richards,[19]. His soil as it abuts upon a body of water gives to him his position and rights as a riparian owner. As Lord Selborne stated:\u2014 It is, of course, necessary for the existence of a riparian right that the land should be in contact with the flow of the stream; * * * Lyon v. Fishmongers' Company,[20].\nAny infringement of his rights by a party or the Crown will give to him a right of action for damages and often a basis for an injunction. His rights, however, are subject to the rights of other riparian owners and indeed of those who in the proper exercise of their own rights may cause him damage. He must exercise his rights in a manner that will not interfere with the rights of other riparian owners.\nIn Chasemore v. Richards[21], the defendant dug a well upon his land and thereby utilized water upon his own premises which, while having no defined course, had prior thereto found its way to the river in question. The construction of this well adversely affected the flow of the river, but although the plaintiff's rights as riparian owner were interfered with, he had no claim against the defendant. See also Mayor, etc., of Bradford v. Pickles[22].\nIn Foster v. Wright[23], the river originally flowed through the plaintiff's land. Gradually and imperceptibly the river on one side wore away the plaintiff's land to the point that it was extinguished and continued to encroach upon and wear away the defendant's land until at the time of the action what was formerly defendant's upland was a portion of the river bed. The plaintiff had the exclusive right of fishing in this part of the river but the defendant contended that this right did not extend over that part of the river bed which could be identified as previously his land. The defendant had by virtue of the process of erosion become a riparian owner but his rights were subject to the fishing right of the plaintiff though the river had changed its position. The Court said:\nThe river has never lost its identity nor its bed the legal owner.\nIn the course of his judgment Lindley J. stated as follows at p. 446:\nGradual accretions of land from water belong to the owner of the land gradually added to: Rex v. Yarborough,[24]; and, conversely, land gradually incroached upon by water, ceases to belong to the former owner: In re Hull and Selby Ry. Co.[25]. The law on this subject is based upon the impossibility of identifying from day to day small additions to or subtractions from land caused by the constant action of running water.\nIn Withers v. Purchase[26], the defendant sought by dredging and cleansing the river to increase its flow \"to restore the current to its former course\". This work on the part of the defendant would have reduced the flow into Fish Lake Cut where the plaintiff had a mill. An injunction was granted restraining the defendant on the basis that while he was endeavouring to restore a former flow he was in fact interfering with the natural course of the river as it now obtained. Mr. Justice Kekewich, in the course of his judgment at p. 821, stated:\nThe wonted or accustomed course of a stream which riparian owners are entitled to say must not be disturbed is not, in my judgment to be found by historical research, but is that which has its natural and apparently permanent course at the time when the right is asserted or called in question.\nAnd again at p. 822:\nI can discover no sound argument against extending to the bed the principle applicable to the banks\u2014that where a stream changes its course by slow steps the riparian proprietors are obliged to accept the consequent alteration in their boundaries.\nThe position of a riparian owner is set forth in an oft quoted and approved passage in a judgment of Lord Wensley dale:\nIt has been now settled that the right to the enjoyment of a natural stream of water on the surface, ex jure naturae, belongs to the proprietor of the adjoining lands, as a natural incident to the right to the soil itself, and that he is entitled to the benefit of it, as he is to all the other natural advantages belonging to the land of which he is the owner. He has the right to have it come to him in its natural state, in flow, quantity and quality, and to go from him without obstruction; upon the same principle that he is entitled to the support of his neighbour's soil for his own in its natural state. His right in no way depends upon prescription, or the presumed grant of his neighbour. Chasemore v. Richards,[27].\nLyon v. Fishmongers' Company[28], Hindson v. Ashby[29], North Shore Ry. Co. v. Pion[30].\nThat the same rules with respect to accretion and erosion apply to islands as to the mainland would appear to be established: Secretary of State for India in Council v. Foucar[31]; Great Torrington Commons Conservators v. Moore Stevens[32]; 33 Halsbury, 2nd Ed. 534. The foregoing and the authorities generally indicate that the riparian owner's rights are subject to the changes effected by nature. So long and to the extent that nature continues the riparian owner as such, he enjoys riparian rights, but nature or the act of any person in the exercise of his rights may from time to time alter or even destroy those of a riparian owner.\nThe relative positions of the appellant and the respondent have been determined by nature. The appellant here has been fortunate, the respondent unfortunate. Sometimes nature favours one and sometimes another, but such are changes incidental to the soil abutting upon a body of water. The law recognizes such changes as inevitable and adjusts the rights of the parties as and when and to the extent that nature alters their positions. It is the natural process of accretion that has altered the areas in holdings of the appellant county and the respondent, and on that basis the learned trial judge has found their boundary to be that line along which the accretion to the island and the mainland met.\nUnder this view there appears to be no conflict such as the respondent suggests.\nThe right to accretions is one of the riparian rights incident to all land bordering on the water. Lamont J., Clarke v. City of Edmonton,[33].\nHis position as a riparian owner is affected by the natural process of accretion or erosion as the case may be, and to his position as so determined the law attributes his rights as riparian owner. The common law has been developed to avoid just such conflicts as respondent suggests and does so by adjusting the rights of the parties according to changes effected by nature.\nThe respondent submitted a number of United States authorities in which discussions and statements will be found favourable to his contention. While these statements are entitled to the greatest respect, they were made in cases that are distinguishable upon their facts. Mulry v. Norton[34] and St. Louis v. Rutz[35], are not cases of accretion. Both of these decisions are reached upon principles well established in the common law. The discussions upon which the respondent relies were not necessary to the decisions and really dictum. The case of Waring v. Stinchcomb[36] does not involve an island and was decided largely upon a statement found in Lamprey v. State[37]. In the latter case the basis of the law of accretion was stated as follows:\n* * * to preserve the fundamental riparian right\u2014on which all others depend, and which often constitutes the principal value of the land\u2014of access to the water.\nSuch a basis is quite different from that which, as already indicated, has been accepted in our law. It is also to be noted that Fillmore v. Jennings[38], and Van Dusen Inv. Co. v. Western Fishing Co.[39] were cases in which islands were involved and in which the island owner was entitled to the accretion to the island regardless of what part of the island it attached itself. It will therefore be observed that in the United States there is not uniformity of decision. Moreover, in some jurisdictions where a rule approaching that for which the respondent contends, it is found necessary to make exceptions thereto. Farnham, Waters & Water Rights, p. 2489. It would appear that in a country such as Canada, where we have large rivers and many islands large and small, the common law rule should be adhered to and if in a given locality the circumstances are such to make some other rule desirable the matter should be dealt with by legislation.\nThe respondent in the further alternative claims the land in question by virtue of his possession thereof. He and his brother bought the mainland parcel in 1912 and his brother sold out to him in 1916. He asserts his possession upon the fact that in each year from 1913 inclusive he cut the hay on the land in question in the month of August, except in the last three years when he rented it to another party. I am in agreement with the disposition made by the learned trial judge against this contention of the defendant. In my opinion his possession could not be described otherwise than \"occasional, or for a special or temporary purpose\", and therefore his occupation was not \"exclusive, continuous, open or visible and notorious\" as required by the authorities. Sherren v. Pearson[40]; Wood v. LeBlanc[41].\nBefore the Appeal Division the respondent amended his counter-claim by asking for damages and a mandatory injunction ordering the appellant municipality to remove a bridge or causeway constructed between the mainland and Thatch Island, and for a further injunction to restrain the appellant from building any other such bridge. The learned judges in the court of appeal, because of the conclusions at which they arrived, were not called upon to deal with this particular issue. It was not an issue at the trial and while there is some evidence with regard to it, one cannot but feel that there might well be additional evidence, particularly as it is built out from the mainland of another owner not a party to these proceedings. Furthermore, the act of the Municipal Council, as evidenced by its resolution of January 1936 giving to the respondent a right to cross the head of Thatch Island, may well be a factor in dealing with certain phases of such issues. In any event, I do not think there is sufficient evidence to justify a final disposition of the matter, and I therefore think that this decision should be without prejudice to the rights of the parties with respect to that bridge or causeway.\nThis appeal should be allowed, the cross-appeal dismissed and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored. I agree with the disposition of costs as directed by my brothers Kerwin and Rand.\nAppeal allowed, cross-appeal dismissed, judgment of the trial judge restored, no costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Limerick & Limerick.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Hanson, Dougherty & West.\n[1] (1945) 18 M.P.R. 317.\n[2] (1945) 18 M.P.R. 317.\n[3] (1890) 138-U.S. 226.\n[4] (1890) 138 U.S. 226.\n[5] [1896] 2 Ch. 1, at 28.\n[6] (1914) 84 L.J.

(Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nMillie Maxim (Plaintiff) Respondent\nEagle Fire Company of New York (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nMillie Maxim (Plaintiff) Respondent\n1946: May 16, 17; 1946: October 1.\nPresent: \u2014 Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin, Hudson, Rand and Estey JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION.\nInsurance (Fire)\u2014False representation by applicant for policy\u2014Nondisclosure or denial of previous fires\u2014Transfer of property\u2014Request by transferor to place insurance in name of transferee\u2014Insurance company endorsing policy to cover transferee\u2014Whether assignment or new contract\u2014Right of transferee to recover on policy\u2014Whether misrepresentation by transferor a defence to action. The appellant companies issued two insurance policies to the respondent's husband on property owned by him consisting of a flour mill and equipment. During their currency, the property was conveyed to the respondent, and it is admitted that she is a bona fide purchaser for value. The policies were then taken to the local agent of the appellant companies by the husband, with the request that, as the property had been transferred, the insurance be placed in the name of his wife. An endorsement was then affixed to the policies by the two companies in nearly the same terms, reading \"* * * this policy is held to cover in her name only * * *. All other terms and conditions remaining unchanged.\" A material misrepresentation was made by the husband in his application for insurance, when he stated that he never had a fire previously. The trial judge found that the statement was knowingly false and such finding was not disturbed by the appellate court. The property insured was totally destroyed by fire, and the respondent brought two actions against the appellant companies for the amount of the policies. The trial judge held that the misrepresentation by the husband could be set up as a defence against the respondent's claim and no waiver of statutory condition No. 1 of The Alberta Insurance Act could be inferred from the language of the assent by the companies; and the actions were dismissed. The Appellate Division, reversing that judgment, found that the effect of the request made by the husband on behalf of his wife and the endorsements on the policies by the companies was to create new contracts of insurance running direct to the wife as then owner of the property, and that the misrepresentation had no application to them; the respondent's actions were maintained. Held, affirming the judgment appealed from ([1945] 3 W.W.R. 705), The Chief Justice and Hudson J. dissenting, that, upon the facts and circumstances of the case, non-disclosure or denial of previous fires by the husband in his application for fire insurance cannot be set as a defence to the actions on the policies brought by the respondent against the appellant companies.\nPer The Chief Justice and Hudson J. (dissenting):\u2014The insurance policies, as between the original insured and the appellant companies, were void and unenforcible; but the effect of the assignment remains to be decided.\u2014Though the misrepresentation was made by the husband and not by his wife, the husband was representing her in getting the approval of the companies to the transfer. The respondent must be held responsible for his acts as her agent, the respondent herself in her evidence proving such agency. \"Concealment or misrepresentation (by the agent) is to be imputed to his principal and any policy effected through him will be void.\" Moreover, there was no change in the moral risk as the husband remained in control of the insured property after the transfer to his wife. Under the circumstances, the respondent acquired no rights under the policies.\nPer Kerwin and Estey JJ.:\u2014The respondent was not a mere assignee, who thus would take nothing from policies avoided for misrepresentation. \u2014In view of the manner in which the companies' local agent was apprised of the respondent's wish to have the insurance in her name, and of the evidence of representatives of the companies that they had no objection to the respondent as an insured, it follows that new contracts were entered into between the companies and the respondent. The respondent was a purchaser for value; and, in the ordinary-course of business, it should be possible for a purchaser of insured property to enter into a new contract of insurance without being bound by all representations that had been made to the insurer by his predecessor in title.\u2014The wording \"all other terms and conditions remaining unchanged\" must be taken to refer to such terms as are applicable to the new contracts and the answers to the questions as to previous fires, by the husband, do not constitute an applicable term.\nPer Rand J.:\u2014Assignment of a contract of fire insurance is essentially different from an ordinary assignment. The latter is a matter between assignor and assignee solely; but admittedly, and here by express terms, in such insurance it is a condition that there be assent by the company. The insured cannot by his own act substitute a new party to the contract and thereby change the moral risk and the interest in the subject matter insured. The effect of the company's assent is to substitute the assignee as the person insured, the transaction involves also a reapplication of terms, the entire group of relations undergoes a readjustment and what emerges is a completely new contract. In this case, therefore, a new contract based on the existing policies was entered into with the respondent. But its terms and conditions must be determined; and, in particular, was it made on the basis of the original application so as to constitute the misrepresentation a fundamental defect? The simple procedure of assignment furnishes the answer to that question. The request for approval of an assignment is in effect an application for a new contract of insurance; the company may require any information before giving consent and could insist upon an application de novo. But, if it does not see fit to do so, the company must be deemed to have been content to deal with the assignee on the footing of his own representations alone and should not be able to raise against the assignee any misrepresentation made by the assignor.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Ewing J. A.[2] and maintaining two actions by the respondent to enforce a claim for loss occasioned by fire in respect of property insured under policies issued by each of the appellant companies.\nG. H. Steer K.C. and R. Martland K.C. for the appellants.\nJ. N. McDonald K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Hudson J. (dissenting) was delivered by\nHUDSON J.:\u2014These actions were brought to enforce claims under insurance policies which the defendant companies had issued to the plaintiff's husband, and which policies were subsequently assigned to the plaintiff to whom, meanwhile, the property had been transferred.\nThe facts are fully set forth in the judgment of Mr. Justice Ewing at the trial2. He found (a) that the plaintiff's husband, in each application to the defendant companies for the insurance, had represented that he never had a fire previous to the date of the applications; (b) that such representation was false to the knowledge of the applicant; (c) that such misrepresentation was of facts material to be made known to the defendants, to enable them to judge of the risks they were undertaking.\nOn these findings the learned judge held that the policies were void. He referred to section 1 of the Statutory Conditions in Schedule B of the Insurance Act, R.S.A. 1942, chapter 201, as follows:\n1. If any person applying for insurance falsely describes the property to the prejudice of the insurer, or misrepresents or fraudulently omits to communicate any circumstance which is material to be made known to the insurer in order to enable it to judge of the risk to be undertaken, the contract shall be void as to the property in respect of which the misrepresentation or omission is made.\nHe also held that this defence was valid as against the plaintiff as assignee and dismissed the action.\nIn the Appellate Division[3] this decision was reversed and judgment given for the plaintiff for the amounts claimed. Chief Justice Harvey arrived at his decision on two grounds: first, that it is only a misrepresentation or omission in respect of the insured property that comes within the terms of the condition, and in the present case it was other properties of the insured where the previous fires had occurred; secondly, that the assignment to the plaintiff when approved of resulted in a new contract between her and the company to which the condition in question here did not apply.\nMr. Justice Ford and Mr. Justice Macdonald agreed with the Chief Justice on the second ground but did not express any opinion on the first.\nIn respect of the first ground relied on by the Chief Justice, counsel for the appellant contended that the question simply is whether the occurrence of previous fires with respect to other properties is a material circumstance to be considered by an insurer, to enable him to judge of the risk he undertakes. This view is supported by a decision of the Judicial Committee in Condogianis v. Guardian Assurance Company Ltd.[4]. In regard to what was a misleading answer to a similar question, Lord Shaw said at p. 131:\nIt is not to be wondered at that this was made the basis of the contract, because insurance companies might hesitate long before entering into a contract with an insurer who had been formerly a claimant upon companies, and they would have been put upon their inquiry as to what these claims were and how they had been settled and what were the circumstances of these former transactions. The importance of the question might be increased by the number of times in which such transactions had taken place.\nThe question goes to the \"moral\" risk which, after all, is much the most important in a case of fire insurance. The danger is not merely that of incendiarism but of carelessness. The careless man in control of property is no doubt responsible for a very large percentage of destructive fires. At the expiration of the term provided for in the original insurance policies, new policies were issued by each of the companies. These were in the nature of renewal policies and upon the same terms and conditions as the earlier policies and on the faith of the original applications. For that reason this condition continued to apply.\nI, therefore, agree with the learned trial judge that as between the original insured and the defendant companies the policies were void and unenforcible.\nThere remains the question of the effect of the assignment to the plaintiff. It appears that in July, 1943, Efrim Maxim, the husband, transferred the title of the flour mill insured to his wife, the plaintiff, and a certificate of title was issued in her name. Several weeks later he told the local agent of each of the insurance companies about this transfer and, at his request, this agent wrote a letter to each of them as follows:\nAugust 12, 1943.\nI am informed by the assured that he has transferred the property in the name of his wife, Mrs. Millie Maxim. Please issue the endorsement and send same over to me for attachment to the above policy.\nAs requested, the companies issued and forwarded to their agent, to be delivered to the plaintiff, endorsements to be attached to the policies in the following language:\nThe Springfield endorsement:\nNotice received and accepted that the title to the within described property now stands in the name of Mrs. Millie Maxim and this policy is held to cover in her name only. All other terms and conditions remaining unchanged.\nThe Eagle endorsement:\nNotice is hereby received and accepted that the property insured under the within policy now stands in the \"name of Mrs. Millie Maxim, and this policy shall, in future, read and cover in the name of Mrs. Millie Maxim, with loss, if any, payable to the Assured and not as heretofore written. All other terms and conditions remaining unchanged.\nSome months later the insured property was totally destroyed and the plaintiff claimed the full amount insured for from each company.\nThe general rule as to the position of an assignee of a fire insurance policy is stated in Welford and Otter Barry's Fire Insurance, 3rd ed. at p. 223:\nOn the other hand, as the assignee merely takes the place of the original assured, he necessarily succeeds to the consequences of any act or omission by which the validity of the policy may have been affected before the assignment, and he may, therefore, through no fault of his own fail to recover in the event of a loss.\nSee also Couch's Cyclopedia of Insurance, vol. 6.\nThe contention on behalf of the respondent here is that the misrepresentation of the husband in the original applications became irrelevant when the property passed to a new owner, that in such case the rights of the purchasers of properties who were entirely innocent of the misrepresentations and who were not parties to same would be put in a most unfair and improper position.\nIt is true that the misrepresentation was made by Efrim Maxim, not by his wife, but Efrim Maxim represented his wife in getting the approval of the company to the transfer. She was responsible for his acts as her agent. Welford and Otter Barry's Fire Insurance, p. 152:\nWhere the policy is effected through the medium of an agent of the assured, such as, for example, an insurance broker, the duty as to disclosure applies as fully as in the case where the assured effects the policy himself. If, therefore, the agent fails to perform this duty, and is guilty of concealing or misrepresenting a material fact, his concealment or misrepresentation is to be imputed to his principal, and any policy effected through him will be void.\nMoreover, the moral risk involved remained. The husband always carried, on the business of operating the mill in question, not only before but after the transfer to the wife. It was a flour mill and not the sort of business which a woman would be likely to operate. The position was stated by her as follows:\nQ. Have you ever carried on business as a flourmiller yourself? A. Myself?\nQ. Yes, have you ever done that business? Did you ever learn to mill flour?\nA. I didn't learn. How could a woman learn to mill flour?\nQ. Since you went to Smoky Lake in 1936 Mr. Maxim has always looked after the flour milling business?\nA. Yes.\nQ. But he was the man who really ran the business?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And he still ran the business after he transferred the property to you?\nA. Yes.\nAnd again:\nQ. After you got the transfer of the flour mill, did you keep the books or did Mr. Maxim?\nA. Well, the books, it was his work. Q. That was his work?\nA. Yes.\nQ. And he would receive the money from the farmers when they paid it?\nA. Yes.\nQ. He would be the one who really ran the business there?\nA. Yes.\nAgain:\nQ. The truth is you were worried about this money that Mr. Maxim had in the Prairie Rose Company, isn't that right?\nA. I guess so; I think so.\nQ. And you wanted to have the flour mill in your name so that it would be safe, in case anybody made claims against Mr. Maxim, isn't that right?\nA. Yes it was part of it.\nQ. Did you ever go and see Mr. Romaniuk yourself?\nA. No.\nQ. You did not have any talk with him about insurance?\nA. No.\nChief Justice Harvey expressed his views in the following language:\nThe important words of these endorsements are in the last clause: \"All other terms and conditions remaining the same.\" Condition 1 is one of the conditions which still applies but it must be adapted to the new contract which is one between Mrs. Millie Maxim and the company instead of one between Efrim Maxim and the company and condition 1 is concerned only with representation made by the \"person applying for insurance.\" Certainly Efrim Maxim did not apply for this insurance which is for the benefit and protection of his wife, other than as agent for her. She was the principal making the application. She acquires her rights under this policy not by assignment but as the terms of a new contract as disclosed in the words of the endorsement. All she received from Efrim Maxim is the benefit of the consideration already paid to the company for which presumably, as in the usual case, she has given him consideration, it then becomes a consideration from her to the company.\nMr. Justice Ford stated his reason as follows:\nThere has been no formal assignment of the policy, and the plaintiff is not relying upon a legal or equitable assignment thereof. She is the insured, and in my opinion her rights are to be determined as those of any applicant who has obtained insurance without a formal application therefor. Whatever duty she had to disclose or not to conceal such a circumstance material to the risk as is relied upon by the respondents, such disclosure is relative only to a new contract made with her.\nThere was no consideration for the change in the name of the insured. It was made at the request of her agent who was the person guilty of the original misrepresentation by which the insurance was secured. This agent was then and remained in control of the insured property. There was no change in the moral risk. In Welford on Fire Insurance, 3rd ed. at p. 223, it is stated:\nOn the other hand, as the assignee merely takes the place of the original assured, he necessarily succeeds to the consequences of any act or omission by which the validity of the policy may have been affected before the assignment, and he may, therefore, through no fault of his own, fail to recover in the event of a loss.\nThe insurers do not, by the mere fact of giving their consent to the assignment, preclude themselves from afterwards asserting that the policy had already been avoided at the date of the assignment. The form of their consent and the circumstances in which it was given may, however, amount, to a new contract, and therefore place the assignee in a better position than the original assured.\nThis statement in Welford is amply borne out by the authorities.\nThe contract of fire insurance required throughout its existence the utmost good faith on the part of both the insurer and the insured.\nThe defendants in their several defences set up that the plaintiff acquired no rights under the policy because it was null and void ab initio, by reason of the misrepresentations and non disclosures of the husband. It was the plaintiff in her evidence who proved the agency of her husband in securing the consent to the transfer to her name. The consequence of such agency, in my opinion, follows as a matter of law. Under these circumstances the plaintiff acquired no rights under the policy.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial with costs.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Estey J.J. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.:\u2014The respondent, Millie Maxim, brought an action against Springfield Fire and Marine Insurance Company on a policy of fire insurance for loss suffered by the destruction by fire of a flour mill and equipment in the village of Smoky Lake, in the province of Alberta. She also brought an action against the Eagle Fire Company of New York on a policy of fire insurance for the same loss. An order was made consolidating the trials of the two actions, which came on before Mr. Justice Ewing who dismissed the actions[5]. Upon appeal, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[6] gave judgment for the respondent, and the two insurance companies now appeal.\nThe flour mill and equipment were at one time owned by Efrim Maxim, the husband of the respondent, and on May 18, 1942, he applied in writing for $2,500 insurance. The application was directed to a different company but nothing turns on this as it was accepted, and policy no. 12872 issued, by the appellant, Springfield Fire and Marine Insurance Company. On June 11, 1942, Maxim applied in writing for $2,000 insurance on the same property and again, while the application was directed to a different company, it was accepted, and policy no. 15741 issued, by the Eagle Fire Company of New York. In each application was a question: \"Have you ever had a fire?\", to which the applicant answered \"No\". Each policy was for the term of one year and in 1943, on May 18 and June 11 respectively, each of the companies issued to Efrim Maxim a new policy for the corresponding amount covering the mill and equipment.\nIn July, 1943, Efrim Maxim transferred and conveyed all his estate and interest in the property to his wife, the present respondent, and a certificate of title was issued to her on July 21. In August of the same year, Efrim Maxim notified the local agent of the appellants of the transfer and that his wife wanted the insurance in her name, and on the 16th of that month, each appellant issued and delivered to the respondent an endorsement to the policy issued by it. The Springfield endorsement reads as follows:\u2014\nNotice received and accepted that the title to the within described property now stands in the name of Mrs. Millie Maxim and this policy is held to cover in her name only.\nAll other terms and conditions remaining unchanged.\nThe Eagle endorsement is in the following words:\u2014\nNotice is hereby received and accepted that the property insured under the within policy now stands in the name of Mrs. Millie Maxim, and this, policy, shall, in future, read and cover in the name of Mrs. Millie Maxim, with loss, if any, payable to the assured and not as heretofore written.\nAll other terms and conditions remaining unchanged.\nOn February 24, 1944, the property insured was totally destroyed by fire. Mr. Justice Ewing found that the answers to the questions in the original applications quoted above were false to Efrim Maxim's knowledge because, while carrying on business at Bellis, Alberta, he had sustained two fire losses prior to the applications, one in 1931 and the other in 1936, and that these were material circumstances to be made known to the insurers in order to enable them to judge the risk to be undertaken within the meaning of Alberta Statutory Condition No. 1:\u2014\nMisrepresentation. 1. If any person applying for insurance falsely describes the property to the prejudice of the insurer, or misrepresents or fraudulently omits to communicate any circumstances which is material to be made known to the insurer in order to enable it to judge of the risk to be undertaken, the contract shall be void as to the property in respect of which the misrepresentation or omission is made.\nIt was only after the fire in February, 1944, that the companies learned of the previous fire losses.\nThe trial judge treated the policies issued in 1943 as mere renewals of the 1942 originals and held that it was settled law that a renewal is made on the faith of the truth of the original representations. As to the endorsements, he held they constituted new contracts entered into between the respondent and the insurers but that they were based upon the terms of the then existing policies.\nThe Appellate Division did not disturb the finding that the answers of Efrim Maxim were false and that the prior fire losses were material circumstances to be made known to the companies. No attack was, or very well could be, made upon it. The Appellate Division did not deal with the contention that the new policies of May and June, 1943, must be taken to be issued on the strength of the original representations but, while counsel for the respondent raised the point before us, there is no doubt that the trial judge was correct; Sun Insurance Office v. Roy[7]. The Appellate Division, however, held that the respondent was not an assignee but that, in the circumstances, she had entered into a new contract with each company. Under The Alberta Insurance Act, an application for such policies as are before us need not be in writing.\nThe Chief Justice of Alberta held that, even assuming Statutory Condition I avoided the contracts with Efrim Maxim, there was a new and valid contract effected with his wife, under which she has a valid claim. Ford J. stated that there had been no formal assignment of the policy and that the respondent's rights were to be determined as those of any other applicant who had obtained insurance without a formal application therefor. The new contracts, he continued, were based upon the terms of the existing policies in accordance with the terms of the companies' consents, \"All other terms and conditions remaining unchanged,\" but with the limitation that only those terms thereof were continued as were applicable to the new contracts. \"I think\", he says,\nit entirely repugnant to the concept of the new contract which arises to say that it is to be avoided by reason of a misrepresentation the materiality of which can have relation only to the moral risk relative to someone other than the person who has been accepted by the insurer as the person assured. The question of whether an applicant for fire insurance has had other fires is so personal to the individual applicant that its materiality is relevant only to him.\nMr. Justice Macdonald agreed with the Chief Justice and Ford J.\nMr. Steer argued that the respondent was a mere assignee who took nothing because by Statutory Condition I the policies were avoided. If I could agree with his premise, the result predicated would, I think, follow but, bearing in mind the manner in which the companies' local agent was apprised of the respondent's wish, and that the evidence of representatives of the companies makes it abundantly clear that they had no objection to the respondent as an insured, I agree with the view of the members of the Appellate Division that new contracts were entered into between the companies and the respondent. It is admitted she is a purchaser for value, and the results in the commercial world would be serious indeed if, in the ordinary course of business, it were not possible for a purchaser of insured property to enter into a new contract without being bound by all representations that had been made to the insurer by his predecessor in title.\nIn North British and Mercantile Insurance Company v. Tourville[8], relied upon by the appellants, it appears from the printed case filed on the appeal that no question of a new contract could arise as the assignment to Tourville was made after the fire which would give rise to a claim had occurred. Even as to assignments of policies as distinguished from assignments of the proceeds, the latter part of the discussion in Welford and Otter-Barry on the Law Relating to Fire Insurance, 3rd edition, also relied upon by the appellants and quoted by the trial judge, shows (pp. 223-4) that while an assignee merely takes the place of the original assured,\u2014\nThe form of their (the insurers') consent and the circumstances in which it was given may, however, amount to a new contract and therefore place the assignee in a better position than the original assured.\nAn example of a new contract between the original assured and his insurer may be found in the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Mechanic v. General Accident Assurance Co. Ltd.[9].\nIt is argued that in the present case there was no consideration moving from the respondent to the appellants but, as stated by Ford J., that may be found in the retention by the appellants of the unexpired portion of the premiums paid by Elfrim Maxim and the obligations imposed upon the respondent by virtue of the applicable statutory conditions,\u2014such, for instance, as under Statutory Condition No. 11:\u2014\nSalvage\n11. After any loss or damage to insured property, it shall be the duty of the insured, when and as soon as practicable, to secure the insured property from further damage, and to separate as far as reasonably may be the damaged from the undamaged property, and to notify the insurer of the separation.\nIt was then contended that even if there were new contracts, one of the terms on which the companies entered into them was, as expressed in each endorsement of August 16, 1943, \"all other terms and conditions remaining unchanged.\" I agree with Ford J. that that must be taken to refer to such terms as are applicable to the new contracts and that, for the reasons given by him in the extract from his judgment previously quoted, the answers to the questions as to previous fires, by her husband, do not constitute an applicable term.\nAn additional reason for allowing the appeal was given by Chief Justice Harvey, namely, that Statutory Condition I did not avoid the policy even if Efrim Maxim had remained the insured because of the words \"as to the property in respect of which the misrepresentation or omission is made\" and the representations had been made with reference to other property. Like Mr. Justice Ford and Mr. Justice Macdonald I am not prepared to agree with that interpretation but what has been said is sufficient to dispose of the appeal which should be dismissed with costs.\nRAND J.:\u2014This appeal raised a question of importance in the law of fire insurance. The respondent claims under two policies which were originally issued to her husband. During their currency, the property consisting of a mill, was conveyed to her, and the case is before us on the basis that she is the bona fide owner of it. There was no formal assignment executed, but the policies were taken to the local agent with the request that, as the property had been transferred, the insurance be placed in the name of the wife. Thereafter an endorsement was affixed to the policies, in the one case in this form:\nNotice is hereby received and accepted that the property insured under the within policy now stands in the name of Mrs. Millie Maxim and this policy shall in future read and cover in the name of Mrs. Millie Maxim with loss, if any, payable to the assured and not as heretofore written.\nAll other terms and conditions remaining unchanged.\nAnd in the other:\nNotice received and accepted that the title to the within described property now stands in the name of Mrs. Millie Maxim and this policy is held to cover in her name only.\nAll other terms and conditions remaining unchanged.\nThe policies had been issued following the expiration of preceding policies to which they referred, and in the application for which there had been a material misrepresentation. In the reply to the question\nHave you ever had a fire? If so, give particulars and name of company which insured the property destroyed at the time\nthe husband had in each case answered \"No\". The applications were made in May, 1942, but in 1931 and in 1936 he had had two fires on both of which he had recovered insurance. The trial judge, on conflicting evidence, found that the answer was knowingly false. The first statutory condition of the Insurance Act of Alberta deals with misrepresentation in these words:\n1. If any person applying for insurance falsely describes the property to the prejudice of the insurer or misrepresents or fraudulently omits to communicate any circumstance which is material to be made known to the insurer in order to enable it to judge of the risk to be undertaken, the contract shall be void as to the property in respect of which the misrepresentation or omission is made.\nThe answers made come clearly within this condition, and as against the husband there can be no question that they furnish a complete defence to an action.\nThe Appellate Division, reversing the judgment at trial, has found, however, that the effect of the request made by the wife and the endorsements on the policies was to create two new contracts of insurance running direct to the wife as then owner of the property, and that the misrepresentation had no applicatoin to them.\nMr. Steer, in his admirable argument, contended that the transaction was an assignment within the terms of statutory condition 5 (c) which reads as follows:\n5. Unless permission is given by the policy or endorsed thereon, the insurer shall not be liable for loss or damage occurring,\u2014\nChange of Interest\n(c) after the interest of the insured in the subject matter of the insurance is assigned, but this condition is not to apply to an authorized assignment under The Bankruptcy Act or to change of title by succession, by operation of law or by death.\nBecause of the misrepresentation, the policy was in fact void and as an assignee whether his interest is equitable or legal simply steps into the shoes of his assignor, there was effected no contract of indemnity with the wife.\nI think it necessary to have clearly in mind just what is entailed in the so-called \"assignment\" of such a contract. An assignment from the earliest times has related to the transfer of an interest in property, corporeal or incorporeal. In the latter case, it has been used with reference to debts in which there existed in substance only an absolute obligation to pay money: the personality of the creditor was not a material element. Admittedly in such cases there was a transfer of beneficial interest but the only legal creation was an irrevocable power of attorney to the assignee to bring action in the name of the assignor: the legal structure of the chose was not changed. In equity the assignee was looked upon as the owner of it and was entitled to enforce his right there by bringing both the debtor and the assignor before the court. Later the Judicature Act, in the case of an assignment in writing followed by notice in writing to the debtor, substituted the assignee for the assignor as the legal party to the chose and so enabled the assignee to bring action at law in his own name, but subject to all the defences that might then have been raised against the assignor.\nIn the contract of fire insurance we have an entirely different relation. It is now beyond controversy that it is a personal contract of indemnity against loss or damage to the interest of the insured in specified property. It is insurance against certain risks, and among them, what is called the moral risk of the insured. It is limited also to the interest of the insured in the subject matter. To say of such a reciprocal relationship, that the insured could by his own act substitute a new party to the contract, and thereby change the moral risk and the interest in the subject matter insured is to misconceive the nature of the contract. It is perhaps unnecessary to remark that this form of transfer is wholly different from that of a mere right to receive moneys that may become payable: there the contract in its insurance aspects remains untouched.\nThe essential difference between the two is indicated by the fact that ordinary assignment is a matter between assignor and assignee solely; but admittedly, and here by express terms, in such insurance it is a condition that there be assent by the company. And the reason is obvious; after a transfer of interest in the subject matter, the insured cannot recover because he suffers no loss, and the assignee, because he is not insured. The effect of that assent is, in some form, to substitute the assignee as the person insured in relation to his newly created interest in the subject matter. The transaction involves also a reapplication of terms. For instance, the provisions relating to the-\"insured\" necessarily apply to the substituted party. In this case, assuming the policies to have been valid, the husband, as the insured, although barred by his own act of incendiarism, could have recovered on a fire set by his wife; but after assignment could it be seriously questioned that the wife, although barred by her own act, would not be barred by that of her husband? The entire group of relations undergoes a readjustment, and what emerges is a completely new contract.\nNow it is possible that A should agree to indemnify B as trustee for C in respect of the interest of C in the subject matter. As in marine insurance C might be a series of transferees of property and of the right to indemnify: but B remains always the party to the contract, and it is contemplated both that the property may be so transferred and the insurance pass without reference to the insurer. In such case obviously the terms made with B not only should but are intended to be the basis of the indemnity to the successive cestuis que trust. But here there is no such form or contemplation; such a transfer would render the policies inoperative; and by the terms of the consent to the transfer and on the evidence, it is unquestionable that there was a complete substitution of insured party, interest and risk under the policies, which terminated the relation of the husband to them.\nIt was argued that there was in fact no assignment but a wholly original contract with the respondent; but that view appears untenable. The existing contract, including the consideration, the premium, was the basis for the substituted arrangement; and from that as well as the mode in which the transfer was made, I think it impossible to treat the transaction as being other than the ordinary \"assignment\" which follows a change in ownership of the subject matter.\nMr. Steer contended that there was no consideration for such a contract, and that all that was changed was in effect the party to whom the loss might become payable. But apart from the necessary modifications in person and risk mentioned, this view overlooks the fact that, in the circumstances, the wife became the equitable owner of whatever rights or powers under the policies might be available in a renegotiation of insurance. When she presented the policies to the agent, it was on the terms that the obligation to her husband be released and a novation made to herself. This release given by her was sufficient to satisfy any requirement that consideration move from the promisee.\nThe termination of insurance and the refunding of unearned premium are covered by condition 10(1) which is as follows:\n10.(1) The insurance may be terminated,\u2014\n(a) subject to the provisions of condition 9, by the insurer giving to the insured at any time fifteen days' notice of cancellation by registered mail, or five days' notice of cancellation personally delivered, and, if the insurance is on the cash plan, refunding the excess of premium actually paid by the insured beyond the pro rata premium for the expired time;\n(b) if on the cash plan, by the insured giving notice of termination to the insurer, in which case the insurer shall, upon surrender of this policy, refund the excess of premium actually paid by the insured beyond the customary short rate for the expired time.\nNotwithstanding the misrepresentation, at the time of the assignment the assignee and the company in fact assumed the policies to be in force, and that a notice under this condition (b) could be given. The discharge of that apparent right to a refund by the superseding agreement would likewise furnish a sufficient consideration from the wife for the new promise.\nBut although a new contract based on the assumption in fact that the existing policies were in force was entered into with the assignee, the question still remains: what were its terms and conditions? In particular, was it made on the basis of the original application and did the first statutory condition apply so as to constitute the misrepresentation a fundamental defect? The argument is that -that application is the foundation for not only the assignment, but any and every policy of insurance issued thereafter by way of renewal. The consequence of that view would be, as Mr. Steer frankly conceded, that an innocent purchaser could continue the payment of insurance premiums for any number of years, and in the event of fire find himself at the mercy of a misrepresentation by his predecessor in title about which he knew nothing and which might be irrelevant to the actual risk of the new contract. I think the simple procedure of assignment furnishes the answer to that contention. The request for approval of an assignment is in effect an application for a new contract of insurance. The company may require any information considered necessary or desirable before giving consent. It could insist upon an application de novo. But if it does not see fit to do that, apart from the question of estoppel on the fact that, in reliance on the approval, the assignee ordinarily can be said to have abstained from taking out new insurance, the company must be deemed to have been content to deal with the assignee on the footing of his own representations alone.\nThe interpretation of the precise language of the condition leads really to the same result. \"If any person applying for insurance\" must refer to the assignee, because it is insurance of the assignee that is constituted by the new contract. The assignee becomes the insured, and the terms and conditions become applicable to him accordingly. The only real difference between the taking of a new policy and that of following the procedure of assignment is that the contract with the unearned premium runs for the balance of the old term rather than with a new premium for a new term. With such an alternative at hand, it would be intolerable that the company should be able to raise such a misrepresentation against the assignee.\nOn the basis of the foregoing grounds, the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] [1945] 3 W.W.R. 705.\n[2] [1945] 3 W.W.R. 209.\n2 [1945] 3 W.W.R. 209.\n[3] [1945] 3 W.W.R. 705.\n[4] [1921] 2 A.C. 125.\n[5] [1945] 3 W.W.R. 209.\n[6] [1945] 3 W.W.R. 705.\n[7] [1927] S.C.R. 8.\n[8] (1896) 25 Can.

By the terms of his will the husband left the testatrix a legacy of $2,000, plus an annuity of $150 per month, with a general power of appointment by will over the residue of his estate. The husband's will contained also a request that his wife should make a will leaving the entire estate to his sister for her life and after her death to his grand nieces (the respondents McClure). In 1920, the testatrix made a will giving substantial effect to her husband's wishes. She later became dissatisfied with the terms of her husband's will and in 1927 executed a new will, leaving, by the exercise of her power of appointment, the estate of her late husband to her own niece and nephew (the appellants Sutcliffe). In July, 1929, the testatrix was admitted as a voluntary patient into a sanitarium and remained in the institution until her death in 1943. In November, 1929, the testatrix executed a third will leaving her own estate and the estate of her husband to the latter's nieces (McClure); and it is the validity of this last will which is in question. The testatrix was subject to hallucinations and delusions which \"at times\" disturbed her, but \"were never very fixed at any time,\" and, amongst them, that she was hearing voices from the grave (presumably her husband's), that she was smelling either gas or dusting powder in her room and that she was tasting poison in her food. But her general rationality was conceded: she was able to converse rationally, had a good memory and was conversant with her husband's estate, her own assets and the contents of the two first wills. The trial judge refused to grant probate basing his conclusions very largely upon the evidence of a medical expert that the testatrix was not capable of managing her own affairs and did not possess testamentary capacity at the time the will was made. The appellate court, reversing that judgment, held that the testimony of experts should not outweigh the testimony of eye-witnesses who had opportunities for observation and knowledge of the testatrix and that the instrument propounded was the last will of a free and capable testator. Held, affirming the judgment appealed from ([1945] 3 W.W.R. 641), that the evidence showed the testatrix to have been competent to make the impugned will and that it must be regarded as valid.\nDelusions and hallucinations may, or may not, have influenced the will of a testator in disposing of his property: it is a question of fact to be determined by the jury or the court after the contents of the will and all the surrounding circumstances have been considered.\nThe proved hallucinations and delusions in this case did not, upon the evidence, influence or direct the motives and reasons that led the testatrix to the making of her will, when she gave instructions and executed it; and it does not appear that in her mind there was any connection between those delusions and the disposition of her property.\nBanks v. Goodfellow (L.R. 5 Q.B. 549) ref.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia [1] reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Wilson J., and maintaining the Administrator's action to prove in solemn form the will of E. Amelia Brown, deceased.\nJ.W. de B. Farris K.C. for the appellants.\nA. Bruce Robertson for the defendant respondents.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Estey JJ. was delivered by\nESTEY J.:\u2014This appeal arises out of an action to prove in solemn form a will, dated November 28, 1929, of the late Elizabeth Amelia Brown. At the trial it was adjudged she did not possess testamentary capacity at the time she made the will. Upon appeal that judgment was reversed and probate directed. This appeal is from the latter judgment.\nMrs. Brown's husband, John Brown, died June 18, 1919, leaving a will, the material parts of which provided a bequest to his wife of the furniture; the sum of $2,000; a monthly payment of $150 during her life; and a power of appointment over the residue of his estate. It contained requests that his wife take care of his sister, Miss Esther Brown, and that by her will she should leave his\nentire estate to my said sister Esther Jane Brown for her life and after her death to my said grand-nieces Ellen and Eva McClure.\nMrs. Brown and the Royal Trust Company were named executors and trustees of his estate. In 1920 Mrs. Brown made a will giving substantial effect to her husband's wishes. About 1925 Miss Brown contracted arthritis and thereafter until her death in June 1927 she required a good deal of care and attention. Much of that time she was confined to her bed and at times a nurse was employed, but in the main Mrs. Brown looked after and cared for her in a manner that was described as \"excellent\".\nMrs. Brown paid the expenses incurred because of the illness of Miss Brown as well as the funeral expenses. She felt that the Trust Company should have paid the latter item but this it refused to do. On one occasion she asked the company for an additional allowance of $25 at Christmas, and this it also refused. She became \"very indignant about\" the Trust Company. Then with respect to her late husband's will, she thought the payment of $150 per month was not enough and that she should have been left the entire estate. In fact, she described her husband's will as a \"terrible will\". In this frame of mind she decided in 1927 to exercise her right under the power of appointment and leave the estate of her late husband, not as he had expressly requested, but to her own niece Susie Sutcliffe and her nephew George Sutcliffe.\nMr. O'Brian, a barrister of Vancouver, had not only been Mr. Brown's solicitor, but had been a personal friend and after Mr. Brown's death he and Mrs. O'Brian continued to visit Mrs. Brown. Mr. O'Brian had drawn Mrs. Brown's will in 1920 and she now consulted him. As to that interview, he deposed as follows:\nShe came in in September or October of 1927 and got the 1920 will. She told me she had a right to leave Mr. Brown's property to whom she liked and that if she so desired she could leave it to her own grand-nieces the Sutcliffe's. I told her that I considered the directions contained in Mr. Brown's will to be binding on her conscience and that if she didn't carry out the directions contained in his will she was doing something very wrong. She remarked to me that that was her own particular business. She took the will and we didn't leave on the ordinary cordial terms.\nMrs. Brown had made up her mind. She refused the advice of her friend and solicitor and consulted another solicitor, Mr. Burnett. Under her instructions Mr. Burnett prepared a will in which she revoked her will of 1920 and exercised the power of appointment under her husband's will in favour of her niece Susie Sutcliffe and her nephew George Sutcliffe. She also left her own property to these relatives. This will is dated October 4, 1927, and no question is raised as to her competency at that time.\nTwo years later Mrs. Brown sent for Mr. O'Brian and executed a third will dated November 28, 1929, under which she revoked the will of 1927 and left all of her own estate and the estate of her late husband, over which she had power of appointment, to Ellen and Eva McClure, nieces of her late husband. In so leaving the property to his nieces she complied with the request contained in the will of her late husband.\nIt is the validity of this last will dated November 28, 1929, that is the subject matter of this litigation. Mrs. Brown, except for one week in 1929, remained at Hollywood Sanitarium from July 12, 1929, until she died on June 24, 1943.\nThe learned trial judge refused to grant probate basing his conclusions very largely upon the evidence of Dr. McKay that the testatrix was not capable of managing her own affairs and did not possess testamentary capacity. In the Court of Appeal Mr. Justice Bird, who wrote the judgment of the Court, was concerned about the weight that ought to be given Dr. McKay's evidence and concluded that the evidence of the other witnesses who had \"opportunities for observation and knowledge of the testatrix\" was sufficient\nto satisfy the conscience of the Court that the document propounded is the last will of a free and capable testator.\nThen referring particularly to her mental difficulties Mr. Justice Bird concluded:\u2014\nI think that the mental diffieulties so described were \"of a degree or form of unsoundness which neither disturbed the exercise of the faculties necessary for the making of a will nor were capable of influencing the result.\u201d\nThe contention of the appellants may be summarized as follows: That the learned judges in the Court of Appeal\nfailed to appreciate that Mrs. Brown's proved delusions or hallucinations were such as were likely to directly influence her in making a will, particularly the fact that she was hearing voices from the grave (presumably her husband's), coupled with the fact of her distress that she had not in her previous will carried out his requests as to the beneficiaries in her will.\nAssociated with this were other contentions that the learned judges had not given due consideration to the heavy burden of proof that rested upon the party propounding the will of a testatrix who is admittedly of unsound mind in at least some particulars, and that undue weight was given to lay witnesses as compared with expert opinion.\nOn its face it is a rational will and carries out the express wish of her late husband. Where, however, the question of testamentary capacity is an issue,\nis not sufficient that the will upon the face of it should be what might be considered a rational will. We have to go below the surface and consider whether the testator was in such a state of mind that he could rationally take into consideration not merely the amount and nature of his property, but the claims of those who, by personal relationship or otherwise, had claims upon him;\nSmee v. Smee [2].\nMr. O'Brian deposed that on the day he received her instructions and prepared the will:\u2014\nI thought she was very clear mentally and with full capacity to appreciate the nature and extent of her estate.\nand Mr. Watson, who was present with Mr. O'Brian when Mrs. Brown gave her instructions, and who signed the will as a witness:\nIn my opinion she was highly nervous and unstrung but knew what she was about, and was quite competent to make a will.\nShe was conversant with the details of her husband's estate, her own assets and the contents of her wills of 1920 and 1927. That in the latter she had left the property to the Sutcliffes contrary to her husband's request. She also stated that she had deceived her husband in that she had accumulated a sum out of her housekeeping allowance and that she had not used this money to give Miss Brown proper nursing attention. It was not contended that anything said upon that occasion would justify a conclusion that she did not possess testamentary capacity.\nIt is, however, submitted that the statements made upon that occasion must be read in association with the other facts and circumstances disclosed in the evidence, and when so read support the appellants' contentions.\nMr. O'Brian first suspected something irrational. about Mrs. Brown in the spring of 1928. In July 1929 she voluntarily entered Hollywood Sanitarium, a privately owned and operated institution for the treatment of mental and functional nervous diseases. She then gave her a as 64. In February 1930 an application for the appointment of a committee was heard by the Court in British Columbia, and on March 17, 1930, judgment rendered that\nElizabeth Amelia Brown is, by reason of mental infirmity, arising from age or otherwise, incapable of managing her affairs.\nDr. McKay, who had specialized in psychiatry and functional neurological conditions since 1907, and who since 1919 had been managing director and medical superintendent of the Hollywood Sanitarium, stated that when Mrs. Brown entered the sanitarium \"she had certain peculiarities\" and that\nshe used to have an idea that there was gas in her room. It was either gas in her room or she was afraid of powder, that is such as dusting powder, it was either one of those two.\nShe had hallucinations and delusions which \"were never very fixed at any time.\"\nWhen questioned if Mrs. Brown worried, he replied:\nThe only worries I can recall her possessing, was worrying regarding things she had done to her husband. That is the only thing that I can recall. There may have been others, but I do recall that because it came up innumerable times. I mean many times. She used to talk about that she hadn't treated her husband well, and she hadn't lived up to his requests.\nMrs. Brown possessed a good memory and often talked with Dr. McKay\nabout her life in Vancouver here, her life in Montreal, and even prior to coming to Canada,\nbut never mentioned to him anything about a will.\nHe concluded his direct examination with a statement:\nI personally believe that she was competent (to make a will) for this reason *** that she did not possess any delusions or hallucinations or illusions that would govern her one way or the other in constructing a will.\nIn cross-examination he was referred to his affidavit dated January 6, 1930, filed in support of the application for the appointment of a committee to manage her affairs. This affidavit read in part as follows:\nAt the time of her admission she was restless, delusional and hallucinatory, her delusions being of the persecutory character.\nShe possessed hallucinations of taste, believing she could taste poison in her food.\nShe also had hallucinations of smell, claiming that she could smell gas which was being forced into her room with the idea of doing her bodily harm. At times she is very disturbed which is altogether due to these false ideas that she possesses.\nOwing to the delusions and hallucinations that were present, the said Mrs. Elizabeth Amelia Brown is incompetent to look after herself or her affairs.\nThroughout his cross-examination there was much disagreement between counsel and Dr. McKay, and finally the following appears:\nQ. Well, what you said on the 7th of January, 1930, was, in your opinion\u2014you said, owing to delusions, and hallucinations that are present, the said Elizabeth Amelia Brown is incompetent to look after herself or her affairs. That was your truthful opinion at that time?\nA. Probably it was.\nQ. If it was your truthful opinion at that time, then it means that, in your opinion, at that time she was not competent to make a will, does it not?\nA. We would only be starting another argument, so I will admit it.\nThis admission does not purport to embody the considered opinion of Dr. McKay but rather an opinion expressed to avoid another argument. Another argument upon the question whether because she could not manage her own affairs it followed she was not competent to make a will. Just before this admission Dr. McKay stated: \"I don't think *** you have the right to combine those two features\". Such an admission as a matter of testing credibility would have weight, but as evidence in support of an essential factor in a cause of action it is for practical purposes of no value. When read in association with the whole of his evidence it falls far short of establishing that because a person is unable to manage her affairs she is incompetent to make a will. Nor does it in this case provide evidence in support of the contention that her hallucinations and delusions were influencing or directing her thinking as she gave instructions and executed this will.\nDr. McKay referred to hallucinations and delusions of a persecutory character and mentioned only those of taste and smell. He described them as\nof a minor character not fixed on any person or persons\u2014never fixed at any time\u2014\nand\nthere wasn't any category from the standpoint of medical diseases that I think I could conscientiously at all place her in. It is significant that in referring to matters respecting her husband he classifies them as worries on her part. Throughout his evidence these hallucinations and delusions are not associated with her worries.\nApart from Dr. McKay's evidence there are the statements made to Mr. O'Brian and Mr. Watson on November 28, 1929, the day the will was made, and those to Mr. O'Brian and Dr. Gillies on January 23, 1930. Upon these dates she was concerned about changing the beneficiaries in her will that she might comply with the wish of her late husband, and throughout these conversations she made no mention of taste or smell, of poison or of bodily harm.\nMr. O'Brian in October or November of 1927 had told her that the request of her late husband was binding on her conscience. In consequence of the illness of Miss Brown and the funeral expenses, which she paid but thought the Trust Company should at least have paid the funeral expenses, Mrs. Brown had become annoyed at the Trust Company and felt her husband's will should have left everything to her. In that state of mind she had made the will of 1927. Now after a period of two years she viewed the matter differently. \"Her husband's will was a proper one, although at one time she did not think so\". She now felt she should respect the request of her late husband. Her conscience dictated that course. It was always upon her mind; she was concerned about the legality of the will. It was written in the handwriting of Mr. O'Brian, was that sufficient, and then was it properly witnessed?\nShe was sure she would feel much better if she could satisfy her mind that the MeClure children would get the estate.\nIn speaking of her feelings to Mr. O'Brian, Mr. Watson and Dr. Gillies, she used various phrases, but her strongest language appears in her conversation of January 23, 1930:\nShe said she got very depressed at times; had a pain in the top of her head; that the day seemed to be the night sometimes, and the night the day; felt sometimes she was going out of her mind; that voices spoke to her at night, as if from the grave; and she was at times' in great torment. She felt she would never see Mr. Brown or Miss Brown; that she had done wrong; that she hadn't been fair to them; that there was no hope for her in the next world; that if she could only be sure the McClure's would get the whole estate, she might feel better.\nThis is a portion of the conversation when Mr. O'Brian and Dr. Gillies visited Mrs. Brown on January 23, 1930, in order that Dr. Gillies might converse with Mrs. Brown and express his opinion as to her competency to make a will. Dr. Gillies made notes of the conversation but unfortunately upon changing his offices in 1933 these notes were lost. He had, however, a very definite recollection that as he left the sanitarium he was of the opinion that Mrs. Brown was competent to make a will. As to the details of that conversation he said his memory was \"extremely vague\". He did think she mentioned \"she heard voices\" but could not remember her making any mention of poison. He did not recall any hallucinations or delusions. Dr. Gillies therefore heard the foregoing statement as part of her conversation and was of the opinion that she was competent to make a will.\nMrs. Kane was in charge of the office of the sanitarium from July 1931, and apart from a year and a half in 1940 and 1942, she was there as long as Mrs. Brown lived. She saw Mrs. Brown practically every day and found her\nquite an interesting conversationalist. Quite wordy, quite bright. Would gossip and interested in all we were doing.\nShe never heard Mrs. Brown speak of either the Sutcliffes or the McClures, and never heard her mention either gas or poison. Her memory was good and she did speak of her late husband and of her late sister-in-law. Mrs. Brown was very friendly with the staff and often came into the kitchen where the staff was having tea in the afternoons.\nThat Mrs. Brown possessed certain hallucinations and delusions of the type and character described by Dr. McKay must be conceded. The possession of such does not invalidate a will unless they have brought about the will or constituted \"an actual and impelling influence\" in the making thereof: Sivewright v. Sivewright [3]. Dr. McKay describes her concern with respect to her husband's affairs as worries and does not associate the hallucinations and delusions therewith. The other witnesses make no reference to the hallucinations and delusions, and it may be that they looked upon her concern with respect to her husband's affairs in a manner that might be described as worries. Mr. O'Brian said she was \"depressed and under great mental strain\" and \"tormented by her conscience\". Mr. Watson said she seemed to be distressed because she had neglected to bequeath the money and property as iher husband had requested her to, and she now desires to make amends.\nMessrs. O'Brian, Watson and Dr. Gillies, who heard her make the remarks the appellants so much rely upon, were definitely of the opinion that Mrs. Brown was competent to make a will. A perusal of Dr. McKay's evidence as a whole, including his admission, indicates that he believed she was competent to make the will. The credibility of all of these witnesses is admitted. Mr. O'Brian had known Mrs. Brown over a long period of years and had been consulted professionally by her as early as 1920. Dr. McKay had her under his care as a patient since July 1929.\nIt is possible that a person may conduct herself in a very rational manner, even making a rational will, and still be motivated and governed by insane delusions. That is the reason the authorities require that in such a case as this \"we have to go below the surface\" and determine if in fact the will be or be not the result of a \"free and capable testator\".\nIn 1920 Mrs. Brown complied with her husband's request. In 1927, under the stress of circumstances then obtaining, she disregarded his request. In the course of time and changing circumstances she concluded that she had made a mistake and her conscience now dictated that her husband's request should be complied with. In order to do so she made her will of November 1929.\nThe proved hallucinations and delusions are not upon the evidence connected with the motives and reasons that led to the making of this will in question. Dr. McKay did not associate her hallucinations and delusions with her worries. In this regard it is significant that Mrs. Brown did not discuss her will with Dr. McKay and never mentioned the taste of poison or the smell of gas to Mr. O'Brian, Mr. Watson or Dr. Gillies. This is an indication that in her mind they were not related. Her statements of November 28, 1929, and January 23, 1930, already discussed, when read in relation to all the other facts and circumstances, are not more than the extreme or extravagant expressions of one's thoughts and feelings who finds herself in some such position as Mrs. Brown. In my opinion, when the evidence in this case is submitted to the test, so often quoted with approval, set forth in Banks v. Goodfellow [4], and which has been adopted in this Court, particularly in Skinner v. Farquharson [5] and Ouderkirk v. Ouderkirk [6], Mrs. Brown's will must be regarded as valid.\nCounsel for the appellants, in a very forceful and exhaustive presentation of this case, contended that the learned judges of the Court of Appeal\ndid not appreciate that there is a much greater burden of proof when the facts actually show insanity or mental derangement.\nIt is true that some of the early authorities go far to justify such a statement. The decision of Banks v. Goodfellow [7], makes it clear that these earlier authorities go too far. That while the burden of proof always rests upon the party supporting the will, and that the existence of proved hallucinations and delusions often presents a \"difficult and delicate investigation\", it remains a question of fact to be determined as in civil cases by a balance of probabilities. In the determination of this fact the contents of the will and all the surrounding circumstances must be considered by the jury or the Court called upon to arrive at a decision. If satisfied that at the relevant time the testator was not impelled or directed by hallucinations or delusions and was in possession of testamentary capacity, the will is valid. Boughton v. Knight[8]; Smee v. Smee [9]; Halsbury, 2nd Ed., Vol. 2, p. 38. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nHUDSON J.:\u2014I have had an opportunity of reading the judgment of my brother Estey and agree with him that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nTo what is said I wish to add only a few words. On the argument before us the point most pressed by Mr. Farris was that at the time of execution of the will the testatrix was suffering from delusions, and in particular from the delusion that she heard voices as from the dead which reproached her with having departed from her husband's wishes in making a previous will. Admitting that the evidence established that the testatrix did make the statements attributed to her, it does not seem to me that this is sufficient to invalidate a disposition of property which she should have made in the absence of any delusion. What she heard would appear after all to have been the \"voice of conscience\" under the circumstances.\nIn Banks v. Goodfellow [10], the general principle is stated thus:\nIt is essential to the exercise of such a power that a testator shall understand the nature of the act and its effects; shall understand the extent of the property of which he is disposing; shall be able to comprehend and appreciate the claims to which he ought to give effect; and, with a view to the latter object, that no disorder of the mind shall poison his affections, pervert his sense of right, or prevent the exercise of his natural faculties\u2014that no insane delusion shall influence his will in disposing of his property and bring about a disposal of it which, if the mind had been sound, would not have been made.\nThe disposition of property here was entirely in accord with what might have been made by the most sane and well intentioned person.\nRAND J.:\u2014Notwithstanding the able argument of Mr. Farris, I think the evidence shows the testatrix to have been competent to make the impugned will. Her general rationality was conceded, and the case against capacity depends upon showing the presence of insane delusionary hallucinations so related to matters admittedly disturbing her conscience as to have governed her mind in making the dispositions. Those matters were, having saved money from household allowances without disclosure to her husband, having toward the end of his sister's life as a result of the financial pressure which the illness and necessary care of the latter made upon her become resentful of the limited allowance made to her under his will, and having failed in spirit at least to maintain toward the sister in her last days what a sense of duty to him as well as to her later seemed to dictate. That they gave rise to a body of deranged thought or sensations so rooted and substantial as to dominate her mind and pervert her judgment in the distribution of her husband's and her own property, is not, in my opinion, a proper conclusion from the facts disclosed.\nAlthough Dr. McKay, in charge of the Home in which the testatrix lived voluntarily for 14 years, whose ability as a psychiatrist and veracity are unquestioned, knew of her notions of tasting poison in food and of smelling gas forced through keyholes to do her physical injury, and observed delusionary thought of a persecutory character, which \"at times\" disturbed her, he looked upon them as transient and erratic wanderings \"never very fixed at any time\" rather than manifestations of deep-seated irrationalities; they were not directed toward any particular person or persons; nor could he say how long they lasted, but the implication is that they did disappear. He did not know of any worry about the will of 1927 nor of her desire to make a new one. But he rejected the view that these evanescent creations were associated morbidly in the true sense of mental disorder with such matters and that they were such as might influence her in making her will.\nThat was the opinion also of Dr. Gillies who, though he saw her only once, made an examination specifically directed to competency; and although she mentioned \"hearing voices\", nothing in her behaviour or speech betrayed or even indicated delusions or hallucinations in any way related to or connected with the property or the will. That her attention could be. held to that field of her thought, over the whole of which his questions led her, and evoke no indication of delusionary ideas or sense irregularities that are said to have poisoned it and driven her to the change in beneficiaries she made, would seem to justify Dr. Gillies' confident assertion that at the time of that examination she was suffering from no such derangement. Whatever their character, they were dissociated phenomena.\nMr. O'Brian observed the same behaviour under similar questioning in relation to the same matters, full understanding, good memory, no sign of disorder. Dr. McKay's affidavit says that \"at times she was very disturbed\" but there can be no doubt, from the evidence, that at the time of making the will, if that language means \"insanely disturbed\", it was not then descriptive of her condition.\nThe deceased quite evidently had become deeply sensitive to the implications of her religious beliefs, and although under the pressure of straitening circumstances feelings of resentfulness had been aroused, when their cause had been removed and her mind become relaxed and reflective, that sensitiveness fastened upon and no doubt magnified the deviations from the rigid duty that then appeared so plain to her. But throughout this period she seems to have had an adequate awareness of herself, including her remorse. It was not that she heard voices from the grave; they appeared to her to be \"as if .from the grave\", she \"felt sometimes she was going out of her mind\", \"the day sometimes seemed night and the night day\", \"she was at times in great torment\", \"there was no hope for her in the next world\" and that she \"would see neither her husband nor his sister\" there. But here she was recounting objectively these experiences: the subjective had not been victimized by any of them. It was a case of repentance for shortcomings in the closing years of her life.\nMr. Farris stresses the heavy onus on the respondents under the law laid down by Banks v. Goodfellow [11] and in particular the language of Cockburn C.J. at page 572:\nWhere delusions are of such a nature as is calculated to influence the testator in making the particular disposition, as was the case in Waring v. Waring [12] and in Smith v. Tebbitt [13], a jury would not in general be justified in coming to the conclusion that the delusion, still existing, was latent at the time, so as to leave the testator free from any influence arising from it; but in the present case the disposition was quite unconnected with the delusions, and consequently there is no reason to suppose that the omission to call the attention of the jury to this specifically can have affected the verdict.\nHe suggests that what Lord Haldane says in Sivewright v. Sivewright [14]:\nThe question is simply whether he understands what he is about. On the other hand, if his act is the outcome of a delusion so irrational that it is not to be taken as that of one having appreciated what he was doing sufficiently to make his action in the particular case that of a mind sane upon the question, the will cannot stand. But, in that case, if the testator is not generally insane, the will must be shown to have been the outcome of the special delusion. It is not sufficient that the man who disposes of his property should be occasionally the subject of a delusion. The delusion must be shown to have been an actual and impelling influence.\nmust be qualified, but it appears to me to be quite within the principle of the earlier case. Once there is shown the existence of a delusion which is calculated to influence the testator in making the dispositions of a will, then the Court must be convinced that in fact the delusion had no such effect. What then is the test by which we can say that a\n[Page636]\ndelusion is so calculated? Obviously its nature and subject matter, and its relation in the mind of the testator to the matters material to testamentary disposition. Here, assuming that in the two respects mentioned there were real delusionary notions, they cannot be said, by themselves, to be so calculated and it does not appear that in her mind there was any connection between them and such matters. It is conceivable that the worry over what she looked upon as a moral dereliction gave rise to them\u2014and there is a strange absence of evidence that from the making of the will until her death she was in the slightest degree disturbed\u2014but they were not associated with such matters in her complaints, and nothing in her behaviour indicated that they were so associated either consciously or unconsciously in her mind. It was not fear but moral anxiety that actuated her. The principle, therefore, of Banks v. Goodfellow [15], on the facts, is strictly applicable and satisfied and we are remitted to her general capacity about which there is no question.\nI agree with Bird, J. A. in his estimate of the weight to be given the statements in the affidavit upon which the case against capacity rests. The evidence as a whole establishes the freedom of her mind from any effect of abnormal elements at the critical time; and she then directed the distribution requested in her husband's will, which in substance she had done nine years before. We are asked to find that reflection on her moral failure had given rise to insane fears that dominated her rational faculty in testamentary judgment; but whether it is to be taken that the will was made at a time free from disturbance, that it was not one of those \"times\" at which she was \"very disturbed\", or that her intelligence and moral sense rose above and clear of the influence of any such ideas that might have lurked in her mind, I am unable to do that.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia dated 25th June, 1945, allowing an appeal from the judgment of Wilson J. which had dismissed an action brought by the respondents for the purpose of proving in solemn form a will of the deceased, Elizabeth Amelia Brown, dated November 28, 1929.\nThe trial judge arrived at his conclusion largely upon his view of the effect of the evidence of one of the medical witnesses of the respondents, Dr. J. G. McKay. The Court of Appeal, however, even on the basis that Dr. McKay's opinion was in reality that the deceased lacked testamentary capacity, held that the other evidence was sufficient to satisfy the burden cast upon the respondents to satisfy the conscience of the Court that the document propounded was the last will of a free and capable testator.\nUpon the argument before us it was common ground that the testatrix had capacity to understand the nature of the act of making a will and its effect as well as the extent of the property of which she was disposing. The contention of counsel for the appellant was that the lack of testamentary capacity lay in want of sufficient comprehension and appreciation of the claims to which effect ought to have been given and that this was due to the existence of insane delusion. It was not contended that the case was in any sense one of total insanity.\nIn these circumstances counsel are at one that a burden of proof rests upon those propounding the will but they disagree as to the nature of that burden. Mr. Farris also complains that the Court of Appeal gave too much weight to the opinion of the lay witnesses. His contention is that in a case of this sort the evidence of medical experts is of paramount importance and that in any event no one, whether a professional or a lay witness, was justified in the circumstances in concluding that the delusions from which the testatrix suffered \"could not\" affect her testamentary capacity and that therefore the respondents must fail.\nThe leading authority in cases of this sort is of course Banks v. Goodfellow [16]. Mr. Farris lays emphasis on certain passages in the judgments in that case and in Smee v. Smee [17], and submits that a testator suffering from delusion lacks capacity to make a will if the delusion is capable of affecting the making of the will and that in such case no inquiry is to be made or can satisfactorily be made as to whether the will was actually affected by the delusion.\nIn an Ontario case, McIntee v. McIntee [18], the trial judge, Riddell J., held on a consideration of the authorities, including Skinner v. Farquharson [19], and Jenkins v. Morris (3), that\nwhatever may be the law elsewhere, I think I am bound by authority to go into the question\u2014not could the delusions possibly have an influence upon a disposition to be made by the testatrix?\u2014but did the delusions influence or affect the disposition actually made.\nThe learned judge points out that in Skinner v. Farquharson [20],, Taschereau J. said at p. 60\u2014\nIf the deceased's delusions had influenced the disposal of his property the respondent's contention should perhaps prevail. But that is a question of fact.\nHe found internal evidence in the will before the Court that the delusions there in question had not in fact influenced the result. Davies J. in the same case at page 86 refers to Jenkins v. Morris [21] and to the head-note which states\nthe mere existence of a delusion in the mind of a person making a disposition or contract is not sufficient to avoid it even though the delusion is connected with the subject matter of such disposition or contract; it is a question for the jury whether the delusion affected the disposition or contract.\nIn Jenkins v. Morris [22], which was a case of a lease, Hall V. C. at page 680 has this to say on the point\u2014\nIt was in the course of the argument before me said that Banks v. Goodfellow [23] was only applicable where the delusion was wholly unconnected with the subject-matter of the disposition. I do not find the rule of law laid down with this qualification, although no doubt in the course of the judgment, the disposition being wholly unconnected with the delusion, and the delusion not being calculated to influence the particular disposition, were mentioned. It is manifest that where the delusion is connected with the disposition, such connection may in some cases shew beyond question that the testator had not testamentary capacity, whilst in other cases, if not in itself conclusive against testamentary capacity, it might have much weight in determining the point. I have not, however, to determine whether in every case where a delusion exists which is connected with the thing disposed of there can or cannot be testamentary capacity to dispose of that thing. The delusion may be trivial, and whether so or not the conviction of a jury or judge may, unless forbidden by law, be that it did not affect the disposition Reference may also be made to the judgments of the Lords Justices in the Court of Appeal.\nWith respect to the decision in Jenkins v. Morris [24], Viscount Haldane in Sivewright v. Sivewright [25], said at page 65\u2014\nTheir view was that the jury had been rightly directed that the mere existence of a delusion was not sufficient to avoid a deed, even though the delusion was; connected with the subject-matter. It was a question for the jury whether the delusion had influenced the bargain, and the jury had thought otherwise. The delusion was not conclusive against capacity, although the fact of its existence might well be evidence bearing on this question. It is not necessary for us on this occasion to discuss the fashion in which the principle was applied in Jenkins v. Morris [26], ; the importance of the case lies in the way in which it lays down the general principle that the delusion need not be held fatal, even if not. wholly unconnected with the subject-matter.\nThese authorities dispose of the contention above mentioned.\nThe husband of the testatrix had predeceased her in 1919, leaving him surviving his widow and a sister who in turn died in 1927. By the terms of his will the husband, John Brown, appointed his wife and the Royal Trust Company executors and left the testatrix a legacy of $2,000, plus an annuity of $150 per month, with a general power of appointment by will. In default of appointment the estate was to go to the sister for life and after her death to two grand nieces of John Brown, namely, the respondents, Ellen and Eva McClure. The will contained the following clause:\nI earnestly request my wife to make a will leaving the entire estate to my said sister Esther Jane Brown for her life and after her death to my grand nieces Ellen\u2014and Eva McClure.\nIn the year 1920, shortly after the husband's death, the testatrix made a will substantially carrying out the request of her late husband. She later became dissatisfied with the terms of her husband's will and in 1927 executed a new will, leaving her own property and exercising her power of appointment over her husband's estate in favour of her own niece and nephew, the appellants, the Sutcliffes. On July 12, 1929, the testatrix was admitted as a voluntary patient into a sanitarium owned and operated by Doctor McKay, and remained in this institution until her death on the 24th of July, 1943, with the exception of one week in November, 1929. By the will here in question, which was executed on the 29th of November, 1929, the testatrix devised and bequeathed her own estate to the respondents, the McClures, and also exercised in their favour her power of appointment over the estate of her husband.\nThe wills of 1920 and 1929 were both drawn by Mr. C. M. O'Brian, who had also drawn the will of John Brown. He had been a visitor at the home of the testatrix before and after her husband's death and appears to have been on a basis of some friendship with them. The sister-in-law became ill in 1925 and in the following year became confined to her bed. She required close medical attention and considerable nursing care at the hands of the testatrix. During this period the latter told Mr. O'Brian that she considered it most unfair that she personally should have to stand the expense of Miss Brown's illness. She said to him that her husband ought to have left her his whole estate and that the provision he had made for her was quite insufficient. She said she considered the will \"terrible.\"\nWhen Miss Brown died the testatrix, being called upon to pay the funeral expenses, requested the Royal Trust Company, the co-executor with her of her husband's estate, to advance the necessary funds. Their refusal and an earlier refusal to advance her some $25 added fuel to the flames of her dissatisfaction. She had also been required to leave her home in order that it might be leased or sold which did not make her any the less dissatisfied. The result of all this is thus described by Mr. O'Brian:\nWitness\u2014So that the result of it all was that within a month or so after Miss Brown's death in 1927 she expressed herself to me that she didn't like the Royal Trust Company, she didn't want them as executors, and thought her husband's estate was being handled very badly, that is to say, so far as she was concerned herself.\nQ. Did she do anything about it?\nA. She came in in September or October of 1927 and got the 1920 will. She told me she had a right to leave Mr. Brown's property to whom she liked and that if she so desired she could leave it to her own grandnieces the Sutcliffes. I told her that I considered the directions contained in Mr. Brown's will to be binding on her conscience and that if she didn't carry out the directions contained in his will she was doing something very wrong. She remarked to me that that was her own particular business. She took the will and we didn't leave on the ordinary cordial terms. It was following this incident that the will of 1927 came into existence. Notwithstanding the circumstances the testatrix does not appear to have retained any particular dislike of Mr. O'Brian. He and his wife visited her on two or three occasions in the following two years, one of those at least being on the invitation of the testatrix.\nFinally, as the result of a message from the testatrix, Mr. O'Brian, accompanied by a Mr. H. H. Watson, went to the sanitarium on November 28, 1929, taking with him some drafting paper, a copy of the 1920 will and, he thinks, a copy of the 1927 will also. He says that he had a discussion with the testatrix and that she appeared to him to be clear mentally.\nWithout detailing the evidence as to what occurred on this occasion it is sufficient to say that if the evidence of Messrs. O'Brian and Watson be accepted, (and the credibility of none of the witnesses is challenged) the opinion formed by Mr. O'Brian was well grounded. The reason given by her at that time for changing her then existing testamentary disposition was that she was under great mental strain owing to the fact that she, as she said, had deceived her sister-in-law as well as her husband in concealing from them the fact that she had accumulated several thousand dollars from housekeeping allowances given her by her husband and that she had not used these monies as she might have done to give Miss Brown proper nursing attention during her last illness. She went on to say that it was her firm desire to change the will of 1927 and to leave everything, not only her own estate, but the estate of her husband, to the McClures. Mr. O'Brian suggested to her that instead of drawing a new will she should execute a codicil to the will of 1927 but she would not have this. She did not want the Trust Company nor the executors named in the 1927 will to act, but requested Mr. O'Brian to act as her executor. During the course of the conversation the testatrix made several references to the fact that she had been a bad woman, that she had deceived her husband and sister-in-law and that she was tormented by her conscience and did not rest either night or day thinking about it. There was nothing, however, in the interview which indicated in any way to Mr. O'Brian that the testatrix was suffering from delusion. Mr. O'Brian says he had suspected that there was something irrational about the testatrix in the spring or summer of 1928, but he does not give and was not asked any particulars and, as already stated, when he saw her in November, 1929, he thought she was perfectly rational. As to the concern which the testatrix expressed for not having spent the money which she had accumulated in engaging nursing assistance for the sister-in-law, Mr. O'Brian says that at one time during the sister-in-law's illness the testatrix had not engaged a nurse and that he had then thought she should have done so. A nurse was at some time engaged but whether it was before or after that time does not appear.\nIn January, 1930, proceedings were initiated for the appointment of a committee to manage the affairs of the testatrix and on the 6th of that month Doctor McKay made an affidavit which included the following paragraph:\n(4) At the time of her admission she was restless, delusional and hallucinatory her delusions being of the persecutory character. She possessed hallucinations of taste believing she could taste poison in her food. She also had hallucinations of smell claiming that she could smell gas which was being forced into her room with the idea of doing her bodily harm.\nAt times she is very disturbed which is altogether due to these false ideas that she possesses. Owing to the delusions and hallucinations that were present, the said Mrs. Elizabeth Amelia Brown is incompetent to look after herself or her affairs.\nAn order was subsequently made on March 17, 1930, declaring the testatrix\nby reason of mental infirmity arising from age or otherwise, incapable of managing her affairs\nand appointing a committee of her estate, pursuant to the provisions of R.S.B.C. 1924, c. 149.\nWhile this proceeding was pending, and no doubt because of it, Mr. O'Brian visited the testatrix on January 23, 1930, taking with him Doctor Gillies, who testified that in his opinion she was on that occasion competent. He says that there was no indication that the testatrix entertained any delusion and that had such been the case his examination would have revealed it.\nAt this interview the testatrix showed that she was perfectly aware of the three wills she had made and referred to them, as well as to the assets of herself and her husband's estate. She said she now thought her husband's will a proper one, although at one time she had not thought so and she again expressed regret at not having taken better care of Miss Brown and for her concealment of the housekeeping moneys she had accumulated. She thought she might feel better if she was sure the McClure children would take. She was concerned, as she had been on November 28th previous, because Mr. O'Brian had drawn the will by hand, and she felt there might be trouble later and the McClures might be deprived of what she intended them to take. As described by Mr. O'Brian she went on to say that:\n*** she got very depressed at times; had a pain in the top of her head; that the day seemed to be the night sometimes, and the night the day; felt sometimes she was going out of her mind; that voices spoke to her at night as if from the grave; and she was at times in great torment. She felt she would never see Mr. Brown or Miss Brown; that she had done wrong; that she hadn't been fair to them; that there was no hope for her in the next world; that if she could only be sure the McClures would get the whole estate, she might feel better. She complained several times she wasn't well, but she read a little\u2014newspapers and books\u2014found it difficult to keep her mind on the subjects. She made some complaint about there being spots on her.\nMr. Farris stresses this part of the evidence, and apart from the other evidence it would require careful consideration. However, each case has to be considered on the evidence as a whole, and so considered, the evidence satisfies me that at the time of the making of the will here in question, the testatrix had sufficient capacity to meet the requirements of the authorities in a case of this kind. I now come to the evidence of Dr. McKay and the view of the learned trial judge regarding it.\nDr. McKay, the proprietor and medical superintendent of the sanitarium, which is a private hospital, said in chief that according to the testatrix she would be seventy-eight at the time of her death but that in his opinion she was actually between eighty-five and ninety. He describes how she was brought to the sanitarium by some friends and he says she was quite willing to stay there throughout her life. Mr. O'Brian also said that he had been consulted by the testatrix about going to the sanitarium and that he had advised her to go. According to Dr. McKay, when she first entered the sanitarium the testatrix had certain peculiarities, that she was a \"little erratic\" on certain things and had certain ideas but not in any way directed \"towards any person or persons\". To particularize he said that she used to have an idea that there was either gas in her room or dusting powder and that she had hallucinations of taste and smell, but her delusions or hallucinations were never \"very fixed at any time\". In his opinion she was quite competent to make a will in November, 1929, and he gave in chief ample basis for that opinion. He said that the only worries he could recall the testatrix having had were worries regarding things she had done to her husband, that she hadn't treated him well and had not lived up to the request in his will. He stated that in his opinion the testatrix did not possess any delusions or hallucinations or illusions that would govern her one way or the other in making a will.\nIn cross-examination the affidavit already referred to was brought to the attention of the witness. He affirmed its correctness but said, as he had in chief, that as to the delusions they were of a minor character and were not fixed on any person or persons.\nCross-examining counsel proceeded on the view that a person who had been adjudged incapable of looking after his affairs under the provisions of the relevant Lunacy Act of British Columbia was per se incapable of making any testatmentary disposition. On that basis he cross-examined as follows:\nQ. Now doctor, do you remember that on the 6th of January, 1930, you swore that owing to the delusions and hallucinations that were present, the said Mrs. Elizabeth Amelia Brown is incompetent to look after herself or her affairs? A. I only say this, Mr. McAlpine. I do remember the letter. I don't remember the document. I must have put it in there, and signed it, so I stand by it.\nQ. So that on the 6th of January, 1930, she was in your opinion, incompetent to look after herself? A. Well, I signed it and don't go back on my signature.\nQ. So that given the assumption that is so, if she were incompetent to look after herself, or incompetent to look after her affairs, she had not the testamentary capacity to make a will. A. I don't think, Mr. McAlpine, you have the right to combine those two features.\nQ. Please don't tell me what my right is. My right is to ask you questions\u2014\nMr. Robertson: And the witness has the right to answer the questions as he thinks. Mr. McAlpine: The witness had no right to ask that and I say I have the right to ask that question.\nThe Court: I do not see, myself, why you cannot answer it. It is really a simple question. A. Well, I will answer it this way. If I put my name on there, I am liable for it. I mean I must have believed it at that time.\nIt would appear that the witness had answered the question which the learned trial judge appears to have thought had not been answered and that the witness did not agree that the two things were the same. All he appears to say in the above is that if he signed the affidavit he stands by what it says. In the cross-examination which follows counsel, however, proceeded on the basis that his own view that the two things were synonymous had been accepted by the witness.\nMr. McAlpine: Q. Now then, doctor, if you believed it at that time, you were then of the opinion that this woman was incompetent to make a will. Is that correct? A. No. I don't say that, because a will was not mentioned to me or anything of that kind.\nQ. What has that got to do with it. You have sworn an affidavit that, owing to delusions and hallucinations that are present, the said Elizabeth Amelia Brown is incompetent to look after herself or her affairs. A. I say I signed it.\nQ. Doctor, will you please listen. I may be stupid, and if I am in your opinion, please bear with me. I am asking you to answer a very simple question. If that was your opinion, on the 6th of January, 1930, it was your opinion that she had not testamentary capacity to make a will, whether you knew she had made one or had not made one. Is that right? A. I don't feel like answering that. But that must speak for itself, as far as I am concerned.\nThe Court: Doctor, I would like you to answer it. You are here to help me. You see, you said she was incompetent to look after herself or her affairs. Now, I would like you to tell me, if you can, whether or not that incompetency to look after herself or her affairs would not be incompetency to make a will. I think you can tell me that. A. That would be incompetency to look after her affairs.\nQ. In your opinion she was incompetent to look after herself or her affairs. Does that also mean incompetency to make a will? A. I feel now, and I will ask you, at this time, if I may explain. I had a reason for giving that affidavit, which reason, of course, is for your lordship to hear. I felt that owing to my experience with these cases, I do certain things especially in the case of elderly people who have not any relatives to look after them, and I recommend as in this case, that a committee be appointed knowing she has no relatives, and I talked it over with Mr. Robert M. McGougan, who was then living, and I believe he had a committeeship or power of attorney, and I recommended that a committeeship be appointed to look after her affairs, and that is how I came to make that affidavit, because I had done that for the protection of these people for many, many years, knowing the pitfalls that result when such is not done.\nMr. McAlpine: Q. Now, doctor, are you seriously suggesting to his lordship that you committed perjury A. No.\nQ. Now then would you mind telling me\u2014I think you have already said that your memory is not very good as to the condition of this woman when she first came in, for the first three or four months. In the first place, I understand you to agree that it would be your opinion when she was incompetent to look after herself or her affairs, that she was insane, is that right? A. If I signed that, I signed that, and therefore I hold myself responsible for it.\nQ. I don't care what you hold yourself responsible for. What I want to know is\u2014did you commit perjury. A. No.\nQ. Well then, if you did not commit perjury, what you say in this affidavit of the 6th of January is true? A. Well, it must have been true.\nQ. Well, what you said on the 6th of January, 1930, was, in your opinion\u2014you said, owing to delusions, and hallucinations that are present, the said Elizabeth Amelia Brown is incompetent to look after herself or her affairs. That was your truthful opinion at that time? A. Probably it was. Q. If it was your truthful opinion at that time, then it means that, in your opinion, at that time, she was not competent to make a will, does it not? A. We would only be starting another argument, so I will admit it.\nThe Court: I could not see very well, how you could avoid that admission. I take it your affidavit is true, and you say she is incompetent to look after her affairs.\nFor my part I find very little value in the answer thus extracted from the witness. In my opinion the basis of the question was a false basis and this, being pressed forcefully to the witness, who considered himself in an embarrassing position as the result of his affidavit if the basis upon which counsel proceeded was not false, but true, resulted in the answer above quoted. I think it perfectly apparent that the real opinion of the witness was that the testatrix had testamentary capacity in November, 1929, and I also think that is the result on the evidence as a whole.\nI have not referred to all the evidence and I do not think it necessary to do so. Its result I have already stated. With regard to delusion, I take the facts to be as stated in the affidavit of Dr. McKay, that the testatrix did have the hallucination that she could taste poison in her food and that she had also the hallucination that she could smell gas which had been forced into her room by somebody intending to do her harm. Neither with respect to taste or smell, however, did she lay the authorship upon any definite person. In my opinion the testatrix was prompted in making the will of 1929 by a change of view as to her moral obligation and self-reproach with respect to her conduct in handling the housekeeping monies without taking her husband into her confidence. There was no delusion about either. Her frame of mind was based on solid fact so far as these matters were concerned. The argument urged with much force by Mr. Farris is that the \"voices\" the testatrix described in the interview of January, 1930, were in fact the voices of the husband and sister-in-law of the testatrix, that these voices reproached her for her conduct in their lifetime and urged her to give effect to the wish of the husband as expressed in his will and that will of November, 1929, was the result. I do not think that one should make these assumptions and conclude that this amounted to insane delusion which brought about the making of the will but that the will, made at a time when the testatrix showed full command over herself and full realization of all the elements necessary to competent will-making, was the logical product of existing facts which should justly have produced such a will from a perfectly rational testator.\nWith respect to the declaration of the incompetency of the testatrix to look after her affairs in 1930, it is perhaps unnecessary to say that the existence of such an order is not, per se, synonymous with lack of testamentary capacity. The statute under which the order was made, R.S.B.C., 1924, c. 149, provides for management and administration of the estate of persons with regard to whom it is proved (sec. 2 (d) )\nthat such person is through mental infirmity arising from disease or age or otherwise incapable of managing his affairs.\nIn Banks v. Goodfellow[27], Cockburn C.J. refers with approval to a number of American authorities, including Harrison v. Rowan[28], a case in the United States Circuit Court for the District of New Jersey, where the presiding judge said\nhis capacity may be perfect to dispose of his property by will and yet very inadequate to the management of other business, as, for instance, to make contracts for the purchase or sale of property. For most men at different periods of their lives have meditated upon the subject of their disposition of their property by will, and when called upon to have their intentions committed to writing, they find much less difficulty in declaring their intentions than they would in comprehending business in some measure new.\nIn his evidence Mr. O'Brian testified that in his opinion Mrs. Brown had never been capable of looking after her own affairs since her husband's death. Those affairs involved sales of real estate, leases and investment of monies. His evidence indicates that his opinion was founded on nothing more than that the testatrix was not a business woman and not capable of conducting such business matters.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: E.

The Corporation of the County of Middlesex, [1947] S.C.R. 1\nDate: 1946-10-01\nThe Bell Telephone Company of Canada Appellant;\nand\nThe Corporation of The County of Middlesex Respondent.\n1946: June 6; 1946: October 1.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin, Hudson, Taschereau and Rand JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE BOARD OF TRANSPORT COMMISSIONERS FOR CANADA\nStatutory law\u2014Telegraphs and telephones\u2014Wire crossing\u2014Future change of location\u2014Highways located neither in cities or towns\u2014Statutory powers of company\u2014Jurisdiction of Board\u2014Terms, conditions and limitations\u2014Railway Act, R.S.C., 1927, c. 170, s. 878, ss. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.\nThe appellant company, by section 3 of its Incorporation Act, was given the power to \u201cconstruct, erect and maintain its lines along the sides of and across or under any public highway * * *\u201d\u2014Subsection (2) of section 373 of The Railway Act enacts that \u201cno telegraph or telephone line * * * shall * * * be constructed by any company upon, along or across any highway * * * without the legal consent of the municipality having jurisdiction over such highway * * *\u201d and section (3) provides that, if such consent is not granted, the company may apply to the Board.\nThe Board of Transport Commissioners, by Order made in July, 1945, authorized the appellant company to construct its lines of telephone (buried cable) under certain highways in the respondent corporation; and the Board, at the same time, directed that questions relating to terms and conditions be reserved for further consideration. In October, 1945, the Board imposed certain terms and conditions as set out in the Order and, more particularly, directed that, in case of disagreement between the Company and the Municipality, following a request by the latter to change in the future the location of the works, the Board may order the company to make such change, each to pay such part of the costs as the Board may direct. Held, Hudson J. dissenting, that the Board had no power to make the last mentioned order.\nHeld, also, that, upon the proper construction of the language of subsection (2) of section 373, which refers to construction of telegraph or telephone lines \u201cupon, along or across any highway * * *,\u201d the proposed construction of the lines of the Company under the County highways does not fall within that subsection, as the word \u201cacross\u201d does not include \u201cunder\u201d. Hudson and Rand JJ. dissenting.\nPer The Chief Justice and Kerwin and Taschereau JJ.:\u2014\u201cAcross\u201d means over from side to side; and it is made clearer by the context of subsection (2) and by the history of the legislation. Parliament, in enacting that subsection, had in mind only above surface construction and was preoccupied with the right of travel particularly referred to in subsection (a) of section 373. The appellant company, under section 3 of its Incorporation Act, is specifically given the power to construct its lines under the highways in the respondent corporation; and, for such purpose, the appellant does not need the legal consent of the respondent, and not only does it not need the authorization of the Board but the latter has no jurisdiction to give such authorization.\nPer Hudson J. dissenting:\u2014Subsection (2) of section 373 deals with the construction of a telegraph or telephone line \u201cacross any highway\u201d. The word \u201cacross\u201d means \u201cfrom side to side\u201d and, taken by itself, is wide enough to cover a crossing at any level. The \u201chighway\u201d to be crossed includes not merely the surface of the road but what has been called the \u201carea of user\u201d, i.e. \u201call the stratum of soil below the surface * * * required for the purposes of the street as street\u201d.\u2014The appellant company, in placing its line \u201cacross a highway\u201d must \u201cnot interfere with the public right of travel (s. 373, ss. (1) (a)) and any alterations by the company in the sub-surface of a highway might affect the safety and convenience of the public using the surface.\u2014Thus, the Board, having jurisdiction in the matter, had under subsections 4 and 5 power to make the Order appealed from.\nPer Rand J.:\u2014The provisions of sub-section 7 as a whole constitute a code regulating the construction of telephone lines in and on highways; and the statute is clear that, with the exception in sub-section 6 where changes may be ordered in cities and towns, once the installations have been made, they may thereafter be maintained and operated free from the Board\u2019s control.\u2014The Order appealed from has in effect added the provisions of sub-section 6 to new constructions outside cities and towns, while these provisions have by implication the effect of denying the Board power to impose conditions as to future changes of location of newly constructed lines outside cities and towns.\nAPPEAL by the Bell Telephone Company of Canada (by leave of the Board and upon a settled statement of facts) from an Order (No. 66533) of the Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada[1] imposing certain terms, conditions and limitations in respect to works which the appellant Company, by a previous order, had been authorized to construct across and under certain highways within the respondent County Corporation.\nLeave to appeal to this court was given upon the question, which in the opinion of the Board was one of law and of jurisdiction, as to whether the Board had power to make Order No. 66533.\nN. A. Munnoch K.C. and F. A. Burgess for the appellant.\nNo counsel for the respondent.\nThe judgment of The Chief Justice and of Kerwin and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014The parties hereto have agreed upon the following statement of facts:\u2014\n(1) The appellant is a company incorporated by Act of the Parliament of Canada, (1880, 43 Victoria, chapter 67). It carries on and provides a public telephone service within the Dominion of Canada and elsewhere. By section 3 of its Act of Incorporation, it is granted the right to: construct, erect and maintain its line or lines of telephone along the sides of and across or under any public highways, streets, bridges, watercourses or other such places, etc., upon the terms and conditions therein set forth.\n(2) The respondent is a municipal corporation within the province of Ontario, governed by the Municipal Act (R.S.O. 1937, chapter 226). It has municipal jurisdiction over the public county roads, highways and road allowances within its municipal boundaries.\n(3) In the early part of the year 1945, the appellant proposed to construct an underground or buried cable system of long distance telephone lines from the city of London to the city of Windsor in the province of Ontario; and it was necessary for the cables to cross under the surfaces of certain public highways, roads and road allowances that intersected their courses. In the case of the county of Middlesex, it was necessary for the said cables to pass under the surfaces of ten different public highways or roads under the municipal jurisdiction of the respondent.\n(4) The appellant applied to the respondent for the latter\u2019s legal consent to these ten highway crossings.\n(5) On June 14, 1945, the council of the respondent passed and enacted by-law no. 2159, granting the requisite legal consent, but upon the following term and condition:\n\u201cProvided further that the County will assume no further costs in connection with lowering of the Company\u2019s cable which might be made necessary by the County road work or works\u201d.\n(6) This was not acceptable to the appellant; and this feature of the by-law was discussed between the parties by correspondence. (7) The appellant thereupon filed an application to the Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada, dated July 19, 1945, for leave of the Board to construct the aforesaid ten underground cable crossings; and on July 20, 1945, moved the Board ex parte for the requisite order.\n(8) By Order no. 66276, dated the 23rd day of July, 1945, the Board authorized the appellant to construct the aforesaid crossings, at the same time directing that:\n\u201call questions relating to terms and conditions in respect of this application and the works hereby authorized be and they are hereby reserved for further consideration and order of the Board\u201d.\n(9) Following the issue of this Order, the respondent wrote to the Secretary of the Board on July 26, 1945:\u2014\n\u201cI have no objection whatever to the making of the Order and am perfectly willing to leave the terms on a statutory basis.\u201d\n(10) By letter addressed to the Secretary of the Board on August 14, 1945, Mr. Moss, the solicitor for the respondent, stated that, in his opinion, no public hearing was necessary; that the sole question was as to who should bear the cost of any future alteration of the appellant\u2019s lines; and that the respondent had no objection to the appellant exercising its statutory powers as long as it did not exceed such powers.\n(11) In turn, by letter addressed to the Secretary of the Board dated August 21, 1945, the appellant agreed that no public hearing was necessary, but expressed the view that the final paragraph of Order no. 66276 made it an interim Order only, and suggested that it should be made final by the issue of a supplementary Order to the effect that the works authorized be subject to the terms and conditions contained in the appellant\u2019s Act of Incorporation, 43 Victoria (1880) chapter 67, section 3, so far as such terms and conditions were applicable to works of the nature authorized.\n(12) Subsequently, without any hearing of the parties in the present case, but after having heard a similar case, the Board issued a judgment on October 4, 1945, and the Order which gives rise to the present appeal, namely, Order no. 66533, by which the Board ordered that the authority granted to the appellant to construct, erect and maintain the works should be subject to the following term, condition or limitation:\n\u201cIf, from time to time, in order to enable the municipality to construct, reconstruct, alter or repair a highway, waterpipe line, sewer or other work of the municipality, the municipality requests the company to change the location of any of the works authorized by Order no. 66276 and the company does not agree to make such change, or does not agree to make such change otherwise than upon terms and conditions unacceptable to the municipality, the municipality may apply to the Board for an order or orders directing the company to make such change; and if, upon such application or applications, the Board deems it expedient, having due regard to all proper interests, that the location of any of the works in question should be changed, the company shall make such changes in the location of the works in question as the Board may direct; and the municipality and the company shall each pay such part of the cost of changing the location of the works as the Board may direct.\u201d\n(13) On November 30, 1945, the appellant moved the Board for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada under section 52 (3) of the Railway Act, from Orders nos. 66276 and 66533. By Order no. 66893 dated the 14th day of December, 1945, the Board granted the appellant leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada upon the following question, which the said Order declares to be, in the opinion of the Board, a question of law and jurisdiction:\nHad the Board power to make Order no. 66533, dated the 4th day of October, 1945?\nIn its reasons for judgment on questions relating to terms and conditions reserved by paragraph 2 of Order no. 66276, the Board amongst other things states:\nThe letter of Mr. Moss raises a question of considerable importance. Order no. 66276 authorizes the company to construct its lines across and under certain highways in the municipality. What will be the position of the municipality if at some time in the future the municipality wishes the company to make some change in the location of any of the works authorized by Order no. 66276? In the absence of any condition imposed by the Board under subsection 4 of section 373 of the Railway Act, it appears that the municipality would have no remedy. Subsection 6 of section 373 confers power on the Board to order (inter alia) a change in the location of a telephone line, but subsection 6 applies only to lines in a city or town. The Board\u2019s view is that Parliament, in giving the Board power to impose \u201cterms, conditions or limitations\u201d, intended the Board to accommodate the interests of the company and the municipality in a practical common sense way; and the Board deems it \u201cexpedient, having due regard to all proper interests\u201d, that in the present case the following term, condition and limitation be imposed by order.\n(then comes the term and condition already reproduced above).\nAnd the reasons proceed:\nIn some other applications of a similar kind which have come before the Board recently, the company has contended that the Board has no power to make such a provision as is above set out, and this contention merits consideration. Subsection 4 is very wide. But the suggestion is that the provisions of subsection 6 by implication cut down or restrict the meaning of subsection 4 and have the effect of denying the Board the power to impose terms, conditions or limitations as to future changes of location of telephone lines in municipalities other than towns and cities. The Board does not agree that such is the effect of subsection 6. The subsection applies to (inter alia) lines which are already in existence, and applies whether they were constructed under the authority of the Board or not. In view of the broad terms of subsection 4, the Board is unable to see that any inference should be drawn from subsection 6 that the Board, in authorizing the construction of a new line in a rural municipality, has no power to safeguard its interests by such a provision as is above set out.\nThe appeal in this Court was argued ex parte, the respondent taking no part in the argument. Here, the appellant raised a question which does not appear to have been submitted to the Board and of which, at all events, no trace can be found in the correspondence or the Orders of the Board, or the reasons therefore.\nThis new question is to the effect that the Board had no jurisdiction whatever to deal with the application because the latter is in respect of the construction of cables or lines \u201cunder highways\u201d and that in such a case, neither the legal consent of the municipality having jurisdiction over such highways, nor the authorization of the Board of Transport Commissioners is required by the Bell Telephone Company, the appellant, to carry on such work.\nIt must be noted that we are dealing here with county highways, and that is to say with highways located neither in a city nor in a town; and also that the cables or lines of the appellant are to cross the highways in question entirely beneath the surface of the ground; in fact, they are to be buried in the ground itself.\nNow, the Company invokes section 3 of its Incorporation Act authorizing it to construct and maintain its lines of telephone \u201calong the sides of and across or under any public highway\u201d; and provides that\nin cities, towns and incorporated villages, the location of the line or lines and the opening up of the street for the erection of poles or for carrying the wires underground shall be done under the direction and supervision of the engineer or such other officer as the Council may appoint, and in such manner as the Council may direct, and that the surface of the street shall, in all cases, be restored to its former condition by and at the expense of the Company.\nBy section 4 of an amending Special Act (45 Victoria, 1882, chapter 95, section 2), the works of the company authorized by this Act of Incorporation \u201care hereby declared to be for the general advantage of Canada\u201d.\nOf course, the situation in which the appellant finds itself is really of its own making, because its present contention is directly contrary to the position it took when it applied first for the legal consent of the county of Middlesex and afterwards for the authorization of the Board.\nIn effect, the action of the appellant assumed that the legal consent of the respondent was necessary, and implied that the Board had jurisdiction to make the Order applied for. But, of course, jurisdiction can never be conferred by consent; and, if the Board has no jurisdiction as now contended, it does not matter that the appellant first elected to go before it; the absence of jurisdiction of the Board still remains.\nThe Board has no inherent jurisdiction. It has only the powers and authority given to it by the Statute. Its jurisdiction over telegraphs, telephones, power and electricity is governed by sections 367 to 378 inclusive of the Railway Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 170). Of these, sections 367 to 371 deal with telegraphs and telephones on railway for railway purposes, or telephone connections with railway stations, or putting wires across railways or other wires.\nIn the premises, section 373, dealing with the putting of lines or wires across or along highways, is the section to be looked at for the purpose of answering the question submitted to this Court by the Board of Transport Commissioners. Section 374 deals with the price and supply of certain power. Section 375 contains special provisions governing telegraphs and telephones, and subsection 12 thereof states the limitations imposed by Parliament upon the jurisdiction and powers of the Board with regard to telegraph and telephone companies.\nMoreover, we are not concerned here with sections 376, 377 and 378 which have reference to marine electric telegraphs or cables, and to Government use and construction of telegraphs and telephones.\nTurning therefore to section 373, which is the section that has to be construed here, we find that:\nsubject to the provisions of this section, any company empowered by Special Act or other authority of the Parliament of Canada, to construct, operate and maintain telegraph or telephone lines, may, for the purpose of exercising the said powers, enter upon, and, as often as the company thinks proper, break up and open any highway, square, or other public place * * *\nIt is therein provided that the company shall not interfere with the public right of travel, or in any way obstruct the entrance to any door or gateway or free access to any building. Then follow certain provisions some of which specifically apply only in cities, towns and incorporated or police villages; others deal with poles, trees, supervision, restoration, the times when it is necessary to cut wires or remove poles, and there is a provision that the telegraph or telephone company\nshall be responsible for all unnecessary damages which it causes in carrying out, maintaining or operating any of its said works.\nThen comes a series of subsections and it is necessary to reproduce in full subsections 2, 3 and 4, because, if the Board of Transport Commissioners has jurisdiction in the matter, it is there that such jurisdiction must be found.\nSubsection (2).\nNotwithstanding anything in any Act of the Parliament of Canada or of the legislature of any province, or any power or authority heretofore or hereafter conferred thereby or derived therefrom, no telegraph or telephone line, within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, shall except as hereinafter in this section provided, be constructed by any company upon, along or across any highway, square or other public place, without the legal consent of the municipality having jurisdiction over such highway, square or public place.\nSubsection (3).\nIf any company cannot, in respect of any such line, obtain such consent from such municipality, or cannot obtain such consent otherwise than subject to terms and conditions not acceptable to the company, such company may apply to the Board for leave to exercise such powers and upon such application shall submit to the Board a plan of such highway, square or other public place showing the proposed location of such lines, wires and poles.\nSubsection (4).\nThe Board may refuse or may grant such application in whole or in part, and may change or fix the route of such lines, wires or poles, and may by order impose any terms, conditions, or limitations, in respect of the application which it deems expedient, having due regard to all proper interests.\nAs will be seen, subsection (2) requires the legal consent of the municipality having jurisdiction over the highways, only when the telegraph or telephone line is to be constructed \u201cupon, along or across any highway\u201d. No mention is made of a line to be constructed \u201cunder the highway\u201d.\nAnd what is to be observed is that\nif any company cannot, in respect of any such line obtain such consent from such municipality, or cannot obtain such consent otherwise than subject to terms and conditions not acceptable to the company, such company may apply to the Board for leave to exercise such powers. Then, the Board may refuse or grant such application in whole or in part, and may\nby order impose any terms, conditions or limitations in respect of the application which it deems expedient, having due regard to all proper interests.\nThe repetition of the word \u201csuch\u201d throughout subsections (3) and (4) makes it clear that both the consent from the municipality is required, and the jurisdiction of the Board exists only if the work is to be constructed \u201cupon, along or across any highway\u201d, for such is the work for which, under subsections (3) and (4) the application may be made to the Board, if the company cannot \u201cobtain such consent from such municipality\u201d. And it is only upon such application\nthat the Board is empowered to act in either refusing or granting same, and at the same time impose terms and conditions or limitations.\nThe answer to the question submitted to the Court must, therefore, depend upon the construction of the language of subsection (2) of section 373.\nThe lines to be constructed by the company and with which we are concerned are not to be upon or along the highways, and if the present construction of the lines falls at all within subsection (2), it is only if the word \u201cacross\u201d includes \u201cunder\u201d. Otherwise, a construction \u201cunder\u201d is not covered by subsection (2) and, therefore, no legal consent of the municipality is required, nor has the Board jurisdiction to deal with it. My view is that the word \u201cacross\u201d does not include \u201cunder\u201d. \u201cAcross\u201d means over from side to side. It is made clearer by the context of subsection (2) and by the history of the legislation. It is evident that in subsection (2) Parliament had in mind only above surface construction. It was preoccupied with the right of travel particularly referred to in subsection (a) in the first part of section 373.\nMoreover, it must be noted that in the Special Act of the Bell Telephone Company of Canada (43 Victoria, 1880, chapter 67, section 3) the company is empowered to\nconstruct, erect and maintain its lines, along the sides of and across or under any public highways (and) across or under any navigable waters.\nIt is a well known rule of construction that Parliament is not supposed to speak for nothing and that all the words it uses in its legislation must be given their application. The fact that the same Act contains both the words \u201cacross\u201d and \u201cunder\u201d shows that in using those words Parliament intended by the word \u201cunder\u201d something more than and different from \u201cacross\u201d.\nA comparison, in that respect, between the Railway Act (1906) and the Railway Act (1919) is also illuminating and instructive.\nIn the Act of 1906, the matters dealt with in sections 247 and 248 correspond to section 373 in the Act of 1919.\nThe 1906 Act provided (subsection 2 of section 248) that the telephone company\nshall not, except as in the section provided, construct, maintain or operate its lines of telephone upon, along, across or under any highway * *. * within the limits of any city, town or village, incorporated or otherwise, without the consent of the municipality;\nand, if such consent of the municipality was not forthcoming, the telephone company could then apply to the Board for leave to exercise its powers upon the highways. The Board could then grant such application and, at the same time, by Order, \u201cimpose any terms, conditions or limitations in respect thereof\u201d.\nSome exceptions were provided for in subsections 4 and 5 of section 248 with regard to long distance line or service or any trunk line or service connecting two or more exchanges in any city, town or village.\nIn section 373 of the Railway Act of 1919, we find several significant changes or modifications.\nFirst, section 373 (2) does not contain the word \u201cunder\u201d any highways. That word has been deleted and the section then reads \u201cupon, along or across any highway\u201d, leaving out the word \u201cunder\u201d which appeared in subsection (2) of section 248 of the 1906 Act.\nOn the other hand, while the same section of the 1906 Act provides for the necessity of the consent of the municipality only for highways \u201cwithin the limits of any city, town or village\u201d, now, in section 373 (2) the necessity of the consent of the municipality is no longer limited to a city, town or village, but it is required in the case of all municipalities having jurisdiction over such highways. Some object must be ascribed to the fact that Parliament, when enacting the Railway Act of 1919, left out the word \u201cunder\u201d. That object might be that while heretofore between 1906 and 1919, a telephone company had to obtain the legal consent of a city, town or police village even to construct \u201cunder\u201d the highways over which such municipality had jurisdiction, after the adoption of the Act of 1919, consent was necessary from all municipalities to construct upon, along or across any highways; but the consent was no longer required from any municipality to construct \u201cunder\u201d.\nThe above view is in accordance with the definition given in Standard dictionaries: Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary; the New English Dictionary (Oxford); The Imperial Encyclopedic Dictionary; Century Dictionary & Cyclopedia; Funk & Wagnall\u2019s New Standard Dictionary; Ordways Dictionary of Synonyms and Antonyms (published by Harrap & Co., London). From all of these, whether we refer to the words \u201cupon\u201d, \u201calong\u201d or \u201cacross\u201d, it appears that these words as used in section 373 (2) can not apply to the lines in question, because such lines are constructed beneath the surface of the highways and, as so constructed, merely cross under said highways from one side to the other, while the word \u201cacross\u201d used alone, means from side to side of and over or above.\nIn the South Eastern Railway Company v. the European and American Electric Printing Telegraph Company and Frend1, it was held that the word \u201cacross\u201d does not include \u201cunder\u201d.\nMany examples of cases where above-ground construction only is intended can be found in the Railway Act:\nSections: 162 (d) 173\n\u201d 162 (e)\n\u201d 193; 295 (1)\n\u201d 246; 247\n\u201d 255; 256; 257\n\u201d 373 (2); 403\n\u201d 256; 257 (2)\n\u201d 372 (a)\n\u201d 281 (3) But where, in the Railway Act, Parliament intended that underground construction be authorized or included, it expressly said so by the use of the word \u201cunder\u201d.\nSections: 162 (k)\n\u201d 162 (l)\n\u201d 162 (m)\n\u201d 245\n\u201d 246\n\u201d 258\n\u201d 250\n\u201d 251\n\u201d 252 (3) (c), 256 (5), 264, 266\n\u201d 256 (5), 257\n\u201d 264, 401 (a)\n\u201d 268\n\u201d 269 (a), (6), (c), 270 (2), (4)\n\u201d 269 (3)\n\u201d 271\nSection (3) of the appellant\u2019s Special Act draws a clear distinction between overhead and underground lines. Under it, the appellant is specifically given the power to construct, erect and maintain its lines along the sides of and across or under any public highways, and there is no doubt about the right of the company to construct its lines under the ten highways in question in the county of Middlesex; but, in my view, there is also no doubt that, for such purpose, the appellant does not need the legal consent of the respondent, and not only does it not need the authorization of the Board of Transport Commissioners, but the Board has no jurisdiction to give such authorization.\nIn Toronto, Corporation of the City of, v. Bell Telephone Company of Canada[2], the Judicial Committee dealt with, among other things, the argument that the Company by reason of its application to the Ontario legislature was precluded or estopped from disputing the competency of that legislature and that the enactment making the consent of the Corporation a condition precedent amounted to a legislative bargain between the Company and the Corporation, and at page 59 appears the following:\nNo trace is to be found of any such bargain and * * * nothing has occurred to prevent the Company from insisting on the powers which the Dominion Act purports to confer upon it. Similarly here the application by the Company for the consent of the County and its subsequent application to the Board do not prevent the Company from relying upon the powers conferred upon it by its special Act.\nI need only add that we should not refer to subsection (6) or subsection (7) of section 373 because they do not apply here. Subsection (6) comes into play only \u201cupon the application of the municipality\u201d and is restricted to a \u201ccity or town\u201d. Subsection (7) applies only to telephone lines \u201cheretofore constructed\u201d. As for subsection (8) of section 373, it deals solely with cases where the Special Acts applying to the telephone companies specifically require the consent of the municipality, which is not the case for the Bell Telephone Co. of Canada. Toronto, Corporation of the city of v. The Bell Telephone Co. of Canada[3].\nFor these reasons, I would answer in the negative the question submitted.\nHudson J.:\u2014This is an appeal by leave from the Board of Transport Commissioners. The terms of this order and the circumstances under which it was made are fully set forth in the judgment of my Lord the Chief Justice. The appeal was heard ex-parte but the Court had the benefit of a very fair and exhaustive argument by counsel for the appellant.\nThe grounds of appeal are first: that the Board had no jurisdiction to make any order in the matter, and secondly: that even if it had such power it had no power to impose the conditions which were included therein.\nThe jurisdiction of the Board in the matter is set forth in section 373 of the Railway Act, R.S.C. 1927, chap. 107. By this section it is provided:\n373. Subject to the provisions of this section, any company empowered by Special Act or other authority of the Parliament of Canada to construct, operate and maintain telegraph or telephone lines, may, for the purpose of exercising the said powers, enter upon, and, as often as the company thinks proper, break up and open any highway, square or other public place, provided always that\n(a) such company shall not interfere with the public right of travel, or in any way obstruct the entrance to any door or gateway or free access to any building: (e) the opening of any street, square, or other public place for the erection of poles, or for the carrying of wires under ground, shall be subject to the supervision of such persons as the municipal council may appoint, and such street, square or other public place shall, without any unnecessary delay, be restored, as far as possible, to its former condition;\n* * *\n2. Notwithstanding anything in any Act of the Parliament of Canada or of the legislature of any province, or any power or authority heretofore or hereafter conferred thereby or derived therefrom, no telegraph or telephone line, within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, shall except as hereinafter in this section provided, be constructed by any company upon, along or across any highway, square, or other public place, without the legal consent of the municipality having jurisdiction over such highway, square or public place.\n3. If any company cannot, in respect of any such line obtain such consent from such municipality, or cannot obtain such consent otherwise than subject to terms and conditions not acceptable to the company, such company may apply to the Board for leave to exercise such powers, and upon such application shall submit to the Board a plan of such highway, square or other public place showing the proposed location of such lines, wires and poles.\n4. The Board may refuse or may grant such application in whole or in part, and may change or fix the route of such lines, wires or poles, and may by order impose any terms, conditions or limitations in respect of the application which it deems expedient, having due regard to all proper interests.\n5. Upon such order being made, and subject to any terms imposed by the Board, such company may exercise such powers in accordance with such order, and shall in the performance and execution thereof, or in the repairing, renewing or maintaining of such lines, wires or poles conform to and be subject to the provisions of subsection one of this section, except in so far as the said provisions are expressly varied by order of the Board.\nThere are also two additional subsections, 6 and 7, which will be hereafter referred to.\nThe appellant company was incorporated by a statute of Canada, 43 Vict. Chap. 67, and by section 3 thereof was granted the right to\nconstruct, erect and maintain its line or lines of telephone along the sides of and across or under any public highways, streets, bridges, watercourses or other such places, or across or under any navigable waters, either wholly in Canada or dividing Canada from any other country.\nThe argument on the first point is that by this Special Act the Company was given power to construct lines \u201cunder\u201d any public highway, and this without consent of the municipality; that by subsection 2 of section 373 the Board was not given power to act where the Company proposed to place its lines under a highway, that is, that the words in subsection 2 \u201cupon, along or across any highway\u201d were not sufficiently broad to cover a case as here where the Company had authority to lay wires or cables underneath the ground.\nIt must be kept in mind that what we are called on to construe here is the provision in the Railway Act, and not the Special Act. The significant words are \u201cacross\u201d and \u201chighway\u201d.\nThe word \u201cacross\u201d, as most commonly used, means \u201cfrom side to side\u201d. It is clear that under paragraph (a) of section 1, in placing its line across a highway the telephone company must not interfere with the public right of travel. The word taken by itself is wide enough to cover a crossing at any level. Obviously, in this instance Parliament did not contemplate a permanent crossing at the surface level. Such a crossing would in all reasonable probability constitute an interference with the use of the highway in the first place, and in the second place it would not be of any value to the telephone company. The crossing contemplated must be either above or below the surface. The \u201chighway\u201d to be crossed includes not merely the surface of the road but what has been called the \u201carea of user\u201d, that is:\nall the stratum of air above the surface, and all the stratum of soil below the surface which in any reasonable sense can be required for the purposes of the street as street.\nThis quotation is from a judgment of Collins, M. R. in the case of Finchley Electric Light Company v. Finchley Urban District Council[4]. Under various statutes in England dealing with main roads, etc. all streets being highways reparable by the inhabitants at large were vested in and under the control of urban authority. Collins, M. R. was dealing with a case arising under one of these statutes, and other cases of the same kind are Mayor etc. of Tunbridge Wells v. Baird4, Lord Halsbury at p. 437 and Lord Herschell p. 442; Wandsworth Board of Works v. United Telephone Co.[5], Lord Bowen.\nIn Ontario the freehold in the soil of the highways is vested in the municipal bodies under section 454 of the Municipal Act, R. S. O. 1937, chap. 266. Even before this provision was enacted the municipalities were vested with powers similar to the Boards referred to in England and their duty was and still is to provide for the maintenance of highways and the safety and convenience of the public who desire to use them. In order to do this, the highways must be of such a character as to bear the traffic which would normally flow thereon. Any alterations in the sub-surface of that portion of the highway being used for traffic might affect the safety and convenience of the public using the surface. Any interference with what is called the \u201carea of user\u201d would be a trespass on the highway. For these reasons, it would appear that the word \u201cacross\u201d here must mean at least any such crossing as lies within the area of user. It would seem inconceivable that Parliament had anything else in mind.\nThe extent of the area of user might of course vary depending on the facts in each particular case, but here the application to the Board was made by the telephone company itself, and this might be taken as an acknowledgment that the crossing they had in mind was probably within this area. In any event, it is a matter for consideration of the facts by the Board in order to protect the interests of the public and it might well be in the interest of the telephone company itself.\nMany authorities were cited in regard to the meaning of the word \u201cacross\u201d in other statutes of Canada and elsewhere. With respect, it does not seem to me that in this case they are sufficient to justify any departure from the cardinal rule of construction, namely:\nThe object of all interpretation of a statute is to determine what intention is conveyed, either expressly or impliedly, by the language used, so far as is necessary for determining whether the particular case or state of facts presented to the interpreter falls within it.\nSee Maxwell on Statutes, p. 1.\nFor these reasons, I am of opinion that the Board had jurisdiction.\nThe second point made is that the condition imposed in the order as follows:\nIf, from time to time, in order to enable the municipality to construct, reconstruct, alter or repair a highway, waterpipe line, sewer or other work of the municipality, the municipality requests the company to change the location of any of the works authorized by Order no. 66276, and the company does not agree to make such change, or does not agree to make such change otherwise than upon terms or conditions unacceptable to the municipality, the municipality may apply to the Board for an order or orders directing the company to make such change; and if upon such application or applications the Board deems it expedient, having due regard to all proper interests, that the location of any of the works in question should be changed, the company shall make such changes in the location of the works in question as the Board may direct; and the municipality and the company shall each pay such part of the cost of changing the location of the works as the Board may direct.\ncannot be exercised because of the provisions of subsections 6 and 7. Subsection 6 provides:\n6. Notwithstanding any power or authority heretofore or hereafter conferred upon any company by or under any Act of the Parliament of Canada, or of the legislature of any province, or any other authority, the Board, upon the application of the municipality, and upon such terms and conditions as the Board may prescribe, may order any telegraph or telephone line, within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, in any city or town, or any portion thereof, to be placed underground, and may in any case order any extension or change in the location of any such line in any city or town, or any portion thereof, and the construction of any new line, and may abrogate the right of any such company to construct or maintain, or to operate, or continue, any such line, or any pole or other works belonging thereto, except as directed by the Board; and where such a line or lines within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada and such a line or lines within the legislative authority of a province, run through or into the same city or town, and such municipality is desirous of having any such lines placed underground, and there exists in such province a provincial commission, public utilities or other board or body having power to order such a line within the legislative authority of such province to be placed underground, the Board and such provincial commission, or public utilities board or body, may by joint session of conference, or by joint board, order any such lines within such city or town, or any portion thereof, to be placed underground, and abrogate any right to carry the same on poles, and the provisions of subsection three of section two hundred and fifty-three of this Act, with the necessary adaptation, shall apply to every such case.\nSubsection 6 applies only to cities and towns and only to cases where the municipality is the applicant and seeks to compel the telephone company to lay its lines beneath the surface. This is an altogether different case from the present where the application is made by the company itself to the Board under subsection 2, to authorize the underground crossing without the consent of the municipality.\nSubsection 7 applies only to lines \u201cheretofore constructed\u201d, that is, prior to the passing of this particular provision and many years before the present application. The particular condition attacked did not appear in the original order permitting the laying of the underground lines, but such original order contained an express reservation to the effect that the Board might make any amendments which it thought necessary in the future. This, I think, is quite in accord with the final phrase of subsection 5 above quoted:\nexcept in so far as the said provisions are expressly varied by order of the Board,\nwhich clearly gives the Board the power to make or amend the previous order.\nThe application on which the Board acted was made by the telephone company itself and it requested action by the Board under section 373, subsection 3, as well as other relevant sections of the Act.\nUnder the provisions of subsection 4, there is no limitation on the conditions which the Board may impose when granting an order. The Board may well find on the facts that the conditions with which it has to deal, when considering the order, are in the case of particular municipalities substantially the same as conditions which exist in cities and towns. If so, there would appear to be no reason why they should not be permitted to exercise the same powers.\nI think that the legal advisers of the company were right in their first thought and that the Board had jurisdiction and, once this is admitted, the Board had under subsections 4 and 5 jurisdiction to make the order.\nFor these reasons, I am of opinion that the answer to the question submitted by the Board in this appeal should be in the affirmative, namely, that the Board had power to make Order no. 66533. There should be no costs.\nRand J.:\u2014The Bell Telephone Company, being unable to obtain from the Corporation an unqualified consent to carry a telephone line across certain highways by underground construction, applied for leave to do so to the Board of Transport Commissioners under the provisions of subsections 2 and 3 of section 373 of The Railway Act which are in these words:\n2. Notwithstanding anything in any Act of the Parliament of Canada or of the legislature of any province, or any power or authority heretofore or hereafter conferred thereby or derived therefrom, no telegraph or telephone line, within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, shall except as hereinafter in this section provided, be constructed by any company upon, along or across any highway, square or other public place, without the legal consent of the municipality having jurisdiction over such highway, square or public place.\n3. If any company cannot, in respect of any such line, obtain such consent from such municipality, or cannot obtain such consent otherwise than subject to terms and conditions not acceptable to the company, such Company may apply to the Board for leave to exercise such powers, and upon such application shall submit to the Board a plan of such highway, square or other public place showing the proposed location of such lines, wires and poles.\nThe powers of the Board on such an application are set forth in subsection 4 of the same section:\n4. The Board may refuse or may grant such application in whole or in part, and may change or fix the route of such lines, wires or poles, and may by order impose any terms, conditions or limitations in respect of the application which it deems expedient, having due regard to all proper interests.\nThe Board granted leave, but subject to this condition:\nIf, from time to time in order to enable the municipality to construct, reconstruct, alter or repair a highway, waterpipe line, sewer or other work of the municipality, the municipality request the company to change the location of any of the works authorized by Order no. 66276 and the company does not agree to make such change, or does not agree to make such change otherwise than upon terms and conditions unacceptable to the municipality, the municipality may apply to the Board for an order or orders directing the company to make such change; and if, upon such application or applications, the Board deems it expedient, having due regard to all proper interests, that the location of any of the works in question should be changed, the company shall make such changes in the location of the works in question as the Board may direct; and the municipality and the company shall each pay such part of the cost of changing the location of the works as the Board may direct.\nAgainst the inclusion in the leave of that condition the Company appeals. Mr. Munnock, in an able argument, places his case on three grounds: that, as the works are underground, they are not within subsection 2 as being constructed \u201cacross\u201d a highway; that the Board, under subsection 4, may impose conditions relating only to construction and not as to maintenance as here; and that the condition in question is in conflict with the implication of subsections 6 and 7 of the same section.\nThe purpose of Parliament in enacting section 373 was to place within the discretion of an important administrative body the adjustment of conflicts between the exercise of various public rights and services in highways. As these become more complex, the need becomes greater that their accommodation be made with efficiency and fairness, having regard to all interests involved. The object sought is a flexibility in functioning and an incidence of work and cost which, in the judgment of an experienced tribunal, best accord with the harmonious working of the services and uses as a whole.\nThe interpretation of such legislation as The Railway Act must have regard to those administrative purposes; and ever since the enactment of that statute the Judicial Committee has consistently adopted constructions of its provisions that have ensured a wide discretion to the Board. I must then approach the language vesting these powers in the Board so as to give it that plain and practical meaning which the nature of the subject matter and the character of the Board\u2019s function unite in requiring.\nIn that interpretive attitude, I reject the first ground raised against the order: but as I have come to the conclusion that the last is well founded, I do not deal with the former in detail. Nor do I find it necessary to examine the second beyond observing that in one aspect it is involved with the third.\nSubsections 6 and 7 are as follows:\n6. Notwithstanding any power or authority heretofore or hereafter conferred upon any company by or under any Act of the Parliament of Canada, or of the legislature of any province, or any other authority, the Board, upon the applicaion of the municipality, and upon such terms and conditions as the Board may prescribe, may order any telegraph or telephone line, within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada, in any city or town, or any portion thereof, to be placed underground, and may in any case order any extension or change in the location of any such line in any city or town, or any portion thereof, and the construction of any new line, and may abrogate the right of any such company to construct or maintain, or to operate, or continue, any such line, or any pole or other works belonging hereto, except as directed by the Board; and where such a line or lines within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada and such a line or lines within the legislative authority of a province, run through or into the same city or town, and such municipality is desirous of having any such lines placed underground, and there exists in such province a provincial commission, public utilities or other board or body having power to order such a line within the legislative authority of such province to be placed underground, the Board and such provincial commission, or public utilities board or body, may by joint session or conference, or by joint board, order any such lines within such city or town, or any portion thereof, to be placed underground, and abrogate any right to carry the same on poles, and the provisions of subsection three of section two hundred and fifty-three of this Act, with the necessary adaptation, shall apply to every such case.\n7. Except as provided in the last preceding subsection, nothing in this section shall affect the right of any telegraph or telephone company to operate, maintain, renew or reconstruct underground or overhead systems or lines, heretofore constructed.\nThe section as a whole furnishes a code regulating the construction of telephone lines in and on highways and other public places; and the statute is clear that, except in one respect and except when the Company is exercising powers granted under subsection 1, once the installations have been made, whether that has taken place before the Board\u2019s jurisdiction was created, or thereafter with the consent of the Municipality or with an order under subsection 3, they may thereafter be maintained and operated free from the Board\u2019s control. The exception is in subsection 6 where changes may be ordered in cities and towns.\nNow what the order challenged does is in effect to add the provisions of subsection 6 to new constructions outside of cities and towns. The implication of that subsection is perfectly clear that outside of cities and towns no such changes can be ordered. Can that implication be nullified by the condition of an order under subsection 3? I do not think so. Parliament no doubt had in mind the necessities of public services in the streets of cities and towns, as contrasted with country highways, as they become more numerous and congested and in subsection 6 it has dealt inclusively with the alterations of constructed works; if, under subsection 4 such a general condition could be annexed to an order, there would have been no need of limiting the power to order changes to cities and towns, certainly for subsequent construction. Under that condition, such works could exist side by side with others, belonging to the same or any other company, free from any administrative control whatever. That anomaly has been avoided in subsection 6 by placing all lines, whenever constructed, under the authority of the Board. Whether such a condition, specifically related to existing works, could in any circumstances be justified, I do not enquire; its generality here in effect removes the limitation to cities and towns in subsection 6 in relation to new construction and cannot be held to be within the scope of subsection 4.\nThe appeal should be allowed and Order no. 66533 set aside. The original Order no. 66276, including section 2, remains in force. There should be no costs.\nQuestion answered in the negative.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Munnoch & Venne.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W. D. J.

The King, [1947] S.C.R. 103\nDate: 1946-12-20\nDavid Tass Appellant;\nand\nHis Majesty the King Respondent.\n1946: November 26, 27; 1946: December 20.\nPresent: Kerwin, Taschereau, Rand, Kellock and Estey J.J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA\nCriminal law\u2014Evidence\u2014Admissibility of\u2014Admissions made by accused as witness on preliminary hearing of charge against another\u2014No objection made to questions as incriminating\u2014No claim for protection under section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act\u2014Right of Crown to use admissions on trial of accused\u2014Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 69.\nThe appellant was convicted on charges of having used a noxious fluid and instruments to procure an abortion. The facts of the case are the following: One Ford was charged with manslaughter in connection with the death of the woman in question. The appellant appeared as a witness for the Crown at the preliminary inquiry. In the course of his evidence, given without raising any objection nor claim for protection under section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act, the appellant made certain admissions which the Crown later put in evidence against him at his own trial. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal on the ground of improper admission in evidence of these admissions; but the conviction was affirmed by a majority of that Count.\nHeld: That the deposition of the appellant was properly admitted and the appeal should be dismissed\u2014If a person testifying does not claim the protection provided for by section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act, the evidence so given may be used against him at his own subsequent trial.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1946] 2 W.W.R. 97) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], affirming a conviction, on a trial before Donovan J. and a jury, on charges of offences relating to procuring an abortion.\nHarry Walsh for the appellant.\nC. W. Tupper for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014The accused, Dr. David Tass, appeals from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba dismissing his appeal from a conviction on charges that he did on or about October 22, 1944, unlawfully administer to Agn\u00e8s Lad\u00e9route, a woman, with intent to procure a miscarriage of the said Agn\u00e8s Lad\u00e9route, a noxious thing, to wit, a mixture of water, soap and lysol, and that he, on the same day, unlawfully used instruments on Agn\u00e8s Lad\u00e9route, a woman, with intent to procure a miscarriage of the said Agn\u00e8s Lad\u00e9route. The appeal is based upon two grounds of dissent in law of Mr. Justice Dysart although other matters of dissent are mentioned in the latter\u2019s judgment. As I have come to the conclusion that the appeal fails on the first ground, I do not say anything as to the second because Mr. Walsh quite properly agreed that, in that event, it would be unnecessary to do so.\nAgn\u00e8s Lad\u00e9route died October 23, 1944. An inquest was held and subsequently one Edward J. Ford was charged with manslaughter in connection with the woman\u2019s death and the preliminary inquiry in connection with that charge was held before a police magistrate on November 23, 1944. Tass was subpoenaed to appear as a witness at that inquiry. He attended and was sworn and gave evidence without raising any objection to answering any question upon the ground that his answer might tend to criminate him, as he was entitled to do by subsection 2 of section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act, After testifying that he had been called to Ford\u2019s house to attend the woman and that he found her dead, he was asked as to what he found in the room and as to any previous knowledge he had of the woman or of her condition. He admitted that he knew she was pregnant, that he drove her in his automobile to a point about one and one-half city blocks from Ford\u2019s house and that he knew Ford would conduct an abortion as he \u201cfelt he had done them before.\u201d From these admissions and others in his testimony at the preliminary inquiry, it is plain that, if the examination was admissible, the jury was entitled to find him guilty.\nI disagree with the view of the dissenting judge below that this evidence of Tass was not relevant to the charge against Ford. It was suggested that an arrangement had been made between certain members of the police force and Crown counsel to put Tass in the witness box at Ford\u2019s preliminary inquiry in order to secure from Tass an admission of his guilt. It was even suggested that the magistrate had been a party to this arrangement. I find no evidence that any of the named parties had entered into such an arrangement or that it had been decided to arrest and prosecute Tass before the preliminary inquiry into the charge against Ford, and the matter is therefore left with Tass as a witness in a proceeding under oath admitting his guilt of the crimes now charged against him and that he did not claim the protection provided for by the Canada Evidence Act. Under these circumstances the decision in Regina v. Coote[2] is conclusive.\nIt is true that at the time of that decision there was no such provision as subsection 2 of section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act. That Act removes a safeguard a person had at common law to refuse to answer any questions that might criminate him. He is now obliged to do so but such evidence may not be used against him if he claims the protection of the Act. It has been pointed out in several cases such as Rex v. Clark[3], Re Ginsberg[4]), and Rex v. Barnes[5] that the protection now afforded may not be as wide as that under the common law and objections have been raised from time to time as to the possibility of the evidence acquired under the Act being used to build up a case against a person who may be subsequently charged with an offence. However that may be, the matter seems quite clear that if the person testifying does not claim the exemption, the evidence so given may be later used against him, and this notwithstanding the fact that he may not known of his rights; Regina case2.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nThe judgment of Rand, Kellock and Estey JJ. was delivered by\nKellock j.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Manitoba affirming (Dysart J. ad hoc dissenting) the conviction of the appellant before Donovan J. and a jury on the 11th day of May, 1945, in respect of two counts in an indictment, namely, attempt to procure a miscarriage and use of instruments to procure a miscarriage. In view of the opinion which I have formed with respect to the appeal it is necessary to mention only one ground of dissent. The appellant had given evidence upon a preliminary inquiry with respect to charges then pending against one Ford, arising out of the same facts out of which the appellant was himself later charged and part of this evidence was admitted against the appellant at his trial. Dysart J. was of opinion that this evidence was inadmissible. His view may be summarized as follows: that the evidence was irrelevant to the matter with which the preliminary inquiry was concerned, namely, the pending charges against Ford; that counsel for the prosecution had conducted the part of the examination objected to from an improper motive, viz: merely to obtain the admissions for use against the witness himself and that the magistrate was a party to this scheme; that the appellant had ceased properly to be a witness at all and his failure to avail himself of the provisions of section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C., c. 59 was immaterial and did not render his answers subsequently admissible against him.\nIn the course of his reasons the learned judge stated that the evidence in question had been\nextracted from a man who was so strongly suspected of complicity in Ford\u2019s crime that the authorities had decided to arrest and prosecute him.\nHowever, counsel for the appellant before us quite frankly admitted that this view of the learned judge was not supported by the evidence.\nWhen the evidence objected to is examined its relevancy is not, in my opinion, open to objection. It is shown that there was a common design between the appellant and Ford with respect to the matter in question and the principle referred to in Koufis v. The King,[6] is applicable. The examination of the appellant was therefore proper and accordingly there is no foundation for the allegation as to any ulterior motive on the part of either the Crown Attorney or the magistrate. Being properly before the magistrate it was for the appellant to invoke the provisions of section 5 of the Canada Evidence Act. Not having done so his evidence is properly admissible against him. It is not therefore necessary to consider whether the examination objected to would have been other than admissible against Tass if it could have been established that it was irrelevant to the pending charge against Ford. Rex v. Sloggett, (1); Rex v. Graham, (2); The King v. Van Meter, (3) may be referred to.\nAs to the other ground of dissent which was argued before us, counsel for the appellant took the position that if he could not support the first ground of dissent it was unnecessary for us to deal with the second.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] [1946] 2 W.W.R. 97; (1946) 1 Criminal Reports (Canada) 378; 86 C.C.C. 97; [1946] 3 D.L.R. 804.\n[2] (1873) L.R. 4 P.C. 599.\n[3] (1902) 3 O.L.R. 176.\n[4] (1917) 40 O.L.R. 136.\n[5] (1921) 49 O.L.R. 374.\n2 (1873) L.R. 4 P.C. 599.\n[6] [1941] S.C.R. 481, at 488.\n",

Appellant continued to use the siding in common with respondent after the expiration of the term but rent was paid during the term only. In 1930 the respondent acquired title to the said lands and in 1945 brought action for a declaration of title free from any right or interest on the part of appellant. Appellant contended that, by reason of the lease, the exclusive right of occupation of the land upon which the siding was situate became vested in the appellant during the term of the demise and that, because of the continued use of the siding by appellant, the title of the respondent had become extinguished by reason of the Statute of Limitations. The judgment of the trial judge in favour of the respondent was affirmed by the appellate court. Held, affirming the judgment appealed from (19 M.P.R. 22), that the appellant had not established any prescriptive title under the Statute of Limitations. The appellant was not, since the expiration of the term, in exclusive possession nor were the respondent and its predecessors in title during that period ever out of possession.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco,[1] affirming the judgment of the trial judge, Hall J.[2] and maintaining an action by the respondent railway for a declaration that it was the owner of a portion of a railway siding and entitled to possession thereof.\nC. B. Smith K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. E. Rutledge K.C. and W. H. Jost for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nKellock J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco, dated 12th January, 1946, dismissing an appeal from the judgment at trial in favour of the respondent in an action brought against the appellant, and others, for possession of certain lands in the town of Yarmouth on which there is a railway siding. In defence of the action the appellant relies upon the Statute of Limitations.\nThe paper title is admittedly in the respondent by virtue of a grant made in 1930. By an indenture of the 1st March, 1918, the respondent\u2019s predecessors in title (the Bakers) demised and leased to the appellant for the term of one year at a rental of $5.00\nthe ground with track thereon and the necessary land for loading and unloading facilities and situate on property of the said parties of the first part * * * running from said Water street in a south westwardly direction three hundred and fifty feet with the necessary roadway permitting exit and egress from and to said spur. Reserving, however, the right of the said parties of the first part, their agents, employees and lessees to use said siding and track in common with said party of the second part.\nThe rent was paid on the 12th April, 1918, but no subsequent rent was ever paid. Some 140 feet only of this siding is the subject matter in dispute. The learned trial judge found that by 1918 the siding had been kept in shape\nprimarily for the purpose of enabling cars to be unloaded at the Baker\u2019s coal and wood sheds\nand that it continued so to be used. The trial judge also found:\nI am of the opinion that from 1911 to the date of the lease only cars for the Bakers had been placed on the siding. Under the terms of the lease the Railway could place cars there for third parties to unload, paying one dollar per year to the Bakers for such privilege and could also place on it cars carrying freight and material belonging to the Railway without payment of an unloading charge. There is no evidence that the Railway Company placed cars there for its own use during the one year term or at any time since.\nThere was also some evidence that from time to time the appellant placed a car on the siding for the convenience of a man by the name of Allen. This was done most infrequently and was found by the trial judge to be a permissive occupation and not a continuous using as of right. These findings of the trial judge were affirmed by the full court.\nAppellant takes the position that it is unnecessary to decide whether the indenture of 1918 is a lease or a licence. Appellant says that on the expiration of the term provided for by the document appellant became a trespasser upon the lands, but that by reason of the terms of the indenture the exclusive right of occupation of the land upon which the siding was situate was vested in appellant during the one year term with the result that, to quote the factum:\nrespondent\u2019s predecessors in title could not have occupied or used the land on which the siding is situate for agricultural, building or other purposes which would have interfered with the free and uninterrupted operation of trains by the appellant.\nCounsel contends that because the use of the siding by both parties has remained the same since the expiration of the term, the title of the respondent has become extinguished by reason of the operation of the Statute of Limitations.\nIn Lord Advocate v. Lord Lovat[3] the following from the judgment of Lord O\u2019Hagan is cited with approval by Lord Macnaghten in Johnston v. O\u2019Neill[4]:\nAs to possession, it must be considered in every case with reference to the peculiar circumstances. The acts, implying possession in one case, may be wholly inadequate to prove it in another. The character and value of the property, the suitable and natural mode of using it, the course of conduct which the proprietor might reasonably be expected to follow with a due regard to his own interests\u2014all these things, greatly varying as they must, under various conditions, are to be taken into account in determining the sufficiency of a possession.\nIn Leigh v. Jack (1), Bramwell L.J. said:\n* * * in order to defeat a title by dispossessing the former owner, acts must be done which are inconsistent with his enjoyment of the soil for the purposes for which he intended to use it * * *\nThe appellant has not, since the expiration of the term, had exclusive possession. The respondent and its predecessors in title were never out of possession but continued to use the lands and the siding upon it as they intended to use it.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: C. B. Smith.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J. E. Rutledge.\n[1] (1946) 19 M.P.R. 22, at 37; 59 Can. Ry. and Transp. Cases 11, at 22.\n[2] (1945) 19 M.P.R. 22; 59 Can. Ry. and Transp.

The appellants, administrators of the father\u2019s estate, are not entitled to the benefit of this presumption arising from the relation of parties. The onus of proof remained upon them. Krys v. Krys ([1929] S.C.R. 153) and McKay v. Clow ([1941] S.C.R. 643) distinguished.\nUnder the circumstances of this case, relative to the question of consideration of the contract, while the courts will inquire as to whether advantage is taken or influence exerted, yet when it is found that neither of these exist and that the parties wore equally in possession of all the facts, mere inadequacy of consideration or that it was an improvident agreement will not suffice to disturb the contract.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal, dismissing the appellant\u2019s action ([1946] 2 W.W.R. 32) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Taylor J. and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action to set aside an agreement for the sale of a homestead by an aged father to his son on grounds of fraud and undue influence.\nG. H. Yule K.C. for the appellants.\nJ. E. MacDermid K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Hudson, Kellock and Estey JJ. was delivered by\nEstey J.\u2014The appellants, executors of the late Sam W. Karaloff, ask in this action that an agreement for sale, dated the 3rd day of November, 1934, between the late Sam W. Karaloff and his son, the late John S. Karaloff, be set aside on the ground that the latter had fraudulently and by the exercise of undue influence induced his father to make the said agreement. Plaintiffs also ask the defendant, Eva Karaloff, the widow of the late John S. Karaloff and executrix of his estate, to account for the crops grown upon the said lands and assets that came into her hands, the property of or for the late Sam W. Karaloff.\nSam W. Karaloff died January 2, 1938; John S. Karaloff died December 10, 1943, and Polly Karaloff, the wife of the late Sam W. Karaloff, died August 10, 1944. The learned trial judge found in favour of the plaintiffs (appellants), and his judgment was reversed by unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal in Saskatchewan.\nThe late Sam W. Karaloff and his wife, the late Polly Karaloff, resided for years on the quarter section in question (North-West Quarter of Section Sixteen (16) in Township Forty-Four (44), in Range Five (5), West of the Third Meridian). They had a family of eight. One of their sons, John, had farmed in the same district. He lost his farm and went to British Columbia, where at times he worked and at other times was on relief. In 1930 the appellant, Serge Calmusky, at the request of his father-in-law, the late Sam W. Karaloff, wrote John asking him to return home. John did so and worked upon the farm with his father, then a man of about 70 years of age.\nThe agreement in question was executed on the 3rd of November, 1934, between the late Sam W. Karaloff and his son, the late John S. Karaloff. Under this agreement John purchased from his father the above described quarter section (N.W. 16-44-5-W-3), together with all livestock and machinery thereon\nfor the price of one-fourth of share of wheat grown on the land above till my death or till the death of my wife, Polly.\nThe purchaser agreed to pay the balance ($70) owing on a cream separator, all the taxes, of which there was a small amount in arrears, and not to ask wages for his services since he returned in 1930. It also contained the two following clauses.\nThe Vendor and his wife shall have full right to reside in the buildings on this said land till their respective deaths. I revoke all my former Wills or Agreements made by me prior to the date of this agreement.\nThis agreement was prepared in the office of one Anton Kryzanowski, a notary public and justice of the peace in the nearby village of Blaine Lake. He deposed that the parties came to his office and both of them instructed him as to the contents of the agreement; that as he was a Ukranian he had an interpreter present who spoke Russian, the language of both Sam W. Karaloff and his wife, Polly. This interpreter also signed as a witness. After the agreement was executed by the parties and witnessed by John Molchanoff, Wasyl Hrycuik and Anton Kryzanowski, the latter, who was acquainted with the parties and had done business for the late Sam W. Karaloff, retained both copies in his possession.\nThe requirements of The Homesteads Act, 1930, R.S.S., c. 82, designed for the protection of the wife, were complied with in this case, not on the 3rd day of November, 1934, when the agreement was executed by the husband, but over nine months later on the 8th day of August, 1935, when the late Polly Karaloff attended at the office of Mr. J. J. Coffin, a justice of the peace in Blaine Lake, and signed the agreement:\nAnd I, Polly Karaloff, wife of the above-named Sam W. Karaloff, do hereby declare that I have executed these presents for the purpose of relinquishing all my rights to the said homestead in favour of John S. Karaloff the within-named purchaser.\nWitness her\nJ. J. Coflin Polly X Karaloff\nmark\nMr. Coffin discussed the matters relative to this agreement through an interpreter and after examining Mrs. Karaloff, as required by The Homesteads Act, he completed the following certificate which is endorsed upon the agreement:\nCertificate under \u201cThe Homesteads Act, 1920\u201d\nI, Jay J. Coflin, a Justice of the Peace in and for the province of Saskatchewan and residing at the village of Blaine Lake therein, do certify:\nThat I have examined Polly Karaloff, wife of Sam W. Karaloff, the owner and vendor named in the within indenture, separate and apart from her husband, and she acknowledges to me that she signed the same of her own free will and consent and without any compulsion on the part of her husband and for the purpose of relinquishing her rights in the homestead in favour of John S. Karaloff, the purchaser named in the within indenture, and further that she was aware of what her rights in the said homestead were.\nAnd I further certify that I am not disqualified under section 3 of The Homesteads Act from taking the above acknowledgment.\nDated the 8th day of August, 1935.\nJ. J. Coflin J.P.\nThe revocation of \u201call my former Wills or Agreements\u201d in the above quoted provision of the agreement has reference to a document dated February 22, 1932. On that date the late Sam W. Karaloff executed a document written by Alexander Nazaroff, a local school teacher, and witnessed by Alexander Nazaroff and Fred Derkachenko. It provided that at his death his son John Karaloff should \u201cremain the sole owner of all my property movable and immovable\u201d, and then followed a description of the above quarter section, his livestock and machinery. It provided that he and his wife, so long as either might so live, would be joint managers with John S. Karaloff, and that the farm should be managed in the best interests of all, including \u201cthe future wife of John S. Karaloff\u201d. It further provided that\nJohn is to take care of me and my wife during the whole period kindly, politely and generously during our old age in sickness and in other adversities.\nIt further provided for certain specific gifts to other members of the family. John had not been paid for his services since his return in 1930, and it contained a provision that if Sam W. Karaloff should at any time sell the farm that he would pay John $2,500.\nThe fact of its execution nor the competency of Sam W. Karaloff to do so is not questioned, nor is there any suggestion of fraud or undue influence with respect to this document.\nJohn S. Karaloff married the respondent, Eva Karaloff, on October 12, 1932.\nUnder date of September 24, 1934, the said John S. Karaloff purchased from his brother, Alexander S. Karaloff, 80 acres of land, being the South Half of the South-West Quarter of Section 21, in Township Forty-Four (44), in Range Five (5), West of the Third Meridian, for $1,000, payable $125 in cash, $75 on the 24th of October, 1935, and the balance by crop payments.\nIt is the same quarter section (N.W. 16-44-5-W-3), the livestock and farming equipment which constituted the subject matter of both the document of February 22, 1932, and the agreement for sale in question. Under the former they were all managers and all worked for the \u201ccommon benefit\u201d with the added provision that\nJohn is to take care of me and my wife during the whole period kindly, politely and generously during our old age in sickness and in other adversities.\nAll of these parties, the father, mother and their son John, had died prior to the trial and therefore no explanation is given as to why this second agreement was made. The agreement for sale dated November 3, 1934, was made between a father about 74 years of age, in good health, active and in possession of all his faculties, and one of his sons about 44 years of age. These facts do not constitute a fiduciary relationship between the parties, nor was any evidence adduced of \u201cconfidence put and influence exerted\u201d by the son that would place the burden upon the respondent to prove the agreement was made voluntarily and with an understanding of its nature and effect. The contention of the appellants that they were entitled to the benefit of this presumption cannot be maintained. The onus of proof remained upon them. Wallis v. Andrews,[2]; In re Coomber,[3]; Axeworthy v. Staples,[4].\nIn cases where a fiduciary relation does not subsist between the parties, the Court will not, as it does where a fiduciary relation subsists, presume confidence put and influence exerted: the confidence and the influence must in such cases be proved extrinsically, but when they are proved extrinsically the rules of equity are just as applicable in the one case as in the other. Kerr on Fraud and Mistake 6th ed., p. 197.\nThe case of Krys v.. Krys,[5] relied upon by the appellants, is distinguishable in that there the learned trial judge found \u201cthe son agreed to act as trustee for the father.\u201d In that relationship there is the presumption of \u201cconfidence put and influence exerted\u201d. Then, too, in the case of McKay v. Clow,[6] a deed of conveyance and an agreement were executed by \u201can enfeebled old man\u201d who, though he requested it, was denied the privilege of obtaining legal advice, and who was threatened that if he did not sign the agreement he would be left in a helpless condition. In addition there was evidence of disagreement and domination extending over a period of time. It was upon evidence of this character that the Court placed the onus upon the transferees.\nThere is no finding of the learned trial judge that John was a trustee for his father, nor is there any evidence upon which such a. finding could be made as in Krys v. Krys,5 and there is no evidence of such weakness on the part of the father, nor such evidence of domination and threats on the part of the son as were present in McKay v. Clow6. Chief Justice Martin, on behalf of the Court of Appeal, appropriately summarized the position up to the conclusion of the agreement:\nWhat took place between the parties prior to the execution of the agreement for sale does not appear. There is no evidence that the execution of the agreement was obtained by fraud, undue influence or duress on the part of John at or prior to the time when the parties respectively signed the agreement or that he took advantage of their illiteracy. The fact that Polly Karaloff executed the agreement nine months after her husband\u2019s execution of it indicates that the agreement was not entered into without due consideration. The father was at the time 75 years of age, almost three years older than when he executed the will of February 22, 1932, which provided for joint management of the farm and it may well be that a reason for the second agreement was that he desired to be relieved from any responsibility and to place the entire management in the hands of his son. Moreover, if John at the time was engaged in a scheme to take advantage of his father as suggested he might have had him execute a transfer of the land, which no doubt in his opinion at least would have made his position more secure.\nA witness, who was councillor for the municipality for a period of ten years from 1931, deposed that John and his father were at the municipal office on a Saturday late in 1934 when the father stated that he had sold his land to John and to collect the taxes from him. When the secretary-treasurer stated there were some arrears owing, John said he would take care of them. That was in accord with the terms of the agreement.\nThe appellants stressed the importance of certain incidents in 1937. It appears that after the making of the agreement there was no reference thereto until that year. The father retained his health until some time in 1937 and he and John worked together on the farm.\nOn the 6th of July, 1937, the appellant, George S. Karaloff, who farmed about a quarter of a mile from his brother John and his father, took the latter into Saskatoon for medical attention and while there his father executed his will. Under its provisions he gave 1\/3 of his real and personal estate to his wife, 2\/9 to John and 4\/9 to be divided between his other seven children.\nWithin a week or two of that trip into Saskatoon on July 6, 1937, George and his father called at Kryzanowski\u2019s office where the agreement in question had remained. George deposed that he there read the agreement to his father who became very angry, made serious accusations against Kryzanowski and said that he meant \u201cdifferent kind of papers.\u201d\nThe statements made by the deceased, Sam W. Karaloff, in this conversation were admitted in evidence by the learned trial judge but rejected in the Court of Appeal. Counsel for the appellants submitted the statements were admissible upon the authority of Shanklin v. Smith,[7]. In that case in the Courts below the statements were not admitted as evidence of the facts asserted but only evidence as to the deceased\u2019s state of mind. An appeal to this Court was dismissed (2), but the reception of this evidence was not discussed. Nor is it necessary to decide the question of its admissibility here because even if the statements of Sam W. Karaloff are admitted on this limited basis as in Shanklin v. Smith,7 they do no more than evidence his state of mind in 1937 and perhaps provide a basis for an inference of his state of mind in 1934. The lapse of time as well as the age and illness of Sam W. Karaloff, and the circumstances under which they were made, make it very doubtful if any inference, the weight of which would be so negligible, ought to be drawn therefrom.\nAt Kryzanowski\u2019s office the conversation was concluded, as George deposed, when his father became so excited and angry that George was \u201cafraid that he might collapse\u201d. As a consequence he took him home. At home, George deposed, the father became involved in a heated conversation with John with respect to this agreement when he accused John of fooling him and used language vile and abusive and said that he was going. to call in the elders. The latter was explained to be a Russian custom for settling difficulties.\nThis conversation was admitted in evidence as statements made in the presence of John. As such they are admissible but constitute evidence against John only in so far as he by words or conduct adopted or admitted them: Phipson, 8th Ed., 240; Rex v. Christie,[8] Chapdelaine v. The King,[9]. No evidence is given as to John\u2019s conduct and there is no finding with regard thereto. All that the evidence discloses is that when the statements were made John, apparently addressing George, said \u201c. . . you find out, that is finished, it is my land\u201d. Under these circumstances his not refuting the alleged statements does not constitute an admission, and therefore, as Chief Justice Martin stated, this conversation:\n* * * has no probative force in an inquiry which must be directed to ascertain the circumstances under which the agreement of November 3, 1934, was executed.\nThis conversation at John\u2019s home was also concluded, as George deposed, because he was concerned lest his father should \u201ccollapse again\u201d, and as a consequence he took him outside to his car. However, George left his father at John\u2019s home and the evidence discloses no further conversations between John and his father with regard to this matter. There his father remained, as provided in the contract, apart from the time he was in the hospital, until he died in January, 1938. Thereafter the mother remained with John until she went to live with her daughter in April, 1943. If John were not giving his father a fair share of the crop, it would seem rather unlikely that he would employ George to thresh for him in 1935 and 1936, and thereby provide George with complete information with respect to the wheat crop. Then after the alleged disclosures of 1937 and the death of his father, when his mother was entitled to the same one-quarter share of the crop, it would seem even more unlikely that he would employ the appellant, his brother-in-law Serge Calmusky, to thresh for him in 1938, 1939, 1940 and at least in part in 1942. There does not appear to be any disputes or discussions with regard to the division of the crop upon any of these occasions. Indeed, apart from a short conversation between Serge Calmusky and John, when they were upon friendly terms, when Serge made some inquiry of John about the deal between himself and his father and John replied: \u201cIt is too late, no use to talk\u201d, after which Serge Calmusky stated: \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t do anything\u201d, and the delivery of a letter written on behalf of the appellants to the auctioneer in October, 1943, claiming the proceeds of personal property which was being sold by Mrs. Karaloff after John had enlisted in the Armed Services, nothing was done with regard to the matter until this action was started in 1945.\nThe conduct of the parties after July, 1937, does not support the contention of the appellants. Apart from the fact that the mother and father continued to reside with John, as contemplated by the contract, neither of the appellants, George who lived about a quarter of a mile and Serge about one and a half miles distant, took any steps or made any effort to have the agreement altered or rescinded, or on the other hand to insure that the parents got their share under the agreement, although throughout their evidence they suggest that the father and mother were not receiving what was called for by the agreement.\nAfter the father died in January, 1938, the mother was still entitled to a quarter of the crop under the agreement, and still no effort was made to have the agreement altered or rescinded. In his will the father had named George Karaloff and Serge Calmusky as his executors. They made no effort to have the will proved until John had consulted a solicitor who took steps with regard to the appointment of an administrator. Then the appellants made application for Letters Probate, which were issued on September 2, 1943. Steps to bring this action were not taken until August, 1944, and the writ was not issued until April, 1945. Laches is not pleaded but that does not prevent their conduct being examined in relation to the allegations of fraud and undue influence.\nThe appellants contended that the consideration was inadequate, basing their contention in the main on the fact that one-quarter of the crop was to be delivered in each year to his parents. There was further consideration: John had received no wages for his work during the preceding four years and was not now to receive any; the parents had the right to live in the home and to enjoy their own furniture; John was to pay the balance owing on the cream separator and the arrears of taxes. In 1934 farm values were very low and speculative; in fact the evidence indicates there was no sale for farm lands at that time. The father apparently wanted John to remain upon the farm, no doubt with a view to him and his wife being cared for as their ages advanced. They had shared everything in the house since 1930 and the evidence is that they continued to do so. Under such circumstances, while the courts will inquire as to whether advantage is taken or influence exerted, yet when it is found that neither of these exist and that the parties were equally in possession of all the facts, mere inadequacy of consideration is not a ground for disturbing the contract.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal dismissing the appellants\u2019 action should be affirmed and this appeal dismissed with costs payable by the appellants personally.\nRand J.\u2014I agree with the conclusions reached by my brother Estey, whose reasons I have had the privilege of reading, and I have only a word to add.\nWhether or not the statement of the father said by the son, George, to have been made on the occasion of the visit to Kryzanowskrs office was admissible, and I do not mean to imply any doubt of the soundness of the holding in the Court of Appeal, in substance it was repeated to the son, John, and its effect on that occasion can properly be taken into consideration. It is significant that notwithstanding this scene, the father continued to live with John until his death five months later. It is significant, too, that the father left the document with the notary, that he did not \u201ccall in the elders\u201d of the community, the practice of this Russian group, nor did he take any other step to confirm what is said to have been his repudiation. Although at that time he was suffering from a heart ailment, he was clearly a man of strong spirit and temper, and it would be inexplicable on the facts before us if in a matter carrying such importance to people of this class he should have meekly or fatalistically abstained from undoing such a fraud. The only plausible inference would be that reflection either had recalled what he had forgotten or had brought him rather to a confirmation of what had been done.\nThe evidence does not enable us to gather the instigation of the making of the will in July, 1943, or his visit to the notary\u2019s office in August; nor do we know what he thought or claimed the document was intended to be. His execution of it is undoubted and the acknowledgment by his wife many months afterwards and his notification to the assessors are corroborating circumstances of the strongest sort.\nThe only ground arguable is fraud, but an allegation of fraud against a deceased in a situation such as that presented to us is to be received with suspicion, and here that suspicion has not been relieved. The trial judge was mistaken in treating the 80 acres as being involved in the dealings of John with his father; the agreement of September 24, 1934, for this land is between John and his brother Alex. He was evidently influenced also by what he considered the unreliability of the witness Derkachenko, but a close examination of the latter\u2019s evidence makes it clear that he misapprehended several of the answers given and on this misconception rejected the testimony as a whole.\nThe appeal should therefore be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Makaroff & Bates.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ferguson, MacDermid & MacDermid.\n[1] [1946] 2 W.W.R. 32; [1946] 2 D.L.R. 513.\n[2] (1869) 16 Gr.

Statute of Frauds\u2014National Selective Service Civilian Regulations\u2014Notice of separation\u2014Companies Act, R.S.B.C., 1936, c. 42, s. 98(1)(c). In an action by the respondent for wrongful dismissal, the facts were that he was engaged by the appellant company as accountant and as salesman for its products, subject to the direction of the managing director, on terms of salary and commissions. The respondent on many occasions had charged commissions on sales tax; and this was alleged inter alia as a cause for dismissal.\nHeld: Rand J. dissenting, that there is no evidence to substantiate the appellant company's charge that the respondent was either fraudulent or incompetent. Charging by the respondent of commissions on sales tax and some other items, even if the respondent himself did not claim that he was entitled to do so, was, particularly considering the extent of the business of the appellant, due to an honest mistake on his part.\nPer Rand J. (dissenting) : Respondent was a highly placed employee with corresponding competence and responsibility in whom complete trust in relation to the accounts, including his own remuneration, was placed; and once, in such circumstances, an objective act of misconduct appeared, an inference arose from it which should be met by the person shown to be at fault. This feature of the case has not been satisfactorily dealt with in the courts below. A re-trial of the issue of misconduct in relation to the taking of commission on taxes and a re-assessment of damages should be had.\nIn a claim at common law for damages for wrongful dismissal, when the right of the employer has been proved, the amount of damages is amenable to mitigation. The true test is not whether it was reasonable for the employee to refrain from seeking employment, but whether the employee took all reasonable steps to mitigate the loss consequent on the breach. In this case, the appellant company having broken the contract, the respondent was not entitled to consider it as still subsisting.\nIn the same claim for wrongful dismissal put upon the allegation that such dismissal did not comply with the National Selective Service Civilian Regulations, the trial judge found that the appellant company did not comply with the regulations but that the respondent himself did not use due diligence in trying to get employment and that once he knew he could not secure a new position without a notice of separation, due diligence would involve the making of some attempt on his part to secure it. The respondent did not appeal from that judgment and the issue must, therefore, be taken as settled.\nThe contention of the appellant, that any agreement as to alterations in the written contract was one which was required to be in writing because of the respondent's covenant not to divulge trade secrets during the continuance of his employment and after its termination, and that the contract was thus within the British Columbia Statute of Frauds as one not performable within a year, cannot be upheld. A contract is not one that is \"not to be performed within the space of one year from the making thereof\", within the meaning of section 4 of the statute, if all the obligations of the employee under the contract could have been carried out by him within the term of one year from its date; since the respondent might have died within the year, such covenant was one which might have been performed within the year. As a result, the respondent is entitled to damages, as there was no basis for his dismissal and should recover the sum of $14,500 awarded him by the trial judge, less such amount as he could have earned between the date of his dismissal and the date marking the end of a contract year (had he obtained his notice of separation) by securing employment in some other remunerative position that may have been opened to him; and a new trial should be had, restricted to ascertaining such amount.\u2014Rand J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the majority of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1] , reversing a judgment of the trial judge, Wilson J., which had maintained an action for damages for wrongful dismissal, and ordering a new trial as to guarantee of damages.\nAlfred Bull K.C. for the appellant.\nC. K. Guild K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin, Hudson and Estey J.J. was delivered by\nKERWIN, J.:\u2014The appellant, Cemco Electrical Manufacturing Company Limited, is the defendant in an action brought by Peter Van Snellenberg, Junior, for the amount claimed to be due him under an agreement between the parties and for damages for wrongful dismissal. The terms of the original agreement are set forth in the following statement contained in the reasons for judgment of the trial judge:\nThe plaintiff herein was employed by the defendant on May 1, 1934, by a written contract, executed under seal by the defendant company to carry out the following duties:\n(1) To continue (as he had been) in responsible charge of the office and accounts of the Company.\n(2) To assume the capacity and perform the duties of salesman of and for the Company with respect to certain products specified in paragraph 1 of the contract, and also any other goods, etc., which the Company might specify in writing to the employee to sell for or on behalf of the Company under the terms of the agreement.\nThe plaintiff's remuneration was fixed by the contract as follows:\n1. Salary: $20.00 per week.\n2. Overriding commission: 1 per cent of all gross sales made by the defendant in excess of $3,000 in any one month.\n3. Specific commissions: 10 per cent on sales of goods specified in paragraph 1 of the contract. In paragraph 3 of the contract the plaintiff contracted inter alia to faithfully, honestly and diligently serve the defendant in the capacities of salesman, supervisor of office work and accounting department and secretary-treasurer, and to at all times obey, observe and carry out the lawful directions of the Company's managing director with respect to his duties.\nParagraph 13 of the contract provided, inter alia, that the plaintiff should have no authority to extend the time for payment of any account.\nParagraph 20 read as follows:\n\"20. This agreement shall be in force for the period of one year from the date hereof at the end of which period it is contemplated that the same shall be revised and\/or continued if, and as may then be, mutually agreed upon by and between the parties hereto; provided, however, that in the event of the employee being guilty of any act or omission in contravention of the terms, covenants or conditions herein contained the Company may at any time terminate this agreement with or without notice.\"\nAs the trial judge further points out, the plaintiff was continuously employed by the defendant from the date of this agreement to September 23, 1943, but at no time did the parties specifically agree, as contemplated by paragraph 20 to continue the contract. The Company's business grew steadily from 1934 and expanded greatly with war orders from the autumn of 1939, and with this expansion occurred an enormous increase in the plaintiff's commission earnings and in his duties. By a letter of September 23, 1943, the defendant purported to cancel the agreement because, as alleged in another letter of the same date, the plaintiff had failed to comply with the instructions of Mr. Darnbrough, the managing director, to take no more orders for the Company's products without his approval. By its statement of defence, the Company gave as additional reasons for its dismissal of the plaintiff: (1) that the plaintiff had, in contravention of paragraph 13 of the agreement, extended the time for payment of an account due the Company; (2) that the plaintiff had credited to his account and collected from the defendant commissions to the extent of $7,231.22 to which he was not entitled. The defendant counter-claimed for $1,718.61 which it alleged to be the net balance owing to it after crediting admitted amounts for commission and salary.\nBy an amendment to his claim, the plaintiff alleged certain verbal alterations in the written contract which he said had been agreed to by Mr. Darnbrough, notwithstanding the terms of paragraph (1) of the agreement by which the plaintiff was to act as salesman for the Company with respect to certain specified equipment, accessories, goods and merchandise\nand also any other goods, equipment and merchandise which the Company may specify in writing to the employee to sell for and on behalf of the Company under the terms of this agreement.\nThe Company contended that the agreement was one which was required to be in writing by virtue of the provisions of section 4 of the British Columbia Statute of Frauds, not so much because the plaintiff was \"on and from the date hereof\" to assume and carry out his duties but because of the provisions of paragraph 12 of the agreement:\u2014\n12. The employee shall not during the continuance of his employment, nor after its determination, by any means, without the consent in writing of the Company, divulge to any person not a director of the Company any trade secret, method of manufacture or special information employed in or conducive to the business of the Company, and which may come to his knowledge in the course of or by reason of his employment.\nThe trial judge and the Court of Appeal were right in holding that, as the plaintiff might have died before May 5, 1935, all his obligations under the contract could have been carried out within the term of one year from its date, and the statute did not apply. The earlier decisions upon this point are all the one way but, if the later case of Reeve v. Jennings[2] decides anything to the contrary, it should not be followed. For the reasons stated by the trial judge, there was ample consideration for the variations and additions to the written agreement.\nThe appellant relied upon the following provision of the British Columbia Companies Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, chapter 42:\n98. (1) Contracts on behalf of a Company may be made as follows, that is to say:\n***\n(c) Any contract which if made between private persons would by law be valid although made by parol only and not reduced into writing, may be made by parol on behalf of the Company by any person acting under its authority, express or implied and may in the same manner be varied or discharged.\nWhile there was no express authority to Mr. Darnbrough, such authority should under the circumstances be implied.\nThe trial judge has found, and the Court of Appeal has agreed with him, (a) that the variations and additions to the agreement alleged by the plaintiff were in fact made; (b) that the plaintiff had Mr. Darnbrough's approval, specific or general, to the taking of more orders, and (c) that the plaintiff did not extend the time for payment of an account due the Company. Not only has Mr. Bull failed to convince me that these conclusions are wrong, but I am satisfied, on the evidence, that they are the proper findings. The effect of the charging by the plaintiff in his accounts of commissions on sales tax presents more difficulty. The trial judge found he was not entitled to these commissions and the plaintiff did not appeal from that judgment. The trial judge is not quite accurate when he says that the plaintiff did not charge commissions on sales tax when it appeared as a separate item on invoices since the Company, before the Court of Appeal and in its factum in this Court, has indicated eight instances where commission was charged on invoices showing sales tax. It is true the total of these items, extending over four years, is only $6.08, and counsel for the plaintiff stated that after a careful search he was able to find only two other items totalling 26c, but the smallness of the amounts would not necessarily determine the matter. However, taking everything into consideration, I am satisfied that while not endorsing all that appears in the reasons for judgment of the members of the Courts below, they have reached the proper conclusion that there is no evidence to substantiate the Company's charge that the plaintiff was either fraudulent or incompetent. His charging of commissions on sales tax and on delivery charges and on the various other items referred to by counsel where the plaintiff himself does not now claim that he was entitled to do so under the terms of the original agreement or any variations thereof was, particularly considering the extent of the business being carried on by the Company, due to an honest mistake on his part.\nThe result is that there being no basis for the Company's dismissal of the plaintiff, he is entitled to damages and it is on this point that a difference of opinion exists between the trial judge and the majority of the Court of Appeal. The plaintiff's claim was put at common law and upon the allegation that his dismissal did not comply with the National Selective Service Civilian Regulations. As to the latter, the trial judge found that the Company did not comply with the regulations, but that the plaintiff himself did not use due diligence in trying to get employment and that once he knew he could not secure a new position without a notice of separation, due diligence would involve the making of some attempt on his part to secure it. The plaintiff did not appeal from this judgment and the issue must, therefore, be taken as settled. As to the claim at common law, the majority of the judges in the Court of Appeal, taking that finding as a starting point, were unable to see why the same reasoning should not apply to the common law branch of the action. Mr. Justice O'Halloran considered that the test was whether it was reasonable for the plaintiff to refrain from seeking employment. The true test, however, is whether the plaintiff took all reasonable steps to mitigate the loss consequent on the breach: British Westinghouse Electric Co. v. Underground Electric Railways Co.[3] . The Company having broken the contract, the plaintiff was not entitled to consider it as still subsisting. In fact he did not do this because he made approaches to at least two other companies from which nothing resulted because he had not received a notice of separation under the Regulations.\nThe plaintiff, therefore, is not entitled as of right to the $14,500 awarded him by the trial judge but, notwithstanding Mr. Bull's contention that the plaintiff is not entitled to damages to the end of a contract year, that is down to April 30, 1944, reasonable notice upon which the agreement between the parties, with its various additions, could be determined would be about seven months. Mr. Bull contended that the plaintiff was entitled on the evidence to nominal damages only and that he should not be granted the privilege of a new trial. The Court of Appeal, however, in its discretion decided otherwise and it is impossible to say that it proceeded upon any wrong principle. In fact, under all the circumstances, it appears to be an eminently proper case in which the plaintiff should be given the opportunity afforded by that Court's formal order. The result is that that order should stand by which the plaintiff recovers from the defendant as damages for unlawful dismissal, the sum of $14,500 less such amount as the plaintiff could have earned between the date of his dismissal, namely, the 23rd September, 1943, and the 30th April, 1944 (had he obtained his notice of separation) by obtaining employment in the most remunerative of the positions open to him for employment in the Electrical Panel Manufacturing Company or the Canadian General Electric Company, or any company carrying on the same class of business as either of these companies, in or around Vancouver, and that a new trial be had, restricted to ascertaining such amount.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs and the cross-appeal without costs.\nRAND J. (dissenting):\u2014I agree with the Court of Appeal that there should be a new assessment of damages. The principle of mitigation is a necessary corollary of the basis of damages, namely, that they have arisen in a legal sense from a violation of a right. Underlying this is the assumption that a person must concern himself with his own interest if he would seek from the law the vindication of his civil engagements. In a contract of employment, the remuneration is either for work done or for the commitment to work. Upon a dismissal which is a repudiation of the obligation to accept the one or the other, as the remedy of specific performance is not available, the employee's capacity to work is now released to him to be used as he sees fit. He may decide to waste it or he may demand that the employer make good its full utility. In that event, he must act reasonably in seeking to employ it as he would or might have had the particular engagement not been made. It is the loss of earnings resulting from a denial of a right to use or commit his working capacity profitably that is the substance of his claim, and as he must prove his damages, it must appear that they arose from the breach of contract.\nThe failure of the employer to give a notice of separation from employment in the form prescribed under the National Selective Service Civil Regulations and that of the employee to demand one and to take every reasonable step to bring the discharge within the administration of those Regulations, do not affect the application of that principle. If the employee acquiesces in a failure in formality on the employer's part, and abstains from availing himself of rights which the Regulations give him, he must, in a court to which he resorts, face the rules of law applicable to the claim which he makes. Both he and his employer may expose themselves to penalties under the Regulations by what they do, but I see no reason why either, if he sees fit, may not waive administrative remedial benefits imposed upon the contract.\nBut a more difficult question is presented, which is whether the act of the respondent in taking commission on the amount of sales tax was a breach of his contract justifying dismissal or whether it was done through oversight or in the belief that the terms of his employment allowed it.\nThe respondent, in addition to his capacity as special salesman, was in complete charge of the accounts. He him-self made up the statements of his commission, prepared the cheques and placed all before the manager. But this material would not indicate or raise any question of tax or commission on it and from its acceptance by the manager no inference can be drawn of knowledge or notice on the part of the company of what was being done. This highly confidential relation between the company and the respondent called for the utmost good faith on his part, and once that was betrayed, the trust which was at the foundation of the employment was at an end.\nThe trial judge says:\nI think his action in charging commission on, sales tax was an honest error. This is, I think, deducible from the fact that he did not charge commission on sales tax where the customer's invoice showed sales tax as a separate item, but only in cases where the invoices incorporated the sales tax in the sale price. It must be said that this was a serious error, and one which deprived the company of a substantial amount of money. However, when eminent counsel seriously argues that commission is payable on sales tax, perhaps the mistake of a layman who has the same impression must not be regarded too seriously, not at any rate as proof of want of honesty or diligence.\nOn that I would make these observations. It was not a fact that commission was not charged on sales tax in cases where the tax was shown as a separate item on the invoice. There were a number of instances of that sort. But how from such a circumstance a deduction can be made that the respondent considered himself entitled to charge \"commission on sales\" is not clear to me. This may mean \"honest error\" in thinking that he had a right to charge commission where the sales tax and the price of the goods were combined in one sum; but on what in the evidence or proceedings can that be based? Certainly not the fact that in other respects his testimony was accepted. And what is clear is that by \"honest error\" is not meant oversight from hurried work in a multitude of items.\nIn the Court of Appeal, the point is dealt with by Robertson J.A. in these words:\nConsidering the volume of business which the appellant was doing during the years 1940-43, it is easy to see that small mistakes would occur in figuring the respondent's commission. In view of this fact and the cases to which I shall later refer, I am of the opinion the learned judge's findings should not be disturbed.\nNow, as I have remarked, this ground of oversight is not that of the trial judge. The cases to which reference is made deal with the onus on the person alleging fraud, and it is stated that it would be necessary to prove that the plaintiff knew that he was not entitled to a commission on the sales tax. The authority given for this is Rex v. Harcourt[4] ; but proof of a criminal mind either as to its nature or the weight of evidence furnishes no guidance for such an issue as we have here. The question is that of a fundamental breach of contract, and considering the confidence reposed in the respondent, a lack of belief on his part that he was entitled to commission on the sales tax would, in the circumstances, make his act such a breach.\nSmith J.A., with whom, on this point, O'Halloran J.A. agreed, puts the matter thus:\nThere can be no doubt that such commissions were so charged and paid; and the learned judge has so found. But he has also found that the plaintiff honestly thought that he was entitled to charge them, and that he did not do so fraudulently or in such a manner as would furnish grounds for dismissal.\nThen, after referring to the fact that the trial judge was in error in stating that the sales tax was charged only in cases where the invoice showed tax and price in a lump sum, he goes on: I think it plain from the evidence that the plaintiff thought himself justified in law in making these commission charges on sales tax (regardless of whether the items of sales tax were or were not shown separately in the invoice) and that it was not until judgment was handed down that his mistake was made clear to him *** It is no doubt true that the plaintiff was never expressly asked, and therefore never expressly said, that his mistake was an honest one. But does this matter when the whole argument of his counsel was that he was entitled in law to make these charges?\nBut it would be dangerous to allow such an argument to supply a defect of evidence going to the good faith of one in the position of the respondent.\nNow it is not disputed that the respondent was not entitled to commission on the amount of the sales taxes, and Mr. Bull contends that the taking of it, in the absence of any explanatory evidence, requires us to draw the conclusion of bad faith. No questions on the actual knowledge or belief of the respondent were asked on either side, and Mr. Guild's answer is that the party alleging fraud must prove it. Of course fraud or bad faith must be proved; but here was a highly placed employee with corresponding competence and responsibility in whom complete trust in relation to the accounts, including his own remuneration, was placed; and once, in such circumstances, the objective act of misconduct appears, I should think an inference arises from it which should be met by the person shown to be at fault.\nThe dealing with this feature of the controversy in the courts below has not, in my opinion, been satisfactory, and it also should be referred back.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal, and direct a re-trial of the issue of misconduct in relation to the taking of commission on taxes, and a re-assessment of damages. The appellant should have his costs in this Court, but all other costs should remain as they now stand. The cross-appeal should be dismissed without costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nCross-appeal dismissed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Walsh, Bull, Houser, Tupper, Ray & Carroll.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Ian A.

(11(2))\u2014\u201cBenefit\u201d\u2014\u201cPerson\u201d (s. 2(h))\u2014\u201cIncome received by an estate or trust and capitalized\u201d (s, 11 (4)(a))\u2014Adequacy of language to make charging provision operative.\nThe question was whether certain income received by the executors of a will was taxable in their hands under the Income War Tax Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 97, and amendments).\nIn the will, the testator gave to his executors and trustees (called his \u201ctrustees\u201d) the residue of his estate upon trust, to convert, invest, to carry out certain provisions, including gifts of annual payments for life, and to invest the surplus of the annual income as part of the capital of the trust estate; he directed his trustees to appropriate sufficient of the trust estate to insure an annual income therefrom sufficient for payment of annuities outstanding and to hold the trust estate, including accumulations and additions by deaths of annuitants or otherwise, and to pay annually to certain nephews and nieces 60 per cent of the net annual income; and to invest the surplus of such annual income as part of the capital of the trust estate; and, by clause 36, upon the death of the last annuitant or the death of the testator\u2019s son\u2019s widow, whichever should last happen, the trustees were to hold the trust estate, with all accumulations and additions, upon trust to distribute 67 per cent thereof to certain individuals and to pay and convey the residue (33%) unto the Royal Trust Company \u201cfor the creation and establishment of a trust to be known as the Burns Memorial Trust\u201d, which it was to administer, and the net annual income therefrom it was to distribute annually in equal shares among The Father Lacombe Home at Midnapore, the Branch of the Salvation Army having its headquarters at Calgary, and three other objects which, after the testator\u2019s death, were settled, by schemes approved by an order of court, to be: a fund to be administered by the City of Calgary for the benefit of poor, indigent and neglected children; a fund to be administered for the benefit of widows and orphans of members of the Police Force (in one case) and of the Fire Brigade (in the other case) of Calgary. The testator died in 1937. Annuitants and said widow were alive in the years now in question. In each of the years 1938, 1939, 1940 and 1941, of the total net income of the estate, 60 per cent thereof was paid to said nephews and nieces and the remaining 40 per cent was transferred by book entry by the executors from the estate income account into the estate capital account; the executors made no segregation or allocation of said 40 per cent of the net income as between the individuals entitled ultimately to 67 per cent thereof under said clause 36 of the will and the Royal Trust Company to which was to be paid and conveyed eventually the remaining 33 per cent thereof under said clause 36. The question was whether said 33 per cent of 40 per cent of the net income of the estate in each of the years 1938, 1939, 1940 and 1941 was subject to income tax.\nHeld (varying the judgment of Cameron D.J. in the Exchequer Court, [1946] Ex. C.R. 229): The income in question was taxable in the hands of the executors except two-fifths of the income (the proportion from which the Father Lacombe Home and the Salvation Army are ultimately to receive the income) for the years 1938 and 1939. (Rand and Estey JJ. dissented in part, holding that no part of the income in question was taxable except the income (the whole of it) for the year 1941.)\nPer the Chief Justice, Kerwin and Hudson JJ. (the majority of the court): Assuming that the five beneficiaries of the trust to be administered by the Royal Trust Company are charitable institutions within s. 4(e) of the Act, that does not give a right of exemption from taxation in respect to the income now in question, as that income is not the income of any of them; they are not to receive it at any time but only the income on the capitalized sums from said company; the income now in question is not income to them at all within the scope of the Act, particularly s. 3, and is not \u201cincome accruing to the credit of the taxpayer\u201d within s. 11(1). As to the Burns Memorial Trust, that is merely the name for a fund to be administered by said company; and said company is only a trustee; the income in question does not belong to it beneficially and it is not a charitable organization.\nAs to the Father Lacombe Home and the Salvation Army, the income in question is not \u201caccumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons\u201d within s. 11(2) of the Act. Those conducting the work of said institutions are bodies corporate and politic, included in \u201cperson\u201d as? defined by s. 2(h) of the Act, and they are ascertained; they are not trustees in any sense; each organization uses its funds generally to help the poor and afflicted but the income in question is accumulating in trust for their benefit (to the extent of their shares) and not for those under their care.\nAs to the three other institutions which are to receive shares of the income from the Burns Memorial Trust, the income in question is \u201caccumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons\u201d within said s. 11(2); those three institutions are merely trustees to apply the gifts for the benefit of other persons, who are \u201cunascertained\u201d; while the income in question is not income of such last-mentioned persons, it is income accumulating in trust for their benefit, since they are entitled to a share of the income thereon. As to the years 1940 and 1941, s. 11(4)(a), as enacted in 1940, c. 34, \u201cincome received by an estate or trust and capitalized shall be taxable in the hands of the executors * * *\u201d applies. It is a true charging provision, not requiring the aid of s. 11(4)(c) enacted in 1941 (c. 18), which was added ex abundanti cautela. (Respondent did not contend for application of the former s. 11(4) as it stood in 1938 and 1939.)\nIn the result, two-fifths of the income in question (the proportion from which the Father Lacombe Home and the Salvation Army are ultimately entitled to the interest thereon) for the years 1938 and 1939 (only) is free from taxation.\nPer Rand J. (dissenting in part): Under the direction in the will to accumulate and capitalize the portion of the net income intended for the five charities and, at the time provided, to pay over the whole of the capital, including the added increments, to the trustees of the Burns Memorial Trust to hold in perpetuity and to distribute the annual income, the accumulations never belong to nor come into possession of the charities; they represent solely the growth of the capital which ultimately becomes the principal from which the income benefits to the charities arise. Therefore the accumulations are not income of charitable institutions within s. 4(e) of the Act; nor are they \u201cincome accruing to the credit of the taxpayer\u201d within s. 11(1). And they are not \u201cincome accumulating in trust for the benefit of\u201d unascertained persons, etc., within s. 11(2); the benefit contemplated by s. 11(2) is that the accumulation, when completed, passes in its entirety to the persons entitled; and while, in the present case, in a sense the accumulations are for the \u201cbenefit\u201d of the charities in the future increased income from increased capital, the word cannot be extended to that indirect and remote advantage. S. 11(4) seems to be designed to meet precisely the present case, that of capitalization of accumulating income; but the charging language thereof, as applicable prior to 1941, was inadequate for operation of the provision; but the addition of s. 11(4)(c) in 1941 made adequate the charging language and thus s. 11(4) was effective to make taxable in the hands of the executors so much of the income in question as was received by them in 1941.\nPer Estey J. (dissenting in part): Neither the Royal Trust Company nor the \u201cBurns Memorial Trust\u201d is a charitable institution within the meaning of s. 4(e) of the Act. Moreover, even if the \u201cBurns Memorial Trust\u201d could be said to be an \u201cinstitution\u201d, yet the income as income is never paid to or received by it; that trust is not created until the residue of the testator\u2019s estate is distributed in the future, when the fund will be paid as capital, not as income, to said company to create the \u201cBurns Memorial Trust\u201d. On the same basis, that as the income in question is never received as income by any of the five beneficiaries, it cannot be said that it is the income of them. Nor is it \u201cincome accruing to the credit of the taxpayer\u201d within s. 11(1); as income it is never paid or intended to be paid to the Royal Trust Company, the \u201cBurns Memorial Trust\u201d or the five beneficiaries; it is year by year added to and made part of the testator\u2019s trust estate and at time of distribution it is to be paid to said company as capital to be used to create the fund from which the beneficiaries will receive the only income receivable by them. On similar considerations (and bearing in mind the definition of \u201cincome\u201d in s. 3(1)), the income in question is not \u201cincome accumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons or of persons with contingent interests\u201d within s. 11(2) (Minister of National Revenue v. Trusts and Guarantee Co., [1940] A.C. 138, distinguished). S. 11 (4)(a) of the Act (\u201cIncome received by an estate or trust and capitalized shall be taxable in the hands of the executors\u201d, etc.) as enacted in 1940 lacked words essential to the imposition of a tax; but under said s. 11(4)(a) along with s. 11(4)(c) (enacted in and applicable to 1941), the executors were liable for tax for 1941.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of His Honour Judge Cameron, Deputy Judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], dismissing an appeal from the decision of the Minister of National Revenue affirming the assessments made upon the appellants, the executors of the will of the Honourable Patrick Burns, late of Calgary, Alberta, deceased, for income tax under the Income War Tax Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 97, and amendments thereto) in respect of the years 1938, 1939, 1940 and 1941. Other parties were added as appellants in the Exchequer Court, namely, the Royal Trust Company (named in the will of the said deceased as Trustee for Burns Memorial Trust), the Father Lacombe Home at Midnapore, the Governing Council of the Salvation Army Canada West, and the respective Trustees of three funds to be administered for benefits provided for in the will of the said deceased.\nThe material facts and questions in issue sufficiently appear in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported and in the reasons for judgment in the Exchequer Court (above cited), and are indicated in the above headnote.\nG. H. Steer, K.C. and E. J. Chambers, K.C. for the appellants.\nH. W. Riley and J. G. McEntyre for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin and Hudson JJ. (the majority of the Court) was delivered by\nKerwin, J.\u2014The executors of the will of the Honourable Patrick Burns and other parties added in the Exchequer Court appeal from a judgment of that Court dismissing an appeal from the decision of the Minister of National Revenue, confirming the assessments to income tax made upon the executors in respect of the years 1938, 1939, 1940 and 1941, under the provisions of the Income War Tax Act. The testator died February 24, 1937, having made his last will and testament and a codicil thereto, probate of which was duly granted. It is unnecessary to refer to the codicil or to set forth all the provisions of the will or the agreements made with the widow of the testator\u2019s son. Suffice it to say that, taken in conjunction with certain orders made by the Courts of the Province of Alberta where the testator was domiciled, the Executors, in the events that have transpired, were directed to act as follows, and proceeded accordingly in the administration of the large estate left by the deceased.\nAfter payment of specific legacies, the executors, referred to as \u201cmy Trustees\u201d, were to hold the balance of the estate, referred to as \u201cmy Trust Estate\u201d, in trust to pay certain annuities and (paragraph 35)\nto appropriate sufficient of the same or of the investments thereof to insure an annual income therefrom sufficient to pay and discharge the Annuities then outstanding and hereinbefore given and bequeathed by this my Will, and to hold \u201cmy Trust Estate,\u201d including the accumulations thereof and the additions thereto by reason of the deaths of Annuitants or otherwise until the death of the last of the Annuitants to whom I have bequeathed Annuities by this my Will or the death of the widow of my said son, Patrick Thomas Michael Burns, whichever shall last happen and * * * upon further trust to pay:\nnamed nephews and nieces a total of 60 per cent of the net annual income. Upon the death of the last of the annuitants or of the son\u2019s widow, the trustees were (paragraph 36) to stand possessed of \u201c\u2018my Trust Estate\u2019 with all accumulations thereof and additions thereto and the whole thereof to hold upon further trust to distribute\u201d 67 per cent thereof among named nephews and nieces\nAnd upon the further trust to pay and convey the rest, residue and remainder of \u201cmy Trust Estate\u201d unto The Royal Trust Company for the creation and establishment of a Trust to be known as the \u201cBurns Memorial Trust\u201d to be administered by it as Trustee at its office in the City of Calgary, in the Province of Alberta, and the net annual income therefrom to pay and distribute annually in equal shares thereof amongst the following: (1) The Father Lacombe Home at Midnapore in the Province of Alberta.\n(2) The Branch of the Salvation Army, having its headquarters at the City of Calgary, in the Province of Alberta.\n(3) The Children\u2019s Shelter carried on under the auspices of the said City of Calgary * * *\n(4) To the Fund established for the benefit of Widows and Orphans of Members of the Police Force of the City of Calgary * * *\n(5) To the Fund established for the benefit of Widows and Orphans of Members of the Fire Brigade of the City of Calgary, * * *\nThe residue to be conveyed to the Royal Trust Company for the purposes mentioned thus represents 33 per cent of 40 per cent of the income of \u201cmy Trust Estate\u201d.\nIn each of the years 1938 to 1941 inclusive, the annuities and the sums due the widow of the testator\u2019s son under the agreements with her were paid and 60 per cent of the total net income of the estate was paid to the nephews and nieces entitled thereto, and the remaining 40 per cent of the net income was transferred by book entry by the trustees from the Estate Income Account into the Estate Capital Account. The trustees made no segregation or allocation of this 40 per cent of the net income as between the individuals entitled ultimately to 67 per cent thereof under paragraph 36 and the Royal Trust Company to which is to be paid and conveyed eventually the remaining 33 per cent.\nThe trustees filed income tax returns for each of the years 1938 to 1941 inclusive, but the Department disallowed for each year a certain sum claimed by the trustees as deductible from the taxable income. Each deduction represented 33 per cent of 40 per cent of the net income of the estate for that year. These amounts are claimed as proper deductions by the estate and by the added parties, who are the Royal Trust Company, the Lacombe Home, the Governing Council of the Salvation Army Canada West, and the trustees of the three Calgary funds. The basis of the claim is that even if these amounts are taxable under certain provisions of the Income War Tax Act (which is denied), they have accrued to the credit of an ascertained beneficiary or ascertained beneficiaries which are charitable institutions and are, therefore, exempt under section 4(e) of the Act:\n(e) The income of any religious, charitable, agricultural and educational institution, board of trade and chamber of commerce, no part of the income of which inures to the personal profit of, or is paid or payable to any proprietor thereof or shareholder therein;\nIt should be stated that by an order of the Supreme Court of Alberta, dated December 11, 1939, the gifts of income to the Lacombe Home, the Salvation Army, the Children\u2019s Shelter, the Fund established for the benefit of Widows and Orphans of Members of the Police Force of the City of Calgary, and the Fund established for the benefit of the Widows and Orphans of Members of the Fire Brigade of the City of Calgary were declared to be good and valid charitable bequests. By the same order, after reciting that it appeared that there was no institution existing in Calgary known and administered as a Children\u2019s Shelter or carried on under the auspices of the City, that no fund had been established for the benefit of widows and orphans of Members of the Police Force of the said City, and that no fund had been established for the benefit of the widows and orphans of Members of the Fire Brigade of the said City, schemes were approved for the setting-up and administration of funds for \u201cThe Trustees for Poor, Indigent and Neglected Children of the City of Calgary\u201d, \u201cThe Trustees for Widows and Orphans of the Police Force of the City of Calgary\u201d and \u201cThe Trustees for Widows and Orphans of the Fire Brigade of the City of Calgary\u201d, and provision was made in each scheme for the appointment of trustees for the several purposes.\nAccording to the evidence, the Lacombe Home is conducted as part of the charitable work carried on by Les Soeurs de Charit\u00e9 de la Providence, and the work of the Salvation Army in Calgary falls under the jurisdiction of the Governing Council of the Salvation Army Canada West. They are religious or charitable organizations and, for the purposes of this present discussion, I will assume that the other three funds mentioned in the will and for which trustees were set-up by the schemes approved by the order are also charitable organizations within the meaning of section 4(e) of the Act as expounded by the Privy Council in the Birtwistle case, Minister of National Revenue v. Trusts and Guarantee Co.[2]. The difficulty in the appellants\u2019 way in seeking exemption under this clause is that the income in question is not the income of any of these bodies. They are not to receive it at any time from any one, but only the income on the capitalized sums from the Royal Trust Company. It is not income to them at all within the scope of the Act, particularly section 3, and is not \u201cincome accruing to the credit of the taxpayer\u201d within subsection 1 of section 11:\nThe income, for any taxation period, of a beneficiary of any estate or trust of whatsoever nature shall be deemed to include all income accruing to the credit of the taxpayer whether received by him or not during such taxation period.\nMr. Steer argued that, as by paragraph 35 of the will the trustees were to \u201cappropriate\u201d sufficient of \u201cmy Trust Estate\u201d to insure an annual income sufficient to pay the annuities, it should be taken in equity as having been done, leaving the balance of the annual income to be divided 60 per cent and 40 per cent; and that, therefore, the 40 per cent was vested,\u2014as to 67 per cent thereof in the named beneficiaries, and as to 33 per cent in the five bodies mentioned above or, in the alternative, in the Burns Memorial Trust. As to the five bodies, the mere fact of charities being entitled to income does not give them the right to demand payment of the corpus, Halifax School for the Blind v. Chipman[3]. As to the Burns Memorial Trust, I agree with the trial judge that it is merely a name for a fund to be administered by the Royal Trust Company and that Company is nothing more than a trustee as was the Council of Colne in the Birtwistle case[4]. The income in question does not belong to it beneficially and, like the Council of Colne, it is not a charitable organization.\nThe claim for exemption therefore fails, but it is still necessary for the respondent to show that the estate is taxable in respect of the income in question. He seeks, first of all, to hold the trustees taxable under subsection 2 of section 11:\nIncome accumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons, or of persons with contingent interests shall be taxable in the hands of the trustee or other like person acting in a fiduciary capacity, as if such income were the income of a person other than a corporation; provided that he shall not be entitled to the exemptions provided by paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and (i) of subsection one of section five of this Act, and provided further that should more than one such trust be created, substantially all the assets of which are received from one person (whether or not administered by the same or different trustees) and be so conditioned as to fall in ultimately in favour of one beneficiary, class or group of beneficiaries, then the income of the several trusts shall be taxed as one trust in the hands of such one of the trustees as the Minister may determine.\non the ground that the income is \u201caccumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons.\u201d In the Birtwistle case[5], the Privy Council held\nthe subsection applies in every case where income is being accumulated in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons whether those persons will or will not ultimately take a vested interest in such income, and whether they will or will not ever become entitled to specific portions of it. In the present case the accumulated interest in the hands of the respondents as trustees will in the year 1948 have to be handed over to the Municipal Council of Colne as trustees in trust to be applied for the benefit of the aged and deserving poor of that town. Such aged and deserving poor are without any question persons, and equally without question they are unascertained. The case, therefore, seems to fall within the very words of the subsection.\nThe trial judge was of opinion that the Lacombe Home and the Salvation Army were \u201cunascertained persons\u201d, but I am unable to agree. Les Soeurs de Charit\u00e9 de la Providence and the Salvation Army are bodies corporate and politic, as mentioned in section 2(h) of the Act:\n(h) \u201cperson\u201d includes any body corporate and politic and any association or other body, and the heirs, executors, administrators and curators or other legal representatives of such person, according to the law of that part of Canada to which the context extends ;\nand they are ascertained. I quite agree that the interposition of trustees between executors and ultimate beneficiaries cannot avoid the liability to taxation under subsection 2 of section 11, as this .was distinctly held in the Birtwistle case (1), but the Lacombe Home and the Salvation Army are not trustees in any sense. Each organization uses its funds generally to help the poor and afflicted, but the income under discussion is accumulating in trust for their benefit and not for the ones under their care. It is true that in the Birtwistle case (1), the accumulated income was to be handed over by the Trust and Guarantee Company to the Municipal Council to be used by the latter for the benefit of aged and deserving poor of Colne, while here the Royal Trust Company is to hand over merely a share of the income on the income in dispute to the two bodies. The income is still accumulated in trust for their benefit to the extent of their shares.\nI agree, however, that the income is accumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons so far as the gifts of income thereon to the other three funds are concerned. The trustees of each of these funds are merely trustees to apply the gifts, according to the approved schemes, for the benefit of (a) poor, indigent and neglected children, (b) widows and orphans of members of the Calgary Police Force, (c) widows and orphans of members of the Calgary Fire Brigade. Such trusts fall clearly within the decision in the Birtwistle case[6], and the judgment of this Court in Cosman\u2019s Trustees v. Minister of National Revenue[7]. While it is not their income, it is income accumulating in trust for their benefit, since they are entitled to a share of the income thereon.\nThe respondent then contents that subsection 4 of section 11 applies to the income for 1940 and 1941. From 1934 to 1940 this subsection read:\nDividends received by an estate or trust and capitalized shall be taxable income of the estate or trust.\nCounsel for the respondent, before the trial judge and before this Court, did not attempt to succeed on this point for the years 1938 and 1939 under this wording of the subsection, so that we are free from the responsibility of construing it and of considering whether, to the extent that dividends may have entered into the income of \u201cmy Trust Estate\u201d, part of the 33 per cent of 40 per cent of the income for the years 1938 and 1939 are taxable. However, by chapter 34 of the 1940 Statutes, the above subsection 4 was repealed and the following enacted in lieu thereof and made applicable to income of the 1940 taxation period and fiscal periods ending therein and to all subsequent periods:\n4. (a) Income received by an estate or trust and capitalized shall be taxable in the hands of the executors or trustees, or other like persons acting in a fiduciary capacity.\n(b) Income earned during the life of any person shall, when received after the death of such person by his executors, trustees or other like persons acting in a fiduciary capacity, be taxable in the hands of such fiduciary.\nMr. Steer contended that this was not a true charging subsection, as no provision was made as to the appropriate rates of taxation, and he pointed out that it was only in 1941, by section 19 of chapter 18, that paragraph (c) was added:\n(c) Income taxable under the provisions of this subsection shall be taxed as if such income were the income of a person other than a corporation, provided that no deduction shall be allowed in respect of the exemptions provided by paragraphs (c), (d), (e), (ee) and (i) of subsection one of section five of this Act.\nIn my view this clause was added ex abundanti cautela. In Holden v. Minister of National Revenue[8], the Privy Council decided that subsection 2 of section 11 as it then stood was a valid charging provision. It is true that the words \u201cas if such income were the income of an unmarried person\u201d appeared therein, but I have no doubt that no other conclusion would be arrived at under the present wording of that subsection, \u201cas if such income were the income of a person other than a corporation\u201d, since their Lordships had no difficulty in deciding as they did, although there was nothing to indicate that the unmarried person was to be a person who was not a householder and without dependents. Clause (a) of subsection 4 being a true charging provision, its terms are too clear to admit of any doubt that where, as here, income is received by an estate and capitalized it is taxable in the hands of the trustees.\nIt is contended in the respondent\u2019s factum, but was not argued, that the definition of \u201cperson\u201d in section 2(h) is wide enough to include executors and trustees and that, therefore, income accumulating in trust in the hands of trustees and capitalized can be taxed under section 9. This argument misconceives the meaning of section 2(h) and the whole tenor of the Act. \u201cPerson\u201d is stated to include the heirs, executors, administrators and curators or other legal representatives of such person, but this has no bearing upon the question of taxation of post mortem income accumulated in trust by executors, administrators, or other legal representatives, including trustees. If such income is not caught by section 11, it is not covered.\nThe income for the years 1940 and 1941, from which the Lacombe Home and the Salvation Army would receive two-fifths of the income thereof in due course is, therefore, covered by subsection 4 of section 11, leaving only two-fifths of the income for the years 1938 and 1939 from which these institutions are ultimately to receive the income, free from taxation. The appellants have succeeded in part. They should receive one-half of their costs of the appeal to this Court and there should be no costs in the Exchequer Court.\nRand J.\u2014The controlling fact in this controversy is the direction to accumulate and to capitalize until the death of the annuitants the portion of the net income intended for the five charities. At that time, the whole of the capital, including the added increments, is to be paid over to the trustee of the Burns Memorial Fund to hold in perpetuity and to distribute the annual income among those entitled. Under that provision, the accumulations never belong to nor come into the possession of the charities: they represent solely the growth of the capital which ultimately becomes the principal from which the income benefits to the charities arise.\nFor that reason I think it impossible to say that the accumulations are the income of charitable institutions, and they are not then within the exemption of section 4(e) of the Income War Tax Act. Likewise, they are not income \u201caccruing to the credit of the taxpayer whether received by him or not during such taxation period\u201d within section 11(1).\nIn support of this view of \u201cincome\u201d to the ultimate beneficiary, the decision of Rowlatt J. in Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Blackwell[9] was cited; but Mr. Steer pointed out that the Court of Appeal, in dealing with this case[10], expressly abstained from passing on the rule laid down; and that in Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Pakenham[11], Rowlatt J. expresses doubts that his former view was sound. But there is an essential difference between the factual basis of the Blackwell decision and that here. There, the accumulated income would go ultimately to a beneficiary; and it was held that even if the interest of the son was vested, a postponement during minority of payment over would prevent the accumulations from being his \u201cincome\u201d. Here, as I have stated, the beneficiaries never become entitled to receive the annual increments in any form, and the purpose of accumulation is to capitalize them for a subsequent enjoyment of income from them only.\nAre they \u201cincome accumulating for the benefit of\u201d unascertained persons or of persons with contingent interests within section 11(2)? The plain meaning of that language is, I think, that the accumulation, when completed, passes in its entirety to the persons entitled: and that transmission is the benefit contemplated. Here in a sense the accumulations are for the \u201cbenefit\u201d of the charities in the future increased income from increased capital. But the word cannot, in my opinion, be extended to that indirect and remote advantage. If it were, the subsection would be duplicated, in respect of capitalization of income for unascertained persons or for contingent interests, by subsection 4 unless it is said, as I think it impossible to say, that subsection 4 does not apply to capitalization when such persons or interests are involved. It would seem, moreover, to be contradictory to say that these annual increments are not income either under 4(e) or 11(1) because they never reach the beneficiaries and yet to treat their accumulation as \u201cincome\u201d of the same beneficiaries under 11(2). To do that would be to distinguished between \u201cincome of\u201d a beneficiary and \u201cincome accumulating for the benefit of\u201d a beneficiary. They are not therefore, \u201cfor the benefit of\u201d these charities whatever may be the latter\u2019s interest in them. There remains subsection 4, and this seems to me to be designed to meet precisely the case we have here, that of capitalization of accumulating income. Subsections 1 and 2 of the section distribute the cases of income to ascertained or unascertained persons with vested or contingent interests, which at some stage passes to them as income; subsection 4 deals with the capitalization of income regardless of its ultimate destination.\nThe difficulty, however, facing the respondent is that of the adequacy of the charging language. Paragraph (a) was enacted in 1940 and paragraph (c) only in 1941, and the question is whether under (a) alone the charge is sufficiently provided. The paragraph is as follows:\nIncome received by an estate or trust and capitalized shall be taxable in the hands of the executors or trustees, or other like persons acting in a fiduciary capacity.\nOn what basis is that taxation to be calculated? Is an \u201cestate or trust\u201d to be a person or a corporation, and in either case what, if any, exemptions are to be allowed? Subsection 2 cannot be resorted to because it deals with different subject matter and conditions, to which it is limited, and there is no other section that can be called in aid. In the presence in the Act of several scales of taxation, how can we find in that initial provision a guide to the measure of charge which the legislation intends? I think the provision incomplete, it is casus omissus, and, for the years in question up to and including 1940, inoperative. For the year 1941, however, it is applicable to the income in question. I would, therefore, allow the appeal and reduce the assessments of income for 1938, 1939 and 1940 by the amounts so accumulated respectively. The 1941 assessment on these items should be made under subsection 4 of section 11. The appellant should recover three-quarters of the costs in both courts.\nEstey J.\u2014The appellants are the executors of the will of the Honourable Patrick Burns, who died February 24, 1937. Their contention is that the Minister of National Revenue was in error in disallowing certain deductions (on the basis that the items of income deducted were nontaxable) made by them in the income tax returns filed in this estate for the years 1938, 1939, 1940 and 1941. The Minister\u2019s disallowance was upheld in the Exchequer Court.\nAfter directing certain specific devises and bequests the will provides for the conversion into money of the residue from which funeral, testamentary and other specified expenses should be paid, and then\nmy Trustees shall stand possessed of the balance of the said rest, residue and remainder * * * with the income and accumulations thereof herein referred to as \u201cmy Trust Estate\u201d upon further trust to invest * * * and out of the net annual income therefrom and from all parts of \u201cmy Trust Estate\u201d, to pay annually\ncertain annuities. After payment of these annuities, the will provides\nand to invest the surplus (if any) of such annual income in the names of my Trustees as part of the capital of \u201cmy Trust Estate\u201d at compound interest.\nThe will then directs\nmy Trustees to hold \u201cmy Trust Estate\u201d and to appropriate sufficient of the same or of the investments thereof to insure an annual income therefrom sufficient to pay and discharge the Annuities * * * and to hold \u201cmy Trust Estate\u201d, including the accumulations thereof and the additions thereto by reason of the deaths of Annuitants or otherwise until the death of the last of the Annuitants to whom I have bequeathed Annuities by this my Will or the death of the widow of my said son * * * whichever shall last happen,\nand during that period to pay from the net annual income to specified nephews and nieces 60 per cent of that income and\nto invest the surplus, if any, of such annual income in the names of my Trustees as part of the capital of \u201cmy Trust Estate\u201d at compound interest.\nThis surplus is the 40 per cent \u201cof the net income of the estate\u201d referred to in para. 9 (hereinafter quoted) of the Agreed Statement of Facts.\nThe will then provides that the residue of \u201cmy Trust Estate\u201d shall be distributed \u201cupon the death of the last of the annuitants to whom I have bequeathed annuities in this my will or the death of the widow of my said son, whichever last shall happen\u201d. This distribution shall be upon the basis of 67 per cent to specified beneficiaries, and 33 per cent thereof shall be paid and conveyed\nunto The Royal Trust Company for the creation and establishment of a Trust to be known as the \u201cBurns Memorial Trust\u201d to be administered by it as Trustee at its office in the City of Calgary, in the Province of Alberta, and the net annual income therefrom to pay and distribute annually in equal shares thereof amongst the following:\n(1) The Father Lacombe Home at Midnapore in the Province of Alberta.\n(2) The Branch of the Salvation Army, having its headquarters at the City of Calgary, in the Province of Alberta.\n(3) The Children\u2019s Shelter carried on under the auspices of the said City of Calgary, towards which I have bequeathed Fifty (50) 4% non-voting, non-cumulative, redeemable Preference Shares in the Capital Stock of Burns Foundation (Limited) by this my Will.\n(4) To the Fund established for the benefit of Widows and Orphans of Members of the Police Force of the City of Calgary, towards which I have bequeathed Fifty (50) 4% non-voting, non-cumulative, redeemable Preference Shares in the Capital Stock of Burns Foundation (Limited) by this my Will.\n(5) To the Fund established for the benefit of Widows and Orphans of Members of the Fire Brigade of the City of Calgary, towards which I have bequeathed Fifty (50) 4% non-voting, non-cumulative, redeemable Preference Shares in the Capital Stock of Burns Foundation (Limited) by this my Will,\nIn each year after all payments were made there was a surplus of income which has been invested in compliance with the terms of the will \u201cin the names of my Trustees as part of the capital of \u2018my Trust Estate\u2019 at compound interest\u201d. The surplus invested as capital has in each year increased the corpus of \u201cmy Trust Estate\u201d to be divided 67 per cent and 33 per cent as above indicated.\nAt the hearing before the Exchequer Court the parties filed an agreed statement of facts, para. 9 of which reads as follows:\n9. That the taxable income submitted by the Appellant, the taxable income as assessed by the Department, and the amount disallowed by the Department during the years 1938 to 1941 inclusive, are as follows:\nTaxable\nAmount\nIncome\nDisallowed by\nPer\nIncome Tax\nDepartment\nEstate\nDepartment\n1938 ...............\n$10,597 94\n$ 9,199\n$1,398 93\n1939 ...............\n11,656 57\n7,809 90\n3,846 67\n1940 ...............\n20,096 97\n14,382 57\n5,714 40\n1941 ...............\n26,775 24\n18,118 03\n8,657 21\n$69,126 72\n$49,509 51\n$19,617 21\nThe amounts disallowed by the Income Tax Department represent 33 per cent of 40 per cent of the net income of the estate. These amounts are claimed as proper deductions by the estate on the ground that they have accrued; to the credit of an ascertained beneficiary or ascertained beneficiaries which are charitable institutions. This view is not accepted by the Income Tax Department.\nThe issue here to be determined: is 33 per cent of the income realized from the investment of 40 per cent of the income\u2014being the surplus after paying in each year 60 per cent thereof to the nephews and nieces\u2014subject to income tax?\nIt is agreed that in each of the years 1938 to 1941 inclusive, 60 per cent of the net income was paid out to the specified nieces and nephews and the executors, by book entry, transferred the remaining 40 per cent from the estate income account into the estate capital account. The executors made no segregation or allocation of the net income from the said 40 per cent as between the individuals entitled to 67 per cent thereof and the parties entitled to the remaining 33 per cent thereof.\nThe appellants\u2019 contention is that income derived from the 33 per cent is not taxable because (a) the \u201cBurns Memorial Trust\u201d is a charitable institution and as such not taxable within the meaning of section 4(e), or alternatively, the income accrued to the credit of the Royal Trust Company, or in the alternative to the five named ascertained beneficiaries, or in the further alternative, to the Salvation Army and Lacombe Home, which are ascertained beneficiaries, and therefore, under section 11(1) the individual beneficiaries and not the executors are taxable with respect thereto.\nThe Crown on the other hand contends that neither section 4(e) nor 11(1) apply because the income in question was received by the executors and used by them to make certain payments and invest the surplus as part of the capital of \u201cmy Trust Estate\u201d. At the time of distribution 33 per cent of the residue of \u201cmy Trust Estate\u201d will be paid over to the Royal Trust Company not as income but as capital. The Royal Trust Company will receive it as capital and hold it in trust and pay the income therefrom to the specified charities. In other words, that neither the Royal Trust Company as trustee nor any of the beneficiaries will ever receive any portion of the amounts in question as income and therefore they cannot be taxed nor be granted an exemption with respect to income which they never received. Further, that the trustees are liable under section 11(2) in that the beneficiaries are unascertained and if not, then they are liable under section 9.\nSection 4(e) of the Income War Tax Act reads:\n4. The following incomes shall not be liable to taxation hereunder:\n(e) The income of any religious, charitable, agricultural and educational institution, board of trade and chamber of commerce, no part of the income of which inures to the personal profit of, or is paid or payable to any proprietor thereof or shareholder therein;\nThe money is paid to the Royal Trust Company\nfor the creation and establishment of a Trust to be known as the \u201cBurns Memorial Trust\u201d to be administered by it as Trustee at its office in the City of Calgary, in the Province of Alberta, and the net annual income therefrom to pay and distribute annually in equal shares thereof\namongst the five specified beneficiaries. It is not, nor could it be successfully, contended that the Royal Trust Company is a charitable institution within the meaning of section 4(e), but it is contended that the \u201cBurns Memorial Trust\u201d is a charitable institution.\nAn order made and issued out of the Supreme Court of Alberta under date of December 11, 1939, declared all of these gifts \u201cgood and valid charitable bequests\u201d. Such a declaration, however, does not conclude the issue. In order to be exempt under section 4(e), it must be \u201cthe income of any * * * charitable * * * institution\u201d. A somewhat similar question was dealt with in Minister of National Revenue v. Trusts and Guarantee Co.[12] where, speaking on behalf of the Privy Council, Lord Romer, at p. 149, stated:\nThat it is a charitable trust no one can doubt. But their Lordships are unable to agree that it is a charitable institution such as is contemplated by s. 4(e) of the Act. It is by no means easy to give a definition of the word \u201cinstitution\u201d that will cover every use of it. Its meaning must always depend upon the context in which it is found. It seems plain, for instance, from the context in which it is found in the sub-section in question that the word is intended to connote something more than a mere trust. Had the Dominion Legislature intended to exempt from taxation the income of every charitable trust, nothing would have been easier than to say so. In view of the language that has in fact been used, it seems to their Lordships that the charitable institutions exempted are those which are institutions in the sense in which boards of trade and chambers of commerce are institutions, such, for example, as a charity organization society, or a society for the prevention of cruelty to children. The trust with which the present appeal is concerned is an ordinary trust for charity. It can only be regarded as a charitable institution within the meaning of the sub-section if every such trust is to be so regarded, and this, in their Lordships\u2019 opinion, is impossible. An ordinary trust for charity is, indeed, only a charitable institution in the sense that a farm is an agricultural institution. It is not in that sense that the word institution is used in the sub-section.\nThe appellants submit the discussion of the word \u201cinstitution\u201d in Mayor of Manchester v. McAdam[13], where, at p. 511, Lord Macnaghten, after pointing out that \u201cinstitution\u201d is \u201ca little difficult to define\u201d, continues:\nIt is the body (so to speak) called into existence to translate the purpose as conceived in the mind of the founders into a living and active principle.\nThey contended that the testator had two purposes in mind, (1) to benefit the five named beneficiaries and (2) to perpetuate the name of the benefactor. They contend that the phrase \u201cBurns Memorial Trust\u201d gives to the trust \u201cthe perpetual memorial idea\u201d, and, this provides what Lord Romer requires by his words \u201csomething more than a mere trust\u201d and therefore the \u201cBurns Memorial Trust\u201d is a charitable institution. This phrase perpetuates the name of the benefactor in association with this trust, but does not make it a perpetual charitable trust. If the words \u201cto be known as the \u2018Burns Memorial Trust\u201d are deleted from para. 36 of the will, which provides for this trust, neither the permanency of the trust, the management and disposition thereof, nor the position of the beneficiaries would be in any way affected. It is a perpetual charitable trust upon the construction of the will quite apart from these words under the authority of The Halifax School for the Blind v. Lewis Chipman[14]\nFurther, all the work in connection with this fund is to be performed by the Royal Trust Company as trustee. That company receives from the trustees the fund \u201cfor the creation and establishment of a Trust to be known as the \u2018Burns Memorial Trust\u2019 to be administered by it as Trustee\u201d and \u201cto pay and distribute annually\u201d the income amongst the five beneficiaries. It is a perpetual charitable trust fund, the income from which is used for charitable purposes through the medium of the five beneficiaries. There is nothing to be performed in connection with this trust by the \u201cBurns Memorial Trust\u201d, nor is there a body or entity which could be described as an institution styled the \u201cBurns Memorial Trust\u201d.\nUnder both of the foregoing discussions of the word \u201cinstitution\u201d there is contemplated a body or entity functioning to attain some charitable purpose. Moreover, the will creating this perpetual charitable trust not only does not contemplate that the \u201cBurns Memorial Trust\u201d will be such an institution, but specifically states that the trust is to be \u201cknown as the \u2018Burns Memoral Trust\u2019\u201d.\nIndeed, from all its relevant provisions, the will indicates that the testator, in using this phrase, intended to give to the trust a name that would embody a memoir of its founder. In its legal significance it is but the name of the trust, and I am therefore in agreement with the conclusion of the learned Judge of the Exchequer Court that these words are \u201ca name attached to a fund\u201d and that under this will the \u201cBurns Memorial Trust\u201d is not an institution as contended by the appellants.\nThe appellants further submit that the situation here created is identical with that which would have existed had the testator provided for the creation of a \u201cBurns Memorial Corporation\u201d or a \u201cBurns Memorial Trust Corporation\u201d with general charitable objects and then have directed that this money should be paid to that Corporation for charitable purposes. If a corporation so constituted could, upon an examination of its nature and purpose, be held a charitable institution, the conclusion suggested by the appellant might follow. That would be a situation entirely different from that which here obtains where a capital sum of money is given to a corporation that is not a charitable institution to create and administer a trust fund to be known as the \u201cBurns Memorial Trust\u201d.\nMoreover, and quite apart from the foregoing, because this income is received and applied by the executors as above indicated, even if the \u201cBurns Memorial Trust\u201d could be construed as an institution, there still remains the fact that the income as income is never paid to or received by the \u201cBurns Memorial Trust\u201d. That trust will not be created until the residue of \u201cmy Trust Estate\u201d is distributed some time in the future. At that time the fund will be paid as capital, not as income, to the Royal Trust Company to create the trust known as the \u201cBurns Memorial Trust\u201d. It therefore cannot be construed as \u201cthe income of any * * * charitable * * * institution\u201d within the meaning of section 4(e) and is not entitled to the benefit of the exemption therein provided for.\nOn the same basis, that as income it is never received by any of the beneficiaries, the appellants\u2019 submission that the income is that of the five named beneficiaries cannot be supported.\nThen with respect to the appellants\u2019 contention that the executors are not taxable because the income here is \u201cincome accruing to the credit of the taxpayer whether received by him or not during such taxation period\u201d:\n11. (1) The income, for any taxation period, of a beneficiary of any estate or trust of whatsoever nature shall be deemed to include all income accruing to the credit of the taxpayer whether received by him or not during such taxation period.\nIt is not contended that the income is year by year received by the Royal Trust Company or the \u201cBurns Memorial Trust\u201d or the five beneficiaries, but that it is \u201cincome accruing to the credit of\u201d either the Royal Trust Company or the \u201cBurns Memorial Trust\u201d or the five beneficiaries within the meaning of section 11(1).\nIn order to come within the terms of this section it must be \u201cincome accruing to the credit of the taxpayer\u201d. As income it is never paid, nor is it intended that it should ever be paid, to the Royal Trust Company, the \u201cBurns Memorial Trust\u201d or the five beneficiaries. It is year by year added to and made part of \u201cmy Trust Estate\u201d and at the time of distribution thereof it is paid to the Royal Trust Company as capital to be retained and used by it to create a perpetual trust fund (\u201cBurns Memorial Trust\u201d). It is only after the creation of this trust fund that the beneficiaries will receive income which this capital fund will earn and that is the only income that, under the terms of the will, these beneficiaries will receive. A somewhat similar provision came before the Privy Council in St. Lucia Usines and Estates Co. v. St. Lucia (Colonial Treasurer)[15], where Lord Wrenbury at p. 512, speaking on behalf of the Privy Council, stated:\nThe words \u201cincome arising or accruing\u201d are not equivalent to the words \u201cDebts arising or accruing\u201d. To give them that meaning is to ignore the word \u201cincome\u201d. The words mean \u201cmoney arising or accruing by way of income\u201d. There must be a coming in to satisfy the word \u201cincome\u201d. This is a sense which is assisted or confirmed by the word \u201creceived\u201d in the proviso at the end of s. 4, sub-section 1.\nTheir Lordships pointed out that \u201cit does not follow that income is confined to that which the taxpayer actually receives\u201d, and illustrated this statement by reference to deduction of income at the source and as it is arrived at by business men and others in the preparation of their balance sheets and profit and loss accounts.\nMoreover, the view expressed by Lord Wrenbury in the St. Lucia case15 appears particularly applicable because of the definition of \u201cincome\u201d in section 3 (1) of the Income War Tax Act:\n3. (1) For the purposes of this Act, \u201cincome\u201d means the annual net profit or gain or gratuity, whether ascertained and capable of computation as being wages, salary,, or other fixed amount, or unascertained as being fees or emoluments, or as being profits from a trade or commercial or financial or other business or calling, directly or indirectly received by a person from * * *\nThis definition makes it clear that the income must be \u201cdirectly or indirectly received\u201d, and with respect to cases coming under section 11(1) it is there provided \u201cwhether received by him or not during such taxation period\u201d. This is further emphasized by Mr. Justice Newcombe in In re McLeod v. The Minister of Customs and Excise[16]:\nIf the income be accruing to the credit of an ascertained person who is the beneficiary of an estate or trust, the taxation of it is provided for by the first sentence of the section; but, whatever may be the meaning of \u201ctaxpayer\u201d in the context, income which by the terms of the trust he may never receive cannot be said to be accruing to his credit, and therefore such income is not that of the testator\u2019s children or grandchildren within the intent of that clause.\nThis income is never received by any of the foregoing beneficiaries within the meaning of section 11(1) and cannot therefore be \u201cincome accruing to the credit\u201d of any of them under that section. The first of the respondent\u2019s contentions is that this income is received by the trustee and is \u201caccumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons\u201d and therefore the appellants are taxable under section 11(2).\n11. (2) Income accumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons, or of persons with contingent interests shall be taxable in the hands of the trustee or other like person acting in a fiduciary capacity, as if such income were the income of a person other than a corporation; * * *\nThe express provisions of section 3(1) defining \u201cincome\u201d for the purpose of this Act are clearly applicable to both subsections (1) and (2) of section 11, more particularly as there is no effort to otherwise define that word in section 11. In 11(2) it is the income \u201caccumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons, or of persons with contingent interests\u201d that is dealt with. Therefore, the income which is here accumulating must some time be \u201cdirectly or indirectly received\u201d as income in order to come within the definition of section 3(1). Without repeating the considerations already mentioned, it is abundantly clear that no part of the trust fund, or specifically that part of it that the respondent seeks to tax, is income that will ever be received as such by the beneficiaries who it is now contended are unascertained persons. It will never reach them as either income or capital. It will be added to \u201cmy Trust Estate\u201d, a part of which will be the capital of the perpetual charitable trust provided for and only a share of the income from that trust will the beneficiaries ultimately receive.\nThat the funds we are here concerned with will create a perpetual charitable trust, the principal of which will remain always intact and only the income therefrom will ever be received by a beneficiary, distinguishes this case from Minister of National Revenue v. Trusts and Guarantee Co.[17], where Lord Romer, speaking on behalf of the Privy Council, stated at p. 148:\nIn the present case the accumulated interest in the hands of the respondents as trustees will in the year 1948 have to be handed over to the municipal council of Colne as trustees in trust to be applied for the benefit of the aged and deserving poor of that town. Such aged and deserving poor are without any question persons, and equally without question they are unascertained. In that case the income was \u201caccumulating in trust for the benefit of unascertained persons\u201d and at a specified time was \u201cto be applied for the benefit of the aged and deserving poor\u201d. Ultimately these unascertained persons received the income there in question and that is a requisite if income as defined in 3(1) is to be taxed under section 11(2). Under the Burns will, as already pointed out, the income sought to be taxed will never be \u201cdirectly or indirectly received\u201d by any person or persons unascertained or otherwise. It cannot, therefore, be taxed under section 11(2).\nIn 1940, Parliament amended section 11 by repealing subsection 4(a) and inserting a new 4(a) reading as follows:\n11. (4) (a) Income received by an estate or trust and capitalized shall be taxable in the hands of the executors or trustees, or other like persons acting in a fiduciary capacity.\nSection 11 is a charging section: Holden v. Minister of National Revenue[18]. When in section 11(2) Parliament imposed a new tax it specified the rate. The tax there imposed was upon \u201cincome accumulating in trust for the benefit of * * *\u201d, while section 11(4) (a) deals with \u201cincome received by an estate or trust and capitalized\u201d, which is different in character and may be quite different in result. Nor do I find any words which indicate an intention either that the rate specified in 11(2) be made applicable to both subsections, or to adopt any other rate specified in the statute. Without a rate or determinable amount there can be no impost. A tax is defined as \u201can impost; a tribute imposed on the subject\u201d: Wharton\u2019s Law Lexicon, 14th Ed., 978. Therefore in the enactment of this subsection 4(a) a factor essential to the imposition of a tax is omitted and the result is that no tax is imposed.\nParliament in the following year, 1940-41, S. C., c. 18, s. 19, added section 11(4) (c):\n(c) Income taxable under the provisions of this subsection shall be taxed as if such income were the income of a person other than a corporation, provided that no deduction shall be allowed in respect of the exemptions provided by paragraphs (c), (d), (e), (ee) and (i) of subsection one of section five of this Act. and by section 32 of the same Act this provision was made applicable to the income of the 1941 taxation period:\n32. Sections one, two, four, five, six, seven, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, seventeen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-four, twenty-five and twenty-six of this Act shall be applicable to income of the 1941 taxation period and fiscal periods ending therein and of all subsequent periods.\nIt therefore follows that with respect to the 1941 period the executors are under section 11(4) (a) and (c) liable for the tax with respect to the income here in question.\nThe respondent\u2019s second contention is that, quite apart from the provisions of section 11(2), the appellants are liable under the provisions of section 9 for all of the years in issue. Section 9 in part reads:\n9. (1) There shall be assessed, levied and paid upon the income during the preceding year of every person * * *\nThe word \u201cperson\u201d is defined in section 2(h):\n2. (h) \u201cperson\u201d includes any body corporate and politic and any association or other body, and the heirs, executors, administrators and curators or other legal representatives of such person, according to the law of that part of Canada to which the context extends;\nSections 9 and 11 are both charging sections and the language used indicates that under these sections Parliament imposes a tax upon entirely different persons. Section 9(1) provides for the assessing, levying and paying upon income during the preceding year of every person other than a corporation or joint stock company, and 9(2) deals with the corporation and the joint stock company. The income tax is here imposed upon the person, corporation or joint stock company per se even though that tax may be assessed, levied and collected from their \u201cheirs, executors, administrators and curators or other legal representatives\u201d.\nSection 11 charges an income with respect to that earned by the estate or trust and imposes the tax upon either the party administering the estate or trust, or the beneficiary. The amendment of 1940-41 was a further step in the attainment of that end and provided for a tax not previously imposed.\nUnder the provisions of these sections it follows that prior to the amendment of section 11, when in 1940-41 the above quoted section 11(4) (c) was passed, no tax was imposed upon the trustees with respect to the income here in question. In the result the amounts here in question were not taxable in the years 1938, 1939 and 1940 and therefore were improperly disallowed by the Crown, while in 1941, because of the enactment of 11(4) (c), the amount in that year was taxable and the deduction properly disallowed.\nThe judgment appealed from should be so varied and the appellants should have three-fourths of their costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed in part; two-fifths of the income in question, being that proportion from which the Lacombe Home and the Salvation Army are ultimately entitled to the interest thereon, are declared free of income tax for the years 1938 and 1989.

Hull Electric Company, [1947] S.C.R. 22\nDate: 1946-10-01\nParmelia Lessard (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nHull Electric Company (Defendant) Respondent.\n1946: June 19, 20, 21; 1946: October 1.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin, Hudson and Rand J.J. and St. Jacques J. ad hoc.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING\u2019S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nNegligence\u2014Workman killed by electric wire while painting railway bridge \u2014Defendant (railway) company held not responsible\u2014Light and power system sold by it years before date of accident\u2014Questions as to ownership of wire and as to its care, control, supervision or maintenance\u2014Whether wire, even if sold, still remained in charge or care of defendant in relation to deceased\u2014Liability of company either under article 1053 C.C. or article 1054 C.C.\u2014Jury trial\u2014Whether interpretation of deed of sale question of law or question of fact.\nThe appellant\u2019s husband was engaged in painting a railway bridge, when, while preparing to move a plank upon which he had been sitting at a considerable height above the floor of the bridge, he came in contact with an electric wire carrying 2,200 volts and his death ensued immediately. Action was brought by the appellant, personally and as tutrix to her minor children, for $50,000 damages against the respondent company. At the trial by a judge with a jury, judgment was entered for $18,064., The jury, to the question whether the death had been caused by a thing under the control or care of the respondent company, answered: \u201cYes, due to the Company, the electric wire\u201d, and later the jury, after having answered in the affirmative that the death had been caused by the \u201cfault\u201d of the respondent company, added that the latter was \u201cliable for negligence and carelessness in keeping its wire too close to the bridge\u201d. The appellate court dismissed the action, holding that the respondent company did not own, or have under its care, the electric wire and that there was no fault on its part.\nHeld, Rand J. and St. Jacques J. ad hoc dissenting, that the appeal should be dismissed.\u2014Upon the evidence and the proper construction of a deed of sale by the respondent company of its light and power system to another electric company, not only was it established that the respondent company, at the time of the accident, was neither the owner of the wire nor had it under its care, control or supervision, but that, on the contrary, the ownership was proved to have been transferred to that other company.\u2014The respondent company, having disposed of the ownership of the wire and not having afterwards assumed or undertaken any supervision or control over it, cannot be held liable.\nThe interpretation of the provisions of the deed of sale is a question of law to be decided by the courts and not a question of fact within the province of the jury. Rand J. expressing no opinion and St. Jacques J. ad hoc contra.\nPer Rand J. and St. Jacques J. ad hoc (dissenting):\u2014The ownership of the wire must not necessarily be determined in this case: even if it was sold to another company, the right to maintain, in the sense of continuing it as it then was, remained in the respondent company. The latter then must be looked upon as a party to the continuing existence of the wire on the bridge in the position in which it was at the time of the fatality; it was thus in charge or care of the wire in relation to the deceased and is brought within the liability of article 1054 C.C.\u2014Whether the death was caused by the wire or whether the deceased himself was negligent, are questions of fact to be found by the jury under proper direction from the Court. The directions given at the trial were not proper: they were to the effect that the respondent company was liable as a matter of law and this withdrew from the jury these essential questions of fact. There should be a new trial.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the trial judge, Surveyer J. with a jury, and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action for damages.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nAuguste Lemieux K.C. and Alexandre Tach\u00e9 K.C. for the appellant.\nJohn L. O\u2019Brien K.C. and A. J. Campbell for the respondent. The judgment of The Chief Justice and of Hudson J. was delivered by\nThe Chief Justice: Je partage enti\u00e8rement l\u2019opinion exprim\u00e9e en cette affaire par Sa Seigneurie le Juge en Chef de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, dans les notes qu\u2019il a fournies lors du jugement rendu par la Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel), et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 subs\u00e9quemment soumis \u00e0 la Cour Supr\u00eame du Canada.\nComme lui, je crois qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas \u00e0 examiner de questions autres que celle de savoir si, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de l\u2019accident dont le mari et le p\u00e8re des appelants a \u00e9t\u00e9 la malheureuse victime, l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait la garde du fil conduisant l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 qui a caus\u00e9 la mort de Joseph Emile Napol\u00e9on Marcoux.\nMarcoux \u00e9tait occup\u00e9 \u00e0 peinturer le pont qui relie Ottawa \u00e0 Hull et connu sous le nom de \u201cPont Interprovincial\u201d; dans un mouvement qu\u2019il fit en se d\u00e9pla\u00e7ant, il vint en contact avec le fil dont il s\u2019agit et il fut \u00e9lectrocut\u00e9.\nSa veuve et ses enfants poursuivirent l\u2019intim\u00e9e et le jury rendit un verdict tenant l\u2019intim\u00e9e responsable de l\u2019accident.\nLa r\u00e9ponse du jury \u00e0 la question qui lui \u00e9tait pos\u00e9e si\nla mort dudit Joseph Emile Napol\u00e9on Marcoux \u00e9tait due \u00e0 ou avait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par aucune chose appartenant \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse, ou \u00e9tait sous sa garde, son contr\u00f4le, sa surveillance ou son entretien,\net, dans l\u2019affirmative, lui demandant de dire quelle \u00e9tait cette chose, se lit comme suit:\nR:\u2014Oui, d\u00fbe \u00e0 la Compagnie Hull Electric, le fil \u00e9lectrique.\nEt, ayant r\u00e9pondu affirmativement \u00e0 une autre question lui demandant de dire si la mort de Marcoux avait \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par la faute, n\u00e9gligence, imprudence ou incurie de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ou de ses officiers, employ\u00e9s ou pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s, le jury pr\u00e9cisa que l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait\nresponsable pour n\u00e9gligence et impr\u00e9voyance en tenant leur fil \u201cD\u201d trop pr\u00e8s du pont.\nIl accorda \u00e0 la veuve personnellement une somme de $10,000 et, aux enfants, des indemnit\u00e9s individuelles dont le total s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 $8,064.00.\nH ne faut pas, je le sais, analyser trop minutieusement les verdicts de jury en mati\u00e8re civile. Cette Cour l\u2019a affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes reprises; mais il faut tout de m\u00eame en d\u00e9gager le sens afin de savoir si le verdict a pour effet de tenir l\u00e9galement responsable celui que le jury a entendu viser.\nOr, \u00e0 mon humble avis, il r\u00e9sulte des r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es par le jury, qu\u2019il a tenu l\u2019intim\u00e9e responsable pour n\u00e9gligence et impr\u00e9voyance, en vertu de l\u2019article 1053 du code civil, et non pas \u00e0 raison des dommages caus\u00e9s par une chose qu\u2019elle avait sous sa garde, en vertu de l\u2019article 1054 C.C.\nLe sens du verdict est manifestement que la mort de Marcoux a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par la\nn\u00e9gligence et impr\u00e9voyance, en tenant leur fil \u201cD\u201d trop pr\u00e8s du pont.\nIl a bien dit que ce fil \u00e9lectrique appartenait \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle en avait la garde, le contr\u00f4le, la surveillance ou l\u2019entretien, mais il faut lier cette r\u00e9ponse avec celle o\u00f9 le jury pr\u00e9cise la raison de la responsabilit\u00e9 pour la mort de Marcoux, et cette raison est clairement d\u00e9finie comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 la n\u00e9gligence et l\u2019impr\u00e9voyance en tenant son fil \u201cD\u201d trop pr\u00e8s du pont. Il \u00e9tait \u00e9videmment n\u00e9cessaire que le jury d\u00e9clar\u00e2t d\u2019abord que, \u00e0 son point de vue, ce fil appartenait \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e ou qu\u2019il \u00e9tait sous sa garde car, autrement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019eut pu \u00eatre responsable \u201cen tenant son fil \u201cD\u201d trop pr\u00e8s du pont\u201d.\nPour tenir son fil \u201cD\u201d trop pr\u00e8s du pont, il fallait n\u00e9cessairement que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ou bien fut propri\u00e9taire du fil, ou bien l\u2019ait eu sous sa garde au moment de l\u2019accident.\nDevant la Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel), comme devant notre Cour, la discussion a \u00e9videmment d\u00e9vi\u00e9 du v\u00e9ritable sens du verdict. Et si l\u2019on en juge par les notes des membres de la Cour du Banc du Roi, ainsi que par l\u2019argumentation devant nous, les appelants ont plut\u00f4t laiss\u00e9 dans l\u2019ombre la question de la responsabilit\u00e9, r\u00e9sultant de l\u2019article 1053 C.C., pour s\u2019arr\u00eater plut\u00f4t \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019article 1054 C.C.\nJe me permets d\u2019exprimer un doute s\u00e9rieux sur la question de savoir si, \u00e0 raison de la preuve faite devant lui, le jury pouvait r\u00e9ellement \u00eatre justifiable de consid\u00e9rer comme une faute en soi, ou, pour employer ses propres expressions, \u201cn\u00e9gligence et impr\u00e9voyance\u201d, la distance qui s\u00e9parait le fil de l\u2019un des portants du pont. L\u2019accident a eu lieu le 5 juin 1941. Ce fil, en autant que le dossier Te r\u00e9v\u00e8le, \u00e9tait l\u00e0 depuis au moins l\u2019ann\u00e9e 1915. J\u2019\u00e9prouve beaucoup de difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 penser qu\u2019il pouvait y avoir eu une faute ou une n\u00e9gligence dans le seul fait d\u2019avoir plac\u00e9 le fil o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait.\nIl me semble que le nombre d\u2019ann\u00e9es qui s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 depuis que le fil avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9 est suffisant pour d\u00e9montrer que la position qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e ne pouvait en soi constituer une imprudence ou une impr\u00e9voyance.\nMais la r\u00e9ponse du jury ne tend pas \u00e0 dire qu\u2019il y a eu n\u00e9gligence au moment o\u00f9 le fil a \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9. Il dit bien que cette n\u00e9gligence ou cette imprudence aurait consist\u00e9 dans le fait de tenir le fil trop pr\u00e8s du pont (\u201cen tenant leur fil \u201cD\u201d trop pr\u00e8s du pont\u201d). Il en r\u00e9sulte que, pour que le verdict puisse s\u2019appuyer sur la preuve faite devant lui, il est n\u00e9cessaire de trouver dans le dossier quelque chose qui \u00e9tablisse que c\u2019\u00e9tait bien l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui \u201ctenait\u201d ce fil trop pr\u00e8s du pont; et pour que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ait pu en agir ainsi, il fallait de toute n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 qu\u2019il fut prouv\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait ou bien la propri\u00e9taire du fil, ou bien qu\u2019elle l\u2019ait eu sous sa garde, son contr\u00f4le, sa surveillance, ou encore qu\u2019elle en ait eu l\u2019entretien. C\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, \u00e0 mon avis, non seulement ce qui manque au dossier d\u2019une fa\u00e7on absolue, mais c\u2019est le contraire qui est prouv\u00e9.\nSur la question de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du fil, il faut absolument s\u2019en rapporter aux documents \u00e9crits ou aux contrats qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits. C\u2019est au moyen de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de ces contrats que l\u2019on peut arriver \u00e0 d\u00e9cider qui, lors de l\u2019accident, \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire du fil. Il ne saurait \u00eatre permis, sur ce point, de recourir \u00e0 la preuve verbale, \u00e0 moins que l\u2019on arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que les contrats comportent une telle ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 qu\u2019il faille absolument chercher \u00e0 les \u00e9claircir au moyen de t\u00e9moignages.\nOr, je dois dire que je n\u2019\u00e9prouve aucune difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter les contrats. Cette question d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation est une question de droit, et ce n\u2019est pas au jury mais aux tribunaux qu\u2019il appartenait de se prononcer l\u00e0-dessus.\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, de m\u00eame que la majorit\u00e9 des juges de la Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel), je crois qu\u2019il faut s\u2019en rapporter au contrat du 11 janvier 1928.\nIl n\u2019y a pas de doute que, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 cette date, l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire du fil \u201cD\u201d. Il s\u2019agit donc de savoir si, lors de la vente de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 The Gatineau Electric Light Co. (Ltd.), le fil \u201cD\u201d est devenu la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de cette derni\u00e8re compagnie.\nJusque l\u00e0, l\u2019intim\u00e9e exploitait \u00e0 la fois un service d\u2019\u00e9clairage par l\u2019\u00e9lectricit\u00e9 et un service de transport de passagers.\nLe but de la vente de 1928 \u00e9tait de transf\u00e9rer \u00e0 la Compagnie Gatineau le service d\u2019\u00e9clairage avec tous ses accessoires, et de r\u00e9server \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e le service de transport des passagers.\nDans ce contrat, l\u2019on a appel\u00e9 le service d\u2019\u00e9clairage \u201celectric lighting and distributing system\u201d, et l\u2019on a d\u00e9sign\u00e9 le service de transport sous le nom de \u201ctraction system\u201d.\nOr, voici comment le contrat d\u00e9finit ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu \u00e0 la compagnie Gatineau:\nAll the electric lighting and distributing system of the city of Hull, municipalities of South Hull and East Hull, town of Aylmer and village of Deschenes, as it existed on the first day of June last, including poles, wires, transformers, service connections, meters and all other accessories used for purposes of domestic or municipal lighting apart from purposes connected with the traction system of the vendor * * *\nQue trouve-t-on dans cette description? Tout d\u2019abord, le mot \u201call\u201d par lequel le paragraphe d\u00e9bute. C\u2019est tout le syst\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9clairage (\u201clighting and distributing system\u201d) qui est vendu. Mais, pour plus de pr\u00e9cision, la description ajoute:\n* * * including poles, wires, transformers, service connections, meters and all other accessories used for purpose of domestic or municipal lighting * * *\nLe mot \u201cincluding\u201d ne peut \u00e9videmment pas limiter le sens des mots \u201call the electric lighting and distributing system\u201d. Le contrat d\u00e9clare que cela inclut les \u201cpoles, wires\u201d, etc., mais ce ne peut \u00eatre que pour suivre les prescriptions de l\u2019article 1021 du code civil:\nLorsque les parties, pour \u00e9carter le doute si un cas particulier serait compris dans le contrat, ont fait des dispositions pour tel cas, les termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux du contrat ne sont pas pour cette raison restreints au seul cas ainsi exprim\u00e9.\nLes mots par lequel le paragraphe 6 du contrat d\u00e9bute, \u201call the electric lighting and distributing system\u201d conservent toute leur ampleur et ne sont en rien diminu\u00e9s par le fait que l\u2019on indique en plus que cela comprend les \u201cpoles, wires, etc.\u201d Les termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux du contrat comprenaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 les fils qui faisaient partie du \u201clighting and distributing system\u201d. Le fait que l\u2019on ajoute plus loin les \u201cwires,\u201d etc., loin de restreindre le sens, vient au contraire le compl\u00e9ter, en autant que besoin est pour les fins de la pr\u00e9 sente cause, par l\u2019addition du mot \u201cwires\u201d.\nAu moment m\u00eame de la vente, le fil \u201cD\u201d servait \u00e0 fournir l\u2019\u00e9clairage au terminus de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 Ottawa.\nEn vendant \u00e0 la Compagnie Gatineau les fils qui faisaient partie du syst\u00e8me d\u2019\u00e9clairage, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a donc vendu entre autres, le fil \u201cD\u201d. Ce fil n\u2019a jamais servi pour fins de transport; il n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 \u00e0 ces fins et ne peut, sous aucun rapport, \u00eatre compris comme faisant partie du \u201ctraction system\u201d.\nMais, comme pour y insister, les parties reviennent sur le sujet dans un paragraphe subs\u00e9quent:\nIt is the intention of the vendor to convey and of the purchaser to accept all the property moveable and immoveable, the rights, privileges, servitudes, franchises and any and all other properties owned by the vendor and used solely in connection with the business of domestic or municipal lighting or furnishing of power apart from traction purposes; and should it be hereafter discovered that any property, rights, privileges, servitudes, franchises or any other properties owned by the vendor and used for the purposes above indicated apart from traction purposes be hereafter vested in its name the vendor will on demand execute such other and further deeds, documents and assurances in writing as may be necessary to vest the same in the purchaser.\nSi un doute avait subsist\u00e9 \u00e0 la lecture du paragraphe 6 du contrat\u2014et pour ma part je n\u2019en ai aucun\u2014je ne vois pas comment on pourrait encore en avoir \u00e0 la lecture de ce paragraphe o\u00f9 les parties ont pris la peine de sp\u00e9cifier d\u2019abondance leur intention. Et, dans le paragraphe que je viens de citer, elles d\u00e9clarent tr\u00e8s clairement que cette intention est de transf\u00e9rer \u00e0 la Compagnie Gatineau\nall the properties * * * owned by the vendor and used solely in connection with the business of domestic or municipal lighting or furnishing of power apart from traction purposes.\nM\u00eame si les mots \u201cdomestic lighting\u201d pr\u00e9sentaient la moindre ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 dans les circonstances, il reste cette pr\u00e9cision suppl\u00e9mentaire que l\u2019intim\u00e9e transf\u00e9rait \u00e0 la Compagnie Gatineau son titre de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, ses droits, privil\u00e8ges, servitudes, franchises et autres, \u201cfurnishing of power apart from traction purposes\u201d, \u00e0 savoir: tout ce qui servait \u00e0 fournir le pouvoir pour toutes fins, except\u00e9 celle destin\u00e9e aux fins de transport. De toute \u00e9vidence, cela comprend les fils qui servaient exclusivement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9clairage au terminus, et cela n\u2019excluait que les fils qui transmettaient le pouvoir n\u00e9cessaire pour les fins de transport.\nIl m\u2019est impossible de voir comment on pouvait encore avoir un doute sur le sujet.\nCe contrat \u00e9tablit donc que le fil \u201cD\u201d \u00e9tait depuis 1928 la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la Compagnie Gatineau ou de son acheteur subs\u00e9quent, la Gatineau Power Company, mais, en tous cas, n\u2019\u00e9tait certainement pas la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nPuis, comme le fait tr\u00e8s justement remarquer le juge en chef de Qu\u00e9bec, c\u2019est d\u2019ailleurs ainsi que, depuis 1928, l\u2019intim\u00e9e et la Gatineau Electric Light Company ont ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 ce contrat. L\u2019ex\u00e9cution par les parties sert \u00e9galement \u00e0 aider \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation d\u2019un contrat. Voir Garneau v. Diotte[1].\nLa preuve tout enti\u00e8re est \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019\u00e0 partir de la date de ce contrat, la Compagnie Gatineau s\u2019est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme propri\u00e9taire du fil \u201cD\u201d et l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est comport\u00e9e comme ne l\u2019\u00e9tant plus. D\u00e8s la venue en vigueur du contrat, la Compagnie Gatineau a assum\u00e9 la garde, le contr\u00f4le, la surveillance et l\u2019entretien du fil \u201cD\u201d. Bien entendu, quand je mentionne ce fait, je veux parler de cette partie du fil \u201cD\u201d qui se trouve dans la cit\u00e9 de Hull jusqu\u2019au point de rencontre \u00e0 la ligne de d\u00e9marcation entre la province de Qu\u00e9bec et celle d\u2019Ontario.\nNon seulement il n\u2019y a aucune preuve que l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 partir de cette date de 1928 avait la garde ou l\u2019entretien du fil \u201cD\u201d dans la cit\u00e9 susmentionn\u00e9e, mais la preuve toute enti\u00e8re est \u00e0 l\u2019effet que cette garde, ce contr\u00f4le, cette surveillance et cet entretien ont \u00e9t\u00e9 subs\u00e9quemment maintenus par la Gatineau Electric Light Co. (Ltd.) et, plus tard, par son successeur, la Gatineau Power Company.\nIl est impossible de trouver au dossier m\u00eame une seule allusion \u00e0 la garde de ce fil qui e\u00fbt pu justifier le jury d\u2019en venir \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019intim\u00e9e, depuis 1928, avait ce fil sous sa garde. Et l\u00e0 il ne s\u2019agit plus seulement de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du contrat, mais il s\u2019agit de faits prouv\u00e9s par les t\u00e9moins. Si le verdict du jury veut dire que l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait la garde de ce fil, ce verdict ne peut tenir parce qu\u2019il n\u2019est bas\u00e9 sur absolument le moindre iota de preuve. Tous les t\u00e9moins ont dit le contraire.\nIl n\u2019y a donc aucun fondement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9tention que le fil \u201cD\u201d ou bien appartenait \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, ou bien \u00e9tait sous sa garde, son contr\u00f4le, sa surveillance ou son entretien. Il s\u2019ensuit \u00e9galement que la r\u00e9ponse du jury \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u201ctenu\u201d le fil \u201cD\u201d trop pr\u00e8s du pont ne peut s\u2019appuyer sur aucune preuve.\nJe ne m\u2019arr\u00eate pas un instant \u00e0 l\u2019objection soulev\u00e9e par les appelants que le contrat du 12 ao\u00fbt 1926 entre la Canadian Pacific Railway Company et l\u2019intim\u00e9e contenait une clause en vertu de laquelle cette derni\u00e8re\nwill not assign or underlet the rights hereby granted without the consent of the Pacific Company in writing first had and obtained.\nOn remarque d\u2019abord dans cette clause qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une prohibition absolue, mais simplement de la stipulation que, pour transf\u00e9rer ce contrat, l\u2019intim\u00e9e devait pr\u00e9alablement obtenir le consentement de la Compagnie du Pacifique. Cette compagnie n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en cause et il n\u2019y a donc eu aucune recherche au cours du proc\u00e8s pour s\u2019informer du consentement que la compagnie a pu donner \u00e0 la cession par l\u2019intim\u00e9e de ses droits \u00e0 la Compagnie Gatineau. Je serais port\u00e9 \u00e0 dire que la Compagnie Gatineau, ayant exerc\u00e9 ces droits depuis 1928 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date de l\u2019accident, soit une p\u00e9riode de treize ann\u00e9es, s\u2019est crue parfaitement justifi\u00e9e de penser que le consentement requis avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9. Si la cause s\u2019\u00e9tait instruite entre l\u2019intim\u00e9e et la Compagnie du Pacifique, il y a toutes les chances du monde que les tribunaux en seraient venus \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019il y a eu au moins un consentement tacite et que la Compagnie du Pacifique e\u00fbt pu difficilement pr\u00e9tendre que ce consentement n\u2019existait pas, en arguant seulement de la pr\u00e9tention d\u00e9finitive qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 par \u00e9crit.\nMais la cession des droits par l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 la Compagnie Gatineau \u00e9tait parfaitement l\u00e9gale et efficace sous tous les rapports, sauf \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier si le consentement requis avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 par la Compagnie du Pacifique. Cette r\u00e9serve \u00e9tait faite exclusivement dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de cette derni\u00e8re compagnie. Aucun autre ne pouvait s\u2019en pr\u00e9valoir. C\u2019est uniquement la Compagnie du Pacifique qui pouvait faire valoir cette absence de consentement \u00e0 son \u00e9gard. Elle n\u2019int\u00e9resse absolument personne autre. Il n\u2019appartenait certainement pas aux tribunaux de soulever cette question lorsque la Compagnie du Pacifique n\u2019est pas partie en cause. M\u00eame \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette derni\u00e8re, il ne s\u2019agirait l\u00e0 que d\u2019un bris de contrat dont seule la Compagnie du Pacifique peut se pr\u00e9valoir, et que les tribunaux peuvent appr\u00e9cier uniquement dans une cause entre l\u2019intim\u00e9e et la Compagnie du Pacifique.\nPour le moment, le contrat entre l\u2019intim\u00e9e et la Compagnie de la Gatineau est en vigueur depuis 1928; personne n\u2019en demande l\u2019annulation.\nIl reste le fait que ce contrat de 1928 a eu lieu, que la Compagnie Gatineau a pris possession de ce qui faisait l\u2019objet de cette vente, y compris le fil \u201cD\u201d et les droits et franchises s\u2019y r\u00e9f\u00e9rant, et que l\u2019on n\u2019est pas appel\u00e9, dans l\u2019instance actuelle, \u00e0 regarder au del\u00e0.\nComme cons\u00e9quence de tout ce qui vient d\u2019\u00eatre dit, le contrat ou le document \u00e9crit \u00e9tablit au dossier sans conteste que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire, au moment de l\u2019accident, du fil \u201cD\u201d et de la franchise y aff\u00e9rant, et que c\u2019\u00e9tait de plus, m\u00eame ind\u00e9pendamment de la question de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, la Compagnie Gatineau qui, en fait, avait la garde, le contr\u00f4le, la surveillance et l\u2019entretien de ce fil.\nToute la preuve est \u00e0 cet effet. Il n\u2019y a pas l\u2019ombre d\u2019une preuve au contraire. Le verdict est donc \u00e9videmment contraire \u00e0 la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, et le jury ne pouvait \u00eatre justifi\u00e9 \u00e0 rendre un verdict autre qu\u2019en faveur de la partie intim\u00e9e.\nDans les circonstances, d\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019article 508, paragraphe 3, du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile, la Cour du Banc du Roi (en Appel) a \u00e9t\u00e9 justifi\u00e9e de rendre un jugement diff\u00e9rent de celui qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu par le juge pr\u00e9sidant au proc\u00e8s.\nPeut-\u00eatre avant de conclure dois-je ajouter que, du moment que la preuve \u00e9tablissait que la garde du fil \u201cD\u201d \u00e9tait, au moment de l\u2019accident, \u00e0 la charge de la Compagnie Gatineau et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait \u00e9videmment exerc\u00e9e par cette Compagnie, cela disposait de la solution de la cause en faveur de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, en vertu de l\u2019article 1054 du Code Civil.\nIl n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire, en effet, de faire remarquer que l\u2019article impose la responsabilit\u00e9 du fait des choses \u00e0 celui qui en a la \u201cgarde\u201d, et, comme je l\u2019ai dit il y a un instant, ind\u00e9pendamment de sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9. Sa responsabilit\u00e9 provient de la \u201cgarde\u201d qu\u2019il peut en avoir. Et si l\u2019objet ou la chose \u00e9tait alors sous la \u201cgarde\u201d d\u2019un autre que le propri\u00e9taire, c\u2019est celui qui a la \u201cgarde\u201d qui est responsable \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion du propri\u00e9taire.\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance dans l\u2019esp\u00e8ce actuelle, le dit lui-m\u00eame dans son jugement formel.\nAu surplus, la responsabilit\u00e9 du fait d\u2019une chose inanim\u00e9e * * * retombe non pas sur le propri\u00e9taire comme tel, mais sur le gardien de la chose.\nEt il cite Pandectes belges, Vo Responsabilit\u00e9 civile, n. 628, 1852; Shawinigan Carbide Company v.

Canadian Pacific Express[7].\nJe suis donc d\u2019avis de confirmer le jugement dont est appel, avec d\u00e9pens. Kerwin J.:\u2014On July 5, 1941, Joseph Emile Napoleon Marcoux, as an employee of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, was engaged in painting the Interprovincial Bridge between Hull and Ottawa. The painting had been commenced on the Quebec end of the bridge and Marcoux was still working within the limits of the city of Hull, when, while preparing to move a plank upon which he had been sitting at a considerable height above the floor of the bridge, he came in contact with an electric wire carrying 2,200 volts, and his death ensued immediately.\nUnder the appropriate statute, the Quebec Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board directed the Canadian Pacific Railway Company to pay a special sum of $100, and $125 towards its employee\u2019s funeral expenses. It also directed the employer to pay Parmelia Lessard, the widow of Marcoux, for herself and her eight minor children, the sum of $66.47 per month,\u2014subject to the revision, in the future, of this monthly payment. The widow had already reserved her rights and those of her children to claim at common law from Hull Electric Company an additional sum which would constitute, with this compensation, an indemnification proportionate to the loss actually sustained. In pursuance of that reservation this action was thereupon brought by the widow personally and as tutrix to her minor children against Hull Electric Company, based upon articles 1053 and 1054 of the Quebec Civil Code.\nThe action was tried by Mr. Justice Surveyer with a jury and upon the latter\u2019s answers to questions put to them, judgment was entered against the Company for $10,000 for the widow personally and $8,064 in her quality as tutrix. In the Court of King\u2019s Bench, the three judges comprising the majority decided that the Company did not own or have under its care the electric wire in question and that there was no fault on its part, and for those reasons and without expressing any opinion upon the other matters raised, set aside the judgment and dismissed the action. Mr. Justice St. Germain concluded that there was evidence to permit the case to go to the jury but that because of errors in the trial judge\u2019s charge, there should be a new trial. The plaintiff now appeals.\nWhatever may be the fact as to who built the Interprovincial Bridge it appears from an agreement dated August 12, 1926, that the Canadian Pacific Railway Company granted to the respondent the right to use, for its electric railway, two lines of tracks on the bridge for east and west bound traffic, respectively, and the right to maintain the shelters, ticket office, waiting room, platforms and stairways at the respondent\u2019s terminal in Ottawa. The grantor was to maintain the rails but the grantee was to construct and maintain, among other things, the necessary trolley wires. The respondent agreed to pay $6,000 per annum for these privileges. We are concerned only with what has been called in the case the south side of the bridge, on which are situate the tracks running from Hull to Ottawa with a trolley wire (b) above them, carrying power for the electric cars, a wire (a) to the south of the trolley wire, for the purpose of furnishing power for lighting the bridge, and wires (c) and (d) to the north of the trolley wire. These wires, (d) and (d), furnished power to light the terminal. In the trolley wire was direct current while in (c) and (d) the current was alternating. It was the current in wire (d) that electrocuted Marcoux.\nNotwithstanding the date of the agreement with the Canadian Pacific Railway, it is clear from the evidence that the respondent commenced to use the tracks and facilities as early as 1915 because in that year it strung across the bridge the two wires (c) and (d). At that time the respondent not only operated the trolley system but also produced and supplied electricity for domestic and municipal use and for power to consumers in the city of Hull and elsewhere. However, by transfer dated January 11, 1928, it conveyed to Gatineau Electric Light Company Limited a number of parcels of land, including that upon which was erected substation no. 4, situated at 70 Main St., Hull, but reserved\nas being used for purposes connected with the operation of its traction lines and not required for domestic or municipal lighting purposes certain generating equipment with accessories thereto\nwhich were located in that substation. By clause 6 of this transfer of January 11, 1928, the respondent also conveyed\nAll the electric lighting and distributing system of the city of Hull, municipalities of South Hull and East Hull, town of Aylmer and village of Deschenes, as it existed on the first day of June last, including poles, wires, transformers, service connections, meters and all other accessories used for purposes of domestic or municipal lighting apart from purposes connected with the traction system of the vendor. It is agreed that the limits of the city of Hull extend to the boundary line between the provinces of Quebec and Ontario. By clause 7 it is stated:\u2014\nIt is the intention of the vendor to convey and of the purchaser to accept all the property moveable and immoveable, the rights, privileges, servitudes, franchises and any and all other properties owned by the vendor and used solely in connection with the business of domestic or municipal lighting or furnishing of power apart from traction purposes.\nThe Court of King\u2019s Bench concluded that, upon the proper construction of these provisions, the respondent thereby transferred the ownership of wires (c) and (d) within the limits of the city of Hull. The matter does not lend itself to extended discussion but upon a full consideration of all that has been said by counsel. I have had no difficulty in coming to the same conclusion. Any ambiguity in clause 6 is, in my opinion, made clear by the terms of clause 7 but, if there should still be any doubt about the matter, it is removed by the subsequent actions of both parties to the sale of January 11, 1928, or their successors. Mr. Gale, the respondent\u2019s manager, testified. that from January 11, 1928, forward, the respondent attended to the repair and maintenance of wires (c) and (d) from the Interprovincial Boundary to the Ottawa terminal but that it exercised no supervision or control over them on the Quebec side. The Chief Engineer of Gatineau Power Company, whose position in the matter will be explained shortly, undertook, on behalf of his company, the supervision of wires (c) and (d) on the Quebec side. Mr. Gale further stated that these wires leave the Gatineau Power Company Substation, 70 Main street, Hull, and follow Main street, Hotel de Ville street, Laurier avenue and Youville street to the Ontario border, and that the respondent uses power from the Gatineau Power Company at 117 Main street as well as at the Ottawa terminal, in both of which places it is but a customer of the Gatineau Power Company.\nThe reference to the Gatineau Power Company is explained by another document dated April 6, 1931, by which Gatineau Electric Light Company Limited transferred to Gatineau Power Company its undertaking in the province of Quebec and its system for the transmission and distribution of electrical power or energy in that province, owned by it, comprising among other transmission and distribution lines:\u2014\nCity of Hull.\nLines in the city of Hull, county of Hull, located as follows and including service extensions along their routes:\nLaurier Avenue.\nEast side of Laurier ave. from Hotel de Ville street to Ste. Foye street.\n* * *\nMain street.\nNorth side of Main street from Hotel de Ville street to Bridge street the said line being located in part upon and over lot number seven hundred and twenty-nine (729) of ward three on the Official Plan and in the Book of Reference of the city of Hull (According to the transfer from the Hull Electric Company to Gatineau Electric Light Company Limited, lot 729 is the lot upon which is erected substation 4).\n* * *\nHotel de Ville street.\nNorth side of Hotel de Ville street from Laurier avenue to Main street.\nYouville street.\nSouth side of Youville street from Laurier avenue to the Provincial Boundary on the Interprovincial Bridge between the cities of Hull and Ottawa.\nThis list of streets upon which the transfer from Gatineau Electric Light Company Limited to Gatineau Power Company states there are transmission and distribution lines agrees with Mr. Gale\u2019s evidence as to the location of wires (c) and (d) from substation 4 to the Ontario boundary.\nIt is argued that even if wires (c) and (d) at the date of the accident were not owned by the respondent, they were under the latter\u2019s care within the meaning of article 1054 of the Civil Code. It is said that they are continuous wires from Youville street across the bridge and to the respondent\u2019s terminal in Ottawa, and that their only purpose is to conduct electric power for the purpose of lighting the terminal. The fact that they are continuous does not prevent the ownership changing at the Interprovincial Boundary and to say that their only purpose is to furnish power to light the Ottawa terminal is correct only in this sense,\u2014that from the time they reach the Quebec end of the bridge the only user of energy is the respondent at its terminal. It is further said that while the agreement with the Canadian Pacific Railway of August, 1926, does not refer to wires (c) and (d) once it is admitted that they were erected on the bridge by the respondent, it should be taken that the Canadian Pacific Railway Company by the agreement of August 12, 1926, gave a licence to the respondent only; particularly in view of clause 4 of that agreement by which the respondent agrees that it will not assign or underlet the rights thereby granted without the consent in writing of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company; that it was shown that there was no agreement between the latter and Gatineau Power Company or Gatineau Electric Light Company Limited; and that the respondent has continued to pay the full amount of $6,000 per annum.\nWe are not concerned with the rights inter se of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the respondent, or of it and Gatineau Power Company. Whatever they may be, they cannot alter the fact that the ownership of wires (c) and (d) to the Provincial Boundary line had been transferred by the respondent and that since then it had not exercised any control or supervision over them and therefore it cannot be said that at the place at which the unfortunate accident occurred, the wires were under the respondent\u2019s care within the meaning of article 1054 C.C. Having disposed of the ownership and not having assumed or undertaken any supervision or control, the respondent cannot be held liable for any fault. There was therefore no case against the respondent to submit to the jury and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRand J. (dissenting):\u2014The husband of the appellant lost his life by electrocution while at work painting the Interprovincial Bridge between Ottawa and Hull. He was found to have come into contact with one of two wires carrying electricity of 2,200 voltage from a sub-station in Hull to the terminal of the respondent, Hull Electric Company, in Ottawa, and used only for lighting that terminal. The wires were fastened to brackets affixed to the bridge structure and the nearer to the side of the column or girder the deceased was painting had a clearance of about 15\u00bd inches. They had been erected by the Hull Company in 1915 under. permission from the Canadian Pacific Railway Company, the owner apparently of the bridge. In 1926 the Pacific Company granted the respondent a long term right to operate its tramway system over the bridge. There is no reference in the contract to any previous use of the bridge for that service, but admittedly it was a continuation of a use that had been going on for many years before. Nor is there any reference to the two lighting wires, and whether they were intended to be covered by it or to be continued under the original licence is not clear. It seems to have been assumed in both the lower courts that they were within the language of the 1926 agreement; but on the argument before us this was challenged by counsel for the respondent. He contended that the right to place the wires on the bridge was to be found in an agreement made in 1914 not placed in evidence, but mentioned in the 1926 document. However this may be, admittedly they were in place only by virtue of a licence from the Pacific Company and on the records of that company the licensee remained the Hull Company. In 1928 the latter sold to the Gatineau Light and Electric Company its light and power system for both domestic and public services, but reserved all plant and property used for or in connection with the traction or tramway purposes, and the controversy has been decided by the Court of King\u2019s Bench on the ground that this sale carried the two wires as far as the interprovincial boundary which is the middle of the Ottawa River.\nI should have thought the language of the 1928 agreement:\nAll the electric lighting and distributing system * * * as it existed on the 1st day of June last * * * used for purposes of domestic or municipal lighting apart from purposes connected with the traction system of the vendor\nwould mean domestic or municipal vis a vis the then owner, the Hull Company; both words look rather to services to third persons than to the parties themselves; and the use then made by the owner, the respondent, for its own purposes would not in that sense be domestic. It could be \u201cdomestic\u201d only from the point of view of the purchaser after the system had been acquired. The later language\nused solely in connection with the business of domestic or municipal lighting or furnishing of power apart from traction purposes\nseems to confirm that. Certainly \u201ctraction purposes\u201d must include some lighting as that of the tramcars and conceivably of right of way, and the lighting of terminals is in the same category. In a subsequent sale of the system to the Gatineau Power Company reference is made to lines on Youville street from Laurier avenue to the inter-provincial boundary on the bridge, and this item is said by the respondent to designate the two wires in question. That may be so: but it is a contract between third parties and would not bind the respondent.\nBut I do not find it necessary to determine this question of title. The wires were on the bridge only under a licence granted the respondent. If they were sold to the Gatineau Electric, the right to maintain, in the sense of continuing them as they then were, remained in the Hull Company; and in relation to the Pacific Company and its employees the responsibility for that continued likewise with the respondent as if it remained the owner. The Gatineau Power cannot be heard to say that it is a trespasser on the bridge and it is not a trespasser only by the continued maintenance of the wires by the respondent as its own.\nThe respondent then must be looked upon as a party to the continuing existence of these wires on the bridge in the position in which they were at the time of the fatality. It was in charge or care of them in relation to the deceased, and is brought within the liability of article 1054 of the Civil Code if it is shown that the death was caused in a legal sense by the wires, unless it is able to avail itself of the exculpatory provision of the article.\nIt is said that we are governed by the judgment of this Court in Canada and Gulf Terminal Railway Co. v Levesque[8], and that that rules out liability on the part of the respondent. This proceeds on the footing that the legal cause of death here was the electricity and not the wire and that only the person in control of the former could be said to be within article 1054 C.C. In that case, however, death was brought about by a sudden flow of excessive current. What was being supplied to the machine shop was a current of 110 volts, but what killed the employee was a current of 2,200 volts, and obviously it was in a causal sense the flow of current which effectively brought about the fatal result. The dissents of Duff J. (as he then was) and Lamont J. were on the ground that there was evidence of negligence on the part of the employer in what should have been safe working conditions in the shop. Here the act of the respondent is in erecting and maintaining, through the continuance only of its sole authority to do so, a wire which is intended to be a channel for a fatal current in a place within reach of workmen engaged in their ordinary duties. The leave is to maintain on the bridge a live wire; it is the position in space that is governing, and this lies within the control of the licensee. That is not to say that the company either controlling the current or responsible vis a vis the Hull Company for the wires as its own property, including their position on the bridge, might not also in the circumstances be within the application of article 1054 C.C.\nBut whether the death was caused by the wire, or whether the deceased himself played a part in bringing it about, are questions of fact to be found by the jury under proper directions from the Court, and I am forced to agree with St. Germain J. of the Court of King\u2019s Bench that the directions given at the trial were not proper. They were to the effect that the respondent was liable as a matter of law. This withdrew from them these essential questions of fact. I am unable to treat the circumstances as admitting of only the conclusion of liability on the part of the respondent; it cannot in my opinion be said as a matter of law that, regardless of the circumstances, the wire was the sole cause of the death.\nI am disposed to the view also that, having regard to the provisions of The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, the damages found are excessive, but as the case should go back for a re-trial of the issue of liability, no more need be said on that point.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal, and direct a new trial. The appellant should have her costs in this Court, the respondent costs in the appeal below, and the costs of the first trial should abide the result of the second.\nSt. Jacques J. ad hoc (dissenting):\u2014On the 5th of June, 1941, Joseph Emile Napol\u00e9on Marcoux, plaintiff\u2019s husband, was working for the Canadian Pacific Railway at the painting of the Interprovincial Bridge between Hull and Ottawa, and during the course of his work, he came in contact with an electric wire carrying a load of 2,200 volts and was instantly killed. He had then nine minor children to whom his wife was appointed tutrix. The accident having occurred on the part of the bridge which is in the province of Quebec, the family of the deceased had the benefit of the Quebec Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and was granted by the Commission a certain sum for funeral expenses, plus a rent of $66.47 per month payable by the employer and susceptible to be revised according to the change of state of the wife and children. When she made her application to the Commission, the widow had reserved whatever rights she might have, for herself and her children, against the Hull Electric Company as a result of the death of her husband, and she instituted an action in the amount of $50,000, viz: $20,000 for her personally and $30,000 for her nine children.\nShe alleged that the death of Marcoux was due to his contact with electric wires belonging to defendant, or being under its control, which wires were then defective, in bad condition, not properly insulated and maintained for the carrying of electricity necessary for the exploitation of defendant\u2019s tramways.\nThe Company thus sued denied the facts alleged by plaintiff and specially pleaded that the accident causing the death of Marcoux was not due to its fault, negligence or imprudence, nor to anything of which it had the control.\nPlaintiff having made the option of a trial before jury, the assignment of facts to be submitted to the jury was made by consent of both parties and a judgment rendered accordingly. As it was then apparent that the main issue was whether the wires having caused the death of Marcoux were under the control of Hull Electric Company the following questions among others were submitted to the jury and the answers were:\n2nd question:\nQuelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause de la mort de Joseph-Emile Marcoux?\nAnswer:\nLa cause de la mort de Joseph-Emile Marcoux est due au choc du fil \u201cD\u201d de la Cie Hull Electric.\n5th question:\nLa mort dudit Joseph-Emile Marcoux est-elle due \u00e0 ou a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par aucune chose appartenant \u00e0 la d\u00e9fenderesse ou \u00e9tant sous la garde, le contr\u00f4le, la surveillance ou l\u2019entretien de la d\u00e9fenderesse, et si oui, quelle est cette chose? Answer:\nOui, due \u00e0 la Cie Hull Electric, le fil \u00e9lectrique.\n6th question:\nLa mort dudit Marcoux a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par la faute, n\u00e9gligence, imprudence ou incurie de la d\u00e9fenderesse ou de ses officiers, employ\u00e9s et pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s?\nAnswer:\nOui.\n6a question:\nSi vous r\u00e9pondez oui \u00e0 la question pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente (no 6), dites en quoi la d\u00e9fenderesse est coupable de faute, n\u00e9gligence, imprudence ou incurie ou celle de ses officiers, employ\u00e9s et pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s.\nAnswer:\nLa r\u00e9ponse est que la Cie Hull Electric est responsable pour n\u00e9gligence et impr\u00e9voyance, en tenant leur fil \u201cD\u201d trop pr\u00e8s du pont.\nThe answers to questions 9 and 10 concerning the damages were $10,000 for plaintiff personally and a total amount of $8,064 for eight children (one being now 21 years of age) to be divided among themselves, according to their age on a basis of $12.00 per month until they reach the age of 21.\nDefendant\u2019s attorneys moved that the verdict be quashed and the action be dismissed or alternatively that a new trial be ordered, alleging that it appears clearly from the evidence that no jury could render such a verdict which is against the law. The presiding judge dismissed the motion; he granted plaintiff\u2019s demand and confirmed the verdict by a judgment based on the grounds that the electric wire, which was the cause of the death, had been installed and used by defendant until the sale made on the 11th of January, 1928, to Gatineau Electric Company and that the facts invoked by defendant to show a transfer of the property of the wire are of the province of the jury whose verdict should not be disturbed by the Court. As to the amount of damages, although the presiding judge declared that he would not have granted such an amount, he, however, confirmed the verdict.\nThis judgment was quashed by a majority of the judges of the Court of King\u2019s Bench dismissing the action, Francoeur J., taking no part in the judgment and St. Germain J., dissenting, being of the opinion that defendant still had the control of the wire at the time of the accident, but ordering a new trial on the ground that the trial judge did not properly instruct the jury.\nPlaintiff appeals from this judgment and contends that Hull Electric Company was properly condemned by the first court.\nThere is no doubt that the death of Marcoux was due to his contact with an electric wire running along the bridge for the purpose of lighting defendant\u2019s station at the Ottawa end of the bridge. The jury found that the wire was too close to the girder of the bridge; and there is satisfactory evidence to justify such a finding. The main issue is whether defendant still had the control of the wire when Marcoux was killed. It is proven, and in fact admitted, that the wire was installed by defendant as its property and was used, before 1928 and after, for the purpose of carrying electricity to the Ottawa station. The Company did not clearly allege it in its plea, but contends that, by the sale made to Gatineau Electric Company on the 11th of January, 1928, the wire was included among the things sold, and since then was the property of Gatineau Electric Company and under its control, and consequently the responsibility of the accident cannot rest upon defendant.\nIn my opinion, the control of the wire and its maintenance, as well before 1928 as after, is a pure question of fact which must be decided by the jury, properly instructed. The assignment of facts, to which no objections were made by defendant before and during the trial, contains the very question of the ownership and control of the wire which was the cause of the death of Marcoux. The issue rested upon the answer to be given to that question; the fyling of deeds of sale, as well as the hearing of witnesses, were for the purpose of proving who had the control of the wire. The deeds of sale invoked by defendant were read to and by the jury; the reading of such deeds to find whether the wire was included among the things sold is a question of fact and not one of law. If the juridical character of a deed is in issue, viz., whether it is a deed of sale, or a deed of donation, or a deed of hypothec, is a question of law, the solution of which belongs to legal minds; but such is not the case here. The jury as well as the judges are called upon to read the deeds solely to find out whether the wire was included among the things enumerated in the clauses reading as follows:\nAll the electric lighting and distributing system of the city of Hull, municipalities of South Hull and East Hull, town of Aylmer and village of Deschenes, as it existed on the first day of June last, including poles, wires, transformers, service connections, meters and all other accessories used for purposes of domestic or municipal lighting apart from purposes connected with the traction system of the vendor * * *\nIt is the intention of the vendor to convey and of the purchaser to accept all the property moveable and immoveable, the rights, privileges, servitudes, franchises and any and all other properties owned by the vendor and used solely in connection with the business of domestic or municipal lighting or furnishing of power apart from traction purposes and should it be hereafter discovered that any property, rights, privileges, servitudes, franchises or any other properties owned by the vendor and used for the purposes above indicated apart from traction purposes be hereafter found vested in its name the vendor will on demand execute such other and further deeds, documents and assurances in writing as may be necessary to vest the same in the purchaser.\nThe presiding judge deduced from the reading of the deeds, as well as from the parol evidence, that wire \u201cD\u201d was not sold to Gatineau Electric Company, but was retained by Hull Electric Company for purposes connected with the traction system. St. Germain J., in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, read the deed the same way and justified his conclusion by very elaborate reasons with which I agree and need not repeat here. I am not, however, disposed to render a judgment according to the verdict, first because I apprehend that the jury may have been confused by the charge of the judge, and also because the amount awarded appears to me grossly excessive, and out of proportion to the evidence.\nArticle 475 C.C.P. says that\nthe jury find the facts, but must be guided by the directions of the judge as regards the law.\nThe jury has to be clearly instructed on that point and I must say with all due deference that this has not been done in a satisfactory way in the present case. The respective provinces of judge and jury have not been clearly defined and confusion in the minds of the jury seems to have resulted from such misdirection. For instance, the judge says:\nvis-\u00e0-vis la demanderesse, elle ne connaissait pas le propri\u00e9taire du fil; l\u2019action me para\u00eet bien fond\u00e9e. And further:\nPar cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019arrive \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019il y a du fait et du droit, et, tant que c\u2019est du droit, comme je vous l\u2019ai dit, vous \u00eates oblig\u00e9s de me suivre, c\u2019est que vous ne pouvez pas refuser \u00e0 la demanderesse d\u2019avoir une action contre la Hull Electric Company.\nThe jury has not been left entirely free in its province of finding facts. This may explain that the answer to question 6a is not only a finding of fact, but really a judgment. The jury says that Hull Electric Company is responsible for its negligence and imprudence in keeping wire \u201cD\u201d too close to the bridge. Responsibility is the legal consequence of facts alleged and proven, and it belongs to the Court and not to the jury to deduce responsibility from the facts found.\nSince dictating the above, I have had the advantage of reading Justice Rand\u2019s notes of judgment and for the additional reasons therein stated and to which I adhere, I would allow the appeal and direct a new trial; respondent should pay the costs in this court and also the costs of the first appeal; as to the costs of the first trial, they should follow the result of the second trial.\nAppeal dismissed with costs\nSolicitor for the appellant: Auguste Lemieux.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Brais & Campbell.\n[1] [1927] S.C.R. 261.\n[2] (1909) 42 Can.

Three distinct accounts are therein specified and \u201ccontingent account\u201d is the description of one of them.\nThe appellant company tendered testimony of witnesses and sought through them to adduce in evidence statements made by the general manager of the Dominion Telegraph Company, who died before the trial, relative to negotiations conducted by him on behalf of the Company in support of its contention that the rentals were considered as capital payments to recoup the Company for the loss of its capital assets.\nPer Kellock J.:\u2014The contemporaneous written evidence does not support such a contention, and it is doubtful if the oral evidence, assuming it is admissible at all, goes that far. It is not necessary however, to decide that point as the documents in the case negative such a view of the actual settlement. While surrounding circumstances may be regarded for the purpose of construing an instrument, the true legal position arising upon the instrument so construed may not be ignored in favour of the supposed \u201csubstance.\u201d\nPer Estey J.:\u2014Statements made in the course of duty by a deceased party are admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule, but the duty must be clearly established and the statements must be made in the course of that duty and not in connection with collateral matters.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1946] Ex. C.R. 338) aff.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, O\u2019Connor J.[1], dismissing the appeal of the appellant company to that Court from the affirmation by the respondent of assessments under the Income War Tax Act upon income tax returns filed by the appellant company for the years 1926 to 1929 inclusively. The material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above head-note and are more fully related in the judgments now reported.\nL. A. Landriau K.C. for the appellant.\nF. P. Varcoe K.C., W. R. Jackett and A. A. McGrory for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Rand JJ. was delivered by:\nRand J.: The contention of the appellant is that in 1925 when it became known that the telegraph system leased in 1878 by the Dominion Telegraph Company had in large measure lost its identity through changes in location and absorption in a larger system, an agreement was made by which the lease came to an end and the rights of the lessor under the lease as well as all its title to whatever property remained to it, were sold for a capital sum equal to the annual rents for the then unexpired term of the lease plus $116,640 at that time paid in cash. The former rents would in amount continue as capital instalments and the latter sum be put out at interest. Together these payments would represent to the Dominion Telegraph Company the plant, works and business which under the lease were to be kept intact and returned as a modern telegraph system. The continuation of the annual payments of $62,500 from 1925 to 1978 would amount to something over $3,000,000, and the sum in cash was calculated at compound interest to produce during the same period over a million dollars. No specific value was placed on the property, but the evidence generally and indefinitely treats it as two, three, four or more million dollars.\nNow, that is a conceivable mode of dealing with a rather mixed up subject-matter; but if the parties intended the arrangement between them to be in that form it is unfortunate they did not so express it. The lease remained unaffected except the release of the covenants to keep the system in good working order and to deliver up the property in that condition when the lease terminated. And the consideration for the payment of $116,640 is dealt with in these words: Upon the expiration of the said lease on the 30th day of June, 1978, or upon its earlier termination as therein provided for, the Dominion Company and the Securities Company for the aforesaid sum of $116,640 hereby agree to transfer, quit claim and assign unto the Great Northwestern all of the Dominion. Company\u2019s and the Securities Company\u2019s right, title and interest in and to all of the lines, telegraph system and properties conveyed by the said lease * * * provided however that the provision of the said lease with respect to the payment of rentals shall have been in all respects fully complied with.\nAnd finally:\nAll future rents payable during the currency of the said indenture of lease and amounting to the sum of $62,500 per annum payable quarterly on the 1st days of January, April, July and October in each and every year during the currency of the said lease, shall be paid to the Securities Company which has acquired by purchase all the assets and goodwill of the Dominion Company subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement.\nMoreover the appellant has shown the $62,500 on its tax return as income and a deduction of bond interest paid to the holders of the bonds has been allowed; and it is only in respect of the portion of the rents referrable to the bonds placed in the \u201csinking fund\u201d so-called that the question of tax arises.\nThe \u201csinking fund\u201d was provided by the form of the transaction as carried out between the shareholders of the Dominion Company and the Securities Company which was this: the latter, the purchaser, issued bonds for $1,000,000 carrying interest at 5\u00bd% per annum, which were distributed pro rata among the shareholders: the $116,640 was used in the first instance to buy in that value of those bonds and these were held by a trust company in the \u201csinking fund\u201d. The rent to the extent of $55,500 was paid quarterly to the trust company which disbursed the interest payable to the bondholders; but that portion representing interest on the bonds in the \u201csinking fund\u201d, in turn was used to redeem or buy in further bonds. The sum of $116,640 was more than necessary to bring about that redemption, and provision was made for the issue of 2,000 interest certificates likewise distributed among the shareholders to absorb the surplus. In the result, at the end of the lease all of the bonds would have been redeemed, the rents exhausted, the property divested, and the object of the Securities Company fulfilled. It was an arrangement for a serial redemption of bonds, but that does not mean that the redemption moneys must be treated as capital; it is their character when and as received that determines their liability for income tax and not their subsequent application.\nIt is further contended that even on the other view the transfer of the moneys to the sinking fund, a fund here not \u201ccontingent\u201d, is outside of the provisions of section 6(1) (d) which reads:\nAmounts transferred or credited to a reserve, contingent account or sinking fund, except such an amount for bad debts as the Minister may allow and except as otherwise provided in this Act;\nand that the amounts are deductible from income. But the answer is twofold: there was no sinking fund properly so-called; and the word \u201ccontingent\u201d in the context of the paragraph does not qualify \u201csinking fund\u201d; three distinct accounts are specified and \u201ccontingent account\u201d is the description of one of them.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nTaschereau j.: I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nKellock J.: This is an appeal from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, O\u2019Connor J., dated December 29, 1945, dismissing certain appeals by the appellant from assessments made under the provisions of the Income War Tax Act in respect of the years 1926 to 1929, inclusive. These assessments arose out of the following facts:\nThe appellant is the purchaser of the assets of Dominion Telegraph Company (which, for convenience, I shall refer to as the original company) under an agreement dated 12th January, 1925. It describes itself and the nature of its business in the income tax returns here in question as \u201cowners of telegraph leases\u201d.\nBy an instrument dated 12th June, 1879, the original company demised to The American Union Telegraph Company, a New York corporation, \u201call the telegraph lines and the entire telegraphic system and plant\u201d in Canada of that company for a term of ninety-nine years, commencing July 1, 1879, at a rental of $52,500 per annum, with provision for an increased rental in certain circumstances. The lease included a covenant on the part of the lessee to keep the lines, system and plant in good working order and to pay all costs of renewals and all expenses of working and carrying on the same, including municipal taxes. The lease contained a further covenant on the part of the lessee to yield up the demised premises at the expiration of the term in good working order and repair.\nBy a further instrument, dated July 11, 1881, the above named lessee assigned the lease, with the consent of the original company, to The Western Union Telegraph Company, with the provision that the assignee might sublet such part of the lines, system and property to another company, namely, the Great North Western Telegraph Company of Canada, as it might deem proper; in which event the Western Union was to pay an additional rental of $10,000 per annum.\nThis last mentioned indenture was followed on the 26th August, 1881, by a further instrument by which The Western Union sublet to the Great North Western all the lines, system and property acquired from the original company west of the province of New Brunswick, the rent being increased to $62,500.\nDuring the year 1922, and subsequent years, negotiations took place between the original company, the other companies mentioned and the Canadian National Railways, which had acquired the assets of the Great North Western Company, and it is said that it was discovered by the officers of the original company that all the wires and poles of the demised system had been removed from their original position on public highways and absorbed into the systems of one or other of the lessee companies and that the municipal franchises had become forfeited. Ultimately a settlement was arrived at and it is the nature of this settlement which gives rise to the controversy between the parties.\nTo carry out the settlement an agreement dated 15th January, 1925, between the original company, The American Union, The Western Union, the Great North Western and the appellant was executed. This document acknowledges receipt by the original company of the sum of $116,640 and in consideration therefor that company and the appellant released the other parties from all claims in respect of the covenants in the indenture of the 12th June, 1879, to keep the telegraph lines, system and plant in good working order and to yield them up in the same condition. The agreement also contains the following provisions:\n3. Upon the expiration of the said lease on the 30th day of June, 1978, or upon its earlier termination as therein provided for, the Dominion Company and the Securities Company for the aforesaid sum of one hundred and sixteen thousand six hundred and forty dollars ($116,640) hereby agree to sell, transfer, quitclaim and assign unto the Great North Western all of the Dominion Company\u2019s and the Securities Company\u2019s right, title and interest in and to all of the lines, telegraph system and properties conveyed by the said lease existing and being west of the province of New Brunswick in the Dominion of Canada and elsewhere west of the province of New Brunswick and the Dominion Company and the Securities Company hereby agree to sell, transfer, quitclaim and assign unto the Western Union all the Dominion Company\u2019s and the Securities Company\u2019s right, title and interest in and to all of the other lines, telegraph system and properties conveyed by the said lease; provided, however, that the provision of the said lease with respect to the payment of rental shall have been in all respects fully complied with.\n4. The indenture of lease hereunto annexed as schedule \u201cA\u201d hereto and all the covenants, provisos, conditions, powers, matters and things whatsoever contained therein shall enure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and assigns of each of the corporate parties hereto and shall continue in full force and effect save and except as hereby expressly amended.\n5. All future rents payable during the whole of the currency of the said indenture of lease and amounting to the sum of sixty-two thousand five hundred dollars ($62,500) per annum payable quarter-yearly on the 1st days of January, April, July and October in each and every year during the currency of the said lease, shall be paid to the Securities Company which has acquired by purchase all the assets and. good will of the Dominion Company subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement.\nIt is the contention of the appellant that not only the sum of $116,640 but the continued payment of the rent of $62,500 were capital, both together being the consideration for the settlement of the claims by the original company in respect of the demised telegraph system and property.\nThe appellant put in evidence the minutes of a special general meeting of shareholders of the original company held on the 2nd April, 1924, called to consider a resolution approving the settlement, passed on the previous 18th of February by the directors. The resolution itself was not put in evidence,. At this meeting the shareholders approved the resolution and authorized the officers of the company to execute a formal agreement. This became the agreement of the 15th January, 1925. The minutes include a statement by Mr. Macrae, the secretary, to the shareholders explaining the negotiations. This includes a statement that the cash payment was arrived at on the basis of the then present value of the sum of $1,000,000 at the expiration of the term of the lease. As Mr. Macrae said\n\u201cthe sum of $1,000,000 was the goal because it was the value of the property when the lease was made and was also the amount of our stock. After still further discussions we were asked to name a figure and we offered to accept the sum of approximately $115,660, which, on a 4% basis instead of 5%, would realize $1,000,000 at the end of the term. The final exact figures will be adjusted by the actuaries of the Imperial Life and the Canada Life. This offer was accepted and passed by the board of the Canadian National Railways and the amount was approved by this board and a settlement authorized subject to the approval of the shareholders.\u201d\nThe $116,660 became $116,640.\nMr. Macrae does not refer at all to the continued payment of the rents but the president of the company, in his statement to the meeting, said:\n\u201cThe amount was arrived at as a sum which would, invested at 4% and interest compounded for the remainder of the term, produce a sum of not less than $1,000,000 which would pay to the shareholders the par value of their stock, $50 per share, and in the meantime the rentals would continue to pay the dividends as heretofore.\u201d\nThe appellant tendered evidence of witnesses who testified to conversations with Mr. Macrae in support of its contention that the rentals were considered by those who negotiated the settlement as capital payments to recoup the company for the loss of its capital assets.\nIt is not argued as a matter of law that the lessees could, by destroying the demised telegraph system, put an end to their liability for the payment of rent. The argument is that by agreement the compensation for the lost assets was fixed at an immediate cash payment of $116,640 and instalment payments of $62,500 per annum, which, although formerly paid and received as rent, ceased to be such. I find no support in the contemporaneous written evidence for such a view and it is doubtful if the oral evidence, assuming it is admissible at all, goes that far. Certainly Mr. Hodgetts does not say so. It is not necessary however to decide this point as I think the documents negative such a view of the actual settlement. While surrounding circumstances may be regarded for the purpose of construing an instrument, the true legal position arising upon the instrument so construed may not be ignored in favour of the supposed \u201csubstance\u201d; Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Westminster (Duke)[2]. No doubt the claims of the original company might have been settled in accord with what the appellant now contends. I do not think they were, but that the rent continued as rent and, accordingly, as revenue, and not capital. The agreement of January 12, 1925, is quite irrelevant in the determination of this question as it formed no part of the settlement. That agreement provided for the issue by the appellant, pro rata, to the shareholders of the original company of bonds of a par value of $1,000,000, to be secured by a mortgage of its assets to the Royal Trust Company, as well as certain \u201ccertificates of interest\u201d, the bonds and certificates ultimately to be retired by means of a \u201csinking fund\u201d to be initiated by the \u201cpurchase\u201d by the appellant of bonds of a par value of $109,000, using part of the $116,640 cash payment for that purpose. Provision was made for payment of the interest on the bonds by assigning to the trustee $55,000 out of the $62,500 annual rental. The bonds bore interest at 5\u00bd%. No dispute exists with respect to so much of the rentals as was required to pay the interest on any bonds other than the bonds held by this \u201csinking fund\u201d. It is the amounts claimed to have been paid as \u201cinterest\u201d on these last mentioned bonds which are here in question.\nIn its argument the appellant says that:\nThe appellant submits that on the evidence it is clearly established that what was to be received by the shareholders of the Company was $1,000,000, and, in addition, the recovery of rentals, dealt with below, and that, by the nature and character of the settlement, no part of the funds which were to represent $1,000,000 by a present settlement in 1924 can be held to be income subject to tax under the Income War Tax Act as an item of annual gain or profit to the appellant.\nIt may be said at once that no question arises on this appeal with respect to any taxation upon any\npart of the funds which were to represent $1,000,000 by a present settlement in 1924.\nThe fund which was to represent that particular $1,000,000 was the sum of $116,640. That was capital and was not and is not taxed. The above contention serves only to confuse the issue. Quoting again from the appellant\u2019s factum:\nThe appellant submits that on the evidence the nature or character of the transaction was that $1,000,000 capital, and the continued payment of rentals, was to be available to the shareholders of the appellant\u2019s predecessor, The Dominion Telegraph Company.\nThe respondent in assessing annually accumulations of interest received in sinking fund on such of the bonds of the issue of $1,000,000 principal amount issued to shareholders of The Dominion Telegraph Company as are held in sinking funds from time to time, has wrongly treated as taxable income the portions of the said $1,000,000 represented by such accumulations.\nIt is apparent that the appellant is here confusing two separate things. The first is the $116,640 received on the basis of its being the present value in 1924 of $1,000,000 payable in 1978 on a 4% basis. The second thing is the rental. On the documents already referred to this was income and no part of it ceased to be income merely because the appellant employed it at 5\u00bd% (the bond rate) to pay interest on outstanding bonds of an issue created by it.\nIf, then, the rental was never capital but revenue, on what basis does it become exempt from income tax? The appellant itself in its returns showed the $62,500 as \u201cRents received from Canadian National Telegraphs\u201d. It is said this was merely bookkeeping. I do not think that a sufficient answer. It is next said that $55,000 out of the rents was assigned to the trustee to meet the interest on the bonds and that the bonds in the \u201csinking fund\u201d were just as much outstanding as those in any other hands. I think that is not so. In my opinion the bonds, when acquired by the sinking fund, ceased to be outstanding obligations of the appellant and payment of \u201cinterest\u201d was impossible. The acquisition was simply redemption and it is interesting to observe that this is the word used in the bond mortgage itself. We have been referred to no provision of the law by which revenue becomes exempt from taxation because used by the tax payer for redemption of an outstanding capital obligation.\nI would dismiss the appeal. Estey J.: The issue in this appeal arises out of an agreement dated the 15th day of January, 1925, and made between the parties to a lease dated the 12th day of June, 1879, for a period of 99 years. The appellant contends that the agreement was a settlement of all matters under the lease. That it effected a cancellation of the lease and the sums payable thereunder are damages payable in lieu of a capital asset and as such not subject to income tax. The respondent contends that the agreement was a settlement of certain covenants only, that otherwise the lease continued in full force and effect. That of the two sums payable thereunder that of $116,640 payable forthwith was a settlement of these covenants and for income tax purposes treated as capital, but the other, $62,500 payable in each year thereafter, remained a payment of rent and was income and as such, subject to certain deductions, was taxable under the Income War Tax Act, 1917 (1927, R.S.C., ch. 97). The returns in this appeal were filed for the years 1926 to 1929 inclusive. In the Exchequer Court of Canada, Mr. Justice O\u2019Connor, sitting in appeal from the decision of the Minister of National Revenue, found in favour of the respondent and dismissed the appeal.\nUnder date of June 12, 1879, The Dominion Telegraph Company leased to The American Union Telegraph Company for 99 years \u201call the telegraph lines and the entire telegraphic system and plant\u201d \u201cfor and in consideration of the rents and covenants and agreements\u201d therein specified. The rent, at first $52,500, subsequently was raised to $62,500, and at all times material to this litigation, was at the latter figure. This lease contained a covenant that the lessee would throughout the term \u201ckeep said telegraph lines, system and plant in good working order\u201d, and at its termination surrender\nthe said demised premises and property in good working order and repair, with an adequate supply of instruments and plant of the most improved character * * *\nThe American Union Telegraph Company assigned this lease to The Western Union Telegraph Company, which company assigned it to The Great North Western Telegraph Company and after the Canadian National Railway System was formed it became as of April 2, 1924, the property of that system and was known as Canadian National Telegraphs.\nAbout this time the directors of The Dominion Telegraph Company discovered that, whereas the rent had been regularly paid by the successive lessees, they had not maintained the line as the lease provided but had made alterations and so far merged it into the larger system that it would now be difficult if not impossible to carry out either of the covenants, to maintain or to surrender at the termination of the lease.\nNegotiations consequent upon this discovery led to an agreement in writing dated the 15th of January, 1925, to which The Dominion Telegraph Company, The American Union Telegraph Company, The Western Union Telegraph Company, The Great North Western Telegraph Company and Dominion Telegraph Securities, Limited, were all parties. (Although negotiations were concluded with the officials of the Canadian National Railways, they were not made a party to this agreement. It is, however, admitted that The Great North Western Telegraph Company was taken over by the Canadian National Railways.) This agreement contained an acknowledgment of \u201cthe due execution and validity\u201d of the original lease and the successive assignments thereof. It then provided that in consideration of the payment of $116,640 The Dominion Telegraph Company and Dominion Telegraph Securities, Limited, released the other parties thereto from the covenants in the lease,\nwhich are to the following effect:\nFirstly, that the lessee in the said indenture of the 12th of June, 1879, should, during the demised term, keep the said telegraph lines, system and plant in good working order and should pay all costs of renewals thereof and all expenses of carrying on the same, and\nSecondly, that on the last day of the said term, or on the sooner determination of the estate thereby granted, the lessee should peaceably and quietly leave, surrender and yield up unto the Dominion Company all and singular the said demised premises and property in good working order and repair with an adequate supply of instruments and plant of the most improved character then in use on telegraph lines in America.\nIt then provided that upon the termination of the lease the lessors would\nfor the aforesaid sum of one hundred and sixteen thousand six hundred and forty dollars ($116,640) * * * sell, transfer, quitclaim and assign unto the Great North Western the property leased (except as to a territory not material to this litigation), and the paragraph concluded:\nProvided, however, that the provision of the said lease with respect to the payment of rentals shall have been in all respects fully complied with.\nThis agreement also contained the following paragraph:\n4. The indenture of lease hereunto annexed as schedule \u201cA\u201d hereto and all the covenants, provisos, conditions, powers, matters and things whatsoever contained therein shall enure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and assigns of each of the corporate parties hereto and shall continue in full force and effect save and except as hereby expressly amended.\nIn the result this agreement released the lessees and their assigns from any covenant to maintain and to surrender all the telegraph lines and the telegraph system and plant at the expiration of the lease but that otherwise this lease shall remain \u201cin full force and effect.\u201d\nThe rent remained at $62,500 per annum. The Dominion Telegraph Company therefore under this agreement had at its disposal the sum of $116,640 in cash and an income of $62,500 per year up to 1978. It was decided to wind up The Dominion Telegraph Company and to form another company known as Dominion Telegraph Securities, Limited. The latter company was incorporated under the laws of the province of Ontario and by an agreement in writing dated the 12th day of January, 1925 it purchased the entire assets, subject to the liabilities, of The Dominion Telegraph Company.\nThe Dominion Telegraph Securities, Limited then entered into two agreements with The Royal Trust Company under the terms of which fifty-three year 5\u00bd% mortgage bonds in the sum of $1,000,000 were issued, as well as certificates of interest valued at that time at the sum of $5.25. As collateral Dominion Telegraph Securities, Limited, assigned the rent under the aforementioned lease in the sum of $62,500, payable quarterly commencing with the instalment dated 30th of April, 1925. These bonds and certificates of interest were delivered to the individual shareholders of The Dominion Telegraph Company in exchange for their shares.\nThe $62,500 was applied as received in each year $55,000 to pay the interest on the $1,000,000 5\u00bd% fifty-three year mortgage bonds and the balance for operating expenses of Dominion Telegraph. Securities, Limited. The $116,640 was expended $56,500 to buy a block of these bonds, and another sum of $52,500 to purchase another block of these bonds, and all of these bonds as purchased were delivered to The Trust Company to be placed in a sinking fund. They were not to be then cancelled but were merely to be\nmarked \u201cNot negotiable, property of the sinking fund\u201d. The balance of the $116,640 was used as expenses. In every year interest was paid out of the $62,500 to The Royal Trust Company on these bonds in the sinking fund and as this interest was received it was expended in purchasing further of the outstanding bonds from the bondholders. These bonds as purchased were in each year placed in the sinking fund and marked \u201cNot negotiable, property of the sinking fund\u201d.\nThe $56,500 capitalized at 5\u00bd% would realize at the end of the fifty-three year period $1,000,000. In fact the trustee in the first year received interest at the rate of 5\u00bd% upon the two amounts of $56,500 and $52,500 with which to purchase further bonds. It follows from this procedure that they would have in each successive year a larger amount with which to purchase additional bonds and at some time prior to the termination of the fifty-three year period all the bonds would be purchased, while the $62,500 per year would be collected up to the expiration of the lease in 1978. The trustee would have, therefore, a fund not required to redeem the bonds. This fact was realized at the outset and led to the issue by The Royal Trust Company, as trustee, of the certificates of interest.\nThese certificates of interest were provided for by a second agreement dated the 2nd day of February, 1925. Under that agreement these certificates entitled\nthe holder thereof to an interest in a fund which shall be in the possession of the trustee on the second day of February, 1978.\nAt the date of their issue they had a value of $5.25 which under this plan would increase in each year. A schedule attached to the certificate indicated from year to year its value, which in February 1978 would be $93.12.\nThese certificates were not transferable but could only be surrendered for cancellation with an assignment thereof. After all the outstanding bonds have been purchased and placed in the sinking fund, but not before the 2nd of February, 1965, the trustee\nshall proceed to redeem certificates at the value thereof as indicated by the schedule endorsed upon the said certificates.\nBut unlike the bonds, as purchased these certificates\nshall forthwith after payment therefor by the trustee be cancelled by the trustee * * *\nIn filing its income tax return in each year the appellant disclosed the $62,500 as income and claimed as a deductible expense the $55,000. The taxing authorities varied this by allowing only those amounts of interest paid to the holders (other than the trustee) of the bonds, or in other words disallowing the amounts of $55,000 paid to the trustee in each year as interest on the bonds in the sinking fund.\nThe appellant submits that the agreement dated the 15th day of January, 1925, was in fact a settlement of all matters under the lease and in effect terminated the lease and the rights of the parties were thereafter determined only by that agreement of January 15, 1925. That it was made because the lessees had not carried out their covenants to maintain and would not be in a position to surrender the property leased at the expiration of the term. That the lessees were not in a position to pay a lump sum in an amount which the lessors would accept as compensation and therefore it was agreed that they would pay in cash the sum of $116,640 and the sum of $62,500 annually to the time when the lease would expire. That as a settlement these amounts were in their nature and character damages paid for the loss of a capital asset and should therefore be treated as capital and ought not to be subject to income tax.\nThe outstanding share capital of The Dominion Telegraph Company was $1,000,000 and the $116,640 capitalized at 4% would at the end of 53 years yield $1,000,000.\nIn support of its contention the appellant tenders an extract from the minute book of The Dominion Telegraph Company under date of April 2, 1924. This minute indicates the negotiations leading up to the settlement and includes the following:\nHe (the president) stated that the directors had then instructed Mr. Macrae to negotiate with the other lessees, the Great North Western Telegraph Company, now the Canadian National Telegraphs, and that the negotiations had been successful, and an offer had recently been made by the Great North Western Company to pay the sum of $115,660 for a release by this Company of the covenants in the lease above mentioned. The amount was arrived at as a sum which would, invested at 4%, and interest compounded for the remainder of the term, produce the sum of not less than $1,000,000, which would pay to the shareholders the par value of their stock, $50 per share, and in the meantime the rentals would continue to pay the dividends as heretofore.\nFurther on in the minutes the following appears:\nAfter still further discussions, we were asked to name a figure and we offered to accept the sum of approximately $115,660, which on a 4% basis instead of a 5% would realize $1,000,000 at the end of the term.\nThe final exact figures will be adjusted by the actuaries of the Imperial Life and the Canada Life. This offer was accepted and passed by the board of the Canadian National Railways, and the amount was approved by this board, and the settlement authorized, subject to the approval of the shareholders.\n* * *\nWe ask you to confirm the resolution passed by the board of directors and authorize the release of the covenants mentioned..\nThe sum of $115,660 mentioned in these minutes when adjusted by the actuaries was fixed at $116,640.\nThe words \u201cfor a release by this company of the covenants in the lease above mentioned\u201d in the foregoing minutes refer to the covenants in the lease to maintain and repair. They are the only covenants mentioned prior thereto in the minutes and indeed throughout the minutes. It will be further observed that \u201cthe rentals would continue to pay the dividends as heretofore\u201d. That they were effecting a settlement for a breach of the. two covenants to maintain and surrender the telegraph lines, system and plant is emphasized in these minutes by the last paragraph above quoted:\nWe ask you to confirm * * * and authorize the release of the covenants mentioned.\nThe negotiations on behalf of the Dominion Telegraph Company were conducted by the late Mr. H. H. Macrae, secretary-treasurer and general manager of that company. A few years later Mr. Macrae died. The appellant called two witnesses and sought through them to adduce in evidence statements made by the late Mr. Macrae relative to these negotiations to establish \u201cthe reason for and the extent of the settlement arrived at\u201d and\nthe full facts explaining the nature and character of the settlement with Canadian National Railways.\nThat the statements made to the witnesses by the late Mr. Macrae were hearsay was not contested but it was contended that these statements were made in the course of duty to the witnesses by the late Mr. Macrae and therefore admissible in evidence. So far as the first witness is concerned, he was not associated with the company nor with Mr. Macrae at the times material and no evidence of any duty on the part of the late Mr. Macrae to make the statements to this witness was established. The other witness was a solicitor who was consulted by the late Mr. Macrae and who deposed as follows:\nQ. Did you take any instructions from Mr. Macrae?\nA. Yes, he gave me all my instructions.\nQ. Instructions in relation to what?\nA. He informed me what the settlement was with the Canadian National Railways and he consulted me as to the method of making a distribution of the proceeds of that settlement among the shareholders of Dominion Telegraph Company. I carried out those instructions.\nQ. And those instructions were given to you when?\nA. In 1924 and 1925.\nQ. Approximately at the time of the settlement?\nA. About the time of the settlement and before the money was paid over by the Canadian National Railways to Dominion Telegraph Company.\nIt will be observed that the solicitor was consulted after the settlement with Canadian National Railways and then\nas to the method of making a distribution of the proceeds of that settlement.\nThat statements made in the course of duty by a deceased party are admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule is clear, but the duty must be clearly established and the statements made in the course of that duty. In this instance any statements made by the late Mr. Macrae as to the negotiations and reason for the settlement would not be part of the instructions given to the solicitor with respect to the disposition of the proceeds but would only be collateral thereto and under the authorities not admissible. Then it is said, if not a statement against interest, the letter is admissible as a memorandum made in the course of business and in the discharge of a duty to Barker\u2019s principals. But the rule as to the admission of such evidence is confined strictly to the entry of the particular thing which it is the duty of the person to do, and, unlike a statement against interest, does not extend to collateral matters, however closely connected with that thing.\nBlackburn J., Smith v. Blakey[3]. O\u2019Connor v. Dunn[4].\nThen does it come within another exception, which is an entry made by a deceased person of something in the discharge of his duty? * * * the principle has never been questioned in any case, and it is this, that it must be an entry, not of something that was said, not of something that was learned, not of something that was ascertained, by the person making the entry, but an entry of a business transaction done by him or to him, and of which he makes a contemporaneous entry. For nothing else was it admissible, and it was received only because it was \u2022 the person\u2019s duty to make that entry at the time when the transaction took place. The exception is entirely confined to that.\nJames L. J., Polini v. Gray,[5].\nQuoted with approval by Bowen L. J. in Lyell v. Kennedy[6]. See also Regina v. Buckley[7] and Phipson on Evidence, 8th ed., 282.\nThe express language of the agreement dated January 15, 1925, which relieved the lessees and their assigns from their obligations to maintain and to surrender \u201call the telegraph lines and the entire telegraphic system and plant\u201d; that the sale and transfer of the leased property would take place only at the termination of the lease and then only:\nProvided, however, that the provision of the said lease with respect to the payment of rentals shall have been in all respects fully complied with.\nthat in all other respects the lease should continue in full force and effect; the extract from the minutes; and the practice of the Dominion Telegraph Securities, Limited, in preparing their income tax returns in each year disclosing the $62,500 as income all clearly indicate that apart from the release of the two covenants the lease continued in full force and effect. The $62,500 was at all times rent and under the circumstances of this case income. As to the $116,640, it has been accepted as capital by the Minister of National Revenue and therefore there is no contest with respect to this item.\nThe principal issue upon this appeal is the disallowance by the taxing authorities as a deductible expense that portion of the $55,000 received by the trustee as interest on the bonds in the sinking fund. As and when received in each year this amount was utilized to purchase additional bonds which were then placed in the sinking fund and stamped \u201cNot negotiable, property of the sinking fund\u201d. There is no provision for their ultimate cancellation but under the terms of the agreement they remain in the sinking fund.\nOnce so purchased and placed, these bonds are in reality paid and under this plan the amounts that would otherwise have been paid out as interest on these bonds are used to buy further bonds of this issue and thereby reduce the outstanding capital obligation of the Dominion Telegraph Securities, Limited. The agreements specifically provide for this, and further, when in the course of time these bonds have all been purchased, then this income shall be used to redeem the certificates of interest. In all the years material to the issues here to be determined, the amount of 5\u00bd% upon the bonds in the sinking fund was applied to purchase additional bonds. It was a \u201cpayment on account of capital\u201d and therefore not deductible under the provisions of section 6 (1) (6) of the Income War Tax Act.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: G.

Maceachern and others (Plaintiffs)\n1946: November 12, 13; 1946: December 20.\nPresent: Kerwin, Hudson, Taschereau, Kellock and Estey JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA IN BANCO\nRailway\u2014Negligence\u2014Motor vehicle\u2014Collision at double track level crossing\u2014One train just passed on one track\u2014-Second train travelling in opposite direction\u2014Engine bell ringing, and wig-wag light and bell operating\u2014Failure by engineer to sound whistle\u2014Municipal by-law prohibiting train whistle at crossings unless necessary to prevent accident\u2014Railway Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 170, s. 808.\nThe driver of a motor vehicle, following another motor vehicle across the tracks at a double track level railway crossing, after a train had just passed on one of the tracks, was struck by an oncoming train travelling on the far track in the opposite direction. There was an automatic flagman or wig-wag which was in operation at all relevant times, with its bell ringing and its light burning. The whistle of the engine was not sounded but its bell was being rung continuously.\u2014A municipal by-law, approved by the Board of Transport Commissioners under the provisions of section 308 of the Railway Act, prohibited the sounding of train whistles within the city limits unless there was reasonable cause for belief that it was necessary in order to prevent an accident.\u2014The driver of the motor vehicle and two of the passengers sued the railway company for damages. The finding of the jury was that, \u201cin view of the conditions prevailing at the crossing,\u201d the engineer was negligent in failing to sound the engine whistle, presumably on the ground that the first train might have caused noise sufficient to drown out the signal bell, that it might have obscured the wig-wag and that there was likelihood that motor vehicles would be waiting to cross. The trial judge maintained the action. The appellate court affirmed that judgment as to the two passengers now respondents, but held that the driver of the motor vehicle could not recover.\nHeld, Hudson J. dissenting, that the appeal should be allowed and the respondent\u2019s action dismissed. There was no evidence upon which the jury could base their finding that the engineer had reasonable cause for belief, at the eighty rods mark before reaching the level crossing (s. 308 Railway Act), that it was necessary for him to sound the engine whistle in order to avoid an accident. The engineer, and the trial judge so found, could not reasonably have foreseen the accident, the train was proceeding in the normal cause of its operation, the engine bell was ringing, the wig-wag was operating and its bell was ringing. Under these circumstances, a jury properly instructed could not have found the appellant railway guilty of any negligence. Per Kerwin and Estey JJ.:\u2014The municipal by-law would fail of its evident purpose, if it were to be held that when two trains are approaching each other at or near a level crossing the engineer of each must always sound the whistle eighty rods from the crossing. Circumstances, however, might arise where it would be incumbent at common law upon the engineer to sound the whistle, but no such case has been made out in the present instance.\nPer Taschereau and Kellock JJ.:\u2014The obligation to sound the whistle imposed by section 308 of the Railway Act, by itself, is an absolute obligation independent of the particular circumstances which may in fact exist. The municipal by-law substitutes for that an obligation not to sound the whistle at all unless from the particular circumstances observable at the time when the statutory warning should otherwise be given a prudent man would consider that in order to prevent an accident the prohibition should be disregarded and the warning given. Neither the statute nor the by-law have anything to do with any duty at common law which may rest upon the appellant at all points upon its railway.\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco (19 M.P.R. 65) reversed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco[1], affirming in part the judgment of the trial judge, Doull J. after trial with jury, which had maintained an action for damages for injuries sustained by the driver of a motor vehicle and two of the passengers in a collision at a railway level crossing.\nD. L. McCarthy K.C. and W. H. Jost for the appellant.\nR. S. MacLelland K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Estey JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin J.:\u2014This is an appeal by Canadian National Railways Company from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia in banco, affirming the judgment entered at the trial upon the findings of the jury. The respondents, Annie I. MacEachern and Catherine Christine MacEachern, together with four other people, were passengers in an automobile owned and driven by Archibald A. MacAulay who, at about 8.30 p.m. on September 18, 1943, had been proceeding westerly on Townsend street, in the city of Sydney, in the province of Nova Scotia. Two pairs of tracks of the appellant company cross Townsend street in what is generally a north and south direction and the distance between the inner rails of each pair is 9.5 feet. At the southwest corner of the crossing is an automatic flagman or wig-wag which was in operation at all relevant times, with the bell ringing and light burning. As MacAulay\u2019s automobile approached the crossing, a train of the Sydney and Louisburg Railway, consisting of twenty-three coal cars, was moving in a northerly direction over the crossing on the east tracks and MacAulay brought his car to a stop thirty or forty feet from the tracks and immediately behind another automobile. Upon the last car of the Sydney and Louisburg train clearing the crossing, the driver of this other automobile and MacAulay put their cars in motion and proceeded over the crossing. MacAulay failed to notice a train of the appellant travelling south on the west track, consisting of an engine and caboose. The whistle on that engine was not sounded but its bell was being rung continuously. This train struck MacAulay\u2019s car, the two respondents were severely injured, and the automobile damaged, while MacAulay and the four other passengers were not injured. An action was brought by MacAulay and the two respondents against the appellant at the trial of which the main question was as to the speed of the appellant\u2019s train.\nBefore turning to the questions submitted to the jury and their answers thereto, a reference should be made to section 308 of the Railway Act, R.S.C. 1927, chapter 170:\u2014\n308. When any train is approaching a highway crossing at rail level the engine whistle shall be sounded at least eighty rods before reaching such crossing, and the bell shall be rung continuously from the time of the sounding of the whistle until the engine has crossed such highway.\n2. Where a municipal by-law of a city or town prohibits such sounding of the whistle or such ringing of the bell in respect of any such crossing or crossings within the limits of such city or town, such by-law shall, if approved by an order of the Board, to the extent of such prohibition relieve the company and its employees from the duty imposed by this section.\nPursuant to subsection 2, by-law 35 was enacted by the Council of the city of Sydney, reading as follows:\u2014\n1. It is prohibited to sound any engine whistle in respect to the following highway crossings within the limits of the city of Sydney, namely \u2014Kings Road, Bentinck St., George St., Brookland St., Townsend St., Prince St., and the Canadian National Railways and Prince St., and the Sydney & Louisburg Railway. 2. The said prohibition shall not apply when there is reasonable cause for belief that it is necessary to sound an engine whistle in order to prevent an accident.\n3. This by-law shall come into effect if and when approved by an order of the Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada.\nThis by-law was duly approved by the Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada, which is the Board referred to in subsection 2 of section 308 of the Act and was in force at the time of the accident.\nIt will be observed that subsection 1 of section 308 of the Act provides for the sounding of the engine whistle at least 80 rods before reaching a highway crossing at rail level, and that the authority under subsection 2 is for a by-law to prohibit such sounding, and it is therefore to that sounding that the prohibition in clause 1 of the by-law applies,\u2014although it does not apply\nwhen there is reasonable cause for belief that it is necessary to sound an engine whistle in order to prevent an accident.\nA complaint was made that this by-law was not referred to by the appellant in its pleading but it was put in as an exhibit and the trial proceeded without objection. On the other hand, I assume that the pleadings of the plaintiffs in the action are sufficient to raise the issue as to whether there was reasonable cause for belief that it was necessary to sound the engine whistle.\nThe questions submitted to the jury and their answers are as follows:\u2014\n1. Was there any negligence on the part of the defendant, or its servants, which caused or contributed to the property damage sustained by the plaintiff, Archibald A. MacAulay; or the bodily injuries suffered by Annie I. MacEachren and Catherine Christine MacEachren?\nAnswer yes or no.\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n2. If so, in what did such negligence consist? Answer as fully as you can.\n\u201cPart 2 city of Sydney ordinance relating to the sounding of engine whistle at a crossing states as follows, quote\u2014the said prohibition shall not apply if there is reasonable cause for belief that it is necessary to sound an engine whistle in order to prevent an accident. In view of the conditions prevailing at the crossing on the night of the accident the jury are agreed that the whistle should have been sounded. This was not done.\u201d\n3. Was there any negligence on the part of the plaintiff, Archibald A. MacAulay, which caused or contributed to the accident? Answer yes or no.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Question 4, asking in what the negligence of MacAulay consisted, was, of course, not answered, and question 5, dealing with the damages need not be considered.\nThe trial judge, after quoting the answer to question 2, proceeded as follows:\u2014\nThis creates a rather peculiar situation as there had been no argument before the jury in regard to the sounding of an engine whistle and there had been no instruction as to negligence of that kind. The pleadings, however, set out the failure to sound a whistle as one of the items of negligence and clearly if there is any evidence to support the finding it may very well be a proper ground. As there will no doubt be an appeal, I am dealing with the subject in only a general way. It is quite clear that the engineer of the engine which collided with the car in which the plaintiffs were driving could not reasonably have foreseen the accident which happened but it is not an unreasonable argument that the fact that there were two trains going in opposite directions on separate tracks and that there were clearly cars waiting to pass on both sides of the railway,. might very well have raised reasonable apprehension of an accident and might have made it necessary in the exercise of prudence to sound a whistle. At any rate I am signing the order for judgment and no doubt the matter can be dealt with more fully by a higher court\nThe appeal by the present appellant against the judgment in favour of MacAulay was allowed as the court in banco decided that the finding that MacAulay had not been negligent was perverse and not supported by the evidence. As to the present respondents, the court in banco considered it clear that the jury believed that there was ground for the belief that the sounding of the whistle was necessary to prevent an accident and that they thought the sounding of the whistle would have been an effective warning. The reasons for judgment of the Chief Justice of Nova Scotia on behalf of the court continues:\u2014\nThe sharp sound of a whistle would no doubt have been heard amid the din caused by the cars. Defendant\u2019s engineer must have known that he was approaching a busy crossing; that vehicles were standing at the time on the western side of the track waiting for the opportunity to pass; and he might reasonably expect vehicles to be waiting on the eastern side of the track as well. I think there is evidence to support the answer of the jury finding the defendant guilty of negligence, and I am not prepared to set aside their verdict in their answers to questions numbers 1 and 2.\nI am unable to agree with this conclusion. The appellant\u2019s train was proceeding in the normal course of its operation and the wig-wag was operating, and if it were to be held that when two trains are approaching each other at or near the crossing the engineer of each must always sound the whistle 80 rods from the crossing, the by-law would fail of its evident purpose. The trial judge was satisfied that the engineer of the appellant\u2019s train could not reasonably have foreseen this particular accident and, despite the fact that the engineer might have anticipated, that traffic was waiting to cross from both directions, I can find no evidence upon which the jury could base their finding that he had reasonable cause for belief that it was necessary to sound the whistle at least 80 rods before reaching the crossing in order to prevent any accident. On the proper construction of the by-law, that is what the finding amounts to. This is not to say that circumstances might not arise where it would be incumbent at common law upon the engineer to sound the whistle but no such case is made out.\nAs was also pointed out by the trial judge, the jury\u2019s answer to question 2 is all the more remarkable as no such point as is there mentioned had been argued by counsel and no instruction upon the point had been given them. The dispute at the trial was as to the speed of the appellant\u2019s train but in the absence of a finding by the jury that the speed of the appellant\u2019s train was illegal or excessive, that question must be disregarded.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the respondents\u2019 action dismissed with costs throughout There was an appeal by MacAulay from the judgment of the court in banco dismissing his claim for damages to his automobile but at the argument this appeal was abandoned and it should, therefore, be dismissed without costs.\nHudson J. (dissenting): This action was brought for damages in respect of injuries sustained as a consequence of the motor car in which the plaintiffs were driving being struck by an engine of the defendant company.\nThe accident took place in Sydney, N.S. where a busy city street crosses two parallel tracks of the defendant\u2019s railway. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendant\u2019s engine and following cars were travelling at an excessive rate of speed, and also that there was no sufficient or effective bell and whistle warning given to the plaintiffs by the \u201csaid outgoing freight train\u201d. The jury found first, that the damage and injury sustained by the plaintiffs was due to the negligence of the defendant or its servants, and secondly, that such negligence consisted in:\nCity of Sydney ordinance relating to the sounding of engine whistle at a crossing states as follows, quote\u2014the said prohibition shall not apply if there is reasonable cause for belief that it is necessary to sound an engine whistle in order to prevent an accident. In view of the conditions prevailing at the crossing on the night of the accident the jury are agreed that the whistle should have been sounded. This was not done.\nThere was no finding as to speed.\nFollowing these answers, on motion for judgment the learned trial judge after quoting the second answer says:\nThis creates a rather peculiar situation as there had been no argument before the jury in regard to the sounding of an engine whistle and there had been no instruction as to negligence of that kind. The pleadings, however, set out the failure to sound a whistle as one of the items of negligence and clearly if there is any evidence to support the finding it may very well be a proper ground. As there will no doubt be an appeal, I am dealing with the subject in only a general way. It is quite clear that the engineer of the engine which collided with the car in which the plaintiffs were driving could not reasonably have foreseen the accident which happened but it is not an unreasonable argument that the fact that there were two trains going in opposite directions on separate tracks and that there were clearly cars waiting to pass on both sides of the railway, might very well have raised reasonable apprehension of an accident and might have made it necessary in the exercise of prudence to sound a whistle.\nJudgment was entered for the plaintiffs accordingly.\nOn appeal, Chief Justice Chisholm, in giving the unanimous opinion of the court, said:\nI shall first deal with the contention that the defendant was negligent. The by-law of the city of Sydney was approved by the proper authority, namely the Board of Transport Commissioners, and must be taken as an effective direction as to the use of a train whistle at crossings within the city of Sydney. The question then narrows down to this\u2014did the defendant observe its requirements? If the city ordinance absolutely forbade the use of the whistle at the crossing, then the defendant was not guilty of negligence in its failure to make use of its whistle. In express words, however, the prohibition is not to apply if there is reasonable cause for belief that the sounding of the whistle is necessary to prevent an accident. Then arises the question whether there was reasonable cause for such belief. It is clear that the jury believed that there was ground for such belief, and that they thought the sounding of the whistle would have been an effective warning. The sharp sound of a whistle would no doubt have been heard amid the din caused by the cars. Defendant\u2019s engineer must have known that he was approaching a busy crossing; that vehicles were standing at the time on the western side of the track waiting for the opportunity to pass; and he might reasonably expect vehicles to be waiting on the eastern side of the track as well. I think there is evidence to support the answer of the jury finding the defendant guilty of negligence, and I am not prepared to set aside their verdict in their answers to questions number 1 and 2.\nThe learned judges of appeal, however, were of the opinion that the male plaintiff, MacAulay, was not entitled to succeed and allowed the appeal in so far as his claim was concerned.\nAfter perusal of the evidence, I am not prepared to say that the two courts below were clearly wrong in their conclusion. Two parallel tracks crossing a busy street thoroughfare obviously create great dangers for those using the highway. Provision was made by order of the Board of Transport Commissioners which, no doubt, was deemed adequate protection in the case of normal operations.\nThe jury\u2019s answers indicated that, in their opinion, at the time of the accident, the conditions prevailing demanded something more. This was a fact which they had a right to decide. See Salmond on Torts, 10th Ed. at p. 438:\nWhat amounts to reasonable care depends entirely on the circumstances of the particular case as known to the defendant whose conduct is the subject of inquiry. Whether in those circumstances, as so known to him, he used clue care\u2014whether he acted as a reasonably prudent man\u2014is a mere question of fact as to which no legal rules can be laid down.\n(See Commissioners of Taxation v. English, Scottish and Australian Bank Limited[2].\nAs Chief Justice Chisholm pointed out:\nThe sharp sound of a whistle would no doubt have been heard amid the din caused by the cars.\nThis might very easily have saved these people from this very unfortunate accident.\nI think there was concurrence in the courts below in respect of the essential facts.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs and also dismiss the cross-appeal of MacAulay without costs.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Kellock JJ. was delivered by\nKellock J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, in banco, dated the 19th January, 1946, affirming the judgment at trial in favour of the respondents other than the respondent MacAulay, upon the verdict of a jury and allowing the appeal with respect to the last named respondent as to whom the action was dismissed.\nThe action was brought to recover damages arising out of a collision which took place about 8.30 p.m., on September 18, 1943, between an automobile, owned and operated by the respondent MacAulay, in which the other respondents and others were passengers, and a freight train of the appellant on Townsend street where it crosses at grade level a double line of tracks of the Canadian Government Railways in the city of Sydney. Townsend street, which also carries a street railway, runs east and west. As the respondent\u2019s car, travelling west, approached the easterly tracks, another train, consisting of some twenty-three empty coal cars, was moving northerly over the crossing. The automobile accordingly stopped, it is said, some thirty feet from the easterly tracks immediately behind another automobile. There was other traffic similarly stopped on the west side of the crossing. MacAulay says that when the last car of the coal train had left the crossing by some fifty feet, having looked up and down the track without seeing anything, the automobile in front of him moved ahead and he started up and proceeded to cross. He had just succeeded in placing his car in the centre of the westerly tracks when he was struck by the freight train which was proceeding southerly. Although the train crew endeavoured to stop the train as soon as they observed him their efforts were without avail. It is for the damages resulting from this occurrence that the action was brought.\nThe crossing was protected by a wig-wag, having a light and an automatic bell, placed on the westerly side of the two sets of tracks on the southerly side of Townsend street. Although the wig-wag was operating neither MacAulay nor any of the other occupants of the automobile saw its light nor heard its bell, nor did any of them hear the bell of the train which struck their car, although it had been in continuous operation for eighty rods as required by statute. All said they did not either hear or see this train until it was upon them, the reasons given being the noise made by the coal train in passing over the crossing and that the approaching train was obscured by the coal cars. It was also said that the headlight on the approaching engine was not noticed as the crossing was brightly lit up by the lights of the automobiles and a light on a post.\nThe evidence of the appellant\u2019s train crew established that the bell on the freight engine had been sounded continuously as required by the statute and that this was the only signal given by that train. No evidence was given by any of the respondents\u2019 witnesses as to any lack of warning by either bell or whistle of the approaching engine beyond the statements made by all the occupants of the MacAulay car that they heard nothing. A by-law of the city of Sydney, hereinafter referred to, was put in by counsel for the appellant no doubt in view of the above evidence and allegations in the statement of claim that effective bell and whistle warnings had not been given. No reference was made in the address of either counsel to failure to blow the whistle nor did the learned trial judge refer to the subject in his charge.\nThe verdict of the jury was in the following terms:\n1. Was there any negligence on the part of the defendant, or its servants, which caused or contributed to the property damage sustained by the plaintiff, Archibald A. MacAulay; or the bodily injuries suffered by Annie L. MacEachren and Catherine Christine MacEachren? Answer yes or no.\n\u201cYes\u201d.\n2. If so, in what did such negligence consist? Answer as fully as you can.\n\u201cPart 2 city of Sydney ordinance relating to the sounding of engine whistle at a crossing states as follows, quote\u2014the said prohibition shall not apply if there is reasonable cause for belief that it is necessary to sound an engine whistle in order to prevent an accident. In view of the conditions prevailing at the crossing on the night of the accident the jury are agreed that the whistle should have been sounded. This was not done.\u201d\n3. Was there any negligence on the part of the plaintiff, Archibald A. MacAulay, which caused or contributed to the accident? Answer yes or no.\n\u201cNo\u201d.\n4. If you answer the 3rd question \u201cyes\u201d then in what did such negligence consist? Answer as fully as you can.\nEffect was given to this verdict by the learned trial judge who said in the course of his reasons:\nIt is quite clear that the engineer of the engine which collided with the car in which the plaintiffs were driving could not reasonably have foreseen the accident which happened but it is not an unreasonable argument that the fact that there were two trains going in opposite directions on separate tracks and that there were clearly cars waiting to pass on both sides of the railway, might very well have raised reasonable apprehension of an accident and might have made it necessary in the exercise of prudence to sound a whistle.\nIn giving judgment on the appeal on behalf of the full Court the Chief Justice said:\nThe by-law of the city of Sydney was approved by the proper authority, namely, the Board of Transport Commissioners, and must be taken as an effective direction as to the use of a train whistle at crossings within the city of Sydney. The question then narrows down to this\u2014 did the defendant observe its requirements? If the city ordinance absolutely forbade the use of the whistle at the crossing, then the defendant was not guilty of negligence in its failure to make use of its whistle. In express words, however, the prohibition is not to apply if there is reasonable cause for belief that the sounding of the whistle is necessary to prevent an accident. Then arises the question whether there was reasonable cause for such belief. It is clear that the jury believed that there was ground for such belief, and that they thought the sounding of the whistle would have been an effective warning. The sharp sound of a whistle would no doubt have been heard amid the din caused by the cars. Defendant\u2019s engineer must have known that he was approaching a busy crossing; that vehicles were standing at the time on the western side of the track waiting for the opportunity to pass; and he might reasonably expect vehicles to be waiting on the eastern side of the track as well. I think that is evidence to support the answer of the jury finding the defendant guilty of negligence and I am not prepared to set aside their verdict in their answers to questions number 1 and 2.\nThe Court held, however, that the finding of the jury with respect to the alleged negligence of the respondent MacAulay was perverse and his action was dismissed. This respondent cross-appealed with respect to the dismissal but the cross-appeal was abandoned before us.\nThe by-law mentioned above was approved by an order of the Board of Transport Commissioners, dated 1st November, 1941, pursuant to the provisions of section 308 of the Railway Act and reads as follows:\n1. It is prohibited to sound any engine whistle in respect to the following highway crossing within the limits of the city of Sydney, namely: Kings Road, Bentick Street, George Street, Brookland Street, Townsend Street, Prince Street and the Canadian National Railways and Prince Street and the Sydney & Louisburg Railway.\n2. The said prohibition shall not apply when there is reasonable cause for belief that it is necessary to sound an engine whistle in order to prevent an accident.\n3. This by-law shall come into effect if and when approved by an order of the Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada.\nBy section 308 of the statute, R.S.C. 1927, ch. 170, provision is made for the sounding of the whistle when a train is approaching a highway crossing at rail level, the whistle to be sounded \u201cat least eighty rods before reaching such crossing\u201d. Subsection 2 provides that:\nWhere a municipal by-law * * * prohibits such sounding of the whistle * * * in respect of any such crossing or crossings * * * such by-law shall, if approved by an order of the board, to the extent of such prohibition relieve the company and its employees from the duty imposed by this section.\nThe duty imposed by the section is to sound the whistle \u201cat least eighty rods before reaching such crossing\u201d and it is only \u201csuch sounding\u201d which may be affected by any by-law passed under the authority of the section. The point therefore at which the engineer had to determine whether or not the statutory signal should be given was at the eighty rod mark. The question which arises is as to whether or not on the evening in question and under the circumstances then existing there was reasonable cause presented to the engineer of the freight engine at that point which should have actuated him to sound his whistle in the belief that it was \u201cnecessary\u201d in order to prevent an accident. In my opinion there is no evidence upon which an affirmative finding could be made upon that question.\nThere is no evidence even to show in the first place that when the freight engine was at the whistling post one-quarter mile from the crossing, it could be there observed that the two trains, one proceeding at the rate of ten miles per hour, and the other at the rate of approximately three miles per hour, were in such positions relative to each other that it should have been realized that the last car of the coal train would pass over the crossing before the freight reached it and thus open up the crossing so as to permit an incautious person to attempt to cross; or in the second place, that the coal train would not pass over the crossing sufficiently prior to the other train reaching it that the approach of the latter would be easily observed from both sides of the crossing. I see nothing in the evidence which, at the whistling post, should have created in the minds of any of the train crew a reasonable belief that it was \u201cnecessary\u201d to sound the whistle in order to prevent an accident. The engine was moving slowly, its bell was ringing and there were no conditions in existence which would obscure its approach from anyone who cared to look before stepping into its path. All of this was known to the train crew, who also knew that the crossing was protected by the wig-wag. In my opinion something more had to be observable than was in fact observable at the whistling post in order to raise the duty with which the by-law deals.\nThe obligation to sound the whistle imposed by section 308, by itself, is an absolute obligation independent of the particular circumstances which may in fact exist. The by-law substitutes for that an obligation not to sound the whistle at all unless from the particular circumstances observable at the time when the statutory warning should otherwise be given a prudent man would consider that in order to prevent an accident the prohibition should be disregarded and the warning given. Neither the statute nor the by-law have anything to do with any duty at common law which may rest upon the appellant at all points upon its railway. Counsel for the respondents opened his argument with the statement that\nOur whole case is based upon the omission of the statutory duty to sound the whistle.\nFor the reasons given, the evidence, in my opinion does not enable any such finding to be made.\nNotwithstanding the argument with which respondents\u2019 counsel opened, he found himself in reality arguing that there had been a breach of duty at common law resting upon the appellant in failing to whistle when, as the freight engine was a short distance from the crossing it became, or should have become, apparent that the coal train would leave the crossing clear before the freight engine entered upon it and that the engine crew should have anticipated that some person might attempt to cross in disregard of the wig-wag, having failed to see or hear the freight by reason of the coal train and its attendant noise.\nThe first difficulty with such an argument in my opinion is that if the jury intended to find in favour of the respondents with respect to such a breach of duty they have not so framed their verdict. They have, on the contrary, founded themselves on the by-law which is limited in its application to quite a different place. If the jury intended to decide that a breach of a common law duty occurred in the vicinity of the crossing itself, as the respondent now disregard the reference in the verdict to the by-law. For myself, I think that brings us into the realm of conjecture as to whether or not the jury would have so found if they had not had present to their minds the terms of the by-law at all. Even if such a construction could properly be put upon the verdict the evidence in my opinion does not support it.\nWhat was the situation as it presented itself to the train crew of the freight train as it neared the crossing? What is the evidence? The train was travelling not faster than ten miles an hour. The coal train was moving over the crossing at about three miles per hour. The crossing was well lighted. The complaint in fact is that there was too much light. The engine-bell was ringing. The wig-wag light was operating and its bell was ringing. The approaching engine was itself clearly visible to anyone approaching the tracks before he entered upon those tracks unless such a person rushed from behind the coal train immediately it passed without waiting for it to clear the crossing by any appreciable distance so as to permit a view. The respondent driver said that the last car of the coal train had cleared the crossing by some fifty feet before he started to move his car and it must have proceeded some distance beyond that while he traversed the forty odd feet intervening between the point where he had stopped and the westerly set of tracks. There is no question that the freight engine was in plain view for anyone who cared to look before entering its path. It is quite true that the wig-wag continues to operate for some time after a receding train has left the crossing as well as for an approaching train, but in my view that is insufficient to cast upon the appellant in the circumstances here present a duty to anticipate that some person will be reckless enough to cross in reliance upon a belief that the wig-wag was connected only with a train which had passed and not with one which was approaching. The sufficiency of the protecting installations at the crossing was a matter for the Board of Transport Commissioners: Grand Trunk Railway Co. of Canada v. MacKay[3]. Something more than the possibility that the crossing signal would be disregarded by persons at the crossing was required to impose upon the crew of the approaching train the obligation to blow the whistle. I think, therefore, that there was nothing to require the appellant\u2019s servants to do other than they did.\nIn my opinion the duty resting upon the appellant in the circumstances of the case at bar cannot be put higher against the railway than as expressed by Riddell, J. in City of London v. Grand Trunk Railway Company,[4].\nthere must be knowledge that the danger is imminent; not simply knowledge that the danger is possible.\nThe circumstances present in Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada v. Hainer,[5], were very different. There was evidence in that case of wind, flurries of snow and smoke and dust from the passing freight which enabled the jury to find that the approaching express train, admittedly moving at an excessive speed, would have its headlight obscured during the approximately two seconds between the time when the one train passed and the deceased entered upon the tracks of the approaching freight. While in the case at bar there was evidence that the noise of the coal train may very well have drowned out the approach of the freight, the night was clear and there is no suggestion of smoke or dust from the coal train having any tendency to obscure the freight.\nIn my opinion there was no evidence upon which the jury, properly instructed, could have found the appellant guilty of any negligence in the circumstances. In truth the jury were not instructed at all with regard to the alleged negligence upon which the respondents now rely as no such question was even suggested at the trial.\nWhile it is no doubt always possible that some person will, like these respondents, rush across in the face of a waving wig-wag on the assumption that there is no other train than the one which has passed, I think it would be to impose too heavy a burden upon the operators of a railway to say that it is negligence to have abstained from blowing the whistle (in the absence of something more than existed in the case at bar.)\nI would allow the appeal and dismiss the action both with costs if demanded. I would dismiss the cross-appeal without costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: John MacNeil.\nSolicitor for the respondents: R. S.

In its income tax return for 1934, a loss was shown of $17.25 in the operations for that year. However, an assessment was made on a taxable income of $8,584.25, which assessment was affirmed by the Minister of National Revenue. The appellant company contended that no proper or sufficient amount was allowed for depreciation in respect of costs of development, that is, the drilling of the well. The amount allowed in the assessment by the taxing authorities was a proportionate amount fixed with reference to the value of production in the taxation year. The decision of the Minister was affirmed by the Exchequer Court of Canada. On appeal to this Court,\nHeld that the discretion of the Minister of National Revenue was not exercised in a manner contrary to the provisions of the Income War Tax Act (s. 5 (a)) nor can the method of ascertaining the allowances, used in this case, be termed unjust and unfair. The appeal must be dismissed. APPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Maclean J., dismissing the appeal of the appellant company to that Court from the affirmation by the respondent of the assessment under the Income War Tax Act on an income tax return for the fiscal year 1934.\nH. S. Patterson K.C. for the appellant.\nH. W. Riley and A. A. McGrory for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Hudson and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nHudson J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment of the late President Maclean of the Exchequer Court of Canada dismissing an appeal to that court from the respondent\u2019s affirmation of an assessment under the Income War Tax Act.\nThe appellant in the course of its business drilled an oil well which proved productive. In their income tax return for 1934 a loss was shown of $17.25 in the operations for that year. However, an assessment was made on a taxable income of $8,584.25 and on appeal this was confirmed by the Minister.\nThe appellant gave notice of dissatisfaction on a number of grounds but these have been reduced to a claim that no proper or sufficient amount was allowed for depreciation in respect of costs of development, that is, the drilling of the well.\nThe amount allowed in the assessment was a proportionate amount fixed with reference to the value of production in the taxation year in question, whereas the company claimed that the amount allowed should have been governed by the cost of development.\nThis and incidental questions were fully discussed in the court below and I am in entire agreement with the views expressed in the judgment of the learned trial judge in the case of National Petroleum Corporation v. The Minister of National Revenue[1] adopted by him in the present case. I will quote the final paragraph of that judgment:\nBut I do not think it can be said, in all the circumstances of the case, that the discretion of the Minister was exercised arbitrarily or haphazardly, or contrary to the provisions of the act, or contrary to well established practice, or upon what can be said to be obviously unsound principles, or that the allowances made can fairly be termed unreasonable, unjust or unfair. The points in issue seem to have been the subject of careful consideration by the taxing authorities, in respect of matters about which there may well be a variety of opinions. The fact that in the assessment of the appellant for 1939, and since upon actual costs, over a period of years, and not upon gross income or net income, does not impugn the validity of the discretion exercised by the Minister in 1938 and earlier years, and I do not think such an argument is a tenable one. The Minister having exercised his discretion in the manner I have already described, and having allowed deductions for depreciation and development, and also for depletion or exhaustion, that I think is the end of the matter, and I do not think I can usefully add anything further. I have not been satisfied that the assessment in question should be disturbed. My conclusion therefore is that the appeal must be dismissed and with costs.\nFor this reason I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment of Rand and Estey JJ. was delivered by\nRand J.:\u2014The question raised in this appeal is whether the Minister of National Revenue has validly exercised a discretion in his award to the appellant of what are called development and depletion allowances in respect of the sinking and operation of an oil well in the Turner Valley field of Alberta. The section of the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, chapter 97 by which provision is made for such allowances is as follows:\n5. \u201cIncome\u201d as hereinbefore defined shall for the purposes of this act be subject to the following exemptions and deductions:\u2014\n(a) Such reasonable amount as the Minister, in his discretion, may allow for depreciation, and the Minister in determining the income derived from mining and from oil and gas wells and timber limits shall make such an allowance for the exhaustion of the mines, wells and timber limits as he may deem just and fair; and in the case of leases of mines, oil and gas wells and timber limits, the lessor and the lessee shall be entitled to deduct a part of the allowance for exhaustion as they agree and in case the lessor and the lessee do not agree, the Minister shall have full power to apportion the deduction between them and his determination shall be conclusive.\nIt is objected that the mode of ascertaining the allowance is so unrelated to any accounting basis appropriate to these two items that it is fundamentally wrong and outside the scope of discretion with which the section invests the Minister.\nThe method used was embodied in an empirical formula. The base figure was the gross income less the amount of royalties payable to superior lessors of the land. The combined allowance was then fixed at 25% of the sum so ascertained. That in turn was distributed between the two items in the following manner: the amount for depletion was fixed at 25% of the net income less the allowance for development, but since the net income, at that stage, consisted of the taxable income plus the combined allowance, the amount for depletion was one-third of the taxable income. Now as the taxable income had already been ascertained, the allowance for depletion could at once be calculated, and a deduction of this sum from the total allowance gave that for development and completed the distribution. It will be seen that the relation between the two items will vary as the taxable income, itself dependent on operating expenses, fluctuates; if, for instance, there were no such expenses, the taxable income would be the net income less the allowance, but since the latter is one-quarter of the gross income, the taxable income would be three-quarters of the gross, one-third of which would exhaust the allowance, and thereby attribute the whole of it to depletion. Conversely, if the expenses of operation eliminated the taxable income by reducing the net to the amount of the allowance, depletion would disappear and the total attributed to the development costs.\nIt is conceded that in certain situations a depletion allowance could be related to net income, but it is said that the conditions of the particular resource here are such as to exclude that as a proper basis of calculation; and it is contended that in the circumstances both of these items, in order to have any accounting foundation, must be directly related, as to development, to the actual outlay, and as to depletion, to some estimate of total resource value.\nBut treating the distribution within the fixed combined allowance to be material, the method adopted has not been shown to be without foundation in accounting principle. From what appears, it is quite impossible to say that over a wide field of this kind of production the allowance will not in the end work out fairly and justly. Certainly no attempt was made to establish that it will not do that. One basis may, in a mathematical aspect, appear to be more scientific, more exact, than another: but it was not said and cannot be said categorically that the use of this practical formula will not fairly serve the purpose to be aimed at in administering this feature of the tax act: dealing justly with and promoting enterprise in the development of this kind of natural resource. Assuming then that the exercise of discretion is open to examination on the ground taken, I am unable to say that the Minister\u2019s action here was not within the compass of the section, and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Patterson, Hobbs & Patterson.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C.

C.\nThe petitioner pleaded guilty to three charges under section 436 Cr. C. and was sentenced to one year\u2019s imprisonment on each charge, to run concurrently and, in addition, he was fined 85,000 upon each charge. The petitioner paid the fines and served the additional sentence of one year. Notices of appeal against the sentence were given by the Attorneys General for Canada and for Ontario, but the appeal was not heard until after the petitioner\u2019s release from imprisonment. The appellate court ordered that the sentence be increased on each of the charges for a further term of one year to run concurrently. The petitioner was re-arrested and incarcerated. The petitioner then moved, before the Chief Justice of this Court, for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that he was detained illegally as there was no longer jurisdiction in the appellate court to increase the sentence imposed on him in view of the provisions of sections 1078 and 1079 Cr. C. Counsel for the petitioner contended that, the sentence having been served, this had \u201cthe like effect and consequences as a pardon under the great seal\u201d and that the petitioner was \u201creleased from all further or other criminal proceedings for the same cause\u201d. The application was dismissed by the Chief Justice of this Court and the applicant appealed to the Full Court from that decision.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Chief Justice of this Court ([1946] S.C.R. 532), that the appeal should be dismissed. Sections 1078 and 1079 Cr. C. must be read in connection with the right of appeal against sentence conferred by section 1013 (c) Cr. C. and with the power of a court of appeal under section 1015 Cr. C. to consider the fitness of the sentence appealed against and increase the punishment imposed by that sentence within the limits of the punishment prescribed by law for the offence of which the offender has been convicted. So read, a judgment of a court of appeal, increasing the punishment imposed by a trial court, has the same force and effect as if the latter had imposed it (subsection 2 of section 1015 Cr. C.). The \u201cpunishment endured\u201d, mentioned in section 1078 Cr. C., must refer to the punishment finally adjudged by the courts having jurisdiction.\nComments on a statement contained in the opinion of the then Chief Justice of this Court (Sir Lyman P. Duff), speaking for the Court, in re Royal Prerogative of Mercy upon Deportation Proceedings ([1933] S.C.R. 269, at 274).\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Chief Justice of this Court[1], refusing an application by the petitioner for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment of the applicant.\nS. A. Hayden K.C. and J. W. Blain for the appellant.\nJ. J. Robinette K.C. for the Attorney General for Canada.\nW. B. Common K.C. for the Attorney General for Ontario.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Rand and Kellock JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin J.:\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Chief Justice of this Court1 refusing to issue a writ of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment of the applicant. Assuming that we have jurisdiction, the appeal fails.\nThe applicant pleaded guilty to three charges under section 436 of the Criminal Code as enacted by chapter 30, section 8 of the statutes of 1939. He was sentenced by the presiding magistrate to one year\u2019s imprisonment on each charge, to run concurrently, and in addition thereto he was fined five thousand dollars upon each charge. He paid the fines and served one year in prison from which he was thereupon released. Notices of appeal against the sentence had been given by the Attorney General for Canada and by the Attorney General for Ontario within the time limited by the rules, and leave to appeal from the sentence had been duly obtained but, for reasons with which the applicant does not quarrel, the appeal was not heard by the Court of Appeal for Ontario until after the applicant\u2019s release from imprisonment. Because of this fact, it is argued that the Court of Appeal had no jurisdiction in view of the provisions of sections 1078 and 1079 of the Criminal Code, which read as follows:\n1078 (1). When any offender has been convicted of an offence not punishable with death, and has endured the punishment adjudged, or has been convicted of an offence punishable with death and the sentence of death has been commuted, and the offender has endured the punishment to which his sentence was commuted, the punishment so endured shall, as to the offence whereof the offender was so convicted, have the like effect and consequences as a pardon under the great seal.\n2. Nothing in this section contained, nor the enduring of such punishment, shall prevent or mitigate any punishment to which the offender might otherwise be lawfully sentenced on a subsequent conviction for any other offence.\n1079. When any person convicted of any offence has paid the sum adjudged to be paid, together with costs, if any, under such conviction, or has received a remission thereof from the Crown, or has suffered the imprisonment awarded for non-payment thereof, or the imprisonment awarded in the first instance, or has been discharged from his conviction by the justice in any case in which such justice may discharge such person, he shall be released from all further or other criminal proceedings for the same cause.\nThese sections must be read in connection with the right of appeal against sentence conferred by section 1013 of the Criminal Code; the power of the court of appeal under section 1015 Cr. C. to consider the fitness of the sentence appealed against and increase the punishment imposed by that sentence within the limits of the punishment prescribed by law for the offence of which the offender has been convicted; and particularly subsection 2 of section 1015 Cr. C.:\n2. A judgment whereby the court of appeal so diminishes, increases or modifies the punishment of an offender shall have the same force and effect as if it were a sentence passed by the trial court.\nSo read, the judgment of the Court of Appeal, increasing the punishment imposed by the magistrate upon the applicant, has the same force and effect as if the latter had imposed it. The \u201cpunishment adjudged\u201d, referred to in section 1078 Cr. C., must refer to the punishment ultimately adjudged on the appeal. Nothing in any of the cases referred to by Mr. Hayden bears precisely upon the point, and the statement in the opinion of Sir Lyman Duff, speaking on behalf of the Court In the Matter of a Reference as to the effect of the exercise by His Excellency the Governor General of the Royal Prerogative of Mercy upon Deportation Proceedings[2]\nwe think it is clear that the phrase \u201cpunishment adjudged\u201d in s. 1078 of the Criminal Code does not describe a punishment reduced by an act of the royal clemency but is intended to designate the punishment nominated by the original sentence\nmust be read in connection with the matter there under discussion, and \u201coriginal sentence\u201d is not confined to the sentence as in the present case of the convicting magistrate but to the ultimate disposition of the matter in accordance with the right of appeal given by the other sections of the Criminal Code.\nThe appeal is dismissed.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Estey JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014On the 22nd of September, 1944, the appellant, on a plea of guilty, was convicted at Toronto by Magistrate R. J. Browne on the following charges:\n1. During the years 1941, 1942 and 1943, at Toronto in the said county and province, and elsewhere within the jurisdiction of this honourable court, unlawfully knowingly cause to be sold and delivered by Canada Comforter Company Limited to His Majesty in the right of his Government of Canada defective air stores, to wit, mattresses, contrary to section 436 of the Criminal Code as amended by 1939, chapter 30, section 8.\n2. During the years 1941, 1942 and 1943, at Toronto in the county of York and province of Ontario, and elsewhere within the jurisdiction of this honourable court unlawfully knowingly cause to be sold and delivered by Canada Comforter Company Limited to His Majesty in the right of his Government of Canada defective military stores, to wit, mattresses contrary to section 436 of the Criminal Code, as amended by 1939, chapter 30, section 8.\n3. During the years 1941, 1942 and 1943, at Toronto in the county of York and province of Ontario and elsewhere within the jurisdiction of this honourable court unlawfully knowingly cause to be sold and delivered by Canada Comforter Company Limited to His Majesty in the right of his Government of Canada defective naval stores, to wit, mattresses contrary to section 436 of the Criminal Code as amended by 1939, chapter 30, section 8. Brown was sentenced to one year\u2019s imprisonment on each charge to run concurrently, and he was also fined $5,000 on each charge, or in default of payment of each fine two years\u2019 imprisonment, the imprisonment in default of the payment of the fine to run consecutively. The appellant paid the fines amounting to $15,000 and served the term of imprisonment imposed on him, being released from confinement in the month of July, 1945. In the meantime, in October, 1944, the Attorney General for Canada and the Attorney General for Ontario appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, from the sentence imposed by Magistrate Browne. The appeal was not heard until May 1946, by which time Brown had then served the term of imprisonment imposed on him, and had been released from gaol.\nOn May 10, 1946, the Court of Appeal for Ontario ordered that the sentence of one year on each of the three charges be varied, and increased it on each of the said charges by a further term of one year. As a consequence of this judgment, the appellant was re-arrested, and is now confined in the Kingston Penitentiary, to serve the increased sentence.\nIn June 1946, counsel for the accused made an application to the Chief Justice of Canada, for a writ of habeas corpus under the provisions of section 57 of the Supreme Court Act. This application was dismissed, and the accused now appeals to the full Court from the decision of the Chief Justice of Canada[3], pursuant to section 57 (2) of the Supreme Court Act.\nIt is submitted by the appellant that the Court of Appeal for Ontario had no jurisdiction to increase, or otherwise deal with the sentence imposed on him, in view of the provisions of sections 1078 (1) and 1079 of the Criminal Code.\nThese sections provide as follows:\n1078. (1). When any offender has been convicted of an offence not punishable with death, and has endured the punishment adjudged, or has been convicted of an offence punishable with death and the sentence of death has been commuted, and the offender has endured the punishment to which his sentence was commuted, the punishment so endured shall, as to the offence whereof the offender was so convicted, have the like effect and consequences as a pardon under the great seal.\n1079. When any person convicted of any offence has paid the sum adjudged to be paid, together with costs, if any, under such conviction, or has received a remission thereof from the Crown, or has suffered the imprisonment awarded for non-payment thereof, or the imprisonment awarded in the first instance, or has been discharged from his conviction by the justice in any case in which such justice may discharge such person, he shall be released from all further or other criminal proceedings for the same cause.\nIt is argued that the Court of Appeal for Ontario was without jurisdiction to hear the appeal of the Crown against the sentence imposed after the convicted man had served the imprisonment adjudged against him, and had been released from prison. It is further said that the imprisonment adjudged having been served and the equivalent of a pardon under the great seal having thereby been obtained under section 1078 (1) of the Criminal Code, the attempt to proceed with the appeal in these circumstances was barred by section 1079 of the Criminal Code.\nThe appeal by the Attorney General for Canada and of the Attorney General of Ontario was made pursuant to section 1013 (2) of the Criminal Code, which says:\n1013 (2). Appeal against sentence.\u2014A person convicted on indictment, or the Attorney General, or the counsel for the Crown in the trial, may, with leave of the Court of Appeal or a judge thereof, appeal to that Court against the sentence passed by the trial court, unless that sentence is one fixed by law.\nSection 1015 (2) of the Criminal Code reads:\n1015 (2). Effect of judgment.\u2014A judgment whereby the court of appeal so diminishes, increases or modifies the punishment of an offender shall have the same force and effect as if it were a sentence passed by the trial court.\nThese two sections must of course be read in conjunction with sections 1078 and 1079 Cr. C. It is clear that where an offender has \u201cendured the punishment adjudged\u201d, the imprisonment or payment of the fine has the same effect \u201cas a pardon under the great seal\u201d, and that he cannot be prosecuted a second time for the same cause. But the \u201cpunishment endured\u201d must be the one which is finally adjudged by the courts having jurisdiction. Section 1015 (2) Cr. C. can leave no possible doubt, and when a judgment of a court of appeal increases a punishment, it has the same effect as if given by a trial court. It is when the rights provided in section 1013 (2) Cr. C. have been exhausted or have not been taken advantage of, that it can be said that the punishment is finally determined. And it is consequently only when this punishment ordered by the court of appeal has been satisfied that it has the effect of a pardon under the great seal.\nAny other interpretation given to these sections would defeat the right given to the Crown to appeal against the pronouncement of too light sentences, for, if an offender is sentenced to one day in gaol and serves his punishment, the Crown would be barred from appealing against such a sentence, unless the appeal is lodged, argued and determined within that period of time.\nDealing with these sections, Chief Justice Rowell said in Rex v. Jarvis Sr.[4]:\nSections 1078-9 should receive if possible a construction which would not deprive either the Crown or the accused of the right of appeal given by the Code. This would be achieved by construing them as being subject to the right of appeal. If these sections can be so construed it removes the difficulty as to the power of the Court to grant a new trial in the case of an appeal where the fine has been paid or the punishment endured, and\u2014though not without grave doubts\u2014I have reached the conclusion they should be so construed.\nAnd in Rex v. Kirkham,[5] Martin J.A. said:\nUpon a careful consideration of the question, which is one of importance, no other conclusion is, to my mind, open than that s. 1079 does not come into operation until the question of what is the proper term of imprisonment to be \u201csuffered\u201d has been finally decided by the proper tribunal for that purpose, and therefore I should exercise the jurisdiction conferred upon me by said s. 1013 (2) by granting the motion.\nMr. Hayden has relied upon the following passage in Sir Lyman Duff\u2019s reasons in re: Royal Prerogative of Mercy upon Deportation Proceedings[6]:\nAs to the second Interrogatory, we think it is clear that the phrase \u201cpunishment adjudged\u201d in s. 1078 of the Criminal Code does not describe a punishment reduced by an act of the royal clemency but is intended to designate the punishment nominated by the original sentence.\nI do not think that the appellant can find any comfort in this citation. The words \u201coriginal sentence\u201d were not used for the purpose of conveying the idea that a judgment of a court of appeal, varying a sentence of a trial court, is not the \u201coriginal sentence\u201d, but merely to emphasize that the words \u201cpunishment adjudged\u201d, found in section 1078 of the Criminal Code, is the punishment imposed by the courts, and not the punishment as reduced by an act of the royal clemency.\nI am clearly of opinion that this appeal fails and should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] [1946] S.C.R. 532.\n1 [1946] S.C.R. 532.\n[2] [1933] S.C.R. 269, at 274.\n[3] [1946] S.C.R. 532.\n[4] (1937) 68 C.C.C. 188, at 197.\n[5] (1935) 64 C.C.C., 255, at 257.\n[6] [1933] S.C.R. 269, at 274.\n",

Common, K.C. and W.C. Bowman for the respondent. The judgment of Kerwin, Hudson and Taschereau J.J. was delivered by\nTASCHEREAU, J.:\u2014On the 31st of October, 1944, the appellant was convicted for armed robbery, robbery, forcible restraining and imprisonment of one George Butcher, and, on the 7th of May, 1945, the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] quashed this conviction and ordered a new trial.\nThe new trial took place before His Honour Judge Shea and a jury on the 19th of October, 1945, and on the 25th of October of the same year, after having been found guilty, he was sentenced to a term of fifteen years imprisonment in the Penitentiary at Kingston.\nAt the first trial, the appellant had been charged with and tried together with Benedetto Zanelli, Samuel Mancuso, Edwin MacDonald and William M. Baskett. Zanelli was also charged with the offence of receiving stolen goods. The appellant, Mancuso, Edwin MacDonald and Baskett were found guilty of armed robbery and imprisoning Butcher, but Zanelli was found guilty only of receiving stolen goods. The appellant and Mancuso appealed their convictions and sentences, and, while Mancuso\u2019s appeal was dismissed, the appellant\u2019s conviction was quashed and a new trial ordered. Having been convicted again at the second trial, MacDonald appealed, but the conviction was confirmed, the Honourable Mr. Justice Laidlaw dissenting on questions of law.\nThe facts are that on the 13th of December, 1943, a truck, containing liquor valued at many thousands of dollars, was seized in the city of Toronto by several men, one of whom was armed with an automatic pistol. The driver of the truck, named Butcher, was forcibly confined in an automobile, and the truck and its contents were taken to a barn on the premises of one Shorting, who operated a riding school known as The Lazy L. Ranch.\nThe evidence reveals that, on the 10th day of December, 1943, Mancuso (subsequently convicted of the armed robbery and unlawfully imprisoning the said Butcher), in company with one Zanelli (subsequently convicted of receiving the liquor), appeared at the riding school and arranged with Shorting to rent his barn for storage of \u201ca few cases of Christmas liquor\u201d. Wilkinson, who was an employee of Shorting and working at the school with him, was given $5.00 by Mancuso for \u201cshaking some hay\u201d over the liquor. Shorting himself received $20.00 for the use of his barn.\nIn the evening of the 12th of December, Zanelli telephoned Shorting to be at the barn at five o\u2019clock the next morning. Following these instructions, Shorting and Wilkinson went to the barn and were met there by Zanelli. Shortly thereafter, an automobile containing four or five men arrived and also the truck containing six hundred cases of liquor which were unloaded. Later the same day, Shorting, through one Moberly, notified the Toronto police that the truck and liquor were at his barn. After having taken possession of the truck and liquor, the police visited the appellant\u2019s apartment in Toronto at one p.m. the same day, and there found Mancuso, Edwin MacDonald, Baskett (all subsequently convicted of the armed robbery and unlawful imprisoning). The appellant, Kay Donavan, a man by the name of Applebaum, a whiskey salesman, and another man by the name of Taylor, who is a known bootlegger, were also present. At the appellant\u2019s trial, Shorting and Wilkinson identified the appellant as being one of the men assisting in the unloading. Shorting also stated that one other man, while doing the unloading, referred to the appellant as \u201cMickey\u201d, which was his nickname.\nThe appellant\u2019s defence was an alibi, and in giving evidence in his own defence, he swore that the stolen liquor was never mentioned in his apartment, where all the men who had committed the crime a few hours before gathered at one p.m. on the 13th of December.\nIn his dissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal, Mr. Justice Laidlaw adopted the view that the learned trial judge erred in law in instructing the jury, that, if they found Shorting or Wilkinson to be accomplices, they might find corroboration of their testimony, as to appellant\u2019s presence at the barn, in the fact and circumstances of the meeting at the appellant\u2019s apartment, and from the fact also that the appellant\u2019s denial that the stolen liquor was discussed was implausible. The second ground of dissent of Mr. Justice Laidlaw, is that counsel for the Crown improperly read to the jury, observations made by the Honourable Mr. Justice McRuer (now C. J. H. C.) in his, judgment on the previous appeal, on the credibility of the witness Shorting.\nThe crimes for which the appellant was charged are not crimes for which, under section 1002 of the Criminal Code, corroboration is essential. However, if Shorting and Wilkinson were found to be accomplices in the perpetration of the crimes with which the appellant is charged, it was imperative to give the jury the usual warning that it was possible to convict without the evidence of Shorting and Wilkinson being corroborated but that it was dangerous to do so.\nIn his address to the jury, His Honour Judge Shea who presided at the trial said:\nIt is important for you to decide that, because I have to instruct you as a matter of law that it is always dangerous to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice, though it is your legal province to do so. Please note the word \u201cuncorroborated\u201d; it means unstrengthened or unconfirmed. If you have the evidence of an accomplice, and in addition you have something independent of that evidence, which strengthens or confirms it, you have corroboration. But I must tell you here, also, that the evidence of one accomplice cannot be taken in corroboration of the evidence of another. It has to be additional evidence to that given by either one of them. It need not be direct evidence that the accused committed the crime. The evidence in corroboration must be independent evidence which affects the accused, and connecting or tending to connect him in some material circumstances.\nThe learned trial judge also explained to the jury what was an accomplice, its legal meaning, and gave various definitions. He said:\nI will read you one or two of these definitions: \u201cAn accomplice is one who knowingly * * * and in a common intent with the principal offender, unites in the completion of a crime.\u201d Or, to determine if a witness is an accomplice, ask this question: \u201cCould the witness have been indicted under the wide provisions of the Code for the offence for which the person has been convicted or is being tried?\u201d And other definition: \u201cAn accomplice is a party to the crime himself, who assists in or is a partner of the crime.\u201d One more: \u201cEvery person who knowingly, deliberately co\u2011operates with or assists or even encourages another in the completion of a crime is an accomplice.\u201d\nThe questions were, therefore: Could it be said that Shorting and Wilkinson were accomplices in the robbery of the liquor and of the imprisoning of Butcher? And if so was the proper direction given to the jury, by the trial judge, as to corroboration?\nThe definition of an accomplice is a question of law, and the determination of all the elements that are necessary to constitute corroboration is similarly a question for the trial judge. The trial judge must direct the jury as to what are the essential requirements to make a person an accomplice, and as to what is necessary to give a probative value to corroborative evidence, and it is also his duty to instruct them as to the legal evidence that must be adduced to establish complicity and corroboration. But the weighing of the facts revealed by the evidence, as to whether a person is an accomplice or not, and the question as to whether \u201ccorroborative inferences should be drawn from the evidence\u201d, are both within the exclusive province of the jury. The King v. Christie,[2]; Hubin v. The King,[3]; Vigeant v. The King,[4].\nCorroboration must be found in some other legal evidence which tends to implicate the accused. This other evidence may of course be direct or circumstantial, oral or by writing or otherwise, as long as it leads to the reasonable belief that the statement of the accomplice is true, and does not let it stand alone. This additional evidence must be independent, that is to say, it must be free from any acts or words attributable to the witness for whom corroboration is sought, otherwise this witness would be a party to his own corroboration. (The King v. Christie,[5]; Hubin v. The King,[6]. Likewise, an accomplice cannot be corroborated by another accomplice, and it is further an essential ingredient of corroboration that it should tend to show not only that a crime has been committed, but that it has been committed by the accused.\nOf course, corroboration must not be so meagre that it should create a mere possibility that the accused has committed the crime for which he is charged; it should be strong enough to sufficiently impress the mind of the jury not with the probability of a conjecture, but with the probability of the truth of a fact put in evidence. It need not be conclusive, but it will be sufficient if it is pre- sumptive, provided that the facts independently proven, and from which inferences are drawn, are consistent in tending to show the guilt of the accused, and are inconsistent with any other rational conclusion that the accused is the guilty person.\nWith deference, I am of opinion that the trial judge has properly instructed the jury as to the law and as to their duties, and that his charge is not impeachable.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario, in hearing the first appeal in Rex. v. MacDonald and Rex. v. Mancuso, came to the conclusion that a new trial in the case of MacDonald should be granted, because the learned trial judge had warned the jury that Shorting might be considered as an accomplice, but did not give the same warning as to Wilkinson. The Court properly said that the warning should have been given as to both witnesses, because the question as to whether they were accomplices or not was a question to be decided by the jury after the proper instructions had been given to them.\nBut in the present case, the situation is entirely different. The learned trial judge, after having given the proper legal definition of an accomplice, left it to the jury to determine if in fact Shorting and Wilkinson were accomplices. He then went on to explain that, if they were found to be accomplices, it was dangerous to convict the appellant on the uncorroborated evidence of Shorting and Wilkinson. He explained the legal meaning of corroboration; told all that was essential to give a legal probative value to corroborative evidence which must be of independent nature; he pointed out that something outside the evidence of the witness must be found which strengthens or confirms it; he said that the evidence of one accomplice cannot be accepted as corroboration of the evidence of another, that it need not be direct evidence, but that it may be circumstantial, as long as it connects or tends to connect the accused with the charge against him in some material circumstance. He also explained that if the jury found that they might decide that Shorting was an accomplice and Wilkinson was not, in that event, the evidence of the witness whom the jury found not to be an accomplice, could be taken as corroboration of the evidence of the other. These directions given by the trial judge are in harmony, I think, with what has been said in numerous well known cases, which have definitely established the rules that are to be followed in this country.\nAs early as in 1855 and even before, it was decided in Regina v. Stubbs[7], that the rule that a jury should not convict on the unsupported evidence of an accomplice is a rule of practice only, and not a rule of law, and that a judge should advise the jury to acquit unless the testimony of the accomplice be corroborated, not only as to the circumstances of the offence, but also as to the participation in it by the accused, and that where there are several prisoners, and the accomplice is not confirmed as to all, the jury should be directed to acquit the prisoners as to whom he is not confirmed; but it was held that this rule being a rule of practice only, if a jury choose to act on the unconfirmed testimony of the accomplice, the conviction cannot be quashed as bad in law.\nLater, in re Baskerville,[8] the Court of Criminal Appeal in England decided at page 87:\nThere is no doubt that the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice is admissible in law. See Rex v. Atwood[9]. But it has long been a rule of practice at common law for the judge to warn the jury of the danger of convicting a prisoner on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice or accomplices, and, in the discretion of the judge, to advise them not to convict upon such evidence; but the judge should point out to the jury that it is within their legal province to convict upon such unconfirmed evidence: Reg. v. Stubbs6; In re Meunier,[10].\nAt page 91 in the same case, it is said:\nWe hold that evidence in corroboration must be independent testimony which affects the accused by connecting or tending to connect him with the crime. In other words, it must be evidence which implicates him, that is, which confirms in some material particular not only the evidence that the crime has been committed, but also that the prisoner committed it. The test applicable to determine the nature and extent of the corroboration is thus the same whether the case falls within the rule of practice at common law or within that class of offence for which corroboration is required by statute. The language of the statute, \u201cimplicating the accused,\u201d compendiously incorporates the test applicable at common law in the rule of practice. The nature of the corroboration will necessarily vary according to the particular circumstances of the offence charged. It would be in a high degree dangerous to attempt to formulate the kind of evidence which would be regarded as corrobora- tion, except to say that corroborative evidence is evidence which shews or tends to shew that the story of the accomplice that the accused committed the crime is true, not merely that the crime has been committed, but that it was committed by the accused.\nThe corroboration need not be direct evidence that the accused committed the crime; it is sufficient if it is merely circumstantial evidence of his connection with the crime. A good instance of this indirect evidence is to be found in Reg. v. Birkett[11].\nReference may also be made to the Beebe case[12]; Gouin v. The King[13]; Hubin v. The King[14]; Vigeant v. The King[15].\nThe jury had, therefore, several alternatives. They could reach the conclusion that Shorting and Wilkinson were not accomplices, and convict on their uncorroborated evidence. It was open to them to believe that Wilkinson and Shorting were in no way connected with the robbery and with the imprisoning of Butcher, and that although they both might have violated the provincial liquor laws of Ontario, or might be a party to the receiving of the stolen goods, they were not implicated in the armed robbery and kidnapping. The offence of receiving stolen goods is a different offence from the one for which the appellant was charged. It has been said that under common law, the receipt of stolen goods did not constitute the receiver an accessory to the theft, but was a distinct misdemeanour punishable by fine and imprisonment. (Archibald\u2019s Criminal Pleadings Evidence and Practice, 28th edition, p. 1463).\nIn Rex v. Dumont[16], Mr. Justice Hodgins said:\nI cannot regard the widow as an accomplice. The test is: could she have been indicted under the wide provisions of our Code for the offence for which the prisoner has been convicted? If she could, then any spectator of a crime might find himself described as an accomplice, for here she only saw the first blow struck and later witnessed the carrying out of her husband.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario in Rex v. Zocanno and Burleigh[17] said:\nOn a charge of breaking and entering, a witness who was found in possession of some of the stolen property, and who subsequently became an accomplice of the accused in other crimes in connection with the disposition of some of the stolen property, is not an accomplice in respect of the crime charged. It is quite unnecessary to examine the soundness of these decisions. But the only ground, upon which they could possibly be challenged, is that the possession of recently stolen goods is evidence upon which a jury may convict of theft, but this possession creates a mere presumption, and here, there is ample evidence to justify a jury to say that the presumption has been rebutted. Rex v. Watson[18]; Baker v. The King[19].\nThe jury could also take the view that Shorting or Wilkinson was an accomplice, and that the other was not. Then, they could properly find the corroboration of one witness in the testimony of the other.\nAnother course the jury could follow was that, even if both were accomplices, they could convict without corroboration, having been on that point properly instructed by the trial judge. They knew that this was a dangerous practice to follow, but it was within their province to do so and to believe Shorting and Wilkinson.\nLastly, if they did rely on corroboration in view of the warning given by the judge, because they believed Shorting and Wilkinson to be accomplices, they had independent circumstantial evidence which was of an incriminating nature. The presence of the appellant with the perpetrators of the crime in his own apartment, and his association with them, a few hours after the robbery, was a circumstance from which the jury could reasonably draw the inference, that Shorting and Wilkinson were speaking the truth when they swore that MacDonald was in the barn helping to unload the stolen liquor. It was also for them to believe that MacDonald would not have been present at that meeting if he was not linked in some material way with the others who have been found guilty.\nAnother most extraordinary circumstance is that, when heard as a witness in his own defence, MacDonald swore that all these people gathered in his apartment after the robbery, the unloading of the stolen liquor and the imprisonment of Butcher, did not mention among themselves the stolen liquor. This statement could be regarded as implausible by the jury, and as not being an expression of the truth. The jury saw and heard MacDonald, and from his demeanour, and from what they had the right to believe as being an absence of reasonableness, they could draw their own conclusions.\nThe behaviour of a witness as well as his contradictory, or untrue statements are questions of fact from which a jury may properly infer corroboration.\nIn The King v. Christie,[20] Lord Moulton said:\nThe evidential value of the occurrence depends entirely on the behaviour of the prisoner, for the fact that some one makes a statement to him subsequently to the commission of the crime cannot in itself have any value as evidence for or against him. The only evidence for or against him is his behaviour in response to the charge, but I can see no justification for laying down as a rule of law that any particular form of response, whether of a positive or negative character, is such that it cannot in some circumstances have an evidential value. I am, therefore, of opinion that there is no rule of law that evidence cannot be given of the accused being charged with the offence and of his behaviour on hearing such charge where that behaviour amounts to a denial of his guilt.\nIn Mash v. Barley,[21] Kennedy L.J. said:\nI also agree that there may be cases in which language, whether used in a Court of justice or outside a Court of justice, may be considered as having the effect of corroboration, although there is nothing like an express admission. There may be such cases.\nUnder the circumstances of this case, I think that the jury could properly conclude that the meeting in MacDonald\u2019s apartment after the robbery, with the others who were since convicted, and his denial of any reference to the stolen liquor, were facts from which the jury, if they chose, could find elements of corroboration of Shorting\u2019s and Wilkinson\u2019s evidence. In view of the evidence adduced, these circumstances could be found consistent with appellant\u2019s guilt and inconsistent with any other rational conclusion.\nThe second ground raised by the appellant is that counsel for the Crown, in his address to the jury, read a part of the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice McRuer, in the first appeal. Mr. Justice McRuer had said:\nThe evidence of Shorting, it was argued, ought not to have been received while the charge of receiving was pending against him. I cannot agree with this contention. Nor do I think there was any impropriety in presenting the evidence of Shorting under the circumstances. Crown Counsel has a duty to offer to the Court such evidence as is available bearing on the charge in question. In many cases it is not only necessary but the duty of the Crown Counsel to call witnesses of low repute and against whom a charge may be pending. In the case of appeal it would have been quite impractical to have proceeded against Shorting on the charge of receiving until the accused had been tried on the principal charge.\nIt is argued that the reading of this extract was improper and amounted to a mistrial, because it dealt with the credibility of Shorting as a witness, which was a vital issue of the trial. It is submitted that anything Mr. Justice McRuer said was not the opinion of the Court, and that if such extracts were read, the different opinions of other judges on the same point should also have been communicated to the jury.\nThe question would be different, if in fact Mr. Justice McRuer had said anything that would tend to create a favourable impression as to Shorting\u2019s credibility; but I find nothing of that kind in that part of the judgment that was read to the jury. Obviously, Miss Parsons, counsel for the appellant, had attacked the propriety of calling Shorting as a witness and it was owing only to the position in which the Crown had found itself at the time of the first trial that Mr. Justice McRuer referred. I am unable to find anything in these remarks that can be interpreted as praising Shorting\u2019s credibility. The indirect reference to Shorting, who was the Crown\u2019s main incriminating witness against the appellant, as a man of \u201clow repute and against whom a charge may be pending\u201d is surely not a vindication of his credibility as a witness. I am far from agreeing with the proposition that the Crown should call in all circumstances a person as a witness while a criminal charge is outstanding against him, or with the propriety of Crown counsel reading the judgment of a judge who had taken part in the hearing of the previous appeal, but the reading of what Mr. Justice McRuer had said involves no miscarriage of justice.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nThe judgment of Rand and Kellock JJ. was delivered by\nRAND J.\u2014The first ground of challenge to the conviction was the direction of the trial judge that the meeting in the apartment of the accused within four or five hours of the unloading of the liquor in the barn could be taken as corroboration of the evidence given by Shorting. There were present at that time Mancuso, Baskett and Edwin MacDonald, who were afterwards convicted of the robbery, two admitted bootleggers and the accused, himself a gambler and a bootlegger. Edwin MacDonald is a brother of the accused and Baskett is married to a step-sister of a woman who lives with the accused. The car in which the truck\u2011driver was kidnapped was owned by the father-in-law of Baskett. It is not clear just how long they had been together before the detective arrived, shortly after one o\u2019clock. When he entered, Baskett, Edwin MacDonald and a bootlegger, Taylor, were in the bedroom just off the living room, with MacDonald lying on the bed; in the living room were Mancuso, the bootlegger Applebaum, and the accused, talking to Applebaum. He was described as being under the influence of liquor, with an appearance of having been up all night. On the stand, he gave reasons for the presence of the different persons in his home and denied that the liquor had been mentioned. These explanations and this denial, in the setting in which they were offered, could have been accepted only by very credulous persons.\nIt is argued that the presence of these men, characterized by the circumstances indicated, was as consistent with innocence as with guilt; that either the gathering was mere coincidence or that the thieves might have made use of the apartment to arrange for disposing of the liquor without any previous knowledge on the part of the accused. Considering all of the evidence bearing upon it, including an adverse inference from disbelief in the improbable testimony of the accused, I am unable to treat the incident as being neutral in its probative effect; that the jury could find a balance of probability tending to connect him with the robbery seems to me to be perfectly clear; and no more is necessary, Thomas v. Jones[22]. The direction was, therefore, well founded, and on this ground the appeal must fail.\nThen in his address, the Crown Prosecutor introduced a quotation from the judgment of McRuer J.A. in the appeal from the first conviction, which dealt with the pro- priety of offering Shorting as a witness when there was a charge pending against him which had been the subject of twelve adjournments, in these words:\nNow, fortunately, in this very case one of the Justices of Appeal made some comments on the propriety of the crown acting as they did with regard to Shorting. The evidence of Shorting, it was argued, \u201cought not to have been received while the charge of receiving was pending against him. I cannot agree with this contention.\u201d This is what the Justice said: I was there. \u201cnor do I think there was any impropriety in presenting the evidence of Shorting under the circumstances. Crown Counsel has a duty to offer to the Court such evidence as is available bearing on the charge in question. In many cases it is not only necessary but the duty of the Crown is to call witnesses of low repute and against whom a charge may be pending. In the case in appeal it would have been quite impractical to have proceeded against Shorting on the charge of receiving until the accused had been tried on the principal charge.\u201d\nEvidence of these and subsequent adjournments was introduced at the second trial and we are told, and it is not questioned, that, in her address, Miss Parsons stressed rigorously the importance of Shorting\u2019s evidence and the possible effect upon him of those circumstances followed by the withdrawal of the preliminary proceeding against him in 1945, a few weeks before the second trial.\nThere is no doubt the quotation ought not to have been made; it was wholly irrelevant to the matters before the jury; and if I could bring myself to the view that it might have influenced them in making up their minds on the credibility of Shorting, I would not hesitate to hold with Laidlaw J.A. that it was an impropriety to be cured only by a new trial. But when the language is carefully examined in the background of the suggestions of counsel, its application to Shorting is really derogatory; it is simply a statement by a judge of what should be obvious to an ordinary juryman; and I do not think its effect can be taken to have been more than to bring forcibly to their minds the fact that in criminal prosecutions of the order in question the Crown more often than not is compelled by the necessities of the case to offer witnesses with character or reputation possessing little to commend them to belief. This ground fails then likewise.\nThe appeal should therefore be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Horkins, Graham & Parsons.\nSolicitors for the respondent: C.P.
