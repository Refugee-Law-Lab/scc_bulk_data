C.R. 444) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], in favour of respondent on the claim to enforce an award of arbitrators, but allowing the suppliant's claim for damages.\nThe suppliant is a licensee of fishing rights in the Detroit River which the Dominion Government agreed to purchase the price to be settled by arbitration. Each party appointed an arbitrator and the two chose a third but before any proceedings were taken the Government gave notice revoking the submission and announcing its intention to abandon the purchase. The Government arbitrator having withdrawn the other two proceeded to arbitrate and made an award in favour of the suppliant for a large amount and a petition of right was filed by the suppliant to enforce the award or, in the alternative, for damages. The judge of the Exchequer Court refused enforcement but gave judgment for damages with a reference. The suppliant appealed against the refusal to enforce the award. The Crown did not cross-appeal.\nMcGregor Young K.C. for the appellant. The liability of the Crown must be determined by the law of Ontario. City of Quebec v. The Queen[2], The Queen v. Filion[3], The King v. Armstrong[4], The King v. Desrosiers[5], And section 10 of the \"Dominion Interpretation Act\" makes the law to be applied that in force when the cause of action arose.\nThe \"Arbitration Act\" applies to cases in which His Majesty is a party to an arbitration and in applying this provision there is no distinction between the Crown in right of the province and in right of the Dominion. Exchange Bank of Canada v. The Queen[6], Attorney-General of Canada v. Attorneys-General of Ontario Etc.[7].\nHogg K.C. for the respondent. No provincial legislation can bind the Crown in right of the Dominion. See Powell v. The King[8]; Burrard Power Co. v. The King[9]. And the Ontario Act could not take away the Crown's common law right to revoke the submission in this case. Attorney-Gen- eral of Canada v. Attorney-General of Ontario[10], Maritime Bank of Canada v. Receiver-General of New Brunswick[11]. And see Attorney-General of British Columbia v. Attorney-General of Canada[12], per Fournier J. at page 363.\nThe appellant is seeking to enforce an award but no such remedy is open to him against the Crown. See McQueen v. The Queen[13], Dominion Atlantic Railway Co. v. The Queen[14].\nMcGregor Young K.C. for the appellant.\nHogg K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice. \u2014 The only question that falls to be decided on this appeal is the contention of the appellant that the Crown in right of the Dominion of Canada is bound by the Ontario statute, \"The Arbitration Act,\" R.S.O. [1914] ch. 65.\nThe learned judge of the Exchequer Court holds against the view that in dealing with rights arising in any province regard must be had to the laws of the province as they were in force at the time of the passing of the \"Exchequer Court Act,\" 50 & 51 Vict. 1887. He quotes section 10 of the \"Interpretation Act,\" R.S.C. [1906] ch. 1.\nThe law shall be considered as always speaking, and whenever any matter or thing is expressed in the present tense, the same shall be applied to the circumstances as they arise, so that effect may be given to each Act and every part thereof, according to its spirit, true intent and meaning.\nAnd continues:\nI do not think the view put forward can be upheld. If such a construction were placed on the \"Exchequer Court Act\" innumerable absurdities might arise, as the statute laws of the various provinces are from time to time repealed or varied.\nSo that but for other reasons which I shall presently discuss the learned judge would apparently hold that the Dominion Crown would be bound by the \"Ontario Arbitration Act.\"\nIt may be well to clear up at once an obvious error in the suggestion that it is always the laws in force at the time of the passing of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" to which regard must be had. The error has probably arisen from judicial decisions upon clause (c) of section 16 (now sec. 20) of that Act, by which it was determined that it imposed a liability upon the Crown which did not previously exist. The Crown, however, was of course liable in many cases, as of contract for instance, before the passing of the \"Exchequer Court Act.\" Thomas v. The Queen[15]. The principle is the same however, viz., that the liability is such as existed under the laws in force in the province at the time when the Crown became liable.\nThe learned judge's holding seems rather inconsistent with his subsequent statement that\nthe local Legislature could not enact laws making the Crown, represented by the Dominion, liable.\nI think too that difficulties, not to say absurdities, may arise whether the view is taken that the liability of the Dominion Crown is to be ascertained with reference to the laws of each province as they were in force when the Crown first came under liability, or as they may be from time to time varied by the statutes of the province. The question, however, has already been settled so far as this court is concerned by judicial decision.\nIn the case of Armstrong v. The King[16], in which the cause of action arose under section 16 (c), Mr. Justice Burbidge, after referring to the case of the City of Quebec v. The Queen[17], The Queen v. Filion[18], Ryder v. The King[19], and Paul v. The King[20], added:\nI think, too, that it may be taken to be settled by the general concurrence of judicial opinion in the cases referred to that it was the intention of Parliament that the liability of the Crown should be determined by the general laws of each province in force at the time when such liability was imposed.\nOn the appeal of the same case[21], Mr. Justice Davies said:\u2014\nI think our previous decisions have settled, as far as we are concerned, the construction of the clause (c) of the 16th section of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" and determined that it not only gave jurisdiction to the Exchequer Court, but imposed a liability upon the Crown which did not previously exist and also that such liability was to be determined by the general laws of the several provinces in force at the time such liability was imposed.\nAlthough this was a case under section 16 (c) of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" by which a particular liability was for the first time imposed upon the Crown, the same principle, as I have said, must apply to all cases and the liability in each be ascertained according to the laws in force in the province at the time when the Crown first became liable in respect of such cause of action as is sued on. In other words, the local Legislature cannot subsequently vary the liability of the Dominion Crown, or at any rate, cannot add to its burden.\nThis was the opinion expressed by Mr. Justice Burbidge in Powell v. The King[22], at p. 374, where he said:\nThe question is whether an assignment of a claim against the Government of Canada, made in the Province of Ontario, gives the assignee a right to bring his petition therefor in his own name; or, in other words, whether the Crown as represented by that Government is bound by the statutes that have from time to time been passed by the Legislature of that Province to enable the assignee of a chose in action to bring an action thereon in his own name. * * * There is, I think, no reason to think that these statutes were or are binding upon the Crown; but even if it were conceded that the Crown, as represented by the Government of the Province of Ontario, was bound thereby, I should be of opinion that the Crown as represented by the Government of Canada is not bound. The only Legislature in Canada that would have power in that respect to bind the Crown, as represented by the Dominion Government, would, it seems to me, be the Parliament of Canada.\nIf I have rightly appreciated the reasoning of the learned judge of the Exchequer Court (Cassels J.), he holds that, whilst in an ordinary case the Dominion Crown would be bound by a provincial statute, the present case may be distinguished on the ground that the statute affects a prerogative right of the Crown. I find it very difficult to discover any principle on which such a conclusion could be arrived at.\nThe right to revoke a submission to arbitration was, prior to its curtailment by the Ontario statutes, one common to all subjects within that province. I do not understand how such a right as this can be considered as one of the prerogatives of the Crown, so as to base on this a conclusion that it could not be legislated against by the Provincial Legislature. It seems to me that the argument must involve any right of the Crown.\nI do not derive any assistance from the authorities referred to in the judgment. The case of Burrard Power Co. v. The King[23], involved a question of Dominion property and the \"B.N.A. Act, 1867,\" reserves to the Dominion Parliament the exclusive legislative authority over such property. The quotation from M. Chitty's book on \"The Prerogatives of the Crown\" to the effect that:\u2014\nActs of Parliament which would divert or abridge the King of his prerogatives, his interests or his remedies in the slightest degree, do not in general extend to, or bind the King, unless there are express words to that effect, seems rather pointless, since the statute now in question does expressly purport to bind the King.\nIt is, however, unnecessary for me to comment further on the judgment. I agree with Anglin J. that the provincial Act, read as a whole, cannot be interpreted as applicable, for the reasons he gives, to bind the Dominion Crown.\nAnd, in any event, the provinces have, in my opinion, neither executive, legislative nor judicial power to bind the Dominion Government. Provincial statutes which were in existence at the time when the Dominion accepted a liability form part of the law of the province by reference to which the Dominion has consented that such liability shall be ascertained and regulated, but any statutory modification of such law can only be enacted by Parliament in order to bind the Dominion Government. That this may occasionally be productive of inconvenient results is one of the inevitable consequences of a divided authority inherent in every federal system such as provided by the constitution of this country.\nI agree also with Mr. Justice Anglin that section 19 of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" merely recognizes preexisting liabilities; and cases falling within it must be decided not according to the law applicable to the subject matter as between subject and subject, but to the general law of province in which the cause of action arises applicable to the Crown in right of the Dominion.\nThe respondent, in his factum, declares that he is content to abide by the judgment of the Exchequer Court and to pay to the appellant the damages assessed by the referee. I agree with the conclusion of the judgment, though basing my opinion upon different grounds from those of the learned judge. The appeal should therefore, I think, be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant represents a suppliant who had sought by means of a petition of right to enforce an alleged award made pursuant to an alleged submission by him and the respondent to the determination of arbitrators.\nThe claim so made has been dismissed by Mr. Justice Cassels and hence this appeal.\nIt seems to me there are several rather formidable and indeed some insuperable obstacles in the way of the appellant.\nIn the first place, on the argument I asked counsel for the appellant what authority any one agreeing on behalf of respondent to the alleged submission had for doing so. He admitted he had not in fact considered that matter but said he would consider it. Since then he has been good enough to hand in a memorandum which first refers to the material in the case shewing that the object of the Minister was to serve the fish breeding establishment of the Dominion, and next refers to the \"Appropriation Acts\" of 1910, by which one appropriation of $241,725 \"to salaries, building and maintenance of fish breeding establishments\" and another for $80,575 alike thereto, had been made and then refers to the report of the Auditor-General for the fiscal year 1910-1911 ending 31st March, 1911, which shews, he says, that $101,572.34 of this appropriation was not used.\nI assume this is all that can be found and it falls very far short of anything that by implications of the most liberal kind could extend to the purchase by the Minister of a property worth nearly two hundred thousand dollars if the award is right.\nThere is no express authority to be found anywhere in these statutes relative to anything of that magnitude.\nThe Act, ch. 44 of the R.S.C. 1906, defines the Minister's duties and powers and they neither expressly nor by implication authorize the acquisition of such a costly property.\nWhat he proposed to buy was a licence of occupation for twenty-one years issued by the Province of Ontario to have the effect of a lease of certain parcels of land covered by water, for which fifty dollars a year was to be paid by the licensee.\nI can easily see authority to the Minister implied in the Act I have referred to enabling him to deal with what looked like a routine transaction even assuming the licensee were given double or treble what was apparently involved and the personal property that it was proposed to buy.\nBut when in the mind of the licensee and some of the arbitrators it became apparent that for some reason or other the transaction was going to result in one of such magnitude as seemed to transcend anything the Minister could reasonably have anticipated, he found his way out by revoking the authority given and properly did so if not bound irrevocably by the submission.\nIt is quite true he did not expressly ground it on the want of authority, but upon mistake on the part of some of the arbitrators as to the scope of the submission and what was intended thereby, which is perhaps another way of saying so.\nI have, however, no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that if the transaction involved in the award was of the magnitude it indicates, there never was authority in any one on behalf of the respondent to bind him by a submission of that kind, the arbitrators presumed to find in it, and hence the proceeding null.\nI am not overlooking the fact that Ministers every day rightly deal with what involves far more than in question herein. But the authority of some statute always has to be relied upon in the last analysis; or their conduct and contracts on behalf of respondent must be ratified by Parliament.\nAnd when it comes to a question of routine transactions each case must stand on its own merits as to whether or not it falls within the scope of what may reasonably be held to be of that character. And it must be borne in mind that even as regards contracts made by a Minister in respondent's name or on his behalf in the course of the routine discharge of duty it rests, or should rest, upon the express provision of some statute, or in the necessary implications found therein.\nThat is recognized in the order for damages to be assessed which has been made herein by the learned trial judge.\nLest, however, this vulgar mode of looking at such things should be considered as an unwarrantable assumption of the limitations of or a repudiation of the existence of the Royal prerogative, a vital force in which in the eyes of some, in regard to affairs of state at least, we must be held to live and move and have our being, let us consider the legal aspects involved from that point of view.\nLet it be observed that no one in argument impugned the doctrine of the common law, as laid down by the learned trial judge, that it was quite competent for respondent to have withdrawn from such a submission.\nReliance is placed upon the provisions of the \"Ontario Arbitration Act.\" Indeed the appellant's counsel seemed to rest his entire case thereon and the implications in the provisions of the \"Exchequer Court Act.\"\nThere seems to me to be assumed in that argument an interpretation of the provisions of the said \"Arbitration Act,\" which is by no means obvious on close examination thereof, in relation to the old well established rule, generally speaking, in the construction of Acts of Parliament, that the King is not included unless there are words to that effect.\nThe \"Arbitration Act\" in itself does include the King in these terms:\u2014\nSection 3:\u2014This Act shall apply to an arbitration to which His Majesty is a party.\nIf that had been passed in the like legislation enacted by the Dominion Parliament then there would have been an end of argument on the point.\nBut can we for a moment assume that the local Legislature intended thereby to include the Crown on behalf of the Dominion or, for that matter, on behalf of the Crown in England or elsewhere in many parts of the Empire where it stands for many varying shades of meaning in relation to the Royal prerogative?\nI cannot think so or impute to the Legislature any intention to go beyond what it was entitled to enact in relation to, and to be acting only within its proper sphere of activity.\nThe inquiring mind may see how this distribution of the Royal prerogative in the federal system has been worked out in other regards by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of the Bonanza Creek Co. v. The King[24], at pp. 578 et seq. And when we turn to the \"Interpretation Act\" of the province 7 Edw. VII. ch. 2 we find the following in section 7, subsection 5:\u2014\nThe words \"His Majesty,\" \"Her Majesty,\" \"The King,\" \"The Queen\" or \"The Crown,\" shall mean the Sovereign of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland for the time being.\nSection 7, subsection 53 of that Act provides:\u2014\nNo Act or enactment shall affect in any manner the rights of His Majesty, his Heirs or Successors, unless it is expressly stated therein that His Majesty shall be bound thereby.\nSurely these provisions can only mean in relation to that which, as a whole, relative to its own powers the Legislature was entitled to speak. If so then the enactment relied upon can only have relation to submissions in which His Majesty on behalf of the province might happen to be an actor.\nI had occasion in the recent case of Hamilton v. The King[25], to consider the possible application of Ontario Statutes of Limitation expressly made to bind the Crown, and formed a decided impression that they never could have been intended to extend to cover the case of a like question arising between the Crown and a subject relative to property held by the Crown on behalf of the Dominion and claimed to have been acquired by His Majesty's subjects by virtue of the Statutes of Limitation.\nThe more I have considered the matter the more I see nothing but confusion likely to arise in defining judicially the relative rights of the Dominion and the provinces by assuming legislation of either in this regard in attempting to fasten on the other its own view of the prerogative.\nAgain this \"Arbitration Act\" evidently was intended to work out the solution of litigious questions. And to carry into effect the principle contended for in its widest possible extent, would produce some curious results which I venture to think were neither intended nor expected.\nFor example; why was it not followed up by this appellant with the legal machinery therein provided to enforce it?\nI imagine it must have been because if ever relied upon it was concluded it would not stand such a strain.\nI must conclude it never was intended to be and hence is not applicable to a submission between respondent on behalf of the Dominion and a subject.\nProperly speaking this submission was only intended for an appraisement or valuation but unfortunately in law as laid down by Sir Alexander Cockburn in In re Hopper[26], at page 373, the terms of the submission having contemplated the examination of witnesses and a judicial investigation and determination it must be held to be a submission in arbitration. And again I am tempted to ask by what authority ? Needless, however, in my view to pursue that inquiry.\nThe other ground taken by appellant as to the applicability of the Act by means of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" fall with that view I have expressed if sound.\nThe only possible part of the \"Exchequer Court Act,\" section 20, applicable herein, is subsection (d), which is as follows:\u2014\n(d) Every claim against the Crown arising under any law of Canada or any regulation made by the Governor in Council.\nIt will be observed that the first obstacle in appellant's way is the meaning of the ambiguous expression \"any law of Canada\" which I may say has never yet been determined though considered in the case of Ryder v. The King[27], and other cases but got in that case from the majority of this court an interpretation tending to narrow its operation and defeat such contentions as appellant sets up herein.\nIn the next place, if my view of the \"Arbitration Act\" be correct, it is not a law of \"any part of Canada\" in such way as to help appellant, being limited by its very terms to the possible cases of submission by the Crown on behalf of the province and not capable of extension to any other case where the Crown is concerned.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014The appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014The Crown has not appealed against the decision of the Exchequer Court holding it answerable to the suppliant in damages for breach of a contract to purchase certain fishing rights held by him.\nThe suppliant, however, not content with this relief, seeks to have it determined that the Crown is bound by an alleged award as to the purchase price (which the agreement stipulated should be fixed by arbitration) made, after notice of revocation of the authority of the arbitrators had been given on its behalf, by two of the three arbitrators appointed to determine it.\nThe Crown maintains its right to revoke the authority of an arbitrator before the award has actually been made; the appellant denies that right.\nHe contends that the liability of the Crown under the \"Exchequer Court Act\" is to be determined according to the law of the province in which the cause of action arises; that its liability is the same as would be that of a subject under like circumstances; and that the \"Ontario Arbitration Act,\" (9 Edw. VII. ch. 35; R.S.O. 1914, ch. 65), which takes away the right of revocation and is made applicable in explicit terms to \"His Majesty,\" defined by the \"Interpretation Act\" as meaning:\u2014\nthe Sovereign of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the seas, (7 Edw. VII. ch. 2, s. 7, s. s. 5)\napplies to the Crown in right of the Dominion.\nThe cause of action arose and all the proceedings have taken place in Ontario, and, no doubt the construction and legal effect of a contract made and to be performed in any province of Canada must ordinarily be determined in the Exchequer Court according to the general law of that province.\nThere are, however, two fallacies in the appellant's contention\u2014one the assumption that liability ex contractu of the Crown in right of the Dominion depends upon the \"Exchequer Court Act;\" the other, that a series of decisions, culminating in The King v. Desrosiers[28], holding that a liability of the Crown imposed by clauses of section 20 of that Act is the same as would be that of a subject under like circumstances in the province in which the cause of action arises, applies to cases falling within section 19. This latter provision (originally found in section 58 of 38. Vict. ch. 11) does not create or impose new liabilities. Recognizing liabilities (in posse) of the Crown already existing, it confers exclusive jurisdiction in respect of them upon the Exchequer Court and regulates the remedy and relief to be administered. In regard to the matters dealt with by this section there is no ground for holding that the Crown thereby renounced whatever prerogative privileges it had theretofore enjoyed and submitted its rights and obligations to be determined and disposed of by the Court according to the law applicable in like cases between subject and subject. The reasons for which it was so held in regard to liabilities imposed by section 20, are stated by Strong C.J. in the earlier part of his dissenting judgment in The City of Quebec v. The Queen[29], See, too, The Queen v. Filion[30], The King v. Armstrong[31], and The King v. Desrosiers[32]. No other law than that applicable between subject and subject was indicated in the \"Exchequer Court Act\" as that by which these newly created liabilities should be determined. Placing upon that section a \"wide and liberal\" \u2014a \"beneficial construction\"\u2014\"the construction calculated to advance the rights of the subject by giving him an extended remedy,\"\u2014it was the view of the former learned Chief Justice, and is now the established jurisprudence of this Court, that it was thereby\nnot intended merely to give a new remedy in respect of some preexisting liability of the Crown but that it was intended to impose a liability and confer a jurisdiction by which the remedy for such new liability might be administered in every case in which a claim was made against the Crown, which, according to the existing; general law, applicable as between subject and subject, would be cognizable by the Courts.\nBut, since section 19 merely recognizes pre-existing liabilities, while responsibility in cases falling within it must, unless otherwise provided by contract or statute binding the Crown in right of the Dominion, be determined according to the law of the province in which the cause of action arises, it is not that law as applicable between subject and subject, but the general law relating to the subject-matter applicable to the Crown in right of the Dominion which governs. That law in the Province of Ontario is the English common law except in so far as it has been modified by statute binding the Crown in right of the Dominion.\nBy the English common law, while an agreement to submit any matter to arbitration has always been irrevocable like any other contract, and the breach of it entails liability for damages, the authority of the arbitrator, because in its nature revocable, might be withdrawn by any party to the submission at any time before the award was made, even though declared irrevocable by express words in the agreement. Legislative action alone could render it irrevocable. In England it was first sought to control this power of revocation by a statutory provision that every submission to arbitration might be made a rule of court (9 & 10 Wm. III., ch. 15), thus subjecting the party who might attempt to escape from carrying it out to the penalties of contempt, but still leaving him the actual power of revocation. By the Act 3 & 4 Wm. IV., ch. 42, s. 39, it was, however, expressly provided that the authority of an arbitrator under a submission containing a provision that it might be made a rule of court should not be revocable without the leave of the court. By 17 & 18 Vict. ch. 125, sec. 17, it was further enacted that every submission might be made a rule of court, unless a contrary intention should appear. It was not until 1889 that the term or condition of irrevocability, then declared to attach to every submission which did not provide otherwise, was also made applicable to the Crown (52 & 53 Vic., ch. 49, ss. 1 & 23).\nThere is no Dominion statute in point. The introduction of English law into Upper Canada in 1792 carried with it the Imperial statute 9 & 10 Wm. III., ch. 15. None of the later Imperial legislation regarding arbitrations extends to Ontario. The provincial statute, 7 Wm. IV., ch. 3, sec. 29, however, is similar in its terms to the Imperial statute 3 & 4 Wm. IV., ch. 42, sec. 39, and, since 1859 (C.S.U.C., ch. 22, sec. 179), it has been substantially the law of Ontario, as is now provided by section 5 of the \"Arbitration Act\" (R.S.O. 1914, ch. 65), that the authority of an arbitrator appointed under a submission, which does not contain a stipulation to the contrary, is irrevocable, \"except by leave of the court,\" and that every submission shall have \"the same effect as if it had been made an order of the court.\"\nThe application of this section of the \"Arbitration Act\" was first extended to the Crown in 1897 by an amendment declaring that that statute \"shall apply to any arbitration to which His Majesty is a party\" (60 Vict., ch. 16, sec. 46; R.S.O. 1914, ch. 65, sec. 3).\nUntil that provision was enacted, although a subject could not do so, the Crown in right of the province was at liberty to revoke the authority of an arbitrator appointed under a submission to which it was a party. Of course the Crown in right of the Dominion had the same right and, unless it has been taken away by the provincial statute of 1897, it still exists.\nSection 5 of the \"Ontario Arbitration Act,\" were it applicable and intra vires, would compel the Crown in right of the Dominion, if it would preserve its right of revocation, to safeguard that right by explicit reservation in every submission by it to arbitration in respect of any difference in regard to property or rights in Ontario. If that were the purview of section 3 of the \"Ontario Arbitration Act\" it would, in my opinion, be pro tanto ultra vires. Provincial legislation cannot proprio vigore take away or abridge any privilege of the Crown in right of the Dominion. An interpretation that would render it ultra vires should, of course, be placed upon a statute only if unavoidable.\nThat it was never intended that section 5 of the \"Ontario Arbitration Act\" should apply to the Crown in right of the Dominion is reasonably clear from its provisions. Thus, if applicable, it would require the Crown in right of the Dominion, should it desire to withdraw from a submission, in the absence of an express reservation therein of that right, to seek the leave of the provincial Supreme Court, (section 2 (a); \"Interpretation Act,\" section 20 (dd)), and it would purport, since the submission would \"have the same effect as if it had been made an order of court\" (i.e., of the Supreme Court of Ontario), to subject the Crown in right of the Dominion to the jurisdiction of that court, although by section 19 of the \"Exchequer Court Act\" the Dominion Parliament has given to the Exchequer Court of Canada\nexclusive original jurisdiction in all cases * * * in which the claim arises out of a contract entered into by or on behalf of the Crown (in right of the Dominion).\nThe provincial Legislature never intended to attempt anything of the sort.\nI think it may be accepted as a safe rule of construction that a reference to the Crown in a provincial statute shall be taken to be to the Crown in right of the province only, unless the statute in express terms or by necessary intendment makes it clear that the reference is to the Crown in some other sense. This would seem to be a corrollary of the rule that the Crown is not bound by a statute unless named in it. It does not at all follow that, because the liability of the Crown in right of the Dominion is to be determined by the laws of the province where the cause of action arose, that liability is governed by a provincial statute made applicable to the Crown in right of the province, since it is by the provincial law only so far as applicable to it that the liability of the Crown in right of the Dominion is governed. Nor is it a reasonable or proper inference that by executing a submission to arbitration in regard to a matter arising in any province of Canada the Crown in right of the Dominion intended to become bound in respect thereof by a provincial statute otherwise not applicable to it.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Young & McEvoy.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Hogg & Hogg.\n[1] 15 Ex.

Four years later the tanning company applied to a judge for the appointment of arbitrators under the \u201cRailway Act\u201d to determine the compensation for the right of way which the railway company, opposing the application, claimed to be entitled to without payment under an oral agreement with the president of the tanning company since deceased. The judge ordered the trial of an issue, with the railway company as plaintiff, to determine the rights of the parties and on appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division:\u2014\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that the evidence established that such an agreement was entered into.\nHeld, also, Idington J. dissenting, that the agreement was binding on the tanning company, that said company was owned and controlled by a commercial firm of which the president was the head and the partnership articles and evidence at the trial shewed that he had authority to bind the company; and that the Statute of Frauds could not be relied on to defeat the action as it was not brought to charge the defendants on a contract for the sale of land or of an interest in land. If applicable it was taken out of the statute by part performance.\nDuff J. also dissented from the judgment pronounced.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs. The facts are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nH.J. Scott K.C. for the appellants. The president had no authority to bind the company by the agreement. See Calloway v. Stobart Sons & Co.[1]\nThe possession of the railway company may be referable to the compulsory powers under the \u201cRailway Act\u201d and not to the agreement which brings the case within the Statute of Frauds. See Maddison v. Alderson[2]; Mercer v. Liverpool Railway Co.[3]\nNesbitt K.C. and Christopher Robinson for the respondents cited McKnight Construction Co. v. Vansickler[4]; McGregor v. Curry[5] and Wilson v. Cameron[6].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014This appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent began to construct its railway through the yard of the Acton Tanning Company at Acton some time in 1913. And when the latter insisted upon being compensated and proceded to have an arbitrator named, under the \u201cRailway Act\u201d in question, to fix the compensation for such expropriation, the application was opposed by respondent on the pretension that the late Walter D. Beardmore, who was the president of the said Acton Tanning Company at the time of the entry upon its lands, had assented to what was done and agreed that there should be no compensation demanded. Thereupon the application was directed to stand over until the respondent had had an opportunity to establish by means of this suit what it then alleged.\nThe learned trial judge entered judgment for the respondent and the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario has upheld same. Hence this appeal.\nThe Acton Tanning Company had, prior to the existence of the respondent, expended some forty thousand dollars in order to have sidings constructed by the Grand Trunk Railway Company connecting the line of that railway with the tanning company\u2019s works, and that railway company had expended a considerable sum besides in such construction.\nThis had apparently been done under a written agreement between the companies which is not in evidence save indirectly by reference made to it as a possible obstacle to carrying out the project of respondent as it might desire. It was admitted in argument that it had provided for the Acton Tanning Company agreeing to give the Grand Trunk Railway Company the exclusive right to the carriage of its freight. An opinion was got from the respondents\u2019 solicitors that this provision being against public policy was not binding.\nThe question of the business policy of thus ignoring an important agreement certainly was deserving of consideration on the part of others as deeply concerned in the management of the appellant company\u2019s business as the late Mr. Beardmore.\nThe further questions of discarding or at all events meddling with the works so constructed thereunder and substituting thereby the new line or rearranging the tracks to provide for that new line and the old, each having suitable access to appellant\u2019s company\u2019s business premises, also seem to be of a character that demanded they should be brought under the notice of the company\u2019s directors and shareholders.\nThe annual freight expenditure for shipment over the Grand Trunk amounted to about a hundred thousand dollars. This fact alone helps to realize the magnitude of the problems presented to appellant company by the incoming of the new line.\nThe question of the location of such a line when it was proposed to bring it through the yard of the appellant company\u2019s business premises, must necessarily have raised grave matters for the consideration of its directors if at all a matter of bargaining, as it is claimed to have been.\nOf course the respondent could probably expropriate such a route without regard to consideration thereof by any one.\nIt is said that the future extensions of the buildings had been mentioned as a possible necessity of the appellant company, but in relation thereto the selection between coming through on the north instead of the south side of said buildings was decided by the late Mr. Beardmore and that was acted on accordingly without reference to the other directors.\nThree or four different lines had been surveyed by respondent\u2019s engineers for the purpose of going through the village of Acton. It is said by the respondent that of these the most expensive was chosen by the late Mr. Beardmore. Again nobody else was consulted. For a corporate company giving away or agreeing to sell any of its lands used in and for its business premises, I venture to think no president thereof has any authority in law unless formally conferred upon him by the by-laws of the company, or at all events by the board of directors, and possibly also the majority of the shareholders. When these several extraordinary powers relative to matters involving the future of the company alleged to have been exercised by the late Mr. Beardmore were dealt with in argument, counsel for respondent did not seem to rely much upon the inherent authority of a president, but upon that contained in articles of a partnership which he referred to as a holding company.\nI shall presently advert to the provisions so relied upon, but meantime I think it well to set forth exactly what the appellant company was, and how constituted and governed.\nThe company was incorporated in the year 1889, under and by virtue of an \u201cAct respecting the incorporation of Joint Stock Companies by Letters Patent,\u201d being chapter 157 R.S.O. 1887. The majority of the shares were held by members of an unincorporated firm known as Beardmore & Company, which was composed of Walter D., George, Alfred and Frederick Beardmore. These gentlemen held shares in other companies, incorporated in like manner, I presume, to the Acton Tanning Company, and had divers establishments carried on by such like corporations or otherwise by unincorporated management.\nThe by-laws of the company provided for a board consisting of three directors to be elected annually by the shareholders of the company, of whom two should form a quorum and the majority of the members of the board should govern in all matters.\nThe president was to have a casting vote in the event of a tie. He was to call meetings of the board whenever he might deem it necessary and also at the request of two directors, each member having one day\u2019s notice of the meeting.\nHe was bound to call a meeting of the stockholders at the written request of two or more shareholders holding at least one-quarter of the capital stock of the company.\nSuch being the tenor of the by-laws there seems little ground for the implication of there being a right inherent in the president to exercise such autocratic powers as it is alleged he exercised in this instance.\nThen let us turn to the articles of partnership and see what, if any, authority they conferred on him for exercising the corporate powers of the company in such regards as involved in the momentous questions presented to him as president.\nWalter D. Beardmore was not only to the eyes of the world apparently the most active man managing these various concerns above referred to, but also, by an agreement entered into on the 31st December, 1904, between them, was constituted, it is said, the manager of the whole.\nSo much turns, in my opinion, upon the powers conferred upon the said Walter D. Beardmore by virtue of the said agreement that I think it well to get accurately seized of a fairly correct understanding thereof. I think that may be accomplished by a careful consideration of the first three sections of the said agreement, and section 11, much relied upon, and the latter part of section 7 thereof.\nThere is nothing unusual in the agreement save in the magnitude of the business if we look at it as articles of partnership. The articles provide for the continuance thereof for a period of five years from the 1st day of January, 1905; that the head office of the firm should be at the city of Toronto; that the said partnership was intended to comprise and include:\u2014\n(a) The business of the present firm of Beardmore & Co. of Toronto and Montreal.\n(b) The business of the present firm of Beardmore & Co. of Acton.\n(c) All shares of the capital stock in the Muskoka Leather Company Limited, the Acton Tanning Company Limited and the Beardmore Belting Company Limited owned by the said parties including the stock in any of the said Companies standing in the name of the wife of the first party as to which the first party undertakes to secure transfers or declarations of trust in favour of the firm forthwith on the execution of these presents.\nAnd the capital of the said partnership shall be the interest of the parties in the said premises valued as hereinafter provided, estimated to amount approximately to $1,275,000 to be contributed by the said partners approximately in the following proportions\u2014$500,000; $400,000; $250,000 and $125,000 by the first, second, third and fourth parties respectively. Said shares of stock in said companies shall continue to be held in the name of said partners individually but shall be so held in trust for the firm.\nSection 11, which I have referred to, was as follows:\n11. Each partner shall at all times give such supervision and attention to the partnership business as may be necessary for the efficient management thereof but the first party shall have the general oversight and direction of the business.\nand is really the most important in the whole document, when we come to consider what turns upon it.\nNow the proposition of law which we are gravely urged by counsel arguing for the respondent company to adopt, that the president of such a company as the tanning company, armed only with the powers conferred upon him as its president, and the clause 11 quoted above in the partnership agreement, was entitled to ignore his fellow shareholders, his partners in business, and make such a bargain conceding not only the right of way, but all that was involved in determining where the right of way was to be exercised, is to my mind not only startling but absolutely unfounded.\nBut when we find that counsel taking that stand relies upon parapraph 11 of the partnership agreement, it is necessary to consider that. I have done so, and read same many times and I fail to find therein anything but a general oversight and direction of the business. It is to be observed that it was the business that was being conducted there, and not the disposition of the property or a radical changing of its application that was being dealt with by this partnership agreement.\nAnd when we find further that the partners who executed this agreement were not the only persons concerned, but that Mr. Clark, who had for years acted as superintendent of the carrying on of the business of the company in question, held thirteen shares which had not yet become the property of any one of the partners, but which we find referred to in the following language in paragraph 7 of the agreement:\u2014\nAnd in case stock in the Acton Tanning Company Limited, now standing in the name of James E. Dunn and John Clark shall revert to said third party same shall be deemed the property of the firm,\nwe may ask how he came to be ignored.\nWe also find in the agreement when it was executed that there seems to have been a large block of stock held by the wife of the said Walter D. Beardmore. He bound himself by these articles of agreement, as appears in the passage quoted above, to procure the transfer thereof to the firm.\nI am not sure whether that ever was obtained or not but in argument it was admitted that there were thirteen shares held by Mr. Clark which had not ceased to be his property at the time in question. We find also that Walter D. Beardmore only held 35% of the entire assets at the time of the said articles, and at the time in question by a renewal thereof which was in force then, a slight fraction less than that proportion of the entire interest in these amalgamated businesses.\nI submit it is rather an untenable argument which in one breath emphatically holds that the majority of the shareholders in an incorporated company were, without any meeting, without consultation with the minority shareholders, simply because they constituted the majority, entitled to disregard the minority without going through the form of calling a meeting of the shareholders, and then in the next breath try to maintain the position that Walter D. Beardmore, who himself was only the holder of a minority of the shares, could by such slender authority as contained in paragraph 11 of the agreement, ignore the majority and deal with such an important piece of business as that in question in the way he is alleged to have done.\nIt looks very much as if either argument was only supposed to be good for the purposes of this case and that we are asked to adopt one or other of them to maintain the respondents\u2019 contention.\nI am unable to accept either proposition. I think there was no authority in Walter D. Beardmore, by virtue of his position under the articles of agreement, to make such a bargain as it is claimed he did.\nI am further of the opinion that if the majority of the shareholders had actually authorized such a transaction and ignored entirely in doing so the minority shareholder, or shareholders, in sanctioning such an agreement, they were doing so without authority in law.\nIn any way I can look at the transaction it was of such an important character that it is hard to suppose that any man of experience in business would venture upon a binding contract such as the late Walter D. Beardmore is alleged to have made without consulting his partners and fellow shareholders.\nI can understand a man in his position tentatively taking the position that it would be a wise thing for his company to consider, and on that supposition was entirely within his rights in submitting to Sir William Mackenzie the proposition for his assent.\nThat, however, is very far from the contention that is set up by the respondents. It must involve a binding bargain or amount to nothing so far as the disposition of this case is concerned. Unless there was a definite conclusive bargain made which would entitle the court to stay proceedings for arbitration under the \u201cRailway Act,\u201d this action must fail.\nWhat transpired may be very cogent evidence, if admissible at all, in the way of minimizing compensation to be awarded in such an arbitration, but with that we have nothing to do.\nThe other members of the firm, holding nearly two-thirds of the entire capital invested in the business and profits to be derived from carrying it on, had never been consulted.\nIt seems a most remarkable thing that the late Mr. Beardmore, who felt such a delicacy in acting without consulting his brothers in relation to a matter which was but a fractional part of what was involved in the very execution of the contract now set up, should write as follows:\u2014\nThe Marlborough-Blenheim,\nAtlantic City, N.J.,\nOctober 28th, 1912.\nDear Sir William:\nI have been in Boston, New York and Philadelphia, for a few days, and returning here find Ansell\u2019s (Annesley\u2019s) note (your secretary) enclosing consent to Acton crossing. Up till now I have not thought it well to mention the matter to my brothers. I am not sure that it would be policy to do so now, but you will agree with me that under the present circumstances it would hardly do for me to sign the consent without their concurrence. I expect to be home on Saturday or Sunday at the latest and will see Mr. Royce. I may tell you that a short time since when Mr. Hewson, the Grand Trunk Railway resident engineer, spoke to me about the matter, I told him at once that the G.T.R. must not look to me for any help as I would not oppose the crossing.\nVery sincerely yours,\nW.D. Beardmore. and yet he readily presumed not only to have absolute power, but to be taken as having asserted it.\nI cannot see why, and still less when we realize the relations that existed between Sir William Mackenzie and himself, and the manner in which the subject was approached and handled throughout.\nIn the course of their social intercourse, Walter D. Beardmore and the said president, Sir William Mackenzie, are said to have got into conversation on the subject of freight from the Acton company\u2019s premises, and the desirability of greater facilities of shipment therefrom. This sort of conversation had taken place more than once, but it is alleged that on an occasion shortly after the trial lines had been run, it had become apparent that one of the favourite schemes of the engineers would, if executed, come too close to the home of Willie Beardmore, son of Walter D. and a son-in-law of Sir William Mackenzie. This feature of the project led to something more definite than had previously taken place.\nA good deal, in fact a great deal, has been argued both before us and in the courts below, as to the exact nature of the final conversation on the subject.\nWalter D. Beardmore is dead and the only direct evidence of the conversation is that given by Sir William Mackenzie. Much has been said about the exact nature of the conversation and whether there was any necessity for having it corroborated by some material evidence.\nIn my view of the case I do not think I need reach a very definite opinion on many of the issues thus raised. I need only to apprehend accurately what it is that is involved in that which Sir William Mackenzie states. His statement is alleged to maintain the proposition that the company of which he is the head was to have the right to pass through the yard of the appellant, the Acton Tanning Company, in the course of constructing their road.\nIndeed he expresses the matter in somewhat different terms in the course of his evidence, but what he tried to make definite was that there was to be no cost of right of way to his company. He says:\u2014\nWe were going in there and he was not paying us to go in and we were not paying. We were not to pay anything to go in to give them the service.\nIt is quite clear that there was no definite location finally decided upon in these conversations. It is tolerably clear that they were to go through the yard but the exact spot that they were to pass over was even changed in the course of carrying out the instructions given pursuant to what the engineer, Mr. Wilkie, says in his evidence he supposed to be based upon what was a tentative agreement between Sir William Mackenzie and Mr. Beardmore.\nThere was no doubt in the service of the respondent someone as solicitor to prepare and have executed conveyances of the right of way as soon as agreed upon, and all the more likely to have that speedily completed if it was to be got for nothing. Why was that not done reif a definite and completed bargain had been ached?\nThere were accounts rendered respondents and paid, which had plainly as possible emphatically intimated that the appellants recognized no such bargain as now set up, and were waiving no claim to the usual compensation for right of way.\nThese explicit statements never were reported or denied or challenged in any way until Walter D. Beardmore had died.\nI have already intimated my decided opinion that there existed no authority in Mr. Beardmore to make such a bargain and hence it is not necessary I should enter into an elaborate examination of the question of the right to specific performance if he had.\nI venture, however, to suggest that the principles upon which courts of equity have uniformly acted in such cases of doubt and difficulty and possible injustice being done by the decree of specific performance, form an unsurmountable barrier in the way of any one seeking to enforce against those not actually parties to it, such an indefinite and incomplete arrangement resting only upon alleged conversations had with a man dead before it was sought to have it fulfilled and founded on such doubtful authority on the part of him so dead, and so inconsistent with his conduct in relation thereto in his lifetime and described by as intelligent a witness as the engineer who located the line where it is because he had been told there was a tentative agreement being made.\nIt is urged that the definite claim to compensation was not made until the road had been constructed.\nThat is no unusual occurrence in railway building or execution of works under municipal authority if the records of this court are taken as a guide.\nI think the appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs throughout.\nDUFF J.\u2014The appeal should be allowed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014This litigation is attributable to the neglect, too common in transactions between persons intimately connected by ties of friendship, marriage or blood, to apply business methods to business matters. Assuming the plaintiff\u2019s contention to be right, the most ordinary precaution for its officials to take would have been to have had a memorandum of its agreement with the defendants prepared, or a deed of the right of way executed. If, on the other hand, the defendants\u2019 position is correct, their allowing the railway company to enter and occupy a right of way through their property without opposition or protest and their subsequent inaction for at least three years evinces such neglect of most obvious business precautions that, coupled with other attendant circumstances, if affords evidence of no little cogency against the claim which they now prefer.\nThe material facts appear in the judgments delivered by the learned trial judge and in the Appellate Division.\nTo the plaintiffs\u2019 demand for a declaration that it is in possession of the right of way which it occupies through the defendants\u2019 yards under an agreement whereby, in consideration of its locating its railway where the defendants desired and paying the cost of removing certain buildings, sheds, piles of tan bark, etc., making certain improvements in the defendants\u2019 yards by filling, grading and otherwise, and providing for necessary changes in the location of Grand Trunk Railway spurs, it should obtain its right of way through the yards without other or further cost, whether for value of land taken or for injurious affection of adjacent property of the defendants, three defences are raised\u2014denial of the making of the alleged agreement; a plea of the Statute of Frauds; and a repudiation of the authority of the late Walter D. Beardmore, its president and managing director, to bind the defendant company by such an agreement if made.\nThe first question is so purely one of fact that the finding of a trial judge, unanimously affirmed on appeal, would ordinarily be conclusive upon it. What- ever agreement there was was made between Sir William Mackenzie, the president of the plaintiff railway company, and the late Walter D. Beardmore. An alleged absence of corroboration of Sir William\u2019s evidence is chiefly relied upon by appellant. After giving the circumstances that led up to the arrangement being made, Sir William\u2019s evidence was:\nMr. Nesbitt: I understood Mr. Henderson (the railway company\u2019s solicitor) to say that he had gone to see you and had told you of the southerly line? A. Yes, I was informed of the other lines and lines that it would cost less money to build.\nQ. And that Mr. Beardmore was asking you to go through there, and that they would not go there unless you said so, and I think he said something about the Davies arbitration? A. I don\u2019t remember anything about that coming up particularly, but the Beardmores were very anxious to have this accommodation, and were willing that there would be no expense to them or to us, no more than building the line. Mr Walter Beardmore is the one that talked to me about it most I think nearly all the time, but I did mention it to George at one time in my office, and he said, oh, it was all right as far as he was concerned, that Walter attended to that business. Matters went on and we went through there.\nQ. Did you have any arrangement or bargain with Mr. Walter Beardmore as to the terms on which you were going through? A. As I said this moment, there was to be no cost; we were going in there and he was not paying us to go in and we were not paying. We were not to pay anything to go in to give them the service.\nQ. It was free of cost both ways? A. Yes.\nAgain on cross-examination he said:\nWhen you were discussing the matter with Walter Beardmore, and you said he could have all this without it costing anything, had you anything in mind as the right of way? A. Why, of course, we could not give them the service without getting into the yard.\nQ. The point is that if he could get it in there without costing him anything, what arrangement was made with the Grand Trunk? The question is how you and he, at that time, understood that the right of way was to be paid for? A. We were to have free right of way, and we were to do all our own work, anything done in the yard, like re-arranging, or getting rid of any buildings, or anything of that kind.\nMr. Mowat:\nIt is suggested that you and Walter Beardmore thought it was mutually advantageous to you to have the railway close to their shops and it is suggested that Walter did this without authority, and without consultation with his brothers? A. I don\u2019t know anything about that; but I did mention it to George.\nQ. And he said, \u201cWalter is attending to that?\u201d A. He said it was all right as far as he was concerned.\nThe anxiety of the Beardmores to have the railway go through their yards is deposed to by Mrs. W.D. Beardmore and her daughter. The objection of the right of way men and engineers to this route as more costly and difficult, and its ultimate selection solely because of an explicit direction of Sir Wm. Mackenzie, and upon the understanding that he had arranged with the Beardmores for the right of way through their yards is also well established. Moreover, it is undisputed that the railway company did work of filling swamps, and holes, cutting down side hills, grading, making roads, etc., thus improving the Beardmore yards, and paid for the cost of re-arranging shipping facilities and removing tan bark and cement blocks\u2014all quite outside any obligations of a company merely carrying out a railway project in the ordinary way and attributable only to some special arrangement. But, apart from the corroboration afforded by these circumstances deposed to by several witnesses, explicit confirmation of Sir William Mackenzie\u2019s statement is given by Mr. Wicksteed, consulting engineer of the plaintiff company. He says:\nQ. Did you have anything to do with any bargain between him (W.D. Beardmore) and Sir William, or is your knowledge merely hearsay? A. Hearsay and inference. I was present at several interviews and it was quite evident to me that there was an understanding between them. That is as far as I can say.\nQ. The conversation proceeded on that basis? A. Quite so.\nQ. You were there when he was claiming that certain expenditures should be made? A. Yes.\nQ. And apparently it was assumed that they should be made by reason of a previous arrangement to that effect? A. Quite so. Sir William deputed me to arrange the details in several instances.\nQ. Where was the meeting with Mr. Beardmore held? A. In Mr. Beardmore\u2019s own office, on Front Street.\nQ. The office of Beardmore & Co. A. Yes, on Front Street. And on cross-examination:\nQ. What was your understanding as to the actual right of way on which the railway was? Who was to pay for that? A. The tenor of all the conversations that I heard between Sir William and Mr. Beardmore\u2014and I heard many\u2014was that the right of way was free. The damage such as the removal of bark piles and such things as that were to be paid.\n* * *\nMr. Mowat: You understood that the lands inside the yard were to be free? A. Yes.\nQ. Where do you say the yards ended? Where was freedom to stop and payment to begin? A. The portion occupied by the work and bark piles.\nQ. The area which would be occupied by buildings and bark piles? A. Yes.\nQ. Roughly speaking, how much would that be? How far east of the easterly building? A. I would say about half a mile altogether.\nQ. A half a mile from east to west? A. Yes, about 3\u00bd acres.\nQ. Your understanding was that outside of that the railway was to pay for the land taken at the average price in the district? A. I inferred that, at least I saw no reason to infer otherwise.\nIf corroboration were necessary I think we have more than enough here. I have not overlooked the adverse comment on Mr. Wicksteed\u2019s evidence based on a memorandum of the 18th November, 1913, in connection with voucher No. 851. Mr. Wicksteed was not confronted with that memorandum on cross-examination, as he should have been if it were proposed to rely upon it to impugn the credibility of his oral testimony. On the other hand, his letter of the 21st of October, 1913, which is in evidence, refers to the fact that running through the Beardmore property \u201chas saved us a large sum in right of way.\u201d Both these documents were before the learned trial judge. He saw and heard both Sir William Mackenzie and Mr. Wicksteed and he appears to have fully credited their testimony. The verisimilitude given it by the probabilities arising upon the surrounding circumstances no doubt weighed with the learned judge. To overturn in this court a finding thus supported and unanimouly affirmed by the court of last resort in the province is practically impossible. It must be assumed to be correct.\nFor the reasons given by the learned Chief Justice in the Common Pleas, delivering the judgment of the Appellate Division, the Statute of Frauds probably has no application. The action is not brought\nto charge (the defendants) upon any contract or sale of lands, tenements or hereditaments, or any interest in or concerning them.\nThat the respondent is rightly in possession of the right of way is not questioned. There is no suggestion that it is a trespasser. It has admittedly given some consideration therefor\u2014whether the whole or only a part is the matter in issue. The real plaintiffs are the appellants, who seek to recover an alleged balance of that consideration; the real defendant, the respondent, who resists their claim.\nIf the statute otherwise had application the case would appear to be taken out of it by part performance, The taking possession of the right of way and the construction of the railway without any proceedings having been taken under the expropriation clauses of the Railway Act, and without protest of any kind, the improvements made by the railway company in the defendants\u2019 yards and its expenditures for them on new buildings and the removal of piles of tan bark, etc.,\nmust be referred to some contract and may be referred to the alleged one; they prove the existence of some contract and are consistent with the contract alleged. Fry on Specific Performance, 5th ed., par. 582; 27 Halsbury, No. 49; Wilson v. Cameron,[7].\nThese facts\nare only consistent with the assumption of the existence of a contract the terms of which equity requires, if possible, to be ascertained and enforced. Maddison v. Alderson[8]. There remains the defence of alleged lack of authority on the part of the late Walter D. Beardmore to bind the Acton Tanning Company by the agreement to which Sir Wm. Mackenzie has deposed. The evidence puts it beyond doubt that the Acton Tanning Company was merely one of several subsidiary instrumentalities of the firm of Beardmore & Company. It was owned and controlled by, and carried on for and in the interest of that partnership. All the shares of its capital stock, except thirteen shares held by one Clark, an employee, were owned by the Beardmore partners. All its earnings, except the insignificant fraction representing the dividend on Clark\u2019s thirteen shares, passed for distribution into the partnership funds of Beardmore & Company. So negligible was Clark\u2019s position as a shareholder considered\u2014so much were he and his shares regarded as under Beardmore control, that, as Mr. Alfred Beardmore tells us, in the adjustment made when Walter D. Beardmore retired in 1915, these thirteen shares were included in the assets of Beardmore & Company.\nWalter D. Beardmore was the senior member of the partnership composed of himself and his three brothers, George, Alfred and Frederick. His interest in the firm was four-tenths. His son, Walter Williams Beardmore, speaking of his late father\u2019s position in the business, says:\u2014\nQ. Who composed the firm of Beardmore & Company? A. My father, Walter D. Beardmore, G.W. Beardmore, A.O. Beardmore and F.W. Beardmore.\nQ. Four brothers? A. Yes.\nQ. Who was the active manager? A.W.D. was. He was the head of the firm and always took the initiative in the business.\nQ. Would you say the leading part? A. Yes.\nQ. Known to the public as Beardmore & Company? A. Yes.\n* * *\nQ. What form did his activity take? A. He took part in every detail of the business, Muskoka Leather, Acton Tanning Company, Montreal and Toronto.\nQ. Would you say that he was the governing mind? A. He certainly was, and recognized by all the managers in the different departments as the one.\nQ. As the directing mind? A. Yes, as the directing mind.\n* * *\nQ. Just to follow that: I notice that in all this correspondence the name of Beardmore and Company is signed even when apparently it was the business of the Acton Company? A. Yes.\nQ. Was that common? A. Yes, quite common.\nQ. Would you say that the whole of the business for all varieties of leather so far as the public was concerned was carried on under the name of Beardmore & Company? A. Absolutely.\nMr. Alfred Beardmore says:\nQ. Your brother is the person who had the direction and control of the business? A. Yes, Walter.\nQ. He was the head of the family and the head of the business? A. Oh, yes, decidedly.\nQ. So far as the public was concerned? A. Yes.\nQ. Frederick, George and yourself were of a retiring disposition? A. Sometimes.\nMr. George Beardmore says:\nQ. Your brother Walter was very active in business prior to the time when he had the stroke? A. He always was, yes.\nQ. And so far as the public was concerned he was the outstanding figure of Beardmore & Company? A. Oh, yes, naturally, he was the head of the firm.\nMr. Frederick Beardmore was not a witness.\nThe partnership articles of Beardmore and Company include in its assets all the shares of the capital stock of, inter alia, the Acton Tanning Company, owned by the partners. They provide specifically for the manner in which the balance sheet of the Acton Tanning Company shall be prepared and they contemplate the reversion of the Clark shares to the firm.\nThey contain this clause:\n11. Each partner shall at all times give such supervision and attention to the partnership business as may be necessary for the efficient management thereof but the first party (Walter D.) shall have the general oversight and direction of the business. A short time previously, as managing director and in the course of his \u201cgeneral oversight and direction,\u201d Walter D. Beardmore had secured the entrance of the Grand Trunk Railway into the Beardmore yards by an expenditure of from $40,000 to $60,000, so important was it to the business to have direct shipping facilities by rail. That Walter Beardmore made, and was regarded as having full authority to make, this arrangement with the Grand Trunk Railway Company is the evidence of his son and is the only reasonable inference from the testimony of Alfred O. Beardmore. There is no suggestion that any resolution, formal or informal, of the directors of the Acton Tanning Company was deemed necessary for this purpose.\nSir William Mackenzie tells us that when he spoke to Mr. George Beardmore about the plaintiff company giving the Beardmores\u2019 Acton business a connection and freight service, George Beardmore told him\nIt was all right as far as he was concerned\u2014that Walter attended to that business.\nMr. George Beardmore, called as a witness, does not contradict this statement, and from his somewhat indefinite evidence, I would infer that he had known that his brother Walter was making an arrangement for bringing in the plaintiff\u2019s railway. He says:\nQ. All you can say is that he (Walter) did not talk to you about the bargain about the road coming in? A. He did not talk a great deal about it. Really I have forgotten what the conversations were. I can not fix the exact conversations that we had, but he has always consulted me upon any decisions, and in fact sometimes left them to me to decide.\nOf course it is not denied that the partners were fully aware of the advent of the plaintiff railway company and of the construction of its line and also of the work done in levelling and making roads and of the payments for removing bark piles, buildings, etc. It is equally impossible to suggest that they did not know that the railway had come in without any expropriation proceedings under some friendly arrangement, though not informed of its precise terms, or that they were ignorant that whatever arrangement was made had been entered into by the late Walter D. Beardmore on their behalf and on behalf of the company they controlled.\nHaving regard to the position he occupied and to his relations with his brothers and the Acton Tanning Company as disclosed by the evidence, I am satisfied that it was, in fact, within the authority of the late Walter D. Beardmore in the course of his management of the business of Beardmore & Company to negotiate and settle the terms on which \u201cthe advantage\u201d\u2014as Mr. Alfred Beardmore says it is\u2014of having the plaintiff\u2019s railway pass through the Beardmore yards should be secured. Their freight business with the Grand Trunk Railway amounted to $100,000 a year. A recent strike on that railway had made the desirability of a second connection very plain and the benefit to the shipper of competition in carriage is obvious. It seems to me to be quite within the scope of the authority of the president of such a company as the Acton company, entrusted with \u201cthe general oversight and direction of the business,\u201d to arrange and settle the terms on which it should obtain railway connection and shipping facilities.\nThat authority to make an agreement such as that under consideration might have been conferred by its directors on the president and managing director of a company such as the Acton Tanning Company will scarcely be questioned. That Walter D. Beardmore was held out to the world as having full authority to act for all the interests controlled by Beardmore and Company, and that Sir William Mackenzie dealt with him as clothed with that authority is the only fair conclusion from the evidence. This aspect of the case is covered by the judgment of this court in McKnight Construction Co. v. Vansickler[9].\nThere was no notice to the plaintiff or to Sir William Mackenzie of any limitation on Walter Beardmore\u2019s ostensible authority. The letter from Atlantic City of the 28th Oct., 1912, relied on by the appellants, had reference not to the terms on which the plaintiffs\u2019 railway should enter the Beardmore yards but to its crossing of the Grand Trunk Railway. Having regard to the tenor of that letter, Mr. Walter Beardmore\u2019s subsequent formal consent to that crossing would rather strongly suggest that he had consulted his partners and fellow-directors, and had secured their approval and concurrence.\nBut if that were not the case and if the other partners, who knew what had occurred in connection with the bringing in of the Grand Trunk and were aware that the only arrangement for the entrance of the plaintiff railway had been made with Walter Beardmore, did not mean to acquiesce in his authority to make a binding agreement on their behalf and on behalf of the Acton Tanning Company, their conduct in allowing it to enter their yards and to build its line of railway through them without any suggestion of opposition or of protest\u2014in demanding and accepting as having been promised by Sir William Mackenzie, benefits not usually incidental to railway construction, unless under special agreement, and in failing to institute any proceedings to recover compensation until some months after Walter Beardmore\u2019s death, four years after the railway had first come in, is to me inexplicable.\nOn the grounds, therefore, that the late Walter D. Beardmore had actual authority to make the arrangement deposed to by Sir William Mackenzie\u2014that, if not, he had ostensible authority to do so\u2014and that that arrangement has been so far acted upon and acquiesced in by the defendants that they should not now he heard to question his authority to enter into it, I conclude that the agreement, which it has been found was in fact made, is binding upon the defendants and cannot be repudiated by them.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Mowat, Maclennan, Hunter & Parkinson.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Boyce, Henderson & Boyd.\n[1] 35 Can.

Ord. N.W.T.c. 43, s. 15. G., an insolvent owing a considerable sum to the Royal Bank, leased his homestead to his son, a minor, at a rental of half the crop to be grown thereon. The son took a lease of a neighbouring farm on similar terms and assigned both leases and his interest in the crops to the bank which agreed to advance money for putting in and harvesting the crops, the father and son undertaking that the proceeds from their sale would be applied first to payment of the advances and next of the father's original debt. Later, under a covenant for further assurances in the assignments, bills of sale of the severed crops were given the bank as additional security. Under executions against G. which, to the knowledge of the bank, were in his hands when the lease was given to the son, the sheriff seized the two crops. On appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division in favour of the bank in an interpleader issue:\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J., that the transactions with the bank were not fraudulent as against the creditors of G.; that as the bank had notice, before entering into these transactions, of the executions out against G. the creditors were entitled to his share of the crop grown on the homestead; but the rest of the grain, in which G. had no interest, remained as security to the bank under the above mentioned agreements.\nPer Idington and Anglin JJ.\u2014That the son, to the knowledge of the bank, was acting throughout for his father with whom the bank was really dealing in taking security for its debt; that so far as the bills of sale of the crops were intended to secure the past debt to the bank they were fraudulent as against creditors and void; and the assignments to the bank were void under sec. 15 of the Bills of Sale Ordinance (Cons. Ord. N.W.T. ch. 43) which makes invalid any security not given for the purchase price of seed grain, which assumes to bind or affect a crop. There was a lawful seizure, therefore, of all the grain grown on the two farms. Per Idington J.\u2014The security taken by the bank was a violation of the provisions of sec. 76, s.s. 2 (e) of the Bank Act.\nPer Davies and Duff JJ. dissenting.\u2014The appeal should be dismissed. Judgment of the Appellate Division (10 Alta. L.R. 304) reversed in part.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe facts are fully stated in the head-note.\nNesbitt K.C. for the appellants referred to Kidd v. Docherty[2]; Campbell v. McKinnon[3].\nGeo. H. Montgomery K.C. and R. A. Smith for the respondent cited Fredericks v. North West Thresher Co.[4]; Cotton v. Boyd[5]; and Maskelyne and Cooke v. Smith[6].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I agree with the finding of Mr. Justice Beck, delivering the judgment of the Appellate Division, that there was nothing fraudulent about the transaction in question in this case. It was, however, a complicated one and as conflicting interests are involved it becomes necessary to decide the strict legal rights of the parties concerned.\nThe record before the court is not satisfactory as it contains merely a schedule of the principal exhibits; for such important documents as the assignments of the leases to the respondent we have nothing but an extract contained in one of the factums.\nThe position of the matter is this: J. T. C. Gwillim made a lease of his homestead farm to his son Wilfred Gwillim for one year reserving rents of $1 and one-half of the crop to be raised that year. The lessee assigned the term by way of security to the respondent. Except to receive his rent J. T. C. Gwillim had formally nothing further to do with the matter. That he may have remained on the farm and with his son raised the crop is not a fact that can have any effect on the legal rights of any parties concerned. It is said in the appellants' factum that he assigned his interest in the lease, and in the crop to be grown on the land, to the bank, but I cannot find that he ever purported to do so.\nAs to the McClure lease taken by Wilfred Gwillim and similarly assigned to the bank as security, J. T. C. Gwillim had nothing to do with this.\nNow if there were nothing else in the case, it would be clear that after harvesting the crops Wilfred Gwillim would have to hand over to his lessors the respective proportions of the crops agreed on by way of rental and the rest in each case would be his own property or to be disposed of in accordance with his arrangements with the bank.\nIt is claimed that the assignments which in terms included his right and interest in the crops to be raised during the term of the leases are invalid under the provisions of section 15 of the Bill of Sale Ordinance, chapter 43 of the Consolidated Ordinances of the North West Territories, which is as follows:\u2014\n15. No mortgage, bill of sale, lien, charge, encumbrance, conveyance, transfer or assignment hereinafter made, executed or created, and which is intended to operate and have effect as a security, shall in so far as the' same assumes to bind, comprise, apply to or affect any growing crop or crop to be grown in future in whole or in part, be valid except the same shall be made, executed or created as a security for the purchase price and interest thereon of seed grain.\nEven if the assignment were invalid it would not help the appellants if the only result were to leave the property in the balances of the crops, after handing over the rentals, vested in Wilfred Gwillim. In my opinion, however, that is not the effect of the section. It has application, I think, only in the case of an attempted assignment of the crop, not in that of an assignment of the land including the crops growing or to be grown upon it. In the case of an ordinary mortgage, the crops, before severance, are of course available to the mortgagee as part of his security.\nAfter the severance of the crops, the bank, for greater security, took from J. T. C. Gwillim and Wilfred Gwillim a bill of sale of the grain on the homestead farm, and a bill of sale from Wilfred Gwillim for that on the McClure farm. The objections offered to these bills of sale are, 1st, that at the time the bank had notice of the writs of execution, and, 2nd, that they were not duly registered as required by sections 6 and 11 of the Bills of Sale Ordinance, ch. 43, Con. Or. N. W. T.\nI think the first objection ought to prevail against the claim of the bank to J. T. C. Gwillim's one-half share of the crop on the homestead farm, not certainly on account of Rule 609 of the Alberta Rules of Court, for no rule of court could have any such effect if it were not otherwise the law. The provision has its origin in the Statute of Frauds, 29 Car. II. c. 3, s. 16, and now appears in the English Sale of Goods Act, 1893, 56 & 57 Vict. ch. 71, s. 26. It is unquestionable law.\nBut as against the rest of the grain, which I have been assuming was the property of Wilfred Gwillim, neither objection could be of any avail for he had no execution creditors and under the Bills of Sale Ordinance it is only as against creditors that bills of sale are void.\nI now come to the consideration which on the above facts and their normal consequences have led the trial judge and the Appellate Court to come to opposite conclusions. The trial judge thought that the whole transaction was a sham designed to afford an unfair preference to the bank, one amongst a number of J. T. C. Gwillim's creditors. Mr Justice Beck in the Appellate Division, on the other hand, found no evidence of fraud in the transaction which he thought was a legitimate attempt\" to create with the assistance of the bank a valuable asset in the hands of the debtor who in return for such assistance was to allow it to be used after liquidating the advances required for its production in discharge of the bank's existing claim, the balance, if any, being available as an asset in the hands of the then insolvent debtor for his other creditors.\nThere were certainly underlying motives which do not appear on the face of the transaction, but I think Mr. Justice Beck has taken the correct view and as I have already said, I can see nothing fraudulent in the proceeding which did not remove any property of the debtor out of the reach of his creditors, and by which they could not possibly be damaged. I do not see how they can legitimately object to the respondent having the benefit of property which but for its intervention and the arrangement effected, would never have come into existence.\nAt first sight it undoubtedly appears to be a ground of suspicion that the son Wilfred should admit the existence of a debt due by himself to the bank which he did not owe. This, however, was a family arrangement. The connection between the father of a family living on and working a farm with the aid of his minor sons is a very close one. The incapacity of the father for want of means to work his farm would mean want of work for the son as well and destitution for the whole family. I do not think it is fair under such circumstances to say that the son had nothing to gain by the transaction. The interest of the family was a matter of concern to him and one in which his own interest was bound up. He, of course, adventuring nothing, had nothing to lose by the transaction. If the father, owing to his insolvency, was unable to obtain the necessary advances to work his homestead farm, I do not see why the son should not undertake it and in return for the assistance afforded by the bank accept a liability for his father's debt limited to being discharged out of property to be produced as the result of his operations.\nI may add that I think we should strive as far as possible to uphold the transaction. It is a matter of public policy that crops should be raised on the land rather than that it should lie idle. The legislature has recognized this by providing in the \"Act respecting seed, grain, fodder and other relief\" being ch. 14 of the Statutes of Alberta, 1915, that a charge representing money and interest agreed to be paid in consideration of the advance of seed, grain and fodder for animals shall take priority over all other liens, taxes, charges or other encumbrances.\nIn the result the appeal should be allowed to the extent of one-half of the crop grown on the homestead farm and judgment entered on the issue that so much of the goods being part of the goods seized under the execution were at the time of the said seizure the property of the said J. T. C. Gwillim.\nThere will be no costs to either party. The half share of J. T. C. Gwillim of the crop as rental had not been delivered, and was not strictly liable to be taken in execution, and the appellants will therefore pay the sheriff's costs. DAVIES J. (dissenting)\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of Alberta holding in an interpleader issue between appellants as execution creditors of J. T. C. Gwillim and the respondent, that the latter was entitled to the crops grown upon a homestead quarter section owned by said Gwillim and upon a half section leased by the infant son of said Gwillim from a third party.\nThe learned trial judge found, as a fact, that said infant son was but the alter ego of the debtor who was insolvent at the time of the making of said lease.\nThis finding of fact can hardly be disputed under all the surrounding facts and circumstances unless we discard common sense in dealing with the matter. I, therefore, throughout accept the finding as determining so far as it goes the relations and rights of the parties.\nThe executions against Gwillim had been placed in the sheriff's hands at various times from the year 1910, to the year 1915, and had been kept renewed and in force until the trial in 1916, covering thus the periods in question when the several transactions took place upon which the respondent's claim is founded, and the seizure by the sheriff.\nIt is somewhat difficult to understand how a judgment debtor could enter into any transaction whereby he could transfer property as if free from encumbrance within the bailiwick of a sheriff holding such executions.\nYet by reason of some discussion of points of law which I respectfully submit are more or less irrelevant to the business in hand, such seems to have been the result of the judgment appealed from, that it is held possible to so transfer. A solution of the problem of whether or not a bargain for the transfer of nonexistent property falls within the Statute of Elizabeth surely has little relation to the real question presented by the facts found herein.\nThat question is whether or not there can be upheld as against existent executions, an assignment of a lease held by a judgment debtor or his alter ego, in the presence of such an array of executions well known to the assignee and in law binding the lease if as found the property of the debtor. For the title of the respondent to the crop as against appellant depends entirely upon the assignment of the lease procured in the son's name.\nSuch result I submit should not be reached if we pay heed to the peculiar facts and circumstances in this case and the law relative to the effect of executions which we find in No. 609 of the Alberta Rules of Court, as follows:\u2014\nSubject to the provisions of any statute a writ of execution shall bind the goods of the judgment debtor from the time of delivery thereof for execution to the Sheriff of the Judicial District within which the goods are situate, but not so as to prejudice the title to such goods acquired by any person in good faith and for valuable consideration, unless such person had, at the time when he acquired his title, notice that such writ had been delivered to the sheriff and remained in his hands unexecuted.\nTo understand properly the foregoing and what I am about to express hereafter requires a knowledge of the actual transactions which took place between the parties and are involved in the maintenance of the respondent's claim. The judgment debtor was possessed of a homestead free from liability to seizure. The exemption therefrom, however, did not extend to the crops grown thereon, save the limited quantity exempted for seed and six months' provisions. In his insolvent condition he bethought himself of a scheme whereby he might save these crops thus liable from the above mentioned executions. He decided to lease the homestead to his infant son then 17 years of age and made a lease dated 1st March, 1915, purporting to be for one year from said date, for the yearly rental of $1. This was drawn upon a printed form which had inserted at the end thereof a typewriten covenant by the lessee with the lessor to cultivate the land in a good and husbandlike manner, and at the proper season seed the same in wheat or other grain as the lessor might consent to, and harvest and thresh the crops in due season at his own expense, and immediately after threshing deliver in the name of the lessor at the nearest elevator a one-half share in kind as the same came from the machine of all wheat and other grain grown upon the said land, which was to be by way of additional rent to that reserved as above. This was followed by a covenant to furnish the lessee with all grain necessary for the seeding. The lease was assigned on the 20th day of May, 1915, by the said infant son to the respondent, by an assignment which recited the making of the lease; that by the terms thereof the lessee was entitled to one-half of the crop to be raised on the said lands during the said term; that the said lessee was then indebted to the respondent in the sum of $2,513, which represented a past indebtedness of the party hereto of the first part as a customer and that in order to better secure the party of the second part the repayment of the said indebtedness, the said lessee had agreed to execute the assignment.\nThe instrument proceeds then, in the operative part, to transfer all the interests acquired under the lease, and his said share of the crop, followed by a covenant that he would on request execute such further assurance as the respondent might require. That was followed by a proviso that the instrument was only to operate as and by way of collateral and additional security to the said indebtedness, and as soon as the same is fully paid and satisfied should cease and become void and of no further effect. The judgment debtor, though not a party to the instrument, signs as if he were and the signatures are followed by a paragraph which acknowledges this assignment as signified by his signature thereto. This, though clumsily done, no doubt was intended to be, and was, effective only for the purpose of assenting to the assignment by the lessee who was prohibited from assigning without leave.\nOn the 8th April, 1915, a memorandum was made which provided that Mr. Gwillim (without stating which of them) agreed to lease 250 acres or more of section 15, township 11, range 21, from Mr. Oliver; Gwillim to furnish the seed and do all the necessary work connected with the seeding and harvesting, Oliver to pay one-third of the threshing bills; Mr. Gwillim agreeing to give Mr. Oliver one-third of the crop delivered at the elevator. This informal scrap of paper is signed by Wilfred Gwillim and N. W. Oliver in the presence of one Fletcher.\nThis lease was assigned on the 19th of May, 1915, by the said Wilfred Gwillim to the respondent by an assignment which recited the making of the said memorandum, the terms thereof, and that the said Wilfred Gwillim was then indebted to the respondent in the sum of $2,513, which represented a past indebtedness as a customer, and that in order to secure the respondent the repayment of the said indebtedness he agreed to execute the instrument. By the operative part of the said assignment, in consideration of the said indebtedness, the said Wilfred Gwillim assigned all his rights, titles, estate and interest both legal and equitable in and to the lease and land mentioned and to his share of the crop so to be raised thereon, as aforesaid. The instrument further provided for further assurances such as required and might be necessary in relation to the premises, but that notwithstanding anything to the contrary was to operate merely as and by way of collateral and additional security to the said indebtedness and as soon as the same was fully paid and satisfied these presents should cease and become void. These assignments of leases were drawn by the solicitor of the bank.\nThe grain now in question in this issue was grown for the greater part on this last mentioned parcel of land. Some of it was the product of farming the homestead. If the two transactions had been kept throughout entirely separate and independent of each other, different considerations possibly might be applied to the resulting effect upon the validity of part of the respondent's claim.\nAs I understand the facts, however, the assignments though dated on different days were but the result of one agreement which had been made between the respondent and the judgment debtor whereby they were to finance the operations under the said lease, and they had made advances accordingly. I assume for the present that the indebtedness owing by the lessee was that owing by the father. The first question that arises is what titles could pass to the bank by the last mentioned assignment?\nThese executions bound the term created by the lease from the landlord Oliver to the infant son of the debtor as his alter ego.\nOf the notice to the respondent of these executions there is left no manner of doubt for its agent, who had the business in charge and procured the assignment of that lease, says expressly as follows:\u2014\nQ. Then he was in difficulties with other people besides the bank?\nA. Oh, yes.\nQ. For how long had you known he was in that condition?\nA. Quite a long time, I think, in fact back as far as 1912.\nQ. Had you any difficulty with his account in any way, by reason of these other creditors trying to attach it or anything of that kind?\nA. I don't remember anything of that.\nQ. Do you know whether or not they had judgments or executions against him?\nA. Oh, yes.\nQ. And he was in that condition of having a lot of executions outstanding for a year or two before this transaction took place?\nA. Yes.\nQ. So that the trust account was opened for that purpose, so that it could not be seized on executions?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Had the son ever had an account with the bank?\nA. No.\nIt seems absurdly comical to try to rest a claim to these crops grown upon the land leased from Oliver by reason of an assignment of a term which is itself bound by the executions and through the term so bound entitles the execution creditors to all the fruits derivable from the lease.\nI will deal with the lease of the homestead to the son presently so far as its peculiar features and all relative thereto suggest a possibility of differentiating them in favour of respondent.\nMeanwhile I wish to follow up the other grounds upon which the respondent's claim as a whole is rested.\nThe respondent was approached by the father who was notoriously insolvent and owed it from $2,000 to $3,000, (possibly the $2,513 referred to in the assignment though not proven), with several suggestions rejected, and finally with this scheme of a lease to his son of the homestead, and that to the son by Oliver being assigned to respondent and it would make ad- vances to help carry on the farm and get the crops as security.\nThe respondent assented to the proposal and made advances accordingly before and after the bank's solicitor had prepared the assignments of the said leases and got them executed.\nMr. Justice Beck says the father and son signed jointly a note to the bank for $2,513 being the amount then owing by the father to the bank, and that the assignments of leases declared they were given to secure that.\nI cannot find that in the evidence which is obscure on the point. Possibly the facts were cleared up by admissions of counsel before the court below in a way we were not favoured with, or more probably he only assumed the fact from the recital, which assumption is not borne out by the evidence.\nThe respondent's agent in his examination seems to indicate that there was a joint note for the old debt as Mr. Justice Beck suggests, but on being shewn the bundle of exhibits failed to identify any such note and pointed to a note for $1,700, dated the very day one of those assignments was given, which destroys the assumption and hence I must deal with that aspect of the case alternatively.\nAssuming first Mr. Justice Beck's impression correct, then it is to be observed that there is nothing in the assignments of the leases which secures anything beyond that sum, for they each expressly provide that upon the payment of the said sum then the assignment is void. And neither professes that there is anything secured beyond that sum, or any ulterior purpose to be served by reason of any such assignment.\nYet it is contended that the respondent was in some way secured by said assignment for the advances made by respondent for seed wheat for the Oliver place, and other expenses of operating these farms during that season of 1915. On what does it rest?\nClearly it cannot rest on these instruments which are expressly confined to the securing of the old indebtedness to the extent of $2,513.\nIf they could be upheld as against the execution creditors the proper judgment would be to restrict the claim to that sum and that alone.\nThe son, however, being but the agent or tool of the judgment debtor father in taking the Oliver lease and, as already pointed out, the same being bound by the executions, that part of the crop cannot be held by respondent even for the old indebtedness.\nWhat then can such claim rest upon?\nThe agent of respondent many times in course of his examinations says he expected he would get the crops to repay the advances first for 1915 and then have a right to apply so much of the balance as needed to pay the old indebtedness.\nI rather think it was a mere expectation that he should be enabled to do so by the goodwill of the father and that the assignment of the leases was but a lever, as it were, which would help in some way to secure a future assignment thereof.\nThe fact that the assignments made no provision therefor, except in relation to the past indebtedness, and yet were followed in September by bills of sale which respectively pretend to have been made pursuant to a mere covenant for further assurance, is most suggestive.\nThese bills of sale were apparently prepared as early as August but failed of prompt execution for some unexplained reason. The agent of the respondent in his evidence puts the matter of agreement for and nature of title, thus:\u2014\nQ. And you got the son to assign everything to the bank and you considered the son had no further interest in the crop?\nA. The agreement that we had, as I said before, was that when the crop was harvested the first money received would go to pay the new debt contracted by the father and son; when that was paid any further moneys would first go to pay the old indebtedness to the bank.\nQ. And what would become of the balance?\nA. The balance they stated they intended to pay on other liabilities.\nQ. Whose?\nA. Gwillim's.\nQ. Which Gwillim?\nA. J. T. C. Gwillim.\nQ. Then I am correct in saying that the son had no interest in the crop at all after he had turned these securities over to you?\nA. Well, I could not say that; he was doing the work and presume he would get certain pay from it.\nQ. What I mean is, as far as the crop itself was concerned, you would consider that any balance would go to pay the father's debts?\nA. That's the agreement upon which I\u2014the bank\u2014advanced them the money; first get that paid up and then the old indebtedness, and on that understanding the bank loaned them the money to put the crop in.\nQ. You were asked in Toronto (Q. 96): \" So far as you were concerned you were treating the whole proceedings of that account as being properly accountable to the father? Answer, Yes.\"\nA. All the proceeds of the crop would certainly go to the trust account of J. T. C. Gwillim, and be disbursed from that account.\nQ. The son had no right to sign cheques on that account?\nA. No.\nQ. He was a minor?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Now, these assignments and bills of sale were taken by way of collateral security to the indebtedness, not taken as transfers of the crop to you as to the bank?\nA. The bill of sale was.\nQ. The bills of sale?\nA. That's the way I understood it.\nQ. But you were to account for any surplus to the trust account?\nA. Yes.\nQ. The bill of sale was then not really an actual bill of sale as we understand it, but by way of mortgage?\nA. Yes, I presume it is. We were not buying the crop.\nQ. You have already told us that you had knowledge of the executions that were outstanding at the time?\nA. Yes. Why did the business take this most circuitous course? Why did the assignments not provide for it all? Can there be a shadow of doubt that it was because the agent and his solicitors were confronted with two well known statutory provisions against such agreements?\nIn the first place the \"Banking Act\" by section 76, s.s. 2 (c), prohibits that and other like dealings, as follows:\u2014\n2. Except as authorized by this Act, the bank shall not, either directly or indirectly,\u2014\n* * * * *\n(c) lend money or make advances upon the security, mortgage or hypothecation of any lands, tenements or immovable property, or of any ships or other vessels, or upon the security of any goods, wares or merchandise.\nIt is apparently assumed by the judgment appealed from that the crops were on the date of these assignments of leases non-existent. If we would apply common knowledge to at least the wheat crops and probably all, they had by 20th May been growing for a long time and were just as assignable and exigible then as ever, but being chattels were goods upon which, under the circumstances, the bank could not advance.\nAnd in the next place there had stood for twenty years an enactment in force in the North West Territories, and in Alberta since its creation, which for good reasons had prohibited any such bargain as might create just such a claim as in question herein.\nThat enactment is section 15 of the Bills of Sale Ordinance, as follows:\u2014\n15. No mortgage, bill of sale, lien, charge, encumbrance, conveyance, transfer or assignment hereafter made, executed or created and which is intended to operate and have effect as a security shall in so far as the same assumes to bind, comprise, apply to or affect any growing crop or crop to be grown in future in whole or in part, be valid except the same shall be made, executed or created as a security for the purchase price and interest thereon of seed grain. It would be difficult to use more comprehensive language than in this enactment prohibiting bargaining for a\nsecurity upon a growing crop or crop to be grown in the future.\nEither the share of the crop was within the express words of the operative part of each assignment of the lease in question or it was not.\nIf it was within them clearly there was an express infringement of the very language of the statute for each of the instruments so assigning the said share of crop was on its face intended to be by way of security only and the evidence of respondent's agent puts that beyond all peradventure.\nIf it was so intended then I incline to think and submit that each of the assignments of the said leases designed to produce such effect was itself by reason thereof void, for the whole purpose thereof was to procure that forbidden by the law.\nWhen we find that the bank held a second mortgage on the homestead, and a chattel mortgage on the stock not seized, which together according to the agent's evidence, seemed ample, the whole transactions seem designed in truth only to secure the advances for 1915, and thus falling within both statutory prohibitions and hence void.\nAnd if it can be said that this illegal part of each of the objects of the instruments are severable from the legal then, at all events so far as they may have the contravention of the statute in view or be intended to give vitality to a contract declared invalid, they must be held null and void,\nI fail to see how the parts are severable, for what you cannot do directly you cannot do indirectly.\nIf there is no such contract, then there is no foundation for the respondent's claim. And if, as I have already observed, these crops were growing (as in all human probability they were) on the date of each assignment, the executions then in the sheriff's hands bound them.\nDoubtless it was on account of these manifest objections in law to the assignments and that contained therein, that more explicit provision was not made therein and hope was rested on the peculiar provisions by way of future assurances which was inserted in each and a foundation laid for the bills of sale which on their face are alleged to be made pursuant thereto.\nThe scheme seems to have miscarried for the respective bills of sale relating to each crop or share thereof which was the only other ground upon which the claim has been rested, was one which the respondent's counsel did not seem disposed in argument here to attempt to rest his client's claim upon.\nIt is difficult to see how he could, for clearly they were each intended to be instruments which in fact were only mortgages and there was no pretence of any compliance with the statute in such case provided relative to the affidavit to be made.\nThat statute by section 6, provides as follows:\u2014\n6. Every mortgage or conveyance intended to operate as a mortgage of goods and chattels which is not accompanied by an immediate delivery and an actual and continued change of possession of the things mortgaged shall within thirty days from the execution thereof be registered as hereinafter provided together with the affidavit of a witness thereto of the due execution of such a mortgage or conveyance and also with the affidavits of the mortgagee or one of the several mortgagees or the agent of the mortgagee or mortgagees if such agent is aware of all the circumstances connected therewith and is properly authorized by power in writing to take such mortgage in which case a copy of such authority shall be attached thereto (save as is hereafter provided under section 21 hereof) such last mentioned affidavit stating that the mortgagor therein named is justly and truly indebted to the mortgagee in the sum mentioned in the mortgage, that it was executed in good faith, and for the express purpose of securing the payment of money justly due or accruing due, and not for the purpose of protecting the goods and chattels mentioned therein against the creditors of the mortgagor or of preventing the creditors of such mortgagor from obtaining payment of any claim against him; and every such mortgage or conveyance shall operate or take effect upon, from and after the day and time of the filing thereof.\nThere was no pretence of its observance. They were not only vitiated thereby, but as being in fact founded upon what was illegal, were doubly so.\nAs to the contention that the transfers were preferential it seems hardly necessary to dwell upon that when in my view, as already expressed, the executions well known to the agent of the bank bound everything and prevented any of these several contrivances from having any validity as against the execution creditors now appellants.\nComing to the lease of the homestead from father to son and the question arising peculiar to it, and all implied therein, we find that one-half of that crop belonged by the terms of the lease to the judgment debtor, and there does not appear a tittle of evidence that he ever assigned that to the respondent except by the bills of sale already referred to.\nThe assignment of the lease by the son to the respondent could not have such effect, and the father's assent to that assignment could not enlarge its operations, but only waive the covenant of the lessee against assignment of the term.\nWhat answer can be made to this I am unable to understand, and hence clearly his half of the crop rightly seized.\nAll the authorities relied upon cannot and do not help. It is quite clear that a man can assign without impediment, his homestead, absolutely or any part thereof, to a stranger. But, as already stated, the law does not exempt the crops he may grow thereon. And a lease cannot help him out of that difficulty. The lease itself, or rather the term created, is chattel property liable to execution against chattels, and need not touch the legal estate in the land.\nAgain it would be quite competent for the owner of a homestead to bargain for the sale of a part of his crop without offending against the provisions of section 15 of the Bills of Sale Ordinance; and hence many of the cases cited and relied upon are maintainable for that reason.\nThe share of the crop which the son was to retain by the terms of the lease of the homestead would, but for the peculiarities of the case I am about to advert to, have been at his disposal and for valuable consideration could have been assigned to a purchaser. But that is not what was attempted, nor could it be in the case of a bank by reason of its incapacity to so bargain.\nThe son owed the bank nothing until he signed as surety for his father cotemporaneously with the assignments of the leases, and how that could be properly termed a past indebtedness so far as he was concerned, puzzles one.\nThe truth is the whole scheme was framed by the father to defeat his creditors and had created at the moment of putting it in force a term which was properly seizable by sheriff under executions. It seems idle to say there was no present property to be affected, for not only did the term exist when the respondent took an assignment of it, but also the growing crops.\nIt is not only the Statute of Elizabeth, but also the common law long before it, that forbade the fraudulent transfer of that which was exigible.\nAnd with great respect it seems to me that there is a misapprehension of the scope of the case of Blakely v. Gould[7], which was the assignment of a non-exigible contract that was in question, in assuming that it touches this case where at the very inception of the transaction in question there was the creation of a term which was exigible as were also the growing crops when the respondent knowing the facts and purpose thereof accepted the assignment and still more when it accepted the bills of sale.\nIt is from these points of view that the purpose of the debtor must be held to have a bearing. And that purpose formed in his own mind until something was done in pursuance of it, could injure no one, but can be looked at and considered when effect is actively given to it in order to affect and transfer that which is exigible and defeat the executions binding same.\nHowever all that may be the many other grounds already fully stated render it unnecessary to pursue the subject.\nI think if the advance, about $500, for seed grain made by the respondent could have been, and I imagine it might have been, severed, if at the time and possibly at the trial attention had been given the matter, it ought to have been maintained unless possibly for the offence against the \"Banking Act.\"\nThe respondents have chosen otherwise. I think the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout.\nDUFF J. (dissenting)\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I am, with respect, of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed.\nThe findings of the learned trial judge, that the lease from J. T. C. Gwillim, the father and execution debtor, to Wilfred Gwillim, his minor son, was made with the object of defeating or hindering the creditors of the former; that the lease of the McClure farm was taken by Wilfred for his father; that Wilfred had no real beneficial interest in either property; and that, at all events as against the father's creditors, the lease to the son of the homestead must be looked upon as non-existent and the father must be deemed the lessee of the McClure property, appear to be so fully warranted by the evidence that they cannot be disturbed. The father's insolvency and the bank's knowledge of it, likewise found, are incontrovertible. However, I accept the finding made by the Appellate Division, although in reversal of that of the trial judge, that there was no intent on the part of the bank manager to defeat, hinder or delay the creditors of J. T. C. Gwillim, and I deal with the case on the assumption that the honest purpose of the bank was by advancing money to J. T. C. Gwillim to enable him to grow and harvest a crop, which he probably otherwise would have been unable to do, from the proceeds of which all parties interested\u2014the bank, Gwillim himself, and his other creditors\u2014might benefit. I am fully satisfied, however, that the bank manager knew that Wilfred was a mere \"stool pigeon\" for his father, that the latter was the sole beneficial owner, and that the bank's real transaction was with him as such and with him alone.\nFor a past indebtedness to it of $2,513 (a debt of his father which Wilfred purported to assume) the Royal Bank on the 19th May, 1915, took as security assignments from Wilfred Gwillim of the two leases above mentioned and of the assignor's share in the crops to be grown on the leased premises. These assignments expressly provide that they shall operate only as collateral security for the existing indebtedness and that the assignor shall retain possession and deliver his share of the crops, when grown and harvested, to the nearest elevator in the name of the bank. They also contain covenants for further assurance. Strangely enough, however, they make no reference to further advances. Yet it seems reasonably clear that they were intended to secure further advances to be made by the bank to enable J. T. C. Gwillim to produce and harvest the crops. The evidence of the bank manager puts it beyond doubt that he so regarded the assignments and also that it was only upon the crops growing or to be grown that substantial security was to be obtained thereby. The leases themselves, apart from the crops, had no substantial value, as the respondent in its factum very frankly admits.\nWhether because he doubted the efficacy of the bank's security on the crops, or because he wished to provide expressly that they should stand as security for the additional advances made after the assignments of the leases were taken, the bank manager, on the 15th of September after the crops had been severed, took from Wilfred Gwillim and J. T. C. Gwillim a bill of sale of the entire crop grown on the Gwillim homestead and from Wilfred Gwillim a bill of sale of his share of the crop grown on the McClure property, the consideration in each document being stated to be $3,262 then due and owing to the bank.\nThese instruments contain statements that they are given pursuant to the covenants for further assurance in the assignments of the leases and, although they secure sums of money not mentioned in those assignments, I have no doubt that the fact is that they were so given and were intended to make good, as far as possible, the agreement made in May that the bank should have security for its past indebtedness and for the future advances then contemplated on the crops to be grown on the two farms. Otherwise as bills of sale given to secure only a past indebtedness their invalidity on the ground of fraudulent preference would seem incontrovertible. There cannot be the slightest room for doubt that the substantial, if not the sole, purpose of the entire transaction was in the first instance to give the bank security on the crops to be grown and afterwards, if possible, to perfect that security.\nBy section 15 of the Bills of Sale Ordinance, ch. 43 of the Consolidated Ordinances, N.W.T., it is enacted that:\u2014\n15. No mortgage, bill of sale, lien, charge, encumbrance, conveyance, transfer or assignment hereafter made, executed or created, and which is intended to operate and have effect as a security, shall, in so far as the same assumes to bind, comprise, apply to or affect any growing crop or crop to be grown in future, in whole or in part, be valid except the same shall be made, executed or created as a security for the purchase price and interest thereon of seed grain.\nThat the assignments of the leases to the bank were \"intended to operate and have effect as a security\" and not otherwise is incontestible. They assume to \"comprise\" and \"bind\" \"a crop to be grown in future in whole or in part.\" That was their only real purpose. They were admittedly not given \"as a security for the price * * * of seed grain.\" They were, in my opinion, \"assignments\" within section 15, and were invalid in so far as they \"applied to or affected any growing crop or crop to be grown.\" Since the subsequent bills of sale expressly purport to have been given in pursuance of the agreement for security on the crops to be grown, in partial fulfilment of which the assignments of leases had been taken, they were tainted with the illegality of the agreement on which they were founded; or, if that agreement, because of its invalidity, should be regarded as nonexistent, they were void, as against the creditors of J. T. C. Gwillim, as securities given for past indebtedness which operated as a fraudulent preference.\nFor reasons which it deemed sufficient the legislature has apparently sought to protect the farmers of Alberta against their own improvidence or the rapacity of some money lenders by preventing the tying up as security of growing or future crops, thus, as far as possible, insuring to the man upon the land the means of subsistence. The policy which underlies this legislation is similar to that which inspired the exemption of homesteads. With its wisdom we are not concerned. That the legislature appreciated its scope and drastic character is apparent from the express exception made in favour of securities taken for the price of seed grain.\nIn some cases section 15 may operate to the serious disadvantage of the honest and even frugal farmer who has met with misfortune by preventing him from availing himself of the only security he can offer to obtain advances that might enable him to put himself upon his feet again. This may be such a case. But if, influenced by these considerations, or because it appears unassailable on moral grounds, or even positively meritorious, we should permit a transaction such as that before us to stand, section 15 of the Bills of Sale Ordinance would be rendered ineffectual. Care must be taken that legislation is not frittered away by judicial interpretation in \"hard cases.\" That the courts may not do without usurping the province of the legislature and ignoring or brushing aside the wholesome limitation upon their own function\u2014jus dicere, non jus dare.\nI am for these reasons of the opinion that at the time of its seizure by the sheriff the grain in question was as against the Royal Bank the property of J. T. C. Gwillim.\nI also incline to think that the assignments of lease were void as against those creditors of J. T. C. Gwillim whose executions were in the sheriff's hands when they were made. The bank manager admits that he had knowledge of these executions when he took the assignments. Indeed he tells us that it was arranged at that time that the account through which future advances were to be made to aid in producing and harvesting the crop should stand in the name of \"J. T. C. Gwillim in trust\" in order to prevent its being attached by those creditors. The modification of section 16 of the Statute of Frauds made by Alberta Rule of Court No. 609, if authorized by section 24 of chapter 3 of the Alberta Statutes of 1907, does not help the respondent. The rule reads:\u2014\nSubject to the provisions of any statute a writ of execution shall bind the goods of the judgment debtor from the time of delivery thereof for execution to the sheriff of the Judicial District within which the goods are situate, but not so as to prejudice the title to such goods acquired by any person in good faith and for valuable consideration, unless such person had, at the time when he acquired his title, notice that such writ had been delivered to the sheriff and remained in his hands unexecuted.\nSo far as the right of the bank to the crops in question depends upon the assignments of leases it would therefore appear to be subject to the executions which were in the sheriff's hands when they were made. Any rights under the bills of sale subsequently taken cannot be higher. I rest my judgment, however, on the applicability of section 15 of the Bills of Sale Ordinance.\nAppeal allowed in part\n[1] 10 Alta. L.R. 304.\n[2] 7Sask. L.R. 137.\n[3] 14 Man. R. 421.\n[4] 3 Sask.

Ord. N.W.T.c. 43, s. 15. G., an insolvent owing a considerable sum to the Royal Bank, leased his homestead to his son, a minor, at a rental of half the crop to be grown thereon. The son took a lease of a neighbouring farm on similar terms and assigned both leases and his interest in the crops to the bank which agreed to advance money for putting in and harvesting the crops, the father and son undertaking that the proceeds from their sale would be applied first to payment of the advances and next of the father's original debt. Later, under a covenant for further assurances in the assignments, bills of sale of the severed crops were given the bank as additional security. Under executions against G. which, to the knowledge of the bank, were in his hands when the lease was given to the son, the sheriff seized the two crops. On appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division in favour of the bank in an interpleader issue:\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J., that the transactions with the bank were not fraudulent as against the creditors of G.; that as the bank had notice, before entering into these transactions, of the executions out against G. the creditors were entitled to his share of the crop grown on the homestead; but the rest of the grain, in which G. had no interest, remained as security to the bank under the above mentioned agreements.\nPer Idington and Anglin JJ.\u2014That the son, to the knowledge of the bank, was acting throughout for his father with whom the bank was really dealing in taking security for its debt; that so far as the bills of sale of the crops were intended to secure the past debt to the bank they were fraudulent as against creditors and void; and the assignments to the bank were void under sec. 15 of the Bills of Sale Ordinance (Cons. Ord. N.W.T. ch. 43) which makes invalid any security not given for the purchase price of seed grain, which assumes to bind or affect a crop. There was a lawful seizure, therefore, of all the grain grown on the two farms. Per Idington J.\u2014The security taken by the bank was a violation of the provisions of sec. 76, s.s. 2 (e) of the Bank Act.\nPer Davies and Duff JJ. dissenting.\u2014The appeal should be dismissed. Judgment of the Appellate Division (10 Alta. L.R. 304) reversed in part.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe facts are fully stated in the head-note.\nNesbitt K.C. for the appellants referred to Kidd v. Docherty[2]; Campbell v. McKinnon[3].\nGeo. H. Montgomery K.C. and R. A. Smith for the respondent cited Fredericks v. North West Thresher Co.[4]; Cotton v. Boyd[5]; and Maskelyne and Cooke v. Smith[6].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I agree with the finding of Mr. Justice Beck, delivering the judgment of the Appellate Division, that there was nothing fraudulent about the transaction in question in this case. It was, however, a complicated one and as conflicting interests are involved it becomes necessary to decide the strict legal rights of the parties concerned.\nThe record before the court is not satisfactory as it contains merely a schedule of the principal exhibits; for such important documents as the assignments of the leases to the respondent we have nothing but an extract contained in one of the factums.\nThe position of the matter is this: J. T. C. Gwillim made a lease of his homestead farm to his son Wilfred Gwillim for one year reserving rents of $1 and one-half of the crop to be raised that year. The lessee assigned the term by way of security to the respondent. Except to receive his rent J. T. C. Gwillim had formally nothing further to do with the matter. That he may have remained on the farm and with his son raised the crop is not a fact that can have any effect on the legal rights of any parties concerned. It is said in the appellants' factum that he assigned his interest in the lease, and in the crop to be grown on the land, to the bank, but I cannot find that he ever purported to do so.\nAs to the McClure lease taken by Wilfred Gwillim and similarly assigned to the bank as security, J. T. C. Gwillim had nothing to do with this.\nNow if there were nothing else in the case, it would be clear that after harvesting the crops Wilfred Gwillim would have to hand over to his lessors the respective proportions of the crops agreed on by way of rental and the rest in each case would be his own property or to be disposed of in accordance with his arrangements with the bank.\nIt is claimed that the assignments which in terms included his right and interest in the crops to be raised during the term of the leases are invalid under the provisions of section 15 of the Bill of Sale Ordinance, chapter 43 of the Consolidated Ordinances of the North West Territories, which is as follows:\u2014\n15. No mortgage, bill of sale, lien, charge, encumbrance, conveyance, transfer or assignment hereinafter made, executed or created, and which is intended to operate and have effect as a security, shall in so far as the' same assumes to bind, comprise, apply to or affect any growing crop or crop to be grown in future in whole or in part, be valid except the same shall be made, executed or created as a security for the purchase price and interest thereon of seed grain.\nEven if the assignment were invalid it would not help the appellants if the only result were to leave the property in the balances of the crops, after handing over the rentals, vested in Wilfred Gwillim. In my opinion, however, that is not the effect of the section. It has application, I think, only in the case of an attempted assignment of the crop, not in that of an assignment of the land including the crops growing or to be grown upon it. In the case of an ordinary mortgage, the crops, before severance, are of course available to the mortgagee as part of his security.\nAfter the severance of the crops, the bank, for greater security, took from J. T. C. Gwillim and Wilfred Gwillim a bill of sale of the grain on the homestead farm, and a bill of sale from Wilfred Gwillim for that on the McClure farm. The objections offered to these bills of sale are, 1st, that at the time the bank had notice of the writs of execution, and, 2nd, that they were not duly registered as required by sections 6 and 11 of the Bills of Sale Ordinance, ch. 43, Con. Or. N. W. T.\nI think the first objection ought to prevail against the claim of the bank to J. T. C. Gwillim's one-half share of the crop on the homestead farm, not certainly on account of Rule 609 of the Alberta Rules of Court, for no rule of court could have any such effect if it were not otherwise the law. The provision has its origin in the Statute of Frauds, 29 Car. II. c. 3, s. 16, and now appears in the English Sale of Goods Act, 1893, 56 & 57 Vict. ch. 71, s. 26. It is unquestionable law.\nBut as against the rest of the grain, which I have been assuming was the property of Wilfred Gwillim, neither objection could be of any avail for he had no execution creditors and under the Bills of Sale Ordinance it is only as against creditors that bills of sale are void.\nI now come to the consideration which on the above facts and their normal consequences have led the trial judge and the Appellate Court to come to opposite conclusions. The trial judge thought that the whole transaction was a sham designed to afford an unfair preference to the bank, one amongst a number of J. T. C. Gwillim's creditors. Mr Justice Beck in the Appellate Division, on the other hand, found no evidence of fraud in the transaction which he thought was a legitimate attempt\" to create with the assistance of the bank a valuable asset in the hands of the debtor who in return for such assistance was to allow it to be used after liquidating the advances required for its production in discharge of the bank's existing claim, the balance, if any, being available as an asset in the hands of the then insolvent debtor for his other creditors.\nThere were certainly underlying motives which do not appear on the face of the transaction, but I think Mr. Justice Beck has taken the correct view and as I have already said, I can see nothing fraudulent in the proceeding which did not remove any property of the debtor out of the reach of his creditors, and by which they could not possibly be damaged. I do not see how they can legitimately object to the respondent having the benefit of property which but for its intervention and the arrangement effected, would never have come into existence.\nAt first sight it undoubtedly appears to be a ground of suspicion that the son Wilfred should admit the existence of a debt due by himself to the bank which he did not owe. This, however, was a family arrangement. The connection between the father of a family living on and working a farm with the aid of his minor sons is a very close one. The incapacity of the father for want of means to work his farm would mean want of work for the son as well and destitution for the whole family. I do not think it is fair under such circumstances to say that the son had nothing to gain by the transaction. The interest of the family was a matter of concern to him and one in which his own interest was bound up. He, of course, adventuring nothing, had nothing to lose by the transaction. If the father, owing to his insolvency, was unable to obtain the necessary advances to work his homestead farm, I do not see why the son should not undertake it and in return for the assistance afforded by the bank accept a liability for his father's debt limited to being discharged out of property to be produced as the result of his operations.\nI may add that I think we should strive as far as possible to uphold the transaction. It is a matter of public policy that crops should be raised on the land rather than that it should lie idle. The legislature has recognized this by providing in the \"Act respecting seed, grain, fodder and other relief\" being ch. 14 of the Statutes of Alberta, 1915, that a charge representing money and interest agreed to be paid in consideration of the advance of seed, grain and fodder for animals shall take priority over all other liens, taxes, charges or other encumbrances.\nIn the result the appeal should be allowed to the extent of one-half of the crop grown on the homestead farm and judgment entered on the issue that so much of the goods being part of the goods seized under the execution were at the time of the said seizure the property of the said J. T. C. Gwillim.\nThere will be no costs to either party. The half share of J. T. C. Gwillim of the crop as rental had not been delivered, and was not strictly liable to be taken in execution, and the appellants will therefore pay the sheriff's costs. DAVIES J. (dissenting)\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Supreme Court of Alberta holding in an interpleader issue between appellants as execution creditors of J. T. C. Gwillim and the respondent, that the latter was entitled to the crops grown upon a homestead quarter section owned by said Gwillim and upon a half section leased by the infant son of said Gwillim from a third party.\nThe learned trial judge found, as a fact, that said infant son was but the alter ego of the debtor who was insolvent at the time of the making of said lease.\nThis finding of fact can hardly be disputed under all the surrounding facts and circumstances unless we discard common sense in dealing with the matter. I, therefore, throughout accept the finding as determining so far as it goes the relations and rights of the parties.\nThe executions against Gwillim had been placed in the sheriff's hands at various times from the year 1910, to the year 1915, and had been kept renewed and in force until the trial in 1916, covering thus the periods in question when the several transactions took place upon which the respondent's claim is founded, and the seizure by the sheriff.\nIt is somewhat difficult to understand how a judgment debtor could enter into any transaction whereby he could transfer property as if free from encumbrance within the bailiwick of a sheriff holding such executions.\nYet by reason of some discussion of points of law which I respectfully submit are more or less irrelevant to the business in hand, such seems to have been the result of the judgment appealed from, that it is held possible to so transfer. A solution of the problem of whether or not a bargain for the transfer of nonexistent property falls within the Statute of Elizabeth surely has little relation to the real question presented by the facts found herein.\nThat question is whether or not there can be upheld as against existent executions, an assignment of a lease held by a judgment debtor or his alter ego, in the presence of such an array of executions well known to the assignee and in law binding the lease if as found the property of the debtor. For the title of the respondent to the crop as against appellant depends entirely upon the assignment of the lease procured in the son's name.\nSuch result I submit should not be reached if we pay heed to the peculiar facts and circumstances in this case and the law relative to the effect of executions which we find in No. 609 of the Alberta Rules of Court, as follows:\u2014\nSubject to the provisions of any statute a writ of execution shall bind the goods of the judgment debtor from the time of delivery thereof for execution to the Sheriff of the Judicial District within which the goods are situate, but not so as to prejudice the title to such goods acquired by any person in good faith and for valuable consideration, unless such person had, at the time when he acquired his title, notice that such writ had been delivered to the sheriff and remained in his hands unexecuted.\nTo understand properly the foregoing and what I am about to express hereafter requires a knowledge of the actual transactions which took place between the parties and are involved in the maintenance of the respondent's claim. The judgment debtor was possessed of a homestead free from liability to seizure. The exemption therefrom, however, did not extend to the crops grown thereon, save the limited quantity exempted for seed and six months' provisions. In his insolvent condition he bethought himself of a scheme whereby he might save these crops thus liable from the above mentioned executions. He decided to lease the homestead to his infant son then 17 years of age and made a lease dated 1st March, 1915, purporting to be for one year from said date, for the yearly rental of $1. This was drawn upon a printed form which had inserted at the end thereof a typewriten covenant by the lessee with the lessor to cultivate the land in a good and husbandlike manner, and at the proper season seed the same in wheat or other grain as the lessor might consent to, and harvest and thresh the crops in due season at his own expense, and immediately after threshing deliver in the name of the lessor at the nearest elevator a one-half share in kind as the same came from the machine of all wheat and other grain grown upon the said land, which was to be by way of additional rent to that reserved as above. This was followed by a covenant to furnish the lessee with all grain necessary for the seeding. The lease was assigned on the 20th day of May, 1915, by the said infant son to the respondent, by an assignment which recited the making of the lease; that by the terms thereof the lessee was entitled to one-half of the crop to be raised on the said lands during the said term; that the said lessee was then indebted to the respondent in the sum of $2,513, which represented a past indebtedness of the party hereto of the first part as a customer and that in order to better secure the party of the second part the repayment of the said indebtedness, the said lessee had agreed to execute the assignment.\nThe instrument proceeds then, in the operative part, to transfer all the interests acquired under the lease, and his said share of the crop, followed by a covenant that he would on request execute such further assurance as the respondent might require. That was followed by a proviso that the instrument was only to operate as and by way of collateral and additional security to the said indebtedness, and as soon as the same is fully paid and satisfied should cease and become void and of no further effect. The judgment debtor, though not a party to the instrument, signs as if he were and the signatures are followed by a paragraph which acknowledges this assignment as signified by his signature thereto. This, though clumsily done, no doubt was intended to be, and was, effective only for the purpose of assenting to the assignment by the lessee who was prohibited from assigning without leave.\nOn the 8th April, 1915, a memorandum was made which provided that Mr. Gwillim (without stating which of them) agreed to lease 250 acres or more of section 15, township 11, range 21, from Mr. Oliver; Gwillim to furnish the seed and do all the necessary work connected with the seeding and harvesting, Oliver to pay one-third of the threshing bills; Mr. Gwillim agreeing to give Mr. Oliver one-third of the crop delivered at the elevator. This informal scrap of paper is signed by Wilfred Gwillim and N. W. Oliver in the presence of one Fletcher.\nThis lease was assigned on the 19th of May, 1915, by the said Wilfred Gwillim to the respondent by an assignment which recited the making of the said memorandum, the terms thereof, and that the said Wilfred Gwillim was then indebted to the respondent in the sum of $2,513, which represented a past indebtedness as a customer, and that in order to secure the respondent the repayment of the said indebtedness he agreed to execute the instrument. By the operative part of the said assignment, in consideration of the said indebtedness, the said Wilfred Gwillim assigned all his rights, titles, estate and interest both legal and equitable in and to the lease and land mentioned and to his share of the crop so to be raised thereon, as aforesaid. The instrument further provided for further assurances such as required and might be necessary in relation to the premises, but that notwithstanding anything to the contrary was to operate merely as and by way of collateral and additional security to the said indebtedness and as soon as the same was fully paid and satisfied these presents should cease and become void. These assignments of leases were drawn by the solicitor of the bank.\nThe grain now in question in this issue was grown for the greater part on this last mentioned parcel of land. Some of it was the product of farming the homestead. If the two transactions had been kept throughout entirely separate and independent of each other, different considerations possibly might be applied to the resulting effect upon the validity of part of the respondent's claim.\nAs I understand the facts, however, the assignments though dated on different days were but the result of one agreement which had been made between the respondent and the judgment debtor whereby they were to finance the operations under the said lease, and they had made advances accordingly. I assume for the present that the indebtedness owing by the lessee was that owing by the father. The first question that arises is what titles could pass to the bank by the last mentioned assignment?\nThese executions bound the term created by the lease from the landlord Oliver to the infant son of the debtor as his alter ego.\nOf the notice to the respondent of these executions there is left no manner of doubt for its agent, who had the business in charge and procured the assignment of that lease, says expressly as follows:\u2014\nQ. Then he was in difficulties with other people besides the bank?\nA. Oh, yes.\nQ. For how long had you known he was in that condition?\nA. Quite a long time, I think, in fact back as far as 1912.\nQ. Had you any difficulty with his account in any way, by reason of these other creditors trying to attach it or anything of that kind?\nA. I don't remember anything of that.\nQ. Do you know whether or not they had judgments or executions against him?\nA. Oh, yes.\nQ. And he was in that condition of having a lot of executions outstanding for a year or two before this transaction took place?\nA. Yes.\nQ. So that the trust account was opened for that purpose, so that it could not be seized on executions?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Had the son ever had an account with the bank?\nA. No.\nIt seems absurdly comical to try to rest a claim to these crops grown upon the land leased from Oliver by reason of an assignment of a term which is itself bound by the executions and through the term so bound entitles the execution creditors to all the fruits derivable from the lease.\nI will deal with the lease of the homestead to the son presently so far as its peculiar features and all relative thereto suggest a possibility of differentiating them in favour of respondent.\nMeanwhile I wish to follow up the other grounds upon which the respondent's claim as a whole is rested.\nThe respondent was approached by the father who was notoriously insolvent and owed it from $2,000 to $3,000, (possibly the $2,513 referred to in the assignment though not proven), with several suggestions rejected, and finally with this scheme of a lease to his son of the homestead, and that to the son by Oliver being assigned to respondent and it would make ad- vances to help carry on the farm and get the crops as security.\nThe respondent assented to the proposal and made advances accordingly before and after the bank's solicitor had prepared the assignments of the said leases and got them executed.\nMr. Justice Beck says the father and son signed jointly a note to the bank for $2,513 being the amount then owing by the father to the bank, and that the assignments of leases declared they were given to secure that.\nI cannot find that in the evidence which is obscure on the point. Possibly the facts were cleared up by admissions of counsel before the court below in a way we were not favoured with, or more probably he only assumed the fact from the recital, which assumption is not borne out by the evidence.\nThe respondent's agent in his examination seems to indicate that there was a joint note for the old debt as Mr. Justice Beck suggests, but on being shewn the bundle of exhibits failed to identify any such note and pointed to a note for $1,700, dated the very day one of those assignments was given, which destroys the assumption and hence I must deal with that aspect of the case alternatively.\nAssuming first Mr. Justice Beck's impression correct, then it is to be observed that there is nothing in the assignments of the leases which secures anything beyond that sum, for they each expressly provide that upon the payment of the said sum then the assignment is void. And neither professes that there is anything secured beyond that sum, or any ulterior purpose to be served by reason of any such assignment.\nYet it is contended that the respondent was in some way secured by said assignment for the advances made by respondent for seed wheat for the Oliver place, and other expenses of operating these farms during that season of 1915. On what does it rest?\nClearly it cannot rest on these instruments which are expressly confined to the securing of the old indebtedness to the extent of $2,513.\nIf they could be upheld as against the execution creditors the proper judgment would be to restrict the claim to that sum and that alone.\nThe son, however, being but the agent or tool of the judgment debtor father in taking the Oliver lease and, as already pointed out, the same being bound by the executions, that part of the crop cannot be held by respondent even for the old indebtedness.\nWhat then can such claim rest upon?\nThe agent of respondent many times in course of his examinations says he expected he would get the crops to repay the advances first for 1915 and then have a right to apply so much of the balance as needed to pay the old indebtedness.\nI rather think it was a mere expectation that he should be enabled to do so by the goodwill of the father and that the assignment of the leases was but a lever, as it were, which would help in some way to secure a future assignment thereof.\nThe fact that the assignments made no provision therefor, except in relation to the past indebtedness, and yet were followed in September by bills of sale which respectively pretend to have been made pursuant to a mere covenant for further assurance, is most suggestive.\nThese bills of sale were apparently prepared as early as August but failed of prompt execution for some unexplained reason. The agent of the respondent in his evidence puts the matter of agreement for and nature of title, thus:\u2014\nQ. And you got the son to assign everything to the bank and you considered the son had no further interest in the crop?\nA. The agreement that we had, as I said before, was that when the crop was harvested the first money received would go to pay the new debt contracted by the father and son; when that was paid any further moneys would first go to pay the old indebtedness to the bank.\nQ. And what would become of the balance?\nA. The balance they stated they intended to pay on other liabilities.\nQ. Whose?\nA. Gwillim's.\nQ. Which Gwillim?\nA. J. T. C. Gwillim.\nQ. Then I am correct in saying that the son had no interest in the crop at all after he had turned these securities over to you?\nA. Well, I could not say that; he was doing the work and presume he would get certain pay from it.\nQ. What I mean is, as far as the crop itself was concerned, you would consider that any balance would go to pay the father's debts?\nA. That's the agreement upon which I\u2014the bank\u2014advanced them the money; first get that paid up and then the old indebtedness, and on that understanding the bank loaned them the money to put the crop in.\nQ. You were asked in Toronto (Q. 96): \" So far as you were concerned you were treating the whole proceedings of that account as being properly accountable to the father? Answer, Yes.\"\nA. All the proceeds of the crop would certainly go to the trust account of J. T. C. Gwillim, and be disbursed from that account.\nQ. The son had no right to sign cheques on that account?\nA. No.\nQ. He was a minor?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Now, these assignments and bills of sale were taken by way of collateral security to the indebtedness, not taken as transfers of the crop to you as to the bank?\nA. The bill of sale was.\nQ. The bills of sale?\nA. That's the way I understood it.\nQ. But you were to account for any surplus to the trust account?\nA. Yes.\nQ. The bill of sale was then not really an actual bill of sale as we understand it, but by way of mortgage?\nA. Yes, I presume it is. We were not buying the crop.\nQ. You have already told us that you had knowledge of the executions that were outstanding at the time?\nA. Yes. Why did the business take this most circuitous course? Why did the assignments not provide for it all? Can there be a shadow of doubt that it was because the agent and his solicitors were confronted with two well known statutory provisions against such agreements?\nIn the first place the \"Banking Act\" by section 76, s.s. 2 (c), prohibits that and other like dealings, as follows:\u2014\n2. Except as authorized by this Act, the bank shall not, either directly or indirectly,\u2014\n* * * * *\n(c) lend money or make advances upon the security, mortgage or hypothecation of any lands, tenements or immovable property, or of any ships or other vessels, or upon the security of any goods, wares or merchandise.\nIt is apparently assumed by the judgment appealed from that the crops were on the date of these assignments of leases non-existent. If we would apply common knowledge to at least the wheat crops and probably all, they had by 20th May been growing for a long time and were just as assignable and exigible then as ever, but being chattels were goods upon which, under the circumstances, the bank could not advance.\nAnd in the next place there had stood for twenty years an enactment in force in the North West Territories, and in Alberta since its creation, which for good reasons had prohibited any such bargain as might create just such a claim as in question herein.\nThat enactment is section 15 of the Bills of Sale Ordinance, as follows:\u2014\n15. No mortgage, bill of sale, lien, charge, encumbrance, conveyance, transfer or assignment hereafter made, executed or created and which is intended to operate and have effect as a security shall in so far as the same assumes to bind, comprise, apply to or affect any growing crop or crop to be grown in future in whole or in part, be valid except the same shall be made, executed or created as a security for the purchase price and interest thereon of seed grain. It would be difficult to use more comprehensive language than in this enactment prohibiting bargaining for a\nsecurity upon a growing crop or crop to be grown in the future.\nEither the share of the crop was within the express words of the operative part of each assignment of the lease in question or it was not.\nIf it was within them clearly there was an express infringement of the very language of the statute for each of the instruments so assigning the said share of crop was on its face intended to be by way of security only and the evidence of respondent's agent puts that beyond all peradventure.\nIf it was so intended then I incline to think and submit that each of the assignments of the said leases designed to produce such effect was itself by reason thereof void, for the whole purpose thereof was to procure that forbidden by the law.\nWhen we find that the bank held a second mortgage on the homestead, and a chattel mortgage on the stock not seized, which together according to the agent's evidence, seemed ample, the whole transactions seem designed in truth only to secure the advances for 1915, and thus falling within both statutory prohibitions and hence void.\nAnd if it can be said that this illegal part of each of the objects of the instruments are severable from the legal then, at all events so far as they may have the contravention of the statute in view or be intended to give vitality to a contract declared invalid, they must be held null and void,\nI fail to see how the parts are severable, for what you cannot do directly you cannot do indirectly.\nIf there is no such contract, then there is no foundation for the respondent's claim. And if, as I have already observed, these crops were growing (as in all human probability they were) on the date of each assignment, the executions then in the sheriff's hands bound them.\nDoubtless it was on account of these manifest objections in law to the assignments and that contained therein, that more explicit provision was not made therein and hope was rested on the peculiar provisions by way of future assurances which was inserted in each and a foundation laid for the bills of sale which on their face are alleged to be made pursuant thereto.\nThe scheme seems to have miscarried for the respective bills of sale relating to each crop or share thereof which was the only other ground upon which the claim has been rested, was one which the respondent's counsel did not seem disposed in argument here to attempt to rest his client's claim upon.\nIt is difficult to see how he could, for clearly they were each intended to be instruments which in fact were only mortgages and there was no pretence of any compliance with the statute in such case provided relative to the affidavit to be made.\nThat statute by section 6, provides as follows:\u2014\n6. Every mortgage or conveyance intended to operate as a mortgage of goods and chattels which is not accompanied by an immediate delivery and an actual and continued change of possession of the things mortgaged shall within thirty days from the execution thereof be registered as hereinafter provided together with the affidavit of a witness thereto of the due execution of such a mortgage or conveyance and also with the affidavits of the mortgagee or one of the several mortgagees or the agent of the mortgagee or mortgagees if such agent is aware of all the circumstances connected therewith and is properly authorized by power in writing to take such mortgage in which case a copy of such authority shall be attached thereto (save as is hereafter provided under section 21 hereof) such last mentioned affidavit stating that the mortgagor therein named is justly and truly indebted to the mortgagee in the sum mentioned in the mortgage, that it was executed in good faith, and for the express purpose of securing the payment of money justly due or accruing due, and not for the purpose of protecting the goods and chattels mentioned therein against the creditors of the mortgagor or of preventing the creditors of such mortgagor from obtaining payment of any claim against him; and every such mortgage or conveyance shall operate or take effect upon, from and after the day and time of the filing thereof.\nThere was no pretence of its observance. They were not only vitiated thereby, but as being in fact founded upon what was illegal, were doubly so.\nAs to the contention that the transfers were preferential it seems hardly necessary to dwell upon that when in my view, as already expressed, the executions well known to the agent of the bank bound everything and prevented any of these several contrivances from having any validity as against the execution creditors now appellants.\nComing to the lease of the homestead from father to son and the question arising peculiar to it, and all implied therein, we find that one-half of that crop belonged by the terms of the lease to the judgment debtor, and there does not appear a tittle of evidence that he ever assigned that to the respondent except by the bills of sale already referred to.\nThe assignment of the lease by the son to the respondent could not have such effect, and the father's assent to that assignment could not enlarge its operations, but only waive the covenant of the lessee against assignment of the term.\nWhat answer can be made to this I am unable to understand, and hence clearly his half of the crop rightly seized.\nAll the authorities relied upon cannot and do not help. It is quite clear that a man can assign without impediment, his homestead, absolutely or any part thereof, to a stranger. But, as already stated, the law does not exempt the crops he may grow thereon. And a lease cannot help him out of that difficulty. The lease itself, or rather the term created, is chattel property liable to execution against chattels, and need not touch the legal estate in the land.\nAgain it would be quite competent for the owner of a homestead to bargain for the sale of a part of his crop without offending against the provisions of section 15 of the Bills of Sale Ordinance; and hence many of the cases cited and relied upon are maintainable for that reason.\nThe share of the crop which the son was to retain by the terms of the lease of the homestead would, but for the peculiarities of the case I am about to advert to, have been at his disposal and for valuable consideration could have been assigned to a purchaser. But that is not what was attempted, nor could it be in the case of a bank by reason of its incapacity to so bargain.\nThe son owed the bank nothing until he signed as surety for his father cotemporaneously with the assignments of the leases, and how that could be properly termed a past indebtedness so far as he was concerned, puzzles one.\nThe truth is the whole scheme was framed by the father to defeat his creditors and had created at the moment of putting it in force a term which was properly seizable by sheriff under executions. It seems idle to say there was no present property to be affected, for not only did the term exist when the respondent took an assignment of it, but also the growing crops.\nIt is not only the Statute of Elizabeth, but also the common law long before it, that forbade the fraudulent transfer of that which was exigible.\nAnd with great respect it seems to me that there is a misapprehension of the scope of the case of Blakely v. Gould[7], which was the assignment of a non-exigible contract that was in question, in assuming that it touches this case where at the very inception of the transaction in question there was the creation of a term which was exigible as were also the growing crops when the respondent knowing the facts and purpose thereof accepted the assignment and still more when it accepted the bills of sale.\nIt is from these points of view that the purpose of the debtor must be held to have a bearing. And that purpose formed in his own mind until something was done in pursuance of it, could injure no one, but can be looked at and considered when effect is actively given to it in order to affect and transfer that which is exigible and defeat the executions binding same.\nHowever all that may be the many other grounds already fully stated render it unnecessary to pursue the subject.\nI think if the advance, about $500, for seed grain made by the respondent could have been, and I imagine it might have been, severed, if at the time and possibly at the trial attention had been given the matter, it ought to have been maintained unless possibly for the offence against the \"Banking Act.\"\nThe respondents have chosen otherwise. I think the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout.\nDUFF J. (dissenting)\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I am, with respect, of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed.\nThe findings of the learned trial judge, that the lease from J. T. C. Gwillim, the father and execution debtor, to Wilfred Gwillim, his minor son, was made with the object of defeating or hindering the creditors of the former; that the lease of the McClure farm was taken by Wilfred for his father; that Wilfred had no real beneficial interest in either property; and that, at all events as against the father's creditors, the lease to the son of the homestead must be looked upon as non-existent and the father must be deemed the lessee of the McClure property, appear to be so fully warranted by the evidence that they cannot be disturbed. The father's insolvency and the bank's knowledge of it, likewise found, are incontrovertible. However, I accept the finding made by the Appellate Division, although in reversal of that of the trial judge, that there was no intent on the part of the bank manager to defeat, hinder or delay the creditors of J. T. C. Gwillim, and I deal with the case on the assumption that the honest purpose of the bank was by advancing money to J. T. C. Gwillim to enable him to grow and harvest a crop, which he probably otherwise would have been unable to do, from the proceeds of which all parties interested\u2014the bank, Gwillim himself, and his other creditors\u2014might benefit. I am fully satisfied, however, that the bank manager knew that Wilfred was a mere \"stool pigeon\" for his father, that the latter was the sole beneficial owner, and that the bank's real transaction was with him as such and with him alone.\nFor a past indebtedness to it of $2,513 (a debt of his father which Wilfred purported to assume) the Royal Bank on the 19th May, 1915, took as security assignments from Wilfred Gwillim of the two leases above mentioned and of the assignor's share in the crops to be grown on the leased premises. These assignments expressly provide that they shall operate only as collateral security for the existing indebtedness and that the assignor shall retain possession and deliver his share of the crops, when grown and harvested, to the nearest elevator in the name of the bank. They also contain covenants for further assurance. Strangely enough, however, they make no reference to further advances. Yet it seems reasonably clear that they were intended to secure further advances to be made by the bank to enable J. T. C. Gwillim to produce and harvest the crops. The evidence of the bank manager puts it beyond doubt that he so regarded the assignments and also that it was only upon the crops growing or to be grown that substantial security was to be obtained thereby. The leases themselves, apart from the crops, had no substantial value, as the respondent in its factum very frankly admits.\nWhether because he doubted the efficacy of the bank's security on the crops, or because he wished to provide expressly that they should stand as security for the additional advances made after the assignments of the leases were taken, the bank manager, on the 15th of September after the crops had been severed, took from Wilfred Gwillim and J. T. C. Gwillim a bill of sale of the entire crop grown on the Gwillim homestead and from Wilfred Gwillim a bill of sale of his share of the crop grown on the McClure property, the consideration in each document being stated to be $3,262 then due and owing to the bank.\nThese instruments contain statements that they are given pursuant to the covenants for further assurance in the assignments of the leases and, although they secure sums of money not mentioned in those assignments, I have no doubt that the fact is that they were so given and were intended to make good, as far as possible, the agreement made in May that the bank should have security for its past indebtedness and for the future advances then contemplated on the crops to be grown on the two farms. Otherwise as bills of sale given to secure only a past indebtedness their invalidity on the ground of fraudulent preference would seem incontrovertible. There cannot be the slightest room for doubt that the substantial, if not the sole, purpose of the entire transaction was in the first instance to give the bank security on the crops to be grown and afterwards, if possible, to perfect that security.\nBy section 15 of the Bills of Sale Ordinance, ch. 43 of the Consolidated Ordinances, N.W.T., it is enacted that:\u2014\n15. No mortgage, bill of sale, lien, charge, encumbrance, conveyance, transfer or assignment hereafter made, executed or created, and which is intended to operate and have effect as a security, shall, in so far as the same assumes to bind, comprise, apply to or affect any growing crop or crop to be grown in future, in whole or in part, be valid except the same shall be made, executed or created as a security for the purchase price and interest thereon of seed grain.\nThat the assignments of the leases to the bank were \"intended to operate and have effect as a security\" and not otherwise is incontestible. They assume to \"comprise\" and \"bind\" \"a crop to be grown in future in whole or in part.\" That was their only real purpose. They were admittedly not given \"as a security for the price * * * of seed grain.\" They were, in my opinion, \"assignments\" within section 15, and were invalid in so far as they \"applied to or affected any growing crop or crop to be grown.\" Since the subsequent bills of sale expressly purport to have been given in pursuance of the agreement for security on the crops to be grown, in partial fulfilment of which the assignments of leases had been taken, they were tainted with the illegality of the agreement on which they were founded; or, if that agreement, because of its invalidity, should be regarded as nonexistent, they were void, as against the creditors of J. T. C. Gwillim, as securities given for past indebtedness which operated as a fraudulent preference.\nFor reasons which it deemed sufficient the legislature has apparently sought to protect the farmers of Alberta against their own improvidence or the rapacity of some money lenders by preventing the tying up as security of growing or future crops, thus, as far as possible, insuring to the man upon the land the means of subsistence. The policy which underlies this legislation is similar to that which inspired the exemption of homesteads. With its wisdom we are not concerned. That the legislature appreciated its scope and drastic character is apparent from the express exception made in favour of securities taken for the price of seed grain.\nIn some cases section 15 may operate to the serious disadvantage of the honest and even frugal farmer who has met with misfortune by preventing him from availing himself of the only security he can offer to obtain advances that might enable him to put himself upon his feet again. This may be such a case. But if, influenced by these considerations, or because it appears unassailable on moral grounds, or even positively meritorious, we should permit a transaction such as that before us to stand, section 15 of the Bills of Sale Ordinance would be rendered ineffectual. Care must be taken that legislation is not frittered away by judicial interpretation in \"hard cases.\" That the courts may not do without usurping the province of the legislature and ignoring or brushing aside the wholesome limitation upon their own function\u2014jus dicere, non jus dare.\nI am for these reasons of the opinion that at the time of its seizure by the sheriff the grain in question was as against the Royal Bank the property of J. T. C. Gwillim.\nI also incline to think that the assignments of lease were void as against those creditors of J. T. C. Gwillim whose executions were in the sheriff's hands when they were made. The bank manager admits that he had knowledge of these executions when he took the assignments. Indeed he tells us that it was arranged at that time that the account through which future advances were to be made to aid in producing and harvesting the crop should stand in the name of \"J. T. C. Gwillim in trust\" in order to prevent its being attached by those creditors. The modification of section 16 of the Statute of Frauds made by Alberta Rule of Court No. 609, if authorized by section 24 of chapter 3 of the Alberta Statutes of 1907, does not help the respondent. The rule reads:\u2014\nSubject to the provisions of any statute a writ of execution shall bind the goods of the judgment debtor from the time of delivery thereof for execution to the sheriff of the Judicial District within which the goods are situate, but not so as to prejudice the title to such goods acquired by any person in good faith and for valuable consideration, unless such person had, at the time when he acquired his title, notice that such writ had been delivered to the sheriff and remained in his hands unexecuted.\nSo far as the right of the bank to the crops in question depends upon the assignments of leases it would therefore appear to be subject to the executions which were in the sheriff's hands when they were made. Any rights under the bills of sale subsequently taken cannot be higher. I rest my judgment, however, on the applicability of section 15 of the Bills of Sale Ordinance.\nAppeal allowed in part\n[1] 10 Alta. L.R. 304.\n[2] 7Sask. L.R. 137.\n[3] 14 Man. R. 421.\n[4] 3 Sask.

Chatham Gas Co., (1918) 56 S.C.R. 253\nDate: 1918-03-25\nThe Union Natural Gas Company of Canada (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nThe Chatham Gas Company (Defendants) Respondents.\n1917: November 7, 8; 1918: March 25.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Duff and Anglin JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nContract\u2014Supply of gas\u2014Area\u2014Extension of municipal limits\u2014Parties.\nThe Union Natural Gas Co. are producers of gas and the Chatham Gas Co. is empowered to sell and distribute the commodity to consumers in the City of Chatham. By a contract between the two companies the Union Co. was to supply and the Chatham Co. to take all the gas required by the latter for such sale and distribution.\nHeld, Anglin J. dissenting, that the Union Co. was not obliged to supply gas for distribution and sale by the Chatham Co. in territory annexed to the city after the contract was made. City of Calgary v. Canadian Western Natural Gas Co., (56 Can. S.C.R. 117,) distinguished.\nThe Chatham Co. had contracted to supply gas to a sugar company operating in the territory so annexed to the city and the right of the latter to obtain the gas furnished by the Union Co. under its contract to supply the Chatham Co. only for use in the city depended on the construction of said contract as to the area to be served.\nHeld, per Anglin J., that the Sugar Co. is entitled to be a party to the action, and the order of the Appellate Division for a new trial with liberty to add it should be affirmed. The case is not one in which the power to give a declaratory judgment not accompanied by consequential relief should be exercised.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division, (40 Ont L.R. 148), reversing that at the trial, (38 Ont L.R. 488), reversed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], setting aside the judgment at the trial[2], in favour of the plaintiffs and ordering a new trial.\nIn 1906 the predecessors in title of the Union Natural Gas Co. which owned gas leases in the townships of Raleigh and East Tilbury contiguous to the City of Chatham entered into a contract with the Chatham Gas Co. which supplied the inhabitants of the city. By this contract the Union Co. agreed to supply to the Chatham Co. all the gas required by the latter and to furnish gas to no other person or company in the city so long as the Chatham Co. continued to take it and the latter agreed to take all it needed from the Union Co.\nIn 1915, while this contract was still in operation, the Dominion Sugar Co. established a refinery on land in Raleigh which, in the following year, was annexed to the city. The Chatham Gas Co. by contract in writing agreed to supply the gas required by the Sugar Co. and claimed that the Union Co. was obliged by its contract to furnish this extra supply. The Union Co. denied this and brought action for a declaration that it was only obliged to furnish gas for distribution in the city according to the limits thereof in 1906 when the contract was made and for an injunction against the Chatham Co. diverting its gas to the annexed territory.\nThe trial judge was of opinion that the contract of 1906 covered the annexed territory but considered the agreement with the Sugar Co. to be unfair to the Union Co. and granted a qualified injunction against diverting the gas to the territory annexed under the contract with the Sugar Co. or entering into any other contract therefor without the approval of the Court. Both parties appealed to the Appellate Division which, without considering the merits of the case, ordered a new trial with liberty to add the Dominion Sugar Co. as a party to the action. The Union Co. then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nWhen this appeal was called counsel for the respondent moved to quash it for want of jurisdiction, it being an appeal from a judgment ordering a new trial in the exercise of judicial discretion. The motion was directed to stand until the appeal was heard on the merits and by the judgment now reported the jurisdiction of the court was maintained.\nTilley K.C. for the appellants. A municipal franchise does not ex necessitate extend to added territory and there is nothing in the contract between the parties here to make it so extend. See Toronto Railway Co. v. City of Toronto[3]; Montreal Street Railway Co. v. City of Montreat[4].\nThe contractual rights of the parties are not affected by an order of Ontario Municipal and Railway Board. County of Wentworth v. Hamilton Radial Railway Co.[5]\nHellmuth K.C. and Pike K.C. for the respondents. The Dominion Sugar Co. is a necessary party to the action. O\u2019Sullivan v. Phelan[6]; Clifton v. Crawford[7]; Beament v. Foster[8].\nThe contract between the parties extends to the added territory and was so contemplated when it was made. See In re Toronto Railway Co. and the City of Toronto[9]; City of Calgary v. Canadian Western Natural Gas Co.[10]; City of Toronto v. Toronto Railway Co.[11] THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I have read with great care the elaborate and able judgment of Mr. Justice Lennox before whom this action was tried, but as the strength of a chain is its weakest link, so the value of his conclusion depends upon the weakest point upon which it is based. The learned judge has formed the opinion, as surprising to me as I think it is without foundation, that the contract between the appellant\u2019s predecessors in title and the respondent for the supply of natural gas to the latter constituted them partners in the respondent\u2019s undertaking and operation of its franchise for distributing gas in the City of Chatham; and the learned judge, though going so fully, as I have said, into the case, gives little reason for his opinion on this point beyond a paraphrase of the agreement which does not seem to carry the matter any further than the document itself. The absence of such reason renders unnecessary more than a brief statement of the considerations which have led me to a contrary conclusion.\nThe learned judge has held that the respondent\nis seized and possessed of a franchise of the same character, and with the same incidents, obligations and duties in the whole of the City of Chatham, as it now is, as this company was seized of and subject to in the area constituting the City of Chatham before and at the date of the annexation,\nand he continues:\nconsidering the whole agreement, i.e., between the parties * * * I have come to the conclusion that the proper interpretation is that its provisions were intended to extend to and include not only the City of Chatham as it was bounded and constituted at the date of the agreement, but land which might thereafter be annexed as well.\nIt seems in any case too much to say that \u201cits provisions were intended to extend,\u201d since this must depend on the previous finding as a legal conclusion that the franchise did so extend; perhaps at most it could be said that it follows from the previous finding that they must be considered to so extend, but indeed the real reason for the judge\u2019s interpretation is given in his previous statement as follows:\nIf the franchise of this company (the respondent) included the right and obligation to supply gas in territory subsequently acquired, the right to share in the benefit of this franchise was conferred, and the correlative obligation to furnish the additional gas required for customers in the added territory was imposed upon the Union Company by the agreement of 1906. It might not always be so, but it seems quite impossible in the circumstances of this case to hold that \u201cCity of Chatham\u201d means one thing as regards area in relation to the rights and obligations of the Chatham Company and the City Corporation, and another thing as regards the rights and obligations of the parties to the agreement of 1906. Why? Because the document of 1906 is in substance and effect a partnership agreement and practically nothing else.\nHere we have the real reason for holding that the agreement, whatever its intention, extended to the territory subsequently added to the city. There is no other; for there is no reason that I can find why \u201cthe City of Chatham\u201d should not mean one thing as regards the area covered by the respondent\u2019s franchise, and another as contemplated by the agreement of 1906 between the parties. On the contrary, I think there are good reasons why this should be so. In granting a franchise within the city, the corporation is naturally dealing with the area subject to its jurisdiction, whatever that may be, but parties making an agreement as private individuals for the supply of a commercial commodity in a particular area, are dealing with a geographical area and are not concerned with any question of what particular municipal jurisdiction it comes under. In the case of The City of Calgary v. The Canadian Western Natural Gas Co.[12], recently heard on appeal to this court and which was referred to in the argument, it was pointed out that between the years 1905 and 1914, the area comprised within the municipal boundaries had been extended from 1,800 to 25,000 acres, whilst the population had grown from 12,500 to 90,000. The franchise which was involved in that case was held to extend to the added territory; but it would surely be impossible, in a private contract for the sale of any commodity, to hold, without the plainest evidence of the intention of the parties, that the area within which it was to be supplied was not that covered by the proper description at the date of the contract, but such an enormously increased area as in the instance of the City of Calgary, and because the area within the jurisdiction of the City Corporation, no party to the contract, had been subsequently enlarged. It would be only reasonable to suppose that if the area were to be increased more than twelvefold the intention would be that the parties owning the franchise would have to make quite other arrangements for so changed a subject-matter of the contract. The conditions in the one case not only might, but probably would, be wholly unsuitable in the other.\nAs Lord Loreburn said in Tamplin S.S. Co. v. Anglo-Mexican Petroleum Co.[13], at page 403:\nA court can and ought to examine the contract, and the circumstances in which it was made, not of course to vary, but only to explain it, in order to see whether or not from the nature of it the parties must have made their bargain on the footing that a particular thing or state of things would continue to exist.\nIf we look at the particular contract, we find that it starts with the recitals:\nWhereas the Chatham Company is the owner of a system of mains and pipes laid through, under and along the streets, squares, highways, lanes and public places of the City of Chatham by and with the authority and sanction of the said City, also of certain rights and franchises to distribute and sell gas to the inhabitants of the said City. And whereas the parties hereto have agreed for the supply by the producers (the appellant) to the Chatham Company of natural gas, and for the sale and distribution in Chatham aforesaid of the same by the said Chatham Company on the terms and conditions following.\nIn the first of these recitals there is an identification of the respondent\u2019s system of pipes in the City of Chatham as it existed at that time, and the agreement is for the supply of gas by the appellant in Chatham aforesaid. In other words, read as a whole, the contract is merely one by which the appellant agrees to sell the respondent a quantity of natural gas at a certain fixed price, which quantity is determined by the capacity of the system of mains and pipes then laid through, under and along the streets, squares, highways, lanes and public places of the City of Chatham, as it then was. If there be doubt, I presume that the rule laid down by Pothier in his Treatise on Obligations, No. 97, would apply. The contract is interpreted as against him who has stipulated and in favour of him who has contracted the obligation. City of Toronto v. Toronto Railway Co.[14]\nAnd in estimating the probable intention, I do not think we can overlook the facts that the contract contemplates the supply by the appellants of gas outside the city therein mentioned to others than the respondent, and that at the time of its execution the appellants held a ten days old grant of a franchise from the Corporation of the Township of Raleigh which included the area in question here. This franchise, in so far as the 51 acres are concerned at any rate, is still in existence. The appellants moreover hold numerous similar franchises in other neighbouring municipalities. Sec. 33 of the Municipal Act, R.S.O. [1914] ch. 192, provides:\u2014 Where a district is annexed to a municipality, its by-laws shall extend to such district * * * and the by-laws in force therein shall cease to apply to it, except those relating to highways * * * and except by-laws in force conferring rights, privileges, franchises, immunities or exemptions which could not be repealed by the council which passed them.\nIf we conclude that the agreement of 3rd November, 1906, is not as the trial judge finds \u201carticles of partnership\u201d between the parties and there is nothing else to shew that the area as regards the contract is necessarily the same as that embraced in the respondent\u2019s franchise, but rather the contrary, then it becomes unnecessary to determine in this action what is the limit of the area covered by the respondent\u2019s franchise.\nThe appellant\u2019s claim is for a declaration that it is not bound under the contract of 6th (3rd) November, 1906, to supply gas to the respondent except for distribution within the limits of the City of Chatham as it then existed; and the consequent relief sought is an injunction restraining the respondent from diverting the gas supplied to it by the appellant to or for the purpose of the respondent\u2019s contract with the Dominion Sugar Company, one of its principal customers, whose factory is situated within the territory added to the city.\nThe trial judge found against the appellant and held that:\nthe proper interpretation of the agreement is that its provisions were intended to extend to and include not only the City of Chatham as it was bounded and constituted at the date of the agreement, but land which might thereafter be annexed as well;\nand that\nIt follows that the respondent will be entitled to obtain from the appellant a sufficient supply of natural gas for its customers on the annexed land. And referring to the claim for an injunction the learned judge says:\nthis prayer is based on the assumption that it would be declared that the agreement applies only to the city as it then was.\nThe finding being otherwise, no such injunction as prayed could of course be granted; but the judge has entered into a consideration of the contract made between the respondent and the Dominion Sugar Company and, being of opinion that it was\nnot one under which the respondent has a right to divert gas to the Sugar Company against the will of the appellant,\nhas granted \u201ca qualified injunction\u201d restraining the respondent from so diverting gas under any agreement unless and until it is approved by the court.\nAgainst this judgment both parties appealed, and the Appellate Division, apparently approving the judgment as to the refusal of the declaration sought by appellant, decided that, in view of the Sugar Company not having been a party to the proceedings, there would have to be a new trial with liberty to the appellant to add the Sugar Company as a party defendant.\nThe judgment on trial being now reversed, there is, of course, no ground on which a new trial could be ordered. The appellant is entitled to the declaration and consequential relief sought.\nThe appeal will therefore be allowed, and the judgment on trial set aside; and it will be declared that under the contract of the 3rd November, 1906, between Symmes and Coste, the predecessors in title of the appellant and the respondent, the appellant is not bound to supply gas to the respondent except for distribution within the limits of the City of Chatham as it then existed or in special cases with respect to which agreements exist. The respondent will be restrained by injunction from diverting gas supplied to it by the appellant otherwise than in accordance with such declaration.\nIn Hartlepool Gas and Water Co. v. West Hartlepool Harbour and Railway Co.[15], the dock company were supplying their own water to their lessees in breach of their covenant to take all their water from the water company. The water company were held sufficiently satisfied with damages for breach of the covenant.\nIn the present case the defendant is diverting and supplying to strangers gas and water respectively belonging to the plaintiff to which the defendant has no right except under its contracts which do not provide for this.\nIt is no answer for the defendant to say: We have made a contract with strangers to give them your gas or water to which we have no right, and, therefore, we cannot be stopped appropriating and giving away your goods. Neither is it necessary to hear what the receiver of the misappropriated goods has got to say.\nDavies J.\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the Appellate Division should be set aside and that it should be declared that appellant is not bound to supply gas for the territory annexed to the City of Chatham since the agreement in question was entered into, and I am also of the opinion that an injunction should be granted in aid of that declaration.\nI concur generally in the reasons for judgment stated by Mr. Justice Idington, costs, of course, to follow the result. IDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant as the assignee of the rights of H.D. Symmes and D.A. Coste under a contract made on 3rd November, 1906, between them and respondent, brought an action for the construction thereof, and in the event of appellant\u2019s contention relative thereto being maintained, for an injunction restraining the respondent from violating same.\nThe learned trial judge\u2019s construction of the contract failed to maintain the appellant\u2019s contention yet he fell far short of satisfying respondent.\nHence both served notice of appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario which, without expressing any opinion on the merits of any of the several contentions set up, set the learned judge\u2019s judgment, which had granted an injunction against respondent, aside and directed a new trial with liberty to appellant herein to add the Dominion Sugar Company as defendants.\nUpon appeal here from said judgment the objection is raised that it was merely in the exercise of its discretion that the Appellate Division directed a new trial, and hence no appeal would lie here, and further that nothing but questions of practice and procedure were involved in the appeal.\nI am afraid that something more is involved, and that we cannot, by that easy way, evade the duty of deciding the questions raised.\nIn the first place, the then prevalent application of the rule relative to non-interference with the discretion of an appellate court granting a new trial got rather a bad blow from the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Toronto Railway Co. v. King[16]. We, following what had been the usual practice in this court up to that time, of assuming that when the court below in any case had, for one or other apparently good reason, decided to grant a new trial, it had exercised its discretion and hence, under section 45 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d now involved, no appeal would lie, refused to hear the appeal of King v. Toronto Railway Company.\nThe railway company was unwise enough as the result shewed to appeal to the Privy Council from the judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal there in question to have the action dismissed, and that ended not only in the company\u2019s appeal being dismissed, but also the trial judgment which had been given against the company, being restored. That led to our examining in other cases thereafter the foundation for such alleged discretion as ground for declining jurisdiction instead of assuming it to exist.\nWhen so examined herein, I fail to find any reason for declining jurisdiction. I also fail to find any adequate reason for the court below granting a new trial.\nI have considered all the cases cited by Mr. Justice Hodgins and supplemental thereto on the same point by counsel for the respondent in their factums. None of them seem to me to touch what is involved in the alleged necessity for the Sugar Company being made a party to this suit.\nThe test of whether or not a party is necessary to the due constitution of a suit, was neatly put by Lord Cairns in the case of Kendall v. Hamilton[17], where he says, at page 516:\u2014\nI conceive that the application to have the person so omitted included as a defendant ought to be granted or refused on the same principles on which a plea in abatement would have succeeded or failed. Pleas of abatement being abolished, as he had observed, did not prevent the application of the test. Such an objection, if relied upon, may still be taken by objection, in the pleading, to the relief being granted unless and until the necessary party has been added or, I imagine, by a motion in chambers.\nNo such course was taken and adhered to herein. If so taken and adhered to, it should not have prevailed.\nWhen the nature of the relief sought is such that parties to the original transaction giving rise to the litigation, and thus in privity with him complaining, have obviously a direct interest in having the question correctly decided they may have, though perhaps not actually necessary to the proper constitution of the suit, a clear right to be added.\nSome of the cases cited are of this character as, for example, that of a party suing and alleging he sues on behalf of all other shareholders, when in fact he does not.\nOther cases, such as those concerned in the construction of a will or its validity, have given rise to those concerned being added.\nThese several cases seem to have been disposed of by application in chambers.\nIn short, I think the rule was correctly laid down by Buckley J. in the case cited by Mr. Justice Hodgins of McCheane v. Gyles (No. 2)[18], at page 917, as follows:\nLooking at the rule you must, in order to say that a person who is not a party ought to be added, find either that he \u201cought to have been joined,\u201d or that his \u201cpresence before the Court may be necessary in order to enable the Court effectually and completely to adjudicate upon and settle all the questions involved in the cause or matter.\u201d\nI understood it to be admitted in argument that the rule in Ontario is in substance the same as that he quoted. And surely if, as in that case, for any reason the absence of a co-trustee of him sued, or the representative of such a co-trustee alleged to have been equally at fault with the one so sued, can furnish no bar to the validity of the proceeding, the absence of one who never had anything to do with the contract in question or the creation of the obligation of which a breach is complained, cannot be heard to complain so long as the one bound by such obligation and answerable in damages is a party and liable also to have the substitutionary relief of an injunction granted against him.\nIt is not necessary to determine the question here of whether or not, for purposes of discovery, for example, or otherwise, some third party or stranger to the creation of the obligation in question, yet who has improperly intervened in thwarting the due observance of the obligation by those who were parties to its creation, might properly have been made a party defendant. The distinction between those who may properly be made parties and others who must, is old and often found applicable.\nOne rather curious feature of this case is that it has not been suggested that the Kent Company, an incorporated holding company possessed of all respondent\u2019s shares, except some held by its directors for qualification purposes, and which seems to have manipulated the whole business transactions now complained of and is to protect the Sugar Company in event of litigation, is a necessary party.\nAnd yet the agreement between that company and the Sugar Company expressly provides for the defence of respondent in case of litigation in some features of its dealings through that company being handed over to the Sugar Company if it so desire. I imagine the legal mind that constructed some of the devices in question had not the same view of the law requiring those conspiring to defeat a solemn obligation directly resting upon others than themselves being necessary parties to litigation arising thereout, that the judgment of the Appellate Division implies.\nI conclude that such like parties are neither necessary parties to this suit nor entitled as of right to intervene and hence no new trial is necessary.\nMoreover this is not a common law action, but essentially a judicial proceeding in the nature of suits or proceedings in equity within the meaning of the excepting part of section 45 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act.\u201d And as we held in Clarke v. Goodall[19], a case may present both common law and equity features, and latter have to be observed in this connection.\nI have therefore no doubt of our jurisdiction to hear the appeal and give the judgment which the court appealed from should have given.\nI cannot agree with the learned trial judge\u2019s construction of the contract as being that which was within the contemplation of the parties. Nor am I free from doubt as to the form of the judgment granting an injunction.\nI am of the opinion that the respondent has violated and threatens to continue violating its covenants with the assignors of the appellant which it is entitled to claim the observance of and, under the circumstances in question herein, to have that observance enforced by an injunction of the court.\nThe agreement of the 3rd November, 1906, between the respondent and Messrs. Symmes and Coste, provided that the latter should for a term of years, yet unexpired, furnish the former, from sources therein referred to, with natural gas.\nI shall presently deal with the questions raised as to the extent of the supply intended by the contract, but meantime think it well to dispose of another aspect of the case presented.\nThe said agreement, by clauses 10 and 11 thereof, provided as follows:\u2014\n10. It is further agreed that the net prices to be charged and collected from consumers of natural gas in Chatham shall be as follows: 25 cents per thousand cubic feet for consumers using natural gas for heating, cooking and other purposes during the months of October to March inclusive; 35 cents per thousand cubic feet for consumers using said gas for heating, cooking and other purposes during the months of April to September inclusive; 35 cents per thousand cubic feet all the year round for consumers using natural gas for cooking, but not for heating, and 15 cents per thousand cubic feet for consumers using 250,000 cubic feet per month or more, excepting what gas shall be used by the Chatham Company at their own works, for which the net price to be paid the producers shall be 7\u00bd cents per thousand cubic feet.\n11. It is further agreed that for all gas furnished hereunder the Chatham Company shall pay the producers as follows: As long as the gross recepts from the sales of gas are less than $60,000 a year, 60 per cent. of the gross receipts shall be paid by the Chatham Company to the producers, and as soon as the gross receipts from sales of gas amount to over $60,000 per year, then the Chatham Company shall pay 66\u2154 per cent. of the gross receipts to the producers and settlement to be made at the end of the year from the time said natural gas is supplied by the producers or at the end of each following year at the same date whenever said receipts have proven to be more than $60,000.\nIt then further provided for the keeping of the necessary meters, books and records, and rendering of accounts whereby the observance of said agreement should be carried out. The binding nature of the limitations upon the prices to be charged was of the essence of the contract.\nThat was fully recognized by respondent for many years in many ways, and especially by several agreements made between itself and others who had become the assignees of the said Messrs. Symmes & Coste, varying the prices and classification thereof either in general or in reference to the supply to particular individuals or companies.\nFor some reason or other they were unable to agree in like manner with regard to the Sugar Company\u2019s request for a supply, and in consequence thereof the respondent most unjustifiably proceeded by indirect means to supply the Sugar Company at a lower rate than it was entitled to serve any one in its class under above quoted clauses or any modification thereof.\nThat was attempted moreover to be put in execution by a deceptive and circuitous method which if maintained would be destructive of the efficacy of the contract.\nThe Kent Company, above referred to, as holding all the shares in respondent company, save such as needed to qualify the directors of the respondent, seemed to have such a curious conception of the obligations of a contract that it undertook to circumvent the provisions of that in question herein, and imagined that it could do so by a juggling of words to accomplish its end.\nIt was content to have the directors of the respondent as its puppets pretend in words it was observing the terms of the contract, whilst it, the real master, behind, was emasculating the vital efficiency thereof by handing back to the Sugar Company the rebate that reduced these words to a nullity.\nIn my opinion such a scheme was conceived in fraud, and is destitute of any legal defence to maintain it in face of the powers of a court of equity which has long exercised the jurisdiction of suppressing fraud.\nI think the appellant is entitled to an injunction so framed as to prohibit the violation by the respondent, directly or indirectly, of the terms of its contract in question.\nWhat I am inclined to doubt, but express no opinion upon, especially in the absence of argument directed to the point, is whether or not the injunction granted by the learned trial judge does not go so far as to exercise a supervision over the execution of the respondent\u2019s business in a way that courts of equity have uniformly declined to accept the burden of in granting injunctions.\nIn the view I have reached and am about to express I need not, if agreed to by a majority of the court, form such a definite opinion as might otherwise be necessary on this point.\nComing to the question which, beyond all others, the parties concerned seemed most anxious to have decided, of whether or not the contract bound the appellant\u2019s assignors, and hence it, to furnish natural gas to serve those needing such service beyond the bounds of the city as they existed at the date of the contract, I desire at the outset to remove any impression that may be derived from the mutual course of conduct which was observable throughout in serving consumers beyond the said limits.\nIf a contract is ambiguous the surrounding circumstances must be considered by way of illuminating that which may have been imperfectly expressed.\nIn other words, if we would understand what men have expressed we must realize the business they were about.\nThat cannot be extended beyond the immediate acts following the signing of their contract.\nI, therefore, exclude all that was done by way of subsequent contracts, evidenced only by the conduct of the parties, in the interpretation or construction of the contract in question. Such subsequent transactions must stand or fall on their merits.\nThe construction of the contract in question depends upon the meaning to be attached to the words \u201cCity of Chatham\u201d used therein, at the time it was executed.\nStress has been laid upon the word \u201ccustomers\u201d and it has been connected in argument with the existence of a customer or customers outside the bounds of the city at the time of the making of the contract, as indicative of some intention to operate beyond the then city limits and hence to extend to any obtainable customers.\nIt is also pointed out that in the first clause the producers were bound to furnish a high pressure line of sufficient capacity for all the requirements of the Chatham Company and its consumers. The subsequent clauses make clear what is meant. The requirements of the company were specially referred to and a lower price therefor charged than to others, being its customers. Again the producers are restrained in clause 4 from furnishing gas to any one outside Chatham excepting the supply shall be greater than that required by the company for itself and its consumers for all purposes.\nAnd again in clause 6 the company is bound to take and supply the gas to its consumers in Chatham.\nInasmuch as the contract is clearly intended to be reciprocal this provision and the entire absence of any provision for outside customers, seems to put beyond peradventure what was meant by the word \u201ccustomers.\u201d Clearly it was only those within the city that were actually provided for.\nThe supply to any others outside must depend upon collateral contracts and whether these were intra vires or not does not concern us here. The scope and purpose of the written contract was the sale of gas in the City of Chatham to customers to be found therein and served there.\nAll other more or less irrelevant issues being eliminated, we have to determine whether it was only the then City of Chatham or also a future greater Chatham that was within the contemplation of the parties in thus framing their contract.\nThe plain literal meaning of the words surely limits the contract to that which was then existent just as much as if the supply contracted for had been for a given factory or block of buildings. What right would any one so bound have to extend it beyond the then present limits? What right have we to extend it beyond?\nSuppose the city had so decayed, or grown in another direction than anticipated, as to render it expedient for purposes of its municipal government to have the limits changed and a part of it cut off, and in that cut off part there was a single factory to which a service pipe of the respondent had extended, could it be said that the appellant might then refuse to furnish gas for that factory, simply because the boundaries of the city had been changed for municipal purposes?\nI put the converse case in order to bring out clearly what is involved in the contention of respondent. I venture to think no court would heed very much such a contention as assumed on the part of appellant in the case I put.\nMoreover there may occur at any moment in a rapidly growing city the annexation of a suburban village already equipped with a plant of its own, or a service supplied by a gas or water company; could the contracting parties serving, just as here, the rapidly growing city, pretend they had as of course in such a contingency thereby the right to serve the village annexed and discard what existed there for the like service? That seems inconceivable, yet it is what had happened and been contended for unsuccessfully in the analogous case of street railways in Detroit.\nI cannot help thinking that the process of reasoning which rests upon the application of by\u2011laws enacted for the general good government of a municipality to any new annexation thereto, and pressed on us as being relevant to and of necessity governing the determination of the contractual rights either of the municipality or those ancillary companies contracting for the service to be given the inhabitants thereof, is essentially unsound.\nI submit there is a confusion of thought in such a mode of reasoning. The promiscuous mingling of the governmental jurisdiction of a council with the contractual relation of the corporate body does not help to anything but to confuse and mislead. And none the less so when we know that the mode of entering into a contract must be by by-law and the legislative function must also be discharged by a by-law.\nTo apply that mode of reasoning as sought herein must inevitably lead to unjust and possibly in some cases disastrous consequences.\nWhatever may be said and there is much in favour of the reasonable expectation of a local company incorporated under and by virtue of the statute whereby respondent was first and secondly constituted, being liable to be defeated by the narrower construction of the said statutes than respondent contends for, is to my mind far outweighed by the consequences liable to flow from the maintenance of such contention.\nIt is to be observed that this sort of corporate companies are by the statutes enabling their creation so limited as to capital and time of existence as to shew they were only intended as a temporary expedient.\nAnd, as if anticipating the very argument set up herein derivable from their creation by by-law and the enactment that in case of annexations the by-laws of the annexing municipality are to prevail, the statute has been amended to read as follows:\u2014\nSection 33. Where a district or a municipality is annexed to a municipality, its by-laws shall extend to such district or annexed municipality, and the by-laws in force therein shall cease to apply to it, except those relating to highways, which shall remain in force until repealed by the council of the municipality to which the district or municipality is annexed, and except by-laws conferring rights, privileges, franchises, immunities or exemptions which could not have been lawfully repealed by the council which passed them.\nI call attention to the excepting part of this new clause which I may be permitted to suggest is of very doubtful import.\nClearly it was intended to prohibit the very conflict I have suggested as possible by virtue of annexations of villages to towns or cities.\nEvidently the draftsman did not suppose that such a conflict was in law possible by a claim on the part of those supplying a service to the larger and annexing municipality, as here in question.\nThe \u201cMunicipal Franchises Act,\u201d 2 George V., ch. 42, seems on the facts presented to be an impassable barrier in the respondent\u2019s way herein, unless its contention that by virtue of the annexation it obtained by force of its charter a right to serve the annexed part is maintainable.\nI have suggested all I need say in that regard.\nMy opinion is that the instrument before us is but a contract which related to a limited period and only contemplated a service for the purposes of the City of Chatham as it existed at the date thereof. The like reasoning which supported that part of the judgment of this court in the case of Toronto Railway Co. v. Toronto[20], and the court above in the same case[21], relative to the boundaries of the city at the date of the contract being the governing line and limit of the operation of the contract, seems to me to support the opinion I express.\nI recognize, however, that as has been so often said, decisions upon one contract may be of little service in determining the meaning of another. As illustrations, however, they are no doubt useful.\nAnd in closing I may be permitted to say that I have a great reluctance to extending by implications, unless so clear as to be necessary to execute the purpose of the parties as expressed, that which is not expressed in a contract, and especially so when that contract is one in common use likely to bring undesirable consequences as the result of such treatment. I have more faith in parties being able to express what they want than in any guess a court is likely to make.\nThe respondent argues that its charter by its very nature shews it was intended to operate in the whole of the municipality whatever might be its bounds and the company to serve all the inhabitants thereof.\nI have already illustrated how such a contention if upheld might produce undesirable results and attempted to shew thereby how doubtful the proposition may be in law.\nThe tendency of these several statutory changes I have just cited as illustrative of the minds of legislators relative to such a contention, rather suggests that the view put forward as to the scope of such like charters has not been generally accepted and hence cannot fairly be said to have been one of the things which inevitably must have been present to the minds of Messrs. Symmes & Coste in framing the contract, and hence necessarily within the contemplation of the parties.\nIt may well be that the powers of a corporate company must form in arriving at an agreement the subject of due and full consideration in some cases. But it does not in this sort of case necessarily go beyond attention being paid to the actual fact of its having power to do that which the parties contracting with it have presented to their minds.\nAnd if the respondent had clearly the widest sort of corporate power entitling it to go far beyond the bounds of the city in carrying on its business, that fact could not expand the plain literal meaning of the words used.\nThere is far more force in the counter argument of appellant that this unexpected demand upon its material appliances and resources would render it necessary to double its capacity.\nThat, however, is a contingency that possibly might have arisen had chance brought the Sugar Company to locate within the bounds of the city as they existed at the date of the contract.\nNeither argument seems to me entitled to much weight relative to the construction of the contract.\nThe lastly mentioned one, however, does bring added force to the appellant\u2019s case by emphasizing the unjustifiable conduct of the respondent in seeking to destroy the efficacy of the contract relative to the rates to be charged.\nI conclude that the parties having, in framing this contract, had in contemplation only a service for the inhabitants of the city as then delimitated, it should be so declared and an injunction be granted as prayed, and alternatively that in any event the appellant is entitled to have the respondent enjoined against departing from the terms of the contract as modified.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the injunction granted as prayed for with costs to the appellant throughout.\nDUFF J.\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal in this case should be allowed in part.\nANGLIN J. (dissenting)\u2014The foundation for, as well as the occasion of, this action is alleged contravention by the defendant of its contractual obligations to the plaintiff involved in a contract for a supply of natural gas made by the defendant with the Dominion Sugar Company. No other breach of the contract between the plaintiff (assignee of Symmes & Coste) and the defendant is suggested in the statement of claim. In addition to a judgment declaratory of the rights of the plaintiff and defendant inter se as to the area within which the latter is entitled to distribute natural gas supplied to it by the former, the plaintiff expressly prays for an injunction restraining the defendant from supplying to the Sugar Company natural gas furnished by it.\nThe learned trial judge held that upon the proper construction of the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant the situation of the Sugar Company\u2019s refinery did not preclude the defendant from supplying it with gas furnished by the plaintiff. In his opinion, however, the contract between the defendant and the Sugar Company was unfair to the plaintiff and such that the defendant was not entitled to require the plaintiff to supply gas to enable it to be carried out, in that, although to provide means of furnishing the quantity of gas which the Sugar Company might need would entail a duplication of the plaintiff\u2019s plant at great expense, there was no obligation on the part of the Sugar Company actually to take more than a trifling quantity of gas, and that a collateral agreement for a rebate gave that company an undue preference over other Chatham consumers, and was also contrary to the bargain as to prices to be charged by the defendant to its customers fixed by its contract with the plaintiff. He granted an injunction restraining the defendant from diverting gas supplied by the plaintiff to the Sugar Company under the existing agreement between that company and the defendant and under any other agreement that might be made or other conditions that might arise until sanctioned by the court.\nThe Appellate Division, expressing no opinion upon the construction of the contract between the plaintiff and defendant as to the area within which gas furnished under it might be supplied by the defendant to its customers, but disapproving of the order disabling it from making any agreement with the Sugar Company except with the sanction of the court, was unanimously of the opinion that in the absence of the Sugar Company the action was not properly constituted. The course suggested by the court, that that company might be added with its own consent and that of the present parties and the case determined on the record so amended, having for some reason been found unacceptable, the judgment of the trial judge was set aside, and a new trial ordered, with liberty to the plaintiff to add the Sugar Company as a party defendant. From that judgment the plaintiff now appeals.\nIt is obvious that the first matter for consideration is whether the appellant is entitled ex debito justiti\u0153 to obtain the relief which it seeks without the Sugar Com- pany being brought before the court, or whether, either because that company is a necessary party, or because judicial discretion would be properly exercised in directing that it should be added as a defendant, in order that it may have an opportunity of upholding any rights which its contract with the defendant purports to confer before it should be determined that those rights are non-existent, the order pronounced by the Appellate Division should be sustained.\nUnder its contract with the defendant it is natural gas furnished by the plaintiff that the Sugar Company is to receive. The obligation of the defendant to supply and that of the Sugar Company to take is to\ncontinue so long as natural gas can be obtained or secured by the Gas Company (the defendant) under and pursuant to the terms of the agreement between the Gas Company and the producers (the plaintiff).\u201d\nIt may at least be arguable that if the plaintiff is unwilling and cannot be compelled to furnish gas to the defendant for delivery to the Sugar Company there is a failure of the subject matter of the contract between the defendant and the Sugar Company, and that consequently an action by the latter against the former for damages for breach of contract would not lie. As Mr. Justice Hodgins points out, we are not dealing with the ordinary case of \u201ca contract for the supply of a commercial article,\u201d in respect of which, upon his vendor\u2019s failure to deliver, a sub\u2011purchaser would have the ordinary recourse in damages.\nUnder these circumstances, if the construction should be placed upon its contract with the defendant for which the plaintiff contends, the effect might be to determine that the Sugar Company has no rights whatever against the present defendant. Such a determination of the Sugar Company\u2019s rights and position behind its back, though not binding upon it as res judicata, could not but prove prejudicial to it in any future contest over the same question. Moreover, unless the Sugar Company should be deterred by the practical effect of an adverse judgment rendered in this action from seeking to enforce its contractual claims, a second litigation of the same question (its right as a customer of the defendant within the present limits of the City of Chatham to be supplied with natural gas furnished by the plaintiff) must ensue\u2014a result which it is now the policy of the courts to obviate, when that may be done without seriously prejudicing or embarrassing the plaintiff, by adding parties not otherwise necessary, but proper to be added within the limits prescribed by the rules. Clifton v. Crawford[22]; Cornell v. Smith[23].\nWhile an injunction forbidding the present defendant from delivering to the Sugar Company gas received from the plaintiff would not bind the Sugar Company so as to render it technically liable for a breach thereof because it would not be enjoined from receiving the gas, yet it would be just as effectively prevented from taking gas furnished by the plaintiff as if it had been so enjoined because such taking, with knowledge of the injunction, would be \u201cassisting in setting the court at defiance\u201d\u2014would \u201cobstruct the course of justice\u201d\u2014would \u201ccontumaciously set at naught the order of the court\u201d\u2014and would therefore properly render the Sugar Company punishable for contempt. Seaward v. Paterson[24], at pages 554 et seq.; Scott v. Scott[25], at page 457.\nThe case of Hartlepool Gas & Water Co. v. West Hartlepool Harbour & Rly. Co.[26], cited by Mr. Justice Hodgins, is indistinguishable in principle from that at bar. In alleged violation of an agreement with the plaintiff, the defendant in the Hartlepool Case26 supplied its lessees (P.S. & Co.) with water not obtained from the plaintiff. Kindersley V.C., although he thought, as then advised, that the defendant could be restrained from doing this, was\nquite satisfied that the court cannot express any such opinion in the absence of P.S. & Co. so as to deal with them in such a manner as most materially to affect the important interests of those absent parties. * * * If the defendants had not entered into any lease or contract with P.S. & Co., I should grant the injunction, but inasmuch as they have entered into this lease or contract, I cannot grant an injunction without doing such prejudice to P.S. & Co. as ought not to be done to an absent party. It is not because the defendants would not (sic) be liable to an action by P.S. & Co. or to any inconvenience which might arise but it is because the court, on principle, will not ordinarily and without special necessity interfere by injunction, where the injunction will have the effect of very materially injuring the rights of third persons not before the court.\nThe interests of their lessees (P.S. & Co.) in that case would have been affected by an injunction against the defendants precisely in the same manner as those of the Sugar Company would be affected by an injunction against the present defendant.\nIt is, no doubt, quite within the power of the court to determine the construction of the contract between the parties to it in this action as now constituted. In that sense the Sugar Company is not a necessary party. If it rests on the contrary view, the judgment of the Appellate Division, even were this not an equitable action, would not be non-appealable under section 45 of the \u201cSupreme Court Act.\u201d Yet, having regard to all the circumstances, and particularly to the obvious prejudice to the Sugar Company\u2019s contractual claims which must result from a judgment adverse to the defendant, to the occasion for and object of the present action, the form which it has been given, the allegations of the statement of claim and the relief sought, and to the desirability of having an adjudication in it which will preclude a second action upon the same issue, in my opinion, the order directing a new trial and giving the plaintiff liberty to add the Sugar Company as a defendant may well be supported as one that might have been made in the exercise of a judicial discretion which could not be held to have been erroneous.\nFor these reasons it would seem to me to be improper to grant relief by injunction in the absence of the Sugar Company; relief by way of damages for breach of contract is not asked and would scarcely be appropriate; and the circumstances are not such that the discretionary power of the court (In re Berens[27]), to pronounce a declaratory judgment unaccompanied by consequential relief, which, wide as it is (Guaranty Trust Co. v. Hannay & Co.[28], at pages 562, 564), is always acted upon \u201cwith extreme care and caution\u201d (North Eastern Marine Engineering Co. v. Leeds Forge Co.[29]); Faber v. Gosworth Urban District Council[30], and usually only if it does not involve \u201cinterfering with the rights of other persons\u201d (Austen v. Collins[31]), should be exercised.\nIn England, where the provision for pronouncing declaratory judgments, formerly contained in the statute 15 & 16 Vict. ch. 86, sec. 50, is now found in an extended form in a Rule of Court (O. XXV., r. 5), its validity in this latter form has been upheld by the Court of Appeal on the ground that it does not confer jurisdiction in the sense that without it the court would lack \u201cpower to deal with and decide the dispute as to the subject-matter before it,\u201d but merely enables it to do so \u201cin a different manner, under different circumstances and when brought before it by a different person,\u201d and that it is therefore \u201conly dealing with practice and procedure.\u201d Guaranty Trust Co. v. Hannay & Co.[32], at pages 563-4, 570. In Ontario the former Chancery Order, No. 538, which corresponded with the former Imperial statute (15 & 16 Vict. ch. 86, sec. 50) is now replaced, likewise in an extended form, by sec. 16 (b) of the \u201cJudicature Act,\u201d which is identical with the present English O. XXV., r. 5. Under the Ontario statute, as under the English Rule of Court, whatever may be the proper view as to the scope and character of the provision itself, the propriety under any given set of circumstances of exercising the power which it enunciates cannot be other than a matter of practice and procedure\u2014just such a matter as it has been time and again decided should be finally determined by the Appellate Court of the province in which it arises, and, without questioning our jurisdiction, has been held not to be a proper subject of appeal to this court. Emperor of Russia v. Proskouriakoff[33]; Green v. George[34]; Cameron\u2019s S.C. Practice 85; Arpin v. Merchants Bank[35].\nI would therefore be disposed to dismiss this appeal without any expression of opinion upon the construction of the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant.\nIn deference however to the contrary opinion on this aspect of the case held by the majority of the court, I proceed to state briefly my view upon the proper construction of the contract between the plaintiff and defendant as to the area within which the defendant is entitled to distribute natural gas supplied by the plaintiff. The contract requires that the producers (the plaintiff) shall furnish to the defendant natural gas\nthrough a high pressure line or lines of sufficient capacity for all the requirements of the Chatham Company and its consumers:\nthat they shall so\nfurnish to the Chatham Company natural gas in sufficient quantities at all times for the purposes of the Chatham Company\u2019s present and future consumers, and the Chatham Company\u2019s own use * * * and shall use due diligence at all times in prospecting and drilling wells for gas so that the supply may be continuous for all the purposes of the Chatham Company, and * * * shall make any reasonable expenditure that may be necessary to make the supply continuous:\nand that they\nshall not furnish natural gas in Chatham during the continuance of this contract to any person or corporation other than the Chatham Company so long as the Chatham Company continues to take its supply from the producers.\nIt requires the Chatham Company to take its supply from the producers (the plaintiff), unless they are unable to deliver it, and forbids the producers supplying any person or corporation outside the city, except\ncustomers along their high pressure line, between the field and Chatham, unless the supply from time to time shall be greater that that required by the Chatham Company for itself and its consumers for all purposes.\nIt requires the Chatham Company to maintain and operate\na system of mains, pipes, fixtures and apparatus suitable and sufficient to distribute the gas to be supplied under this contract to any person, firm or corporation in the said City of Chatham desiring to use the same.\nTwo features stand out as essential and predominant in this contract\u2014the defendant is obliged to take all its gas from the plaintiff (so long as it can furnish sufficient for the defendant\u2019s business) and to provide for its distribution to every person in Chatham desiring to use it; the plaintiff is obliged to supply (as far as it can or as due diligence and reasonable expenditure will enable it to do so) all the gas required by the defendant for itself and all its customers. The franchise of the defendant to distribute, and the obligation of the plaintiff to furnish gas (within the limitation stated) would therefore appear to be co\u2011extensive and coterminous and to have been intended to remain so during the term of the contract between the plaintiff and the defendant. The limit of the plaintiff\u2019s obligation is the requirements of the Chatham Gas Company within its franchise.\nThe Chatham Gas Company was constituted in 1872, under a power then enjoyed by municipal corporations (C.S.C., ch. 65) enabling them to incorporate companies \u201cfor supplying cities, towns and villages with gas and water,\u201d by a by-law of the Town of Chatham which recited the desirability of \u201clighting with gas the streets and buildings of the said town\u201d and gave it authority for that purpose to \u201clay down pipes or conduits under any of the streets or public squares of the town.\u201d It was \u201cre-created and re-constructed\u201d under the same statutory authority (R.S.O., [1877] ch. 157) by a by-law passed in 1884, and its corporate existence was formally recognized and declared by the Ontario statute 48 Vict. ch. 81. The right to substitute natural gas for artificial gas, if it did not already possess it, was conferred upon it by a by-law in 1906, when its agreement with the plaintiff was made.\nIt was the obvious purpose in creating this corporation that its franchise and its functions should be territorially co-extensive with the area of the municipality. The creation of such a company was the means provided by the legislature for the carrying on of a public utility under municipal authority and control for the benefit of an entire city, town or village. It was intended that the Chatham Gas Company should supply the needs of all citizens. Its franchise was perpetual. It would seem to follow that, as the municipal limits should extend, the franchise of the Gas Company with its co-related powers and obligations should also extend. If not, it would lose its municipal identity and the purpose of its creation would be defeated.\nWhen the territory within which the refinery of the Dominion Sugar Company is situated was brought into the City of Chatham, the franchise, powers and obligations of the Chatham Gas Company, in my opinion, automatically extended to the area so annexed, subject, it may be, to any existing right or franchise of the plaintiff or any other company within the annexed territory. R.S.O. [1914] ch. 192, sec. 33; Wentworth v. Hamilton Radial Electric Railway Co.[36] There was no exclusive gas franchise in this annexed territory.\nMoreover, assuming that the contract should be construed as the plaintiff contends, I am by no means satisfied that it is entitled in this action as now framed to a declaration that its contractual obligation with the defendant is restricted to supplying gas to be distributed within the limits of the City of Chatham as it existed at the date of the contract, the 6th November, 1906. The plaintiff well knew that at that time the defendant was supplying gas to a considerable number of consumers outside the limits of the city and it has since continued, with the knowledge and acquiescence of the plaintiff, to supply these and other outside consumers with natural gas furnished by the plaintiff. The plaintiff has for upwards of ten years under the terms of the contract knowingly taken its 60%, or 66\u2154% of the defendant\u2019s receipts from such customers. If granted the declaration it seeks, the plaintiff would be entitled now to require the defendant to cut off all these customers. A general injunction restraining it from supplying consumers outside the limits of the city as they were in 1906 would have that effect and would seem to be open to the objections that it would be unfair to many persons not represented and also ultra petita, the only injunction asked being to restrain the supplying of gas to the Sugar Company. It may be worthy of the plaintiff\u2019s consideration whether there should not also be representation of other outside consumers.\nIn the absence of the Dominion Sugar Company the only observation I desire to make upon other features of its contractual relations with the defendant referred to in the judgment of the learned trial judge is that, at all events without some explanation not in the record, at least one of them\u2014that providing for a rebate through the medium of a holding company\u2014savours of methods which a court of justice cannot countenances.\nIf required now to dispose finally of the present action I should dismiss it.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Kerr & McNevin.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Wilson, Pike & Stewart.\n[1] 40 Ont.

C.C.\u2014Appeal\u2014Jurisdiction\u2014Supreme Court Act, section 46 (b).\nBy an agreement respecting the unexpired term of an emphyteutic lease, it was stipulated that the vendor should be obliged to give to the buyer a deed of sale of all his rights and claims upon the lease when a sum of two hundred dollars had been wholly paid, and thereupon the buyer should enter into full proprietorship of the immoveable (under the terms of Art. 569 C.C.) subject to the payment of the emphyteutic rent.\nHeld, Anglin J. dissenting, that the intention of the parties was that the sale was to be deemed perfected by the payment of the sum stipulated, without it being necessary for the buyer to take out a title deed.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014When the payment was made, the buyer would become entitled to a transfer of the vendor's title and would enter into full proprietorship only after such transfer should have been made.\nHeld, Duff J. dissenting, that the existence or non-existence of proprietorship of a lot of land held under an emphyteutic lease \"relates * * * to * * * title to lands or tenements\" within the clause (b) of section 46 of the Supreme Court Act.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, maintaining the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Quebec[1], and maintaining the action with costs.\nThe immoveable property in question in this case was leased by the respondent to one Gigu\u00e8re for a period of twenty-five years; and subsequently, the unexpired portion of this lease, to wit two years, was sold for taxes due by the tenant and purchased by the appellant. The appellant then leased that unexpired portion to one Mrs. Falardeau; and the agreement between them contains this provision:\nIl est convenu entre les parties, que la dite Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec sera tenue et oblig\u00e9e de consentir \u00e0 la dite Dame Falardeau un titre de vente de ses droits et pr\u00e9tentions sur les dits baux emphyt\u00e9otiques lorsque la dite somme de deux cents piastres aura \u00e9t\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement pay\u00e9e, et alors la dite Dame Falardeau entrera en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du susdit immeuble, sujet toutefois au paiement de la dite rente emphyt\u00e9otique.\nMrs. Falardeau entered into possession of the property immediately after the lease was made, and she fulfilled all her obligations to the appellant, her vendor and to the respondent, the landlord; but she did not apply for nor obtain a deed of sale.\nThe appeal turns upon the meaning of the above clause, interpreted in accordance with the above facts and the intentions of the parties and the question to be decided is whether Mrs. Falardeau or the appellant has the proprietorship of the immoveable leased.\nL. A. Taschereau K.C. and J. E. Chapleau K.C. for the appellant.\nChs. Angers K.C. and Louis Larue for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of the opinion, with all possible respect, that we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal under section 46 (b) of the \"Supreme Court Act.\" By this action, the plaintiff (respondent here) claims: (a) the possession as landlord of a lot of land held as he alleges, by the city, under an emphyteutic lease; and (b) the payment of different sums of money for arrears of rent, for damages and for repairs. The question at issue between the parties relates therefore to the right or title to property held under emphyteutic lease. Emphyteusis carries with it alienation; and, so long as it lasts, the lessee enjoys the rights attached to the quality of a proprietor. Art. 569 C. C.\nLe droit de l'emphyt\u00e9ote est r\u00e9el et puisqu'il s'exerce dans un immeuble, c'est un droit r\u00e9el immobilier.\nLaurent, vol. 8, No. 352. Delisle v. Areand[2]. This point was not raised at the argument\nOn the merits, I have reached the conclusion that the city is not now, and has not been for many years, to the knowledge of Lampson, in possession of the property in question, and that whatever rights the city acquired under the sheriff's title, hereinafter referred to, were assigned to Falardeau. The facts are not in dispute. The whole controversy turns upon the obligation of the city to pay rent for the property during the occupancy of Falardeau and that obligation depends upon the effect to be given the deed made by the city to Falardeau. Was it a mere lease, as Lampson contends, or did it operate to transfer the title to the realty for the unexpired term of the lease?\nI do not think that either of the parties to these proceedings ever intended to argue that emphyteutic rent can be collected from a tenant who has, by valid assignment, parted with his rights in the property held under the emphyteutic lease. The confusion has, I think, arisen out of the claim which appears to have been made that novation was effected by the substitution of Falardeau as the debtor of the rent in place of the city with the consent of Lampson. That is the question which the Chief Justice who tried the case deals with, and I agree with that distinguished judge, who held that a case of novation was not made out. I have, however, the misfortune to be unable to agree to the construction which the Chief Justice puts on the deed by the city to Falardeau. It is, I grant, difficult to imagine how such a simple agreement as the parties evidently had in contemplation could have been so clumsily expressed. But, in construing a deed what must be sought is the intention of the parties; and however ambiguous and involved the language they used may be, if that intention can be ascertained with reasonable certainty, then effect must be given to it. Mr. Justice Archibald, in the case of Stevenson v. Rollit[3], gives the rule of construction applicable to deeds which contain a promise of sale of an immoveable when followed by actual possession. As that learned judge says, the answer to the question as to whether the right of property has or has not passed must be gathered from the promise of sale as to the intention of the parties. If there is\na clause in the promise of sale which provides that the right of property should not pass, the courts have never held that, notwithstanding such provision, the right of property did pass.\nBut, in the absence of such a provision, effect must be given to article 1478 C.C.\nLes parties ont stipul\u00e9 express\u00e9ment qu'elles entendaient faire un contrat de location, mais le rapport de droit, tel qu'il r\u00e9sulte objectivement des clauses de l'acte, correspond au contrat de vente dont l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment sp\u00e9cifique, transfert de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, se trouve r\u00e9alis\u00e9. S.V. 1888, 1. 87; D. 96, 1. 57; D. 98, 1. 271.\nThis appeal, as I understand the contentions of the parties, turns upon the question as to whether it was the intention of the city not to part with the property held under emphyteutic lease until the \"titre de vente,\" i.e., the title deed or writing evidencing the sale was taken out by Mrs. Falardeau. There is no doubt that the deed of lease contains a promise of sale and that Mrs. Falardeau entered into possession thereunder. But it is said it was a condition of the deed that the title should not pass until Mrs. Falardeau had applied for and obtained her deed of sale.\nThe property in question was leased by Lampson to one Gigu\u00e8re for a term of years under emphyteutic lease and subsequently the unexpired portion of that term was sold for taxes due by the tenant. It was purchased by the city and the agreement now in question was then entered into. By that agreement, the city leased to Mrs. Falardeau for two years the unexpired portion of the lease to Gigu\u00e8re, the lessee undertaking to pay to the city $200 in eight equal instalments of $25 each and to Lampson, the landlord, his emphyteutic rent. In a word, by the terms of the lease, Mrs. Falardeau assumes all the obligations of a proprietor and, in addition, agrees to pay the city for its interest the $200 above mentioned. Then the lease contains this provision:\nIl est convenu entre les parties, que la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec sera tenue et oblig\u00e9e de consentir \u00e0 la dite Dame Falardeau un litre de vente de ses droits et pr\u00e9tentions sur les dits baux emphyt\u00e9otiques lorsque la dite somme de deux cents piastres aura \u00e9t\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement pay\u00e9e, et alors la dite Dame Falardeau entrera en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du susdit immeuble, sujet toutefois au paiement de la dite rente emplryt\u00e9otique.\nThis appeal turns upon the meaning of that language. I construe that clause, read with all that precedes, to mean that, when the sum of $200 has been paid, Mrs. Falardeau becomes the owner of the unexpired term of Gigu\u00e8re's lease acquired by the city under the sheriff's title and, in addition, the city binds itself to give a deed conveying to Mrs. Falardeau all its rights and pretensions to the unexpired portion of the lease. Mrs. Falardeau entered into possession of the property immediately after the lease was made to her and she fulfilled all her obligations to the city, her vendor, and to Lampson, the landlord; and it is now for us to say what was in all these circumstances the intention of the parties when they made that agreement. It is reasonably clear that Mrs. Falardeau meant to acquire and the city to sell all the right of the latter in the property. The total consideration stipulated for was the sum of $200 and when that sum was paid to the city Mrs. Falardeau had fulfilled her part of the agreement. She could then, at any time, force the city to give her the paper title, which would be merely evidence of the fact that she had performed her part of the agreement. The language of the deed, as I have already said, is not happily chosen; but why should we assume that the taking out of the paper title by Mrs. Falardeau was a condition of the sale? Nothing remained to be done by her when she had completed her payments and it is not easy to see why the city should make it a condition of the sale that Mrs. Falardeau should take out a deed. What could be the possible object of such a stipulation?\nThe language of the instrument is:\nIl est convenu * * * que le cit\u00e9 sera tenue et oblig\u00e9e de consentir \u00e0 un litre de vente * * * lorsque la dite somme de deux cents piastres aura \u00e9t\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement pay\u00e9e.\nI can find in these words no trace of any intention by the city to retain the title to the property after the $200 had been paid. When that sum was paid, Mrs. Falardeau had fulfilled all her obligations to her vendor and she was entitled absolutely and of right to her \"titre de vente\"\u2014document of title. The city could not refuse to give it to her and therein this case is clearly distinguishable from such cases as Stevenson v. Rollit[4]; Hogan v. City of Montreal[5]; Thomas v. Aylen[6]; Grange v. McLennan[7], which will all be found collected at pp. 29 and 30 of Mignault, vol. 7. That learned author sums up his analysis of all these cases thus:\u2014\nQuelle interpr\u00e9tation devra-t-on donner \u00e0 la clause par laquelle le vendeur s'engage \u00e0 donner un titre lorsque le prix sera pay\u00e9? C'est une question d'interpr\u00e9tation de l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'intention des parties.\nIt is difficult for me to find in the language of the instrument an intention to give the purchaser the right to enjoy the property for years, and then permit her by refusing to exercise her discretionary right to take the paper title to defeat the whole scheme of the agreement. It is not, I insist, the vendor which stipulates, as in the cases referred to by Mignault, for the retention of the title for its own protection, but the purchaser who neglects to exercise her right to ask for and obtain the evidence of the transaction entered into with the city. Under the Code, sale is perfected by the consent alone of the parties (Arts. 1472 C.C.; 1025 C.C.). No deed is necessary and the paper title gave no additional force or effect to the transaction in so far as Mrs. Falardeau was concerned. The latter, as I have already said, entered into possession immediately after the lease was passed, made her payments within the stipulated time and thereafter dealt with the property as if it was her own, not only to the knowledge of the city but also of Lampson who treated her as his emphyteutic tenant.\nIt is said that there was no obligation on the part of Mrs. Falardeau to acquire the emphyteusis; but that was the consideration for the payment of $200. The emphyteusis was the thing sold or for which she agreed to pay and did pay the $200 and of which she entered into possession immediately when the deed was made. As for tradition, I assume that Pothier's definition will be accepted by the majority:\nLa tradition r\u00e9elle est celle qui se fait par une pr\u00e9hension corporelle de la chose faite par celui \u00e0 qui on entend en faire la tradition, ou par quelqu'un de sa part. Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour la tradition r\u00e9elle qu'il en soit fait un acte par \u00e9crit.\n(Art. 1493 C.C.). The obligation to deliver is satisfied when the buyer enters into possession with consent of seller. Title passes by the effect of the contract (1025 C.C.).\nOn the whole, I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014I concur with His Lordship the Chief Justice.\nIdington J.\u2014I concur with His Lordship the Chief Justice.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014I am to dismiss for want of jurisdiction, with costs.\nAnglin J. (dissenting).\u2014The plaintiff, as emphyteutic lessor, sues the City of Quebec, as purchaser, at a judicial sale for taxes, of the unexpired term of two emphyteutic leases, for an unpaid balance of the ground rent or canon accrued since the purchase, for the cost of neglected repairs which the emphyteutic lessee was bound to make, and for delivery up of the leased premises, the emphyteusis having now expired. To this claim the city pleads that it sold its interest in the premises to one Mme. Falardeau, and that she has been the sole proprietress thereof under the emphyteutic leases since the first of August 1896, In his reply the plaintiff denies that Falardeau had acquired title as emphyteutic proprietor and alleges that his rights against the defendant remained unaffected by any agreement made by the defendant with her.\nThe learned trial judge[8], maintained the action, holding that the city by purchasing the leaseholds at a judicial sale became personally responsible to the lessor for payment of the rent or emphyteutic canon as well as for the other obligations of the original lessee; that a lien de droit was thereby established between it and the lessor whereby the latter became creditor and the former debtor in respect of the rent and other obligations of the leases; and that, in the absence of novation, the city was not relieved of the liability thus assumed merely by reason of the occupation or enjoyment of the leasehold premises by Mme. Falardeau \u00e0 titre d'emphyt\u00e9ote, her payments of rent to Lampson and a statement made by her that she had acquired the city's rights.\nThe Court of King's Bench unanimously affirmed the judgment for the plaintiff, on the ground, however, that, although an alienation of the emphyteusis made by the city in good faith would have relieved it of future obligations to the emphyteutic landlord, there has not in fact been such an alienation to Falardeau.\nHaving regard to the nature of an emphyteusis \u2014it conveys the immoveable for a time to the lessee (art. 567 C.C.); so long as it lasts he enjoys all the rights attached to the quality of a proprietor,\u2014may alienate, transfer and hypothecate the immoveable so leased (art. 569-570 C.C.); his interest may be seized and sold as real property (art. 571 C.C.); he is held for all the real rights and land charges to which the property is subjected (art. 576 C.C); the rent itself is an immoveable (art. 388 C.C.): En effet, le bail emphyt\u00e9otique est une ali\u00e9nation de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 utile au profit du preneur pendant tout le temps que doit durer le bail, la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 directe demeurant reserv\u00e9e au bailleur;\n(Merlin, Rep. vbo. Emphyt\u00e9ose, 1,3)\u2014 I entertain no doubt that the issue as to the existence or non-existence of this proprietorship in the defendant \"relates to title to lands or tenements\" within clause (b) of s. 46 of the Supreme Court Act and that we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal.\nThat the City of Quebec by its purchase of the unexpired term of the emphyteutic leases at the judicial sale thereof assumed the obligations of the emphyteutic lessee is not now questioned. It has, of course, not been suggested that its undertaking was more extensive or more onerous. Agreeing, as I do, with the view which prevailed in the Court of King's Bench, that the plaintiff is entitled to succeed on the ground that the city never effectively parted with its interest to Mme. Falardeau, it is unnecessary to pass upon the \"consid\u00e9rant\" as to the absence of proof of novation, on which the learned Chief Justice of the Superior Court reached the same conclusion. It should perhaps be noted, however, that the case of Credit Foncier Franco-Canadien v. Young[9], cited by him would seem not to be in point. The lease, under which, in the absence of novation, the original lessee was there condemned to pay rent accrued after he had transferred his interest, reserved much more than a nominal rent and did not contain a stipulation obliging the lessee to improve the property and was therefore held not to be an emphyteusis, but an ordinary lease. The opinion of Merlin seems to conflict with the view taken by the learned Chief Justice and to point to the conclusion that, apart from any consideration of novation, on alienation of an emphyteusis, unless perhaps in the exceptional case where\nle preneur par le contrat d'arrentement a promis fournir et faire valoir la rente, et a ce oblig\u00e9 tous ses biens,\nor has otherwise expressly assumed a personal obligation to remain responsible thereafter (Dubois v. Hall[10]), his liability for future rent ceases. Merlin, Rep. (5 ed.) vol. 7, Vbo. \"D\u00e9guerpissement\" s. III., 1; s. IV., 1, and s. V., 1. The facts that an emphyteusis is terminated by the total loss of the estate leased, or by abandonment (art. 579 C.C) that it imports the power of alienation and that the rent itself is an immoveable seem rather to support the view that, at all events in the absence of some explicit agreement by the lessee to remain liable for the rent after and notwithstanding a transfer of it, his personal liability terminates on its complete and bon\u00e2 fide alienation. It is unnecessary however to dwell further upon this aspect of the case since I am of the opinion that in the present instance there has not been the complete and effective alienation or transfer of the emphyteusis by the city which the learned appellate judges think would suffice to terminate its liability to the lessor. As put by Mr. Justice Lavergne:\nUne fois substitu\u00e9e au preneur originaire, le Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec ne pouvait se lib\u00e9rer de ses obligations quant au canon emphyt\u00e9otique et au maintien de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en bon \u00e9tat, que par une ali\u00e9nation de bonne foi, ou le d\u00e9guerpissement aux termes des articles 579 et suivants.\nThere is no question of abandonment here.\nAfter acquiring the emphyteusis the city sublet the premises to Falardeau for two years from the 1st of August, 1894, at a rental of $100 a year, payable quarterly, Falardeau undertaking to pay in addition the emphyteutic rent and all rates and taxes and keep the buildings in repair. This lease contained the following clause:\nIl est convenu entre les parties, que la dite Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec sera tenue et oblig\u00e9e de consentir \u00e0 la dite Dame Falardeau un titre de vente de ses droits et pr\u00e9tensions sur les dits baux emphyt\u00e9otiques lorsque la dite somme de deux cents piastres aura \u00e9t\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement pay\u00e9e, et alors la dite Dame Falardeau entrera en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 du susdit immeuble, sujet toutefois au paiement de la dite rente emphyt\u00e9otique.\nAs I translate it into English, this clause reads:\nIt is agreed between the parties that the said City of Quebec shall be held and obliged to give to the said Dame Falardeau a deed of sale of all its rights and claims upon the said emphyteutic leases when the said sum of $200 shall have been wholly paid, and thereupon the said Dame Falardeau shall enter into full proprietorship of the aforesaid immoveable, subject always to the payment of the said emphyteutic rent.\nAlthough she paid the $200 as stipulated, a deed of transfer of the emphyteusis from the city has never been executed. Her lease from the city is the only title Mme. Falardeau has to the property. As Mr. Justice Lavergne says:\nL'appelante a consenti \u00e0 Madame Falardeau un simple bail pour deux ans, avec promesse de lui transf\u00e9rer la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 une fois la somme de $200 pay\u00e9e; elle ne lui a jamais consenti la vente promise.\nMr. Justice Pelletier makes the same statement. I agree with the construction placed by those learned judges on the clause which I have quoted from the city's lease to Falardeau. Mr. Justice Pelletier says:\u2014\nL'acte que nous avons devant nous est un bail avec une clause d\u00e9clarant que, au cas de l'accomplissement de deux conditions, Mme. Falardeau pourrait devenir propri\u00e9taire; ces deux conditions sont: lo, le paiement de $200 par Mime. Falardeau \u00e0 la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec; 20. la passation d'un titre. La clause du bail cit\u00e9e plus haut dit que c'est alors, c'est-\u00e0-dire apr\u00e8s l'accomplissement de ces deux conditions, que Mme. Falardeau entrera en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'immeuble en question.\nPour que Mme. Falardeau serait devenue propri\u00e9taire, il fallait d\u00e9montrer d'abord qu'elle avait pay\u00e9 les $200, et en second lieu que l\u2019acte de transmission par la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9.\nAs put by Mr. Justice Lavergne:\nMadame Falardeau pouvait devenir propri\u00e9taire en vertu du bail et de ces conditions apr\u00e8s avoir pay\u00e9 la somme de $200; secondement, par la passation d'un titre apr\u00e8s l'ex\u00e9cution de ces deux premi\u00e8res conditions; il est dit dans le bail: \"c'est alors que Madame Falardeau entrera en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'immeuble.\" Il n'y a jamais eu de titre donn\u00e9 par la Cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Madame Falardeau.\nWhen she should have paid the $200, Mme. Falardeau would become entitled to a transfer of the city's title: when that transfer should have been made (alors; thereupon) she would enter into full proprietorship. That, in my opinion, is the intent and effect of the provision invoked by the city: The making of the transfer was a condition precedent to the passing of the property. Stevenson v. Rollit[11]; Hogan v. City of Montreal[12].\nA promise of sale with delivery and possession has not the effect of conveying the right of property to the promisee, when it appears from the terms of the contract that such was not the intention of the parties, but that on the contrary they meant to effect this result by a subsequent act. Renaud v. Arcand[13]. The question is one of intention. Grange v. McLennan[14].\nThe evidence establishes that, since 1896, a dispute had been pending between the Falardeaus and the city as to a right of way or passage forming part of or adjoining the leased premises. The landlord had closed up this passage. The Falardeaus deemed it essential to the full enjoyment of the property. They claimed that it was in fact appurtenant to the leasehold and insisted on being given a title to it. The city contested this claim and refused to give a deed including the passage. The Falardeaus declined to take a deed without it. Matters were allowed to rest in that position. As David Falardeau put it in giving his testimony:\nPar La Cour:\nQ. Vous ne l'avez pas encore eu?\nR. Je ne l'ai pas encore eu, le titre, seulement ils ne nous ont pas d\u00e9rang\u00e9s dans la possession de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, on a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 en possession de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9.\nPar M. Larue, procureur du demandeur:\nQ. N'est-il pas vrai que vous avez demand\u00e9 vos titres \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 plusieurs reprises et que la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec a refus\u00e9, qu'elle n'a pas voulu en donner?\nR. Non pas qu'elle refuse de nous en donner, mais seulement ils m'ont offert un titre que je ne trouvais pas acceptable.\nPar M. Chapleau, procureur de la d\u00e9fenderesse.\nQ. A cause du passage.\nR. A cause du passage, je voulais faire clairer le passage et puis, ils n'ont pas * * *\nPar M. Larue, procureur du demandeur:\nQ. Tant que vous n'aviez pas de passage pour sortir, il \u00e9tait inutile pour vous d'avoir un titre.\nR. Je ne pouvais pas continuer mon commerce l\u00e0, \u00e7a ruinait mon commerce, \u00e7a nous a ruin\u00e9s completement. Ils ont offert un titre mais il n'\u00e9tait pas acceptable pour nous.\nThe appellant urges two grounds in support of its contention that, notwithstanding that no deed had ever been delivered to Mme. Falardeau, she became the emphyteutic tenant under the Lampson leases and that it (the city) was thus relieved from the obligations incurred when it purchased at the sale for taxes. It relies on some payments on account of the emphyteutic rent made by Falardeau after August, 1896, and other alleged acts and admissions of her status as emphyteutic tenant: and it invokes article 1478 C.C.\nAs found by the learned trial judge, Mme. Falardeau did pay $100 on account of the rent due Lampson subsequent to August, 1896. The city had paid $60. A balance of about $690 remains unpaid. I find nothing in what Mme. Falardeau has done inconsistent with the tacit renewal of her lease from the city (art. 1609 C.C.) pending the adjustment of the question as to the lane or passage. While holding under that lease she would be bound to comply with its terms. They required her to pay the emphyteutic rent and to keep the premises in repair, etc. Her conduct and that of her husband is explicable on the assumption that, while Mme. Falardeau actually continued to hold under the lease from the city, they fully expected that she would eventually become proprietor of the emphyteusis. It does not import an election to forego their objection to the title offered by the city. As put by the learned Chief Justice of the Superior Court:\nTous ces faits cependant ne sauraient constituer, en faveur de la cit\u00e9, une fin de non-recevoir.\nOn the other hand, their persistent refusal to accept a transfer unless it included the passage is inconsistent with the Falardeaus having intended that the emphyteusis should actually vest in Mme. Falardeau without the formality of a deed. Taking all the circumstances into account they do not justify a finding that she waived the giving of the deed by the city and that all parties tacitly consented to treat the promise of sale contained in the lease as having been carried out.\nThere appear to be two formidable obstacles to the application to this case of art. 1478 C.C. In the first place, the promise itself is unilateral. The document contains no agreement by Mme. Falardeau to purchase. The city was, no doubt, bound to sell and convey to her on payment of the sum of $200, but there was no corresponding obligation on her part to take or acquire the emphyteusis. Neither was there any delivery or any taking of possession under the promise of sale such as might import an agreement on Mme. Falardeau's part to become the owner of the property. In delivering the judgment of the majority of the Court of King's Bench in Thomas v. Aylen[15], Badgley, J., says:\u2014\nIt is also urged that by art. 1478 C.C. la promesse de vente avec tradition et possession actuelle \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 vente; * * * Now the article at the utmost is only a general expletive of promesse with both tradition and possession combined, but as a rule of law allowing it that effect, it could not annul the covenants and conditional stipulations of the parties themselves, which are exceptions to the maxim and qualify the rule, leaving the conditional sale such as it is stipulated, according to the covenants of the parties, in conformity with the stringency of another legal rule paramount to that of the article, that modus et conventio vincunt legem * * * It must be observed that the expressions tradition et possession actuelle, constituents required to make up the equivalent of sale of the article, are not the legal synonyms of each other. Tradition is the known legal complement and satisfaction of a sale, \"la tradition est la transmission du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, c'est transf\u00e9rer sa possession dans l'intention de nous en faire avoir la propri\u00e9t\u00e9,\" and it is also expressed in different terms in the 1492 art: 'C'est la translation de la chose vendue en la jouissance et possession de l'acheteur,\" whilst, on the other hand, possession even though actuelle, is the mere occupancy of the immeuble vendu, the simply permitted use of the land.\nThe only \"tradition\" or delivery of the premises by the city was made under its lease to Mme. Falardeau as its tenant. It had no relation to the conditional promise of sale. Her continued possession after the term of two years had elapsed may well be attributed to a tacit renewal of it pending the settlement of the dispute as to a question of title. This dispute still remains unsettled at the expiry of the emphyteusis in 1913. If, therefore, article 1478 has any application to a promise of sale unilateral and subject to a condition to give title upon payment of the price (Keegan v. Raymond et al.[16]; Levy v. Connolly[17]; Richer v. Rochon[18]), such as that with which we are now dealing there never was the delivery or \"tradition\" under it requisite to enable the city to invoke that article. I also incline to think that the possession of Mme. Falardeau, because consistent with a tacit renewal of the lease from the city and therefore not necessarily ascribable to the promise of sale, was not of the character required by the article. But possession without \"tradition\" would not suffice.\nI would, for these reasons, affirm the judgment of the Court of King's Bench and dismiss this appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Chapleau & Morin.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

Scown (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe Herald Publishing Company (Defendants) Respondents\n1918: February 28; 1918: March 5.\nPresent:\u2014Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA.\nLibel\u2014Newspaper\u2014Proprietor and publisher\u2014Address of publication\u2014Libel and Slander Act, 4 Geo. V. (2 sess.) c. 12, s. 15. In an action claiming damages for a libel published in a newspaper the Alberta Libel and Slander Act by sec. 15 requires for certain purposes of defence that \"the name of the proprietor and publisher and address of publication\" shall be stated at the head of the editorials or on the front page of the paper. The Calgary Herald publishes at the head of the editorials: \"The Herald * * * Published at Calgary, Canada, by The Herald Publishing Co.\" The Herald Publishing Co. is both proprietor and publisher of the newspaper, and in an action against it for libel\u2014\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that the requirements of sec. 15 were substantially complied with. Judgment of the Appellate Division (38 D.L.R. 43) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe only question raised on this appeal is whether or not the statement in the Herald that it was \"Published at Calgary, Canada, by The Herald Publishing Co.\" was a compliance with the requirements of sec. 15 of the \"Libel and Slander Act\" that \"the name of the proprietor and publisher and address of publication\" shall be stated. The appellant contends that the fact of the company being both proprietor and publisher should appear and that the address of publication should be more specific. The trial judge agreed with this but was reversed on appeal.\nGeo. H. Ross K.C. and Barron for the appellant, referred to Skryha v. Telegram Printing Co.[2], and Ashdown v. Manitoba Free Press Co.[3].\nA. H. Clarke K.C. for respondents cited the above cases and Knott v. Telegram Printing Co.[4].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014Plaintiff (appellant) recovered $300 damages for libel. It is agreed that the only question on this appeal is whether the respondent company can claim the protection which is given by the \"Libel and Slander Act\" (Alta. 1913, ch. 12, 2nd Session) in view of the provision of section 15, subsection 1, which is as follows:\u2014\nNo defendant shall be entitled to the benefit of sections 7 and 13 of this Act, unless the name of the proprietor and publisher and address of publication is stated either at the head of the editorials or on the front page of the newspaper.\nIt is admitted and agreed that the only words published at the head of the editorials or on the front page of the newspaper in question approaching the requirements of the said section 15 were as follows:\u2014\nTHE HERALD.\nEstablished 1883, Evening and Weekly. Published at Calgary, Canada, by The Herald Publishing Co. Limited.\nMr. Justice Ives, the trial judge, concluded that section 15 was not complied with, as the name of the proprietor was not stated.\nThe majority of the appeal court (Stuart J. dissenting) reversed the judgment on the ground that \"the stating the name of the publisher as is done in this case is stating the name of the proprietor as well.\" I would dismiss the appeal because, I agree with Mr. Justice Anglin where he says that\nthe spirit of the section (15) was substantially complied with by the respondent.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The question raised herein is whether the 15th section of the Alberta \"Libel and Slander Act\" was complied with by the respondent in publishing at the head of the editorials or on the front page of a newspaper by printing therein the following:\u2014\nTHE HERALD.\nEstablished 1883. Evening and Weekly. Published at Calgary, Canada, by The Herald Publishing Co. Limited.\nIf that was not a compliance with said section the appeal herein should be allowed and the judgment for the plaintiff at the trial restored.\nSaid section 15 is as follows:\u2014\n15. No defendant shall be entitled to the benefit of sections 7 and 13 of this Act unless the name of the proprietor and publisher and address of publication is stated either at the head of the editorials or on the front page of the newspaper.\nIt so happens that in this instance the proprietor and publisher are identical, but quite clearly the proprietor may be and sometimes is an entirely different party from the publisher.\nSuch a thing has been known as the publisher being a man of straw used by a proprietor of substance as a tool for disseminating libels.\nI think that possibly was within the range of vision of the draftsman of this Act which was designed to protect respectable newspaper proprietors and publishers and at the same time facilitate the enforcing of the legal remedies open to any one suffering at the hands of either such.\nThe clear intention was that every issue should contain the necessary information to enable any one so wronged to reach promptly and effectively the wrongdoer, whether proprietor or publisher.\nThat intention might be frustrated by the courts holding, as the court below has, that only the name of the publisher need be printed as directed.\nAnd the mere accident that in this case the publisher happens to be also proprietor, does not meet the requirement of the statute.\nIt obviously was intended to furnish full information at a glance to be read by all concerned without being under the necessity of going to the expense of instituting legal proceedings to obtain it.\nThe proprietor might be liable in damages as a publisher for printing and giving to his ostensible publisher copies of the publication, or might be liable to be enjoined from continuing to print any defamatory matter regarding some person whom he desired to attack in that way.\nThis legislation to ameliorate the conditions of the public press imposes a very simple price as preliminary to enjoyment thereof.\nIt is idle to point to the use of the singular number of the word name as indicative of any legislative purpose to enable a purchaser thereby to fulfil the requirements of the statute; for the same sort of reasoning would justify the publication of only one name out of many proprietors or publishers. My opinion is that the respondent failed to comply with the law. I am also far from thinking that \"the address of the publication\" required, is satisfied by the words, \"Calgary, Canada.\"\nIt might have been quite sufficient in 1883.\nIt is not only the well-known and highly respectable newspaper, such as I assume that in question herein to be, that we must keep in view, but also the possibly obscure and disreputable publication that may emanate in a large city from some place almost, if not altogether, unknown and difficult to discover, that has to be considered in determining the true construction to be put upon an Act of this kind.\nThis substitute for registration required by legislation elsewhere, if lived up to, will, I suspect, be well worth while making it so full and clear that no complaint is likely to arise.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment entered by Mr. Justice Ives be restored.\nANGLIN J.\u2014It is conceded that if the defendant has complied with section 15 of the \"Libel and Slander Act\" of Alberta (ch. 12, of 1913, 2nd session) this action has been rightly dismissed by the Appellate Division for non-compliance by the plaintiff with section 7 of the same statute.\nSection 15 is as follows:\u2014\n15. No defendant shall be entitled to the benefit of sections 7 and 13 of this Act unless the name of the proprietor and publisher and address of publication is stated either at the head of the editorials or on the front page of the newspaper.\nAt the head of the editorials in the defendant's newspaper there was printed:\u2014\nThe Herald. Established in 1883. Evening and Weekly. Published at Calgary, Canada, by The Herald Publishing Company, Limited.\nIt is common ground that The Herald Publishing Company is both publisher and proprietor of the Herald.\nThe appellant objects that \"the address of publication\" is not given with sufficient particularity, and that the fact that The Herald Publishing Company is the proprietor of the newspaper as well as its publisher is not stated.\nThe address as given would be sufficient for post office purposes and it supplies the information necessary to enable any person affected to comply with section 7 of the statute. I agree with the majority of the learned judges of the Appellate Division that the objection to it should not prevail\nIt would almost seem from the use in section 15 of the word \"name\" in the singular and the non-repetition of the preposition and article \"of the\" that the legislature did not contemplate or provide for the case where the publisher and the proprietor of a newspaper should be other than the same person or body. The fact that only one address\u2014that of publication\u2014is required to be given tends to strengthen this view. Yet the proper construction may be \"the name (or names) of the proprietor and publisher,\" or reddendo singula singulis, \"the name of the proprietor and (the name of the) publisher,\" and when, as may happen,\" the proprietor and the publisher are different persons or bodies the spirit of section 15 would not be satisfied or its purposes accomplished unless both names were stated.\nIt is contended for the respondent that, read literally, the statute prescribes merely the printing, in either of the two designated places, of \"the name\" of the publisher and proprietor. But that interpretation would seem to ignore the significance of the use of the word \"stated\" which implies more than the mere printing of the name. Moreover, while the printing of the name in prominent characters at the head of the editorials might, without more, afford some indication that it is that of the publisher and the proprietor of the newspaper, the mere printing of it in some inconspicuous part of the front page, as the statute permits, would not convey that information. I agree with Harvey C.J. that the spirit of section 15 would not be satisfied were the information that the name printed is that of the proprietor and publisher not furnished\u2014at least substantially. It should not be overlooked, however, that it is by implication from the use of the word \"stated\" rather than because the statute explicitly so directs that we reach the view that this is its proper interpretation. Where, as here, the same person or body is both the proprietor and publisher, the spirit of the section, to which, in the absence of explicit direction, effect should be given, is, in my opinion, substantially and sufficiently complied with and its purpose is attained by the printing in either of the designated places of the statement that the newspaper is published by that person or body.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 38 D.L.R. 43.\n[2] 20 D.L.R. 692; 7 West W.R. 167.\n[3] 20 Can.

M., a member of the firm of \"J. J. M.\" real estate brokers, was one of two trustees appointed by order of court to sell certain lands in Vancouver with liberty to employ \"J. J. M.\" as agents. S. carried on real estate transactions through this firm or its other member and had given W. M. a power of attorney to buy and sell land for him in and around Vancouver. The other member of the firm of \"J. J. M.\" purchased some land for S. from the trustees and an agreement for sale was signed by the latter as vendors and by W.M. as attorney for S. The purchase price was paid with money of S. in his agent's hands. The agreement was not sent to S. until five years after it was signed and he at once repudiated it and brought action for rescission.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal (37 D.L.R. 514), that as the evidence did not shew that S. was aware, until he received the agreement, that his attorney W. M. was one of the vendors, and as he acted promptly as soon as the fact came to his knowledge he was entitled to rescission of the agreement and repayment of the purchase price.\nThe defendants were sued personally and not as trustees.\nHeld, per Fitzpatrick C.J. and Anglin J., that as they purported to sell to S. as beneficial owners the proper parties are before the Court. No application to amend has been made but as a matter of grace if they now elect to amend judgment can be entered against them in both capacities.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], by an equal division of opinion upholding the judgment at the trial in favour of the defendants. The facts of the case are fully stated in the above head-note.\nA. L. P. Hunter for the appellant. The rule is well settled that an agent to buy cannot buy from himself. Harrison v. Harrison[2]. And the extent of the agent's interest and fair nature of the transaction are immaterial, Bank of Upper Canada v. Bradshaw[3]; Cavendish-Bentinck v. Fenn[4].\nIt was for the defendants to prove that Stahl was aware of the position of his agent or ratified the purchase. De Bussche v. Alt[5].\nCassidy K.C., for the respondents. The nondisclosure of Miller's interest as trustee would not avoid the sale. Guy v. Churchill[6]. And he had no beneficial interest in the property. See Great Western Insurance Company v. Cunliffe [7]; Norreys v. Hodgson[8].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The appellant carried on speculations in real estate in Vancouver through the firm of J. J. Miller, real estate brokers in that city, and the respondent, William Miller, was a partner in the firm. On the 13th March, 1907, the appellant gave the respondent, William Miller, a power of attorney\nto execute for him all documents, agreements for sale and deeds of land in connection with the purchase or sale of lands in Vancouver and absolute authority to do all acts, deeds, matters and things necessary to be done in and about the premises.\nBy an order of the court of British Columbia, made on the 13th September, 1910, certain lands of one Christina Kildall, deceased, were vested in the respondents, W. Miller and Kildall, upon trust for sale and to stand possessed of the proceeds upon the trusts therein mentioned\nwith liberty to the trustees to employ the firm of J. J. Miller & Company as agents for the subdivision and sale of the said lands at a commission, etc,\nand it was further ordered\nthat the trustees receive by way of remuneration as trustees, etc.\nJ. J. Miller, who or whose firm were agents for the appellant, on the 10th December, 1910, purchased of the lands of the deceased Christina Kildall six lots for the appellant; and the respondent William Miller signed the agreement as one of the vendors and also acting under his power of attorney signed the name of the appellant as purchaser.\nThe appellant had no knowledge of the transaction until after it was completed and, as J. J. Miller retained the documents in his possession, the appellant was not informed of all the facts until he obtained the agreements on the 23rd October, 1915. On the 15th November, 1915, he wrote to the respondents giving notice to rescind the contracts for sale.\nOn the trial Macdonald J. gave judgment for defendants apparently on the ground that they were only trustees and the Kildall estate was not before the court.\nOn appeal, Macdonald C.J.A. thought that lapse of time and also the fact that the transaction was a fair one was a sufficient defence. Neither of these grounds can prevail here. Hitchcock v. Sykes[9].\nIt is also argued that although the respondents are the registered owners of the property they are not in reality the beneficial owners and therefore there is no conflict of duty by reason of the fiduciary relationship in which William Miller stood. But William Miller by the order of the court had absolute power to sell, and he had authority to buy under his power of attorney from the appellant. For his services as trustee, W. M. Miller was entitled to a commission on the sale and in addition he received his share of commission paid the firm of J. J. Miller, who were the selling agents for the respondents. A trustee for sale is no more competent to purchase the trust property as agent for a stranger to the trust than he is to buy it for himself.\nAs I am of opinion that this case cannot be distinguished from the numerous cases in which it has been clearly established that an agent cannot act for both vendor and purchaser, the appeal should be allowed.\nReference may be made to the case of Clark v. Hepworth,[10] recently before this court, and to Armstrong v. Jackson[11].\nI entirely concur in the disposition made by Mr. Justice Anglin of the objection that the proper parties are not before the court.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondents, being registered owners of the lands in question which had been subdivided into small lots, entered into three written agreements purporting to be for the respective sales of some six in all of said lots to the appellant for prices therein named.\nThe respondents for themselves each executed these agreements and Miller did likewise on behalf of appellant by virtue of a power of attorney he held from the appellant. This was done without consultation with appellant and without disclosure to him of the position they occupied as trustees for the sale of the said subdivision.\nThe respondent Miller was a member of a firm sometimes designated \"J. J. Miller\" and at other times as \"J. J. Miller & Company,\" carrying on business as real estate agents in Vancouver.\nThe appellant was a farmer in British Columbia, resident some fifty odd miles from Vancouver, who had some years previously paid the firm fifteen hundred dollars to invest.\nIt was stated by counsel for appellant, and not denied, that on several occasions prior to this transaction parts of that money or other moneys coming into the hands of said firm as agents of the appellant had been used in making real estate purchases for him, but in each case only after having submitted to him the proposal so involved.\nIn this instance now in question that prudent and proper course was departed from in the way already stated without any excuse so far as I can see unless presuming upon the confidence they had acquired by reason of the said prior dealings.\nThe appellant was first informed of these transactions in an incidental sort of fashion by letter some months afterwards.\nHe does not seem to have been for some years fully informed of what really did take place, and then, on discovery of the nature of the transactions thus entered into, sought to be relieved therefrom and went so far as to propose to sacrifice what had been paid and give a quit claim of any interest he might be supposed to have acquired. The respondents declined this offer. It was not until he sought and got the assistance of a solicitor that he discovered the use which, as stated above, had been made of his power of attorney.\nThe respondents, it turned out, were trustees for the family of the respondent Kildall. As such they were entitled to a commission, and beyond that the J. J. Miller firm were entitled to a further commission as real estate agents effecting such sales, as made, of the lots in question. Of this latter commission the respondent Miller was entitled to receive and did receive one half.\nThe alleged sales are now attacked herein and rescission sought by appellant on the ground that the relations of the respondent Miller to him, and the duties owing thereunder, were such as to render it impossible in law for him as vendor to bind appellant without full disclosure of his actual position and interest in promoting such sales and then thereupon procuring the actual assent of appellant thereto.\nIt seems too clear for argument that a sale made under such circumstances was void and could only be upheld by something in the nature of ratification. These sales have been upheld by the learned trial judge and the equal division of the Court of Appeal.\nThe learned trial judge seemed to recognize the principles of law governing such a transaction, but to feel unable to give relief because the respondents were in fact trustees appointed by the court and had not been attacked as such, and that respondent Kildall owed no duty to the appellant.\nI cannot assent to either of these propositions. In the first place, I think and most respectfully submit that the sooner the court which had control of such a trustee called upon him to explain and if possible excuse such an apparently loose mode of discharging his duties as its appointee, the better.\nThe appearance of the documents should have indicated to him that his co-trustee was, as attorney for the alleged vendee, venturing on a something that called for explanation. He should not have been a party thereto unless and until it was made quite clear that the proposed vendee in truth understood and approved of his attorney's action in buying.\nThe reasons assigned by the Court of Appeal for dismissing the appeal are of a different and more arguable nature. With great respect, however, I am unable to adopt them.\nI do not think the appellant was called upon to give his evidence or explanation until something much more direct and cogent had been given than appears in the evidence of Mr. J. J. Miller.\nThe respondent Miller had, apart altogether from his monetary interest, placed himself in the position of attempting to discharge two inconsistent duties. One he owed to his cestuis que trustent and the other to the appellant.\nHis relation to the former also as a partner of the firm which had been given the duty of selling the lands in question has been made the basis for a number of ingenious submissions which are untenable, however plausible.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the alleged agreements of purchase rescinded and the moneys paid by appellant or received by respondents on account of the transactions in question be repaid with interest.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The respondents, as trustees for the sale of the Kildall estate, sold the property in question to the appellant. In the agreement of sale, however, they assumed the position of vendors in their personal capacity.\nOn their own statement, one of them, William Miller, was a partner in the firm of \"J. J. Miller,\" carrying on business as real estate agents at Vancouver, B.C. John J. Miller, the other partner in the firm, was the agent for the sale of the property. He was at the same time the agent of the appellant, who resided at Whonnock, B.C., to invest moneys deposited by the latter with the firm of \"J. J. Miller\" in desirable real estate, and, as such, he bought from the respondent trustees the property in question for the appellant. William Miller, the other member of the firm, and one of the trustees for sale, as attorney for the appellant, executed on his behalf the agreement to purchase.\nUpon the mere statement of these facts the conflict of duty on the part of John J. Miller is so apparent that it is obvious that the transaction must be voidable by the appellant unless he was aware of the agency of John J. Miller for the vendors when the contract was made or subsequently learned of it and with such knowledge ratified or acquiesced in what had been done. If the facts that the trustees for sale were to be remunerated by a 3% commission and the sale's agent by a 7% commission are taken into account, the element of interest in conflict with duty is superadded.\nThe learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal thus summarizes the evidence as to knowledge and acquiescence on the part of the appellant\u2014quite fairly, if I may say so:\nJ. J. Miller, while not quite positive, says that shortly after the making of the agreement in question, and therefore about five years prior to the bringing of this action, he told the appellant that it was the Kildall estate and not the defendants who were the real vendors of the property. He also adverts to certain advertisements which he says appellant must have seen and which he thinks disclosed the fact that J. J. Miller was the selling agent of the Kildall estate;\nand on this evidence the learned Chief Justice assumes knowledge and finds ratification by the appellant apparently because he \"did not think fit to give evidence * * * to rebut the evidence of J. J. Miller.\"\nWith great respect, the suggestion of an interested witness that \"the appellant must have seen\" certain advertisements, and that he \"thinks\" these advertisements \"disclosed the fact that J. J. Miller was the selling agent\" cannot be accepted as satisfying the burden of proof which lay on the respondents, rescission being sought, to establish that the dual position of their agent, J. J. Miller, and the conflict between his duty to them and his duty to the appellant and between his interest and the latter duty became known to the appellant, and that he either expressly or by implication elected to uphold the transaction. Cavendish-Bentinck v. Fenn[12], at page 666; De Busche v. Alt[13], at page 313. The respondent did not make a prim\u00e2 facie case of the knowledge essential to ratification or acquiescence such that the appellant was called upon to displace it. On the contrary, there is really nothing whatever to shew that he knew anything of J. J. Miller's agency for the vendors until he saw the sale agreement some five years after it had been made; and he then promptly repudiated liability and sued for rescission within a reasonable time afterwards. Indeed, there is very little to indicate that he was aware at any earlier date that. William Miller, his own attorney, was also one of his vendors. As put by the learned trial judge: There is no evidence before me to shew that the plaintiff knew that the purchase made on his behalf had been in the manner indicated. When it was brought to his attention by the agreement being produced he then took the position by letter, signed by himself, but probably prepared by his solicitor, that he intended to set aside the transaction on the grounds that are now urged.\nI am, with respect, of the opinion, that the appellant's right to avoid the transaction, regardless of whether it was fair or unfair, advantageous or otherwise at the time it was entered into, is beyond question.\nObjection is taken, however, to the constitution of the action in that the defendants are sued in their personal capacity, whereas they sold, in fact, as trustees for the Kildall estate. In the agreement for sale the vendors are not described as trustees. By it they purport to sell as beneficial owners and to assume the obligation of vendors in their personal capacity. They would, therefore, appear to have no good ground for contending that the necessary parties are not before the court. If for any reason they thought it desirable either in their own interest or in that of the Kildall estate to have that estate represented in this action by themselves in their capacity of trustees, it was their privilege, at any time before trial, to apply for the requisite amendment. Not having done so they should not be heard now to set up as a matter of right that it should have been made. But, as a matter of grace and indulgence, if they desire it, since it will entail no delay, expense or inconvenience to the plaintiff, I would be disposed to allow such an amendment to be made now. Judgment should be entered for the appellant as prayed in the statement of claim against the respondents in their personal capacity; and, if they elect to amend, also in their capacity as trustees.\nThe appellant is entitled to his costs of the litigation throughout. BRODEUR J.\u2014Stahl had given a power of attorney to William Miller and to the firm J. J. Miller, of which William Miller was a member. He had left some money in the hands of the firm J. J. Miller for investment.\nIt happened that the Kildall estate, of which William Miller was one of the trustees, had some property for sale, and an agreement for sale of some lots was then signed by the trustees of the Kildall estate of which William Miller was one, in favour of Stahl, and the agreement was then signed by William Miller as agent for Stahl. The result is that Miller appeared in the same acts as one of the vendors and as agent of the purchaser.\nThe price which was paid was given by the Miller firm out of the moneys belonging to Stahl. The taxes were paid in the same way and Stahl was never told that his agent had been, at the same time, his vendors.\nSome years after, when he discovered this illegal transaction, he repudiated it and took proceedings in rescission.\nIt is a settled rule that an agent authorized to buy cannot buy from himself and that if he does so without disclosing the fact to his principal the latter may repudiate the transaction. Harrison v. Harrison[14]; Gillett v. Peppercorne[15].\nThe fairness of the transaction is immaterial; and the agent might be acting with the best of good faith; but it does not make any difference, because an agent will never be allowed to place himself in a situation in which, under ordinary circumstances, he would be tempted to do that which is not the best for his principal. Bank of Upper Canada v. Bradshaw[16].\nBesides, in this case, it is proved that the Miller firm which sold the lots for the Kildall estate was having a commission on those sales, and then William Miller, who was a member of that firm, who had a share in that commission, was naturally interested in disposing of those lots in favour of Stahl, which he had no right to do, being the agent of Stahl.\nStahl should, therefore, succeed in setting aside the agreement for sale and the judgment a quo should be reversed with costs of this court and of the courts below.\nAppeal allowed with costs\nSolicitor for the appellant: A.

The circumstances of the case and the questions of law in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nAim\u00e9 Geoffrion K.C. and A. R. Holden K.C. for the appellant.\nG. F. Gibsone K.C., Errol Languedoc K.C. and Eug. Angers, for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The appellants' steamship \"Empress of Ireland\" was sunk with great loss of life in a collision with the \"S.S. Storstad,\" a foreign ship, in the St. Lawrence River off Father Point on the 29th May, 1914. The \"Storstad\" proceeded to Montreal where she was arrested in a suit for damages brought by the appellant in the Exchequer Court, Quebec Admiralty District. She was subsequently sold by order of the court and the proceeds $175,000 paid into court to take the place of the ship and to avail for all parties interested therein.\nJudgment in the suit was pronounced in favour of the plaintiff's claim and a reference directed to the deputy registrar to report the amount due. A large number of intervenants and claimants came in and established their claims and the deputy registrar made his report admitting claims to the total amount of $3,069,483.94 of which $469,467.51 were for loss of life and the balance for loss of property including over $2,000,000 claimed by the appellant as the value of its ship, the \"Empress of Ireland.\" The fund in court being insufficient to satisfy all claims, the deputy registrar collocated the amount pro rat\u00e2 in favour of the life claims so far as the same was sufficient and excluded all other claims from participation in the collocation.\nOn motion by the appellant to vary the report and seeking to be collocated for its claim as admitted, judgment was given confirming the report; from this judgment the present appeal is brought.\nThe liability to any of the claimants found entitled by the Registrar's report is not contested. We have not therefore to consider the effect of the decision in Seward v. \"Vera Cruz\"[2]. The question for determination turns, I think, upon the construction to be put upon sec. 503 of the Imperial statute \"The Merchant Shipping Act\" (1894). That Act, so far as material parts are concerned, is expressly extended to the whole of His Majesty's Dominions. A statute of the Imperial Parliament, so declared to extend to all His Majesty's Dominions, is binding on all courts in Canada, those of Admiralty no less than the civil courts. It is upon this statute that the Local Judge in Admiralty has rested his judgment.\nPart VIII of the \"Imperial Merchant Shipping Act,\" 1894, is under the caption \"Liability of Shipowners\" and comprises secs. 502 to 509 inclusive. Sec. 503, so far as material, is as follows:\u2014\n503. (I) The owners of a ship, British or foreign, shall not, where all or any of the following occurrences take place without their actual fault or privity; (that is to say)\n(a) Where any loss of life or personal injury is caused to any person being carried in the ship;\n(b) Where any damage or loss is caused to any goods, merchandise, or other things whatsoever on board the ship;\n(c) Where any loss of life or personal injury is caused to any person carried in any other vessel by reason of the improper navigation of the ship;\n(d) where any loss or damage is caused to any other vessel or to any goods, merchandise, or other things whatsoever on board any other vessel, by reason of the improper navigation of the ship;\nbe liable to damages beyond the following amounts; (that is to say.).\n(i) In respect of loss of life or personal injury, either alone or together with loss of or damage to vessels, goods, merchandise, or other things, an aggregate amount not exceeding fifteen pounds for each ton of their ship's tonnage; and (ii) In respect of loss of, or damage to, vessels, goods, merchandise, or other things, whether there be in addition loss of life or personal injury or not, an aggregate amount not exceeding eight pounds for each ton of their ship's tonnage.\nThe tonnage of the \"Storstad\" is 6,028 tons and the amount realized by her sale and forming the fund now in court is less than \u00a37 for each ton of such tonnage.\nIt is contended by the appellant:\u2014\n(1) That inasmuch as no limitation of liability has been obtained or sought for by the owners of the ship, the section has no application and that in the distribution of the fund all claims should be paid ratably.\n(2) That in any event the section does not give any right to preferential payment.\nIn an action in rem there can be no liability beyond the value of the res. Prior to 1862 the ascertaining of the value of the ship was a fruitful source of litigation and expense.\nTo obviate this and also in order that bad and inferior ships should not have an advantage, in case of collision, over good and valuable ships, 25 & 26 Vict. ch. 63 was passed. That Act struck a rough average value for all ships at \u00a315 or \u00a38 per ton, the valuation to be at the higher or lower rate according as the collision was accompanied by loss of life or personal injury or not. In 1894 it was repealed, but in substance re-enacted by 57 & 58 Vict. ch. 60, sec. 503. (Marsden on Collisions, 6th ed., pages 151-2.)\nThe \"Merchant Shipping Act\" is a complete code of the law relating to the subject and Part VIII. under the caption \"Liability of Shipowners,\" must have been intended to deal comprehensively with the subject. It is clear that in a very large number, probably a majority, of cases the value of the ship is, as in the present instance, less than the statutory amount. I do not think it can be maintained that the Act has its application only where the value is the \"rough average value\" fixed by the statute and not where it is the actual value of the ship. We should not, if it can be avoided, construe the Act as making a reservation in favour of the life claims in the case of the statutory value and none at all in the case of the actual value which may be little less or indeed equal to it since there can be no limit of liability unless the real value is greater than the statutory value.\nBut whilst I think the registrar was right in his report in holding that the distribution of the fund must be in accordance with sec. 503, I think that he has taken a mistaken view of the effect of the section as affecting the particular case. I do not think you can take the maximum amount given in the section when the actual amount is less; it is the proportion that must be observed, that is to say the amounts reserved for the life and other claims must respectively abate in the proportions which the actual fund bears to the amounts fixed by the statute. It is not seven-fifteenths of an amount equal to \u00a315 per ton to which the life claimants are entitled but seven-fifteenths of the fund of $175,000. This would be about $81,000 and leave some $93,000 against which the life claimants would be entitled to rank for the balance of their claims pari passu with the other claimants. This, of course, subject to the deduction of costs out of the fund.\nI confess that I have some difficulty in following the construction which the courts have placed upon sec. 503 as to the reservation in favour of the life claims. The case of \"The Victoria\"[3], decided in 1888 was, of course, upon the statute of 1862 then in force, but the provisions of this are for all practical purposes identical with those in the statute of 1894 and the construction then placed upon what is sec. 503 in the latter does not seem to have been ever questioned since that time. It must now be accepted as laying down the law correctly.\nI do not see the necessity of the cross-appeal. The order of the 26th September, 1916, against which this is brought simply extends the time for filing claims. It does not, and from the nature of the things cannot, be any adjudication on the claims which may be brought in. The cross-appellants in their factum say that \"the judgment decides two things: First, that (after providing for costs) the fund in court to be distributed exclusively among claims founded upon loss of life; secondly, that claims for loss of life filed up to the 10th October, 1916, are to be considered and apparently to be collocated.\" I can see no grounds for this supposition. It will be open to the cross-appellants on the further inquiry to raise the objection that any new claims are statute barred or for any other reason inadmissible. The cross-appeal should, I think, be dismissed with costs.\nThe judgment should be varied as above indicated and the whole matter remitted to the deputy registrar for further inquiry and report as directed by the judgment so varied.\nThe costs of all parties other than of the cross-appeal should be paid out of the fund in court.\nDavies J.\u2014I concur with my brother Anglin.\nI would vary the judgment below by directing that the sum for distribution be apportioned to a fund upon which claimants for loss of life or personal injuries should be entitled to rank exclusively for seven-fifteenths and to another fund upon which these claimants shall be entitled to rank for unsatisfied balances pro rat\u00e2 with claimants for loss of property. Costs of the appeal out of the fund. I would dismiss the cross-appeal with costs. Idington J. (dissenting).\u2014The learned judge below held that in the case of the bankrupt owner of the vessel in fault and the losses suffered thereby, exceeding her value, the classes of sufferers referred to in sec. 503 of the \"Imperial Merchants Shipping Act,\" 1894, or some of them, must be preferred over others in sharing the proceeds of her sale. Whether such holding can be maintained or not must depend upon the scope and purpose of part 8 of the said Act in which the section is found.\nAn ambiguous section often, indeed generally, has been made to respond to and subserve the obvious purview of the Act in which it is found.\nThe history of the enactment now in question does not enable that mode of treatment to be successfully applied herein. The \"Shipping Act\" of 1894, has been the growth of legislation extending over many years, and relates to so many subjects that it is impossible to gather much help from it as a whole in order to be enabled to interpret and construe part 8 thereof, which is all that really is involved or has to be considered in the disposition of the question raised. The enactments contained therein represent the last feature of legislation of that kind applied to the hazardous employment of shipping. The original liability of shipowners for loss suffered by shippers through the misconduct and especially negligence on the part of servants of the shipowners in managing the thing given them in charge, is said to have been unlimited in England until the year 1734. See Marsden on Collisions, 5th ed. 148.\nThen 7 Geo. II. ch. 15, limited shipowners' liability for loss of cargo by theft of master or crew to the value of the ship.\n26 Geo. III., ch. 86, limited the loss from theft by strangers or by fire. Then 53 Geo. III, ch. 159, furnished the first limitations of liability in the case of collisions.\nThe substance of these enactments was incorporated into the \"Shipping Act\" of 1854. In 1862 many amendments were made to that Act by the enactment of 25 & 26 Vict., ch. 63, sec. 54, which in substance adopted the same terms as appear in sec. 503 of the \"Shipping Act\" of 1894, now in question. By the first section of the said amending Act it was enacted as follows:\u2014\nThis Act may be cited as the \"Merchants Shipping Amending Act,\" 1862, and shall be construed with and as part of the \"Merchants Shipping Act,\" 1854, hereinafter termed the \"Principal Act.\"\nWhen we have regard to this enactment and turn to the said \"Principal Act\" we find in sec. 514, thereof, the following:\u2014\n514. In cases where any liability has been or is alleged to have been incurred by any owner in respect of loss of life, personal injury, or loss of or damage to ships, boats or goods, and several claims are made or apprehended in respect of such liability, then, subject to the right hereinbefore given to the Board of Trade of recovering damages in the United Kingdom in respect of loss of life or personal injury, it shall be lawful in England or Ireland for the High Court of Chancery, and in Scotland for the Court of Session, and in any British possession for any competent court, to entertain proceedings at the suit of any owner for the purpose of determining the amount of such liability subject as aforesaid, and for the distribution of such amount ratably amongst the several claimants, with power for any such court to stop all actions and suits pending in any other court in relation to the same subject matter; and any proceeding entertained by such Court of Chancery or Court of Session, or other competent Court, may be conducted in such manner and subject to such regulations as to making any persons interested parties to the same, and as to the exclusion of any claimants who do not come in within a certain time, and as to requiring security from the owner, and as to payment of costs, as the court thinks just.\nIt was doubtless under this enactment that proceedings were taken in the many cases that arose under the said \"Shipping Act\" as amended by said sec. 54.\nTurning then to part 8 of the \"Shipping Act\" of 1894, we find sec. 504 providing in substance for that which was enacted in the clause just quoted. When we consider the frame of the Act of 1854, or of the said amending Act of 1862, we find each subject matter, as it were, which is dealt with legislatively, made to appear under a defining caption. Having regard to that system of defining the subject matter we need not concern ourselves much with the general purview of the Act as a whole. We should further confine ourselves to looking at the purview of the enactments appearing under each of these respective captions, unless, indeed, as in the case of the amendment by sec. 54 in the amending Act of 1862, we find it relates to cognate matters in the Principal Act, and then, of course, we should consider all such together. It is to be observed that there is nothing expressed in the Act of 1894 which lends the slightest colour to the claim of priority by any one over others in relation to damages which the ship as such was responsible for, and has been condemned to answer, much less to the proceeds of her sale resulting from the condemnation against her.\nThe same is true of each of the several enactments giving to shipowners a right to secure limitations of liability. It so happened, however, that the courts which had been entrusted with the power of giving effect to the relief provided by these several Acts of limitation, in administering these laws, on the application of the shipowners invoking protection, gave relief only upon payment into court of a sum or sums based on the application of the measurements specified in the Act, and priorities were thus created, indeed of necessity sprang from the course of judicial relief given in each of the classes of cases provided for.\nThat, however, is surely very far removed from the possibility of constituting the fund realized out of the sale of the vessel, in an action in rem, as this is, at the suit of another party like appellant, one which must be administered on the basis which the courts have adopted in an entirely different sort of proceeding.\nSec. 504, forming part of said part 8, expressly provides that upon such claims as in question in that part of the Act being taken or apprehended, then the owner may apply to a competent court and invoke the relief given him or it by the preceding section.\nThe enactment was substantially in principle the same as sec. 514 above quoted from the Act of 1854.\nThe numerous cases which had to be dealt with under the last mentioned section indicate that any preference or priority given to any claimant invoking said section, or the powers therein, was solely in furtherance of the privilege given to the shipowners and for the purpose of effectively working out the scheme of the limitation clause or clauses.\nSec. 504 of the Act of. 1894, with which we have to deal, I think has been treated in the same way as in acting upon it the like principles have been applied. This section alone seems to render this part of the Act operative and give the court power to determine the amount to be paid and administer the fund thereby created.\nUnless and until this part of the Act has thus been made effective and operative there can be no claim under it.\nThe case of \"The Victoria,\"[4] relied upon below, was one of the very many decisions passed upon questions raised under the amendment of 1862, and was simply the result of an application to the Court of Chancery under the sec. 514 above quoted. It decides nothing to support the present contention of priority in relation to the fund derived from the sale of the vessel in this action in rem. In not a single case so far as I can find has the construction of the amendment of 1862, or the part 8 of the Act of 1894, been otherwise brought into question or declared to have any effect.\nIndeed being a case of privilege given the owner only under certain circumstances, it seems impossible for the question otherwise to arise and when raised the issue must be tried as other questions upon pleadings and proof.\nFor aught we know the owners may have been privy to the wrong done which is in question here. That suggestion may appear remote when a case has been tried without one word of contention or evidence relevant thereto having been set up, but it is to be observed the case being in rem does not necessarily involve the privity of the owner or its individual responsibility.\nSuch being the conclusions which I have reached upon the construction of the Act relied on, it is needless to pursue the many other questions raised, for admittedly under the \"Canada Shipping Act\" there can be no claim to the priority alleged.\nThe appeal must be allowed with costs.\nAs to the cross-appeal by some claimants that others are barred by the limitations of the time within which those entitled in virtue of \"Lord Campbell's Act\" must bring action, it seems to be rather late now to raise such a question for the first time.\nThere is nothing in the judgment appealed from to indicate that such a contention was set up below.\nThe objection to the right of the judge to amend the order as to the original time fixed for bringing in claims, does not cover the ground.\nThe case of \"The Alma\"[5], cited in the factum is not in point. That is where owners had taken proceedings to establish a limitation under the sections I have already discussed and the question raised before the judge in charge of working out a reference thereunder, was whether or not he could let in claims which were not presented within the time limit originally fixed by the judgment giving relief.\nIt presented no case based on the Statute of Limitations or the clause of \"Lord Campbell's Act\" limiting the time.\nWhen those cross-appealing saw any claim competing with theirs presented before the referee they may have been entitled to raise the objection of the Statute of Limitations, or the corresponding limitation in \"Lord Campbell's Act,\" but failing to do so, or someone entitled to do so failing to object, I cannot think it can now be raised for the first time and the cross-appeal should therefore be dismissed with costs which would seem to be trifling if worth noticing in view of the factum.\nDuff J.\u2014I think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014Arrested and held liable at the suit of the owners of the \"Empress of Ireland,\" with which she had collided, the S.S. \"Storstad\" was sold under an order of the court made in the action by consent of all parties interested. The proceeds of the sale are in court. The respective rights in the distribution of them, on the one hand of persons entitled to maritime liens on the delinquent ship for damages for loss of life or personal injuries, and on the other of persons entitled to similar liens in respect of loss of or injury to property resulting from the collision, form the subject of this appeal. The priority of the claim of the plaintiff for its costs incurred in securing the arrest and condemnation of the offending ship is not contested, nor is her liability to any of the claimants found entitled by the registrar now disputed. Were it otherwise the status of claimants in respect of loss of life would call for very careful consideration in view of the decision in Seward v. Vera Cruz[6].\nThe money available, however, will answer but a fraction of the claims and falls far short of either the \u00a315 per ton fixed by sec. 503 of the \"English Merchant Shipping Act,\" 1894, or the $38.92 per ton fixed by the \"Canada Shipping Act\" (R.S.C., ch. 113, sec. 921), as the limit of the owner's liability.\nThe question at issue between the parties is whether all the recognized claimants are entitled to rank pari passu upon this fund, as it is conceded would be the case if the \"Canada Shipping Act\" should govern or if neither it nor the \"English Merchant Shipping Act\" should apply, or whether claimants in respect of loss of life or personal injuries are entitled to whatever preference sec. 503 of the latter Act provides for. There is also a question as to the extent of this preference.\nNeither the \"Storstad\" nor the \"Empress of Ireland\" was registered in Canada. The registry of the \"Storstad\" was Norwegian, that of the \"Empress of Ireland,\" British. Part 8 (secs. 502-509) of the \"Imperial Merchant Shipping Act,\" 1894 (57 & 58 Vict., ch. 60), is, by sec. 509, made applicable to the whole of His Majesty's Dominions; and, by sec. 735, the power of the legislature of any British possession to repeal wholly or in part any of its provisions is restricted to their application to ships registered in that possession, The \"Merchant Shipping Act\" of 1854 (17 & 18 Vict., ch. 104), contained similar provisions\u2014secs. 502 and 547. I have no doubt whatever that if this case falls within either of them, the liability of the defendant and the rights of the plaintiff and other claimants inter se must be determined by sec. 503 of the Imperial Act rather than by sec. 921 of the \"Canada Shipping Act,\" which is in pari materia.\nThe heading of part 8 of the Imperial Act is \"The Liability of Shipowners.\" It was presumably intended to be exhaustive. By sec. 503 (sec. 54 of the Act of 1862), it limits the liability of the shipowner to \u00a315 per ton of the delinquent ship's tonnage in respect of loss of life or personal injury either alone or together with loss of or damage to property, and to \u00a38 per ton in respect of loss of or damage to property whether it is or is not accompanied by loss of life or personal injury. No doubt\nthe ordinary mode of obtaining this limitation of liability is for the shipowner to pay the statutory amount into court in an action in which he asks a decree limiting his liability to that sum. (Carver's Carriage by Sea, 5th ed., page 36).\nBut, having regard to the history of the limitation of shipowners' liability in English law, I agree with the learned local Judge in Admiralty that it is not made dependent on such an action being taken.\nSec. 503 enacts in general terms a limitation upon the claimants' right of recovery. The only condition attached is that the loss shall have occurred \"without (the owner's) actual fault or privity.\" I cannot think that this term imports that the fact of absence of personal fault or privity must be established in a proceeding in which it is alleged by the owner as an actor. It must suffice if it appears and is found, as is the case here, in a suit in which the liability of the ship is determined\u2014or, it may be, if the contrary does not appear, since such privity or fault should not be presumed. As the learned local judge points out, sec. 504 is permissive. It enables the shipowner where it is his interest to do so, to protect himself against multiplicity of actions with the harassing consequence of burdensome costs, which are not within the limitation. It affords him \"the full benefit of having the whole case settled at once\" and enables him to obtain a speedy release of his vessel, which may be worth much more than a sum equal to \u00a315 or \u00a38 per ton of its tonnage, as the case may be.\nThe company that owned the \"Storstad,\" however, had no interest to invoke the protection afforded by sec. 504. She was, so far as appears, its sole asset, and, if not, she was, at all events, the only property owned by it subject to the process of the Canadian court. She was worth only \u00a35 10s. per ton of her tonnage as was proved by the result of the sale. The company therefore had nothing to gain by instituting proceedings under sec. 504; the claimants could not force it to do so; and they were not taken.\nSec. 503 is not merely an enactment for the shipowner's benefit limiting his liability. It contains a substantive provision for the advantage of claimants in respect of loss of life and personal injuries upon whom it confers valuable rights of priority. A construction which would make the existence and enforceability of those rights entirely dependent on the shipowner's seeking and obtaining a judgment under sec. 504 declaratory of the limitation of his liability and fixing the amount thereof would seem so utterly unreasonable and so contrary to what Parliament apparently intended should be the effect of the statute that, in my opinion, it should not prevail. Whether loss of life and personal injury claims are to have a limited preference over loss of property claims or are to rank pari passu with them on the entire fund available was not left to be determined by the action or the inaction of the shipowner whether prompted by interest or purely spontaneous.\nAn argument in support of the contrary view rests on the juxtaposition of secs. 503 and 504 in the Act of 1894. But in the Act of 1854 the section corresponding to sec. 503 of the statute of 1894 was sec. 504 and that corresponding to sec. 504 of 1894 was sec. 514. When sec. 54 of the Act of 1862 replaced sec. 504 of the Act of 1854, sec. 514 was left unaltered. Compare secs. 1 and 4 of 26 Geo. III., ch. 86; 53 Geo. III., ch. 159, sec. 1 and sec. 7; and see the speech of Lord Blackburn in the Stoomvaart Maatschappy Nederland v. The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Nav. Co.[7], at pages 814 et seq. There is no interdependence between the two provisions. Their juxtaposition in the Act of 1894 has not the significance suggested.\nSubject to the priority of the plaintiff for costs of the suit in which the offending ship was seized and its liability determined, the proceeds of the sale of it in court form part of the amount for which the owners are liable under the \"Merchant Shipping Act.\" Their liability to have their ship confiscated for the purpose of making good the damage inflicted is part of the personal liability which that statute has limited. Leycester v. Logan[8]. It follows that credit must be given upon the owner's statutory liability for any sums received by claimants out of the proceeds of the sale of the ship. If those proceeds should be distributed otherwise than in the proportions in which the full amount of the statutory liability, if paid into court by the owners, would be distributed, on the final disposition of the balance of the statutory liability, should it be realized, payments to the claimants would be so adjusted that they would be allowed thereout only such sums as would make the total amount to be received by each equal to what would have been his share in the full amount of the statutory liability had it been paid into court in the first instance. The \"Crathie\"[9]. The balance of the statutory liability of the owners of the \"Storstad\" certainly may not, and in all probability will not be realized. Were the court to distribute the money now available pro rat\u00e2 amongst all the claimants, as the plaintiff contends for, the policy of sec. 503 of the \"Merchant Shipping Act\" would be defeated. It would be equally disregarded were the entire proceeds of the sale of the ship devoted to a fund available exclusively to satisfy demands in respect of loss of life and personal injury. The statute does not give them any such priority. It provides for the concurrent establishment of two distinct funds in which it defines different rights.\nTo carry out the policy of the Act the proceeds of the sale of the ship in court must be treated as a realization pro tanto (as in fact they are) of the owners' statutory liability and distributed as such amongst the several claimants in the same proportions in which the full amount of that liability, if available, would have been distributed. The sum on hand for distribution will therefore be apportioned between the two funds\u2014to one of them seven-fifteenths of it, and to the other the remaining eight-fifteenths. According to the rule laid down in The \"Victoria\"[10], and subsequently acted on in The \"Alma\"[11], and The \"Inventor\"[12], the former fund will be distributed pari passu amongst recognized claimants in respect of loss of life and personal injury, and, in respect of any deficiency, these claimants will share pro rat\u00e2 on the latter fund with the approved claimants in respect of loss of life and injury to property.\nThe judgment in appeal should be varied accordingly.\nAn order of the local Judge in Admiralty extending the time for filing claims until the 10th October, 1916, has been made the subject of a cross-appeal on the assumption that it determined that all claims which should be filed before the date so fixed would be ipso facto eligible for collocation in the distribution. The order does not so provide. Any claims filed pursuant to it must be adjudicated upon by the referee and will be open to all defences to which they are subject. The cross-appeal was misconceived and unnecessary.\nAppeal allowed in part with costs of all parties out of fund.\nCross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Meredith, Holden, Hague, Shaughnessy & Heward.\nSolicitors for the respondents De Goss and others: Gibsone & Dobell.\nSolicitors for the respondents Fabri and others: Greenshields, Greenshields, Languedoc & Parkins.\nSolicitors for the respondents Bronken and others: Ross & Angers.\n[1] 16 Ex.

A. Mackay & Co. one hundred preferred shares of the Canadian Jewellers, Limited, at 95% of the par value with 50% of the par value in bonus common stock of the company. It was also stipulated that the underwriting could be pledged or hypothecated with any banking institution or trust company as security for advances. Prior to the date of this agreement J. A. Mackay & Co. had borrowed from the respondent $131,103.10 and hypothecated the appellant's underwriting as collateral security for the advances already made and for further advances.\nThe action was brought by the respondent against the appellant to enforce payment by him of the amount of the shares subscribed and was accompanied by a tender and deposit of certificates.\nThe principal defence set up by the appellant was that his signature was procured by misrepresentations made to him by J. A. Mackay as to the amount of preferred shares and common shares \"to be issued\" and as to the jewellery businesses to be acquired by the new company.\nJ. E. Martin K.C. and Thibaudeau Rinfret K.C. for the appellant.\nGeo. H. Montgomery K.C. and W. Chipman K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014The appellant agreed to take 100 shares of Canadian Jewellers, Limited, of the par value of $100 each at 95% of the par value with 50% of the par value in bonus common stock. The respondent sues in this action as assignee of the underwriting for $9,500 and interest.\nThe company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger of jewellery businesses on a large scale but the promoters were unable to carry out their intentions.\nThe form of subscription signed by the defendant had the following heading:\u2014 Canadian Jewellers, Limited.\nAuthorized Capital.\nTo be issued.\nPreferred shares, . . . . . . . . . . $2,500,000\n$1,500,000\nCommon shares, . . . . . . . . . . . 2,500,000\n1,500,000\nThe amount of stock actually issued was $600,000 preferred and $671,000 of common.\nHarry Timmis, the president of the company, who was the originator of it, says in his evidence:\u2014\nWe started out with the idea that we would make a very big company out of it, and that we would bring all the jewellery concerns that we could bring in on advantageous terms * * * The company unfortunately was not as strong as it should have been, because what I had originally planned had not been carried out.\nQ.\u2014With all those concerns which I have mentioned to you which were to come in you would have had $1,500,000 preferred and $1,500,000 common? A.\u2014 Quite so.\nIt must be admitted that the purchaser is entitled to get substantially at any rate what he has bargained for by his contract. In the case of an agreement to take shares in a company, the capital issued, if not equal to that proposed, must at least be adequate for the purposes of the company. It would be impossible to enforce a contract entered into on the faith of the company having at least prim\u00e2 facie a sufficient capital if this were so reduced as to render the success of the company's operations impossible and the loss of the purchaser's money certain.\nNow the very nature of the scheme for the carrying out of which this company was organized called for a very large capital. Without it, it is obvious that whatever business they might be able to transact they could not be able to effect a consolidation of a number of the principal businesses in the jewellery trade.\nThe difference in this case between the capital to be issued and what was actually issued was not merely one of degree, did not merely involve the probability of the company being crippled for want of sufficient capital, it rendered the company incapable of accomplishing the avowed object of its existence.\nThe underwriting contained a clause agreeing that\nthis underwriting may be pledged or hypothecated with any banking institution or trust company as security for advances.\nThe respondent's main contention is that the appellant is estopped as if the instrument were a negotiable security. I think, however, the doctrine of equitable estoppel which he invokes can have no application where the subject matter of the contract has never come into existence. It is not a question of the assignee being unaffected by equities between the vendor and purchaser. The purchaser cannot be expected to give his money for nothing; he is entitled to his part of the bargain and he is entitled to get substantially what he has agreed to purchase, not something essentially different and which may be of no value.\nIf I agree with a builder to put up a house for me for $20,000 and that he may pledge the contract for advances to enable him to carry out the work this does not mean that the builder can put the $20,000 in his pocket without doing any work and leave me to be sued for this amount by the lender of the money. It does mean, on the other hand, that I cannot, after the house has been built, claim to set off against the contract price a debt owing to me by the builder.\nIt would be difficult to lay down any general rules as to the rights and liabilities of the purchaser and the lender in these cases; they must, I think, depend upon the particular circumstances of each; that the effect of the pledge of the contract could ever be the same as the indorsement by the purchaser of a negotiable instrument cannot, I think, be maintained. The respondent's error is in regarding it as such and as being an absolute security regardless of the nature of the contract. The appellant's case has been prejudiced by his refusal or omission to answer the communications addressed to him by the respondent; but unless there was some obligation upon him to do so, his legal liability can hardly be altered in consequence. The respondent quotes from the case in this court of Ewing v. Dominion Bank[2], where it was said:\u2014\nWhere a man has kept silent when he ought to have spoken, he will not be permitted to speak when he ought to keep silent.\nThat is obviously assuming the obligation to speak or to keep silent.\nNow what was the obligation in this case, if I am right in supposing that the company never offered the appellant, was never in a position to offer him, the shares which he had agreed to take? Was he not, strictly speaking, justified in doing nothing but waiting until this was done? Timmis, the president of the company, questioned as to the reduction of capital, says:\u2014\nI don't know that we ever reduced. We have not yet carried out all our intentions.\nAnd in respondent's factum it is said:\u2014\nThe reason for issuing a smaller amount was that the plans of the organizers were changed to suit the situation subsequently arising. The promoters' intentions had not yet been all carried out. Nothing would prevent the issue of further shares.\nThe appellant, we must suppose, is and always has been ready and willing to carry out his part of the bargain when the vendors offer him the shares for which he has subscribed.\nIt is true that\nif a man claims to rescind his contract to take shares in a company on the ground that he has been induced to enter into it by misrepresentation he must rescind it as soon as he learns the facts, but that is not this case in which the appellant is not suing but only seeks to rescind his contract as matter of defence to the action, if and so far as he does seek to rescind the contract.\nIt is going a great deal too far to say that his (the appellant's) failure to say or do anything amounts to approval of the statement of his indebtedness to the respondent contained in the letters.\nAnd then when it is complained that the appellant has done nothing why has the respondent done nothing all this time beyond writing three letters, the failure to obtain an answer to which was certainly notice to them that they ought to take some action to insist on such rights as they supposed they had against the appellant? Even if there be no excuse to be made for the appellant there were laches on the part of the respondent.\nI am disposed to think that the pleadings sufficiently cover the defence of the appellant but if it were necessary they ought to be amended.\nFor these reasons I would allow the appeal.\nDavies J.\u2014I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014Inasmuch as it has not been made quite clear that the respondent actually changed its position or did anything except procure the certificate of stock tendered by this action, and bring the action on the faith of the underwriting contained in the appellant's subscription for stock now in question, I am inclined to hesitate before adopting the grounds of estoppel in the strict legal sense of the term used in the court below as entirely sufficient to rest the judgment upon.\nIn another and wider sense than the technical application of the term \"estoppel\" and which I will proceed to explain, the case may well be made to turn and the judgment be rested.\nThe appellant has entirely failed to make out any case of fraud or misrepresentation of an existing fact whereby he was induced to sign the contract in question. He merely, according to his own evidence, sets up that the thing he bargained for was not the thing that had been tendered him. In other words, he says he had been led to understand that the stock he was subscribing for was in a company of greater importance than the company that actually resulted from the promotion of Mackay and others. He says that because it was a company having only an issue of six hundred thousand preferred stock with an issue of six hundred and some odd thousand of common stock, instead of a company which had been hoped for of one million and a half preferred stock and one million and a half common stock, therefore he is relieved of his bargain.\nI cannot accede to the proposition that as a matter of course the failure of realization of a man's expectations in this regard, apart from any express stipulation providing for such a condition of things as he expected, he can withdraw on account of a disappointment resting upon so little as appears in this case.\nWe have no such condition or stipulation existent as between the parties concerned but we are asked, as it were, to engraft same into or on to that form of contract which they chose to adopt. There is nothing to help in the form of contract except the words \"to be issued\" at the heading which I would read \"authorized capital to be issued.\"\nI cannot infer from the use of such terms in the place it occupies in the instrument and read in light of the attendant circumstances any such meaning as to imply that in default of that expectation being realized the subscription for stock should be null and void.\nThen we have it made clear by the evidence that there were no persons present at the making and signing of the contract except the appellant and Mackay. The latter swears positively that the conversation did not last more than five minutes, and that he did not use any language properly giving rise to any such expectations.\nThe appellant failed to contradict this, or swear that it lasted longer. His memory fails, he admits, to serve him either as to that or the express language which passed between them.\nNow I take it that in weighing evidence of that kind and determining which of these two parties is right, that the man who acts in the way the appellant acted towards Mackay and towards the respondent in failing to answer one single word calling attention at different times, spread over many months, demanding payment, is not in a position to ask any court to accept his version of the understanding reached or such a construction as he seeks to put upon the transaction to which he subscribes his name, when that document as I hold neither expressly nor by implication bears it.\nCommon fairness and a straightforward mode of dealing with other men as well as a proper regard for the rights of others on the part of a business man, renders it imperative, in my opinion, that under the circumstances detailed in the evidence herein the appellant should have spoken promptly and decidedly and explained why he was failing to pay.\nIt may not be estoppel in pais as usually understood, but it is the kind of thing that precludes a man from imputing to another conduct or expressions of a misleading character, which he absolutely denies, when there is nothing in the documents that passed entitling him to take that position. I think the effect of such denial stands good under such circumstances as presented by this case and deprives appellant of any effective support for his understanding on which he rests his appeal.\nAnd as to the ground of illegality of the common stock which he presents in his evidence, I fail to find it made good by anything in the case.\nI, therefore, think that the appeal should fail with costs, and the judgment below be sustained.\nDuff J.\u2014I think that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014On or about the 30th December, 1911, J. A. Mackay, president of J. A. Mackay & Co., Ltd., procured the signature of the defendant Robert to the agreement sued upon, which is as follows:\u2014\nCanadian Jewellers, Ltd.\nAuthorized Capital\nTo be issued.\nPreferred shares . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $2,500,000\n$1,500,000\nCommon shares . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,500,000%\n1,500,000\nAll shares of the par value of $100 each.\nWe, the undersigned, severally subscribe for and agree to purchase from J. A. Mackay & Co., Limited, preferred shares of the above company to the number and amounts set opposite our respective names. The price to be paid for said shares is 95% of the par value thereof with 50% of the par value thereof in bonus common stock of the company. The purchase price to be paid on the 15th day of September, 1912.\nThis underwriting may be pledged or hypothecated with any banking institution or trust company as security for advances. This agreement may be signed in counterpart and all counterparts taken together shall be deemed to be one original instrument,\nName of Subscriber.\nAddress.\nNo. of shares subscribed.\nTotal amount, of subscription.\nWitness\n(Sgd.)\n$10,000.00\n(Sgd.)\nE. A. Robert\nMontreal.\nOne hundred.\nJ. A. Mackay\nThe Canadian Jewellers, Limited, was incorporated by letters patent issued under the \"Dominion Companies Act.\" Prior to the 30th December, 1911, Mackay, who attended to its \"financing\" and the underwriting of its stock for the new company, had borrowed for that purpose from the plaintiff, the Montreal Trust Company, $131,103.10. On the 6th January, 1912, he hypothecated the defendant's agreement to purchase stock with the trust company as collateral security for the advances already made to him and for further advances. Further advances appear to have been made to Mackay after the 30th December, 1911. But, so far as appears, no advance was made after the 19th of April, 1912.\nThis action was brought by the Montreal Trust Company against Robert on the 21st of January, 1915, to enforce payment by him of the amount of his underwriting ($9,500), with interest thereon at 7% per annum from the 15th September, 1912, the action being accompanied by a tender and deposit of a certificate issued in the name of the defendant for 100 shares of the preferred stock and another certificate for 50 shares of the common stock of the Canadian Jewellers, Limited.\nApart from formal pleas, the defences set up are that the signature of the defendant was procured by misrepresentations made to him by Mackay as to the amount of preferred shares and common shares \"to be issued\" and as to the jewellery businesses to be acquired by the new company; that the shares tendered were part of a block of stock illegally issued by the Canadian Jewellers, Limited, without consideration, and for illegal secret profits and commissions and are not fully paid up and are of no value; and that the company has mortgaged its assets, with the assent of J. A. Mackay & Company, for $70,000 and has thus rendered its stock worthless. The last mentioned plea, probably demurrable, was not pressed.\nThe evidence does not support the plea of illegality in the issue of shares. J. A. Mackay & Company appear to have paid for those issued to them.\nThe company was in fact organized and has been carried on with a subscribed capital of only $600,000 in preference shares and $671,000 in common shares, and did not include two or three of the principal jewellery firms whose businesses the defendant claims it was represented to him would be acquired.\nIt may be noted that the defendant does not plead that it was a term or condition of his subscription that he should be liable thereon only in the event of and upon $1,500,000 in preference shares and $1,500,000 in common shares of the capital stock being subscribed for. The plea in this connection is solely one of misrepresentation. Had it been of the former character, however, in view of the provisions of the \"Companies Act\" (R.S.C. ch. 79) as to the commencement of business (sec. 26) and the allotment of stock and liability for calls thereon (secs. 46, 80, 132, 140), I should hesitate to hold that a mere statement at the head of an underwriting agreement as to the capital to be issued implies that it is a term or condition of the subscriber's contract that he should be under no liability to take or pay for shares unless and until the amount so stated has been subscribed for, or that his liability should cease if the scheme of issuing the amount of stock thus stated should be changed and the issue of a smaller amount determined upon. Ornamental Pyrographic Woodwork Company v. Brown[3]; Lyon's Case[4]; Buckley's Law of Companies (1902), 569-70; but see Elder v. New Zealand Land Improvement Company[5]. In the case of a company incorporated under that statute, a subscription contract intended so to restrict or qualify the subscribers' liability, must, I think, in view of its provisions above referred to, be couched in clear and explicit language. But it is unnecessary to pass upon a possible defence which has not been pleaded.\nNeither is it pleaded that the shares for the price of which the defendant is sued are not the shares which he agreed to purchase, or that the company is not that a portion of whose stock he agreed to underwrite. That was the issue in Windsor Hotel Co. v. Laframboise[6].\nDealing with the case, therefore, purely as one of misrepresentation, it becomes material to consider the evidence given in support of that defence.\nThe testimony of the defendant is far from wholly satisfactory. Indefinite in his examination in chief, on cross-examination he probably deposed with sufficient distinctness and particularity to the making of the representation as to the amount of the stock to be issued, but he left quite vague and uncertain what he may have been told, if anything, as to the inclusion of the firms whose omissions he complained of. Mr. Mackay, called in rebuttal, distinctly denied having made the statement that the acquisition of the businesses of these firms had been or would be arranged for, but did not deny that he had made the representation as to capitalization. With Mr. Justice Martineau I am of the opinion that the latter is the only misrepresentation the making of which has been at all satisfactorily proved. The defendant, however, did not pledge his oath either that he had been induced to subscribe by this representation or that he would not have done so had it not been made. Under the circumstances of this case, especially having regard to the defendant's failure to disaffirm or repudiate his contract for at least two and a half years after he had full knowledge of the falsity of the misrepresentation he alleges, I think strict proof that he had in fact been induced by it to subscribe should be exacted. Art. 993 C.C.; 4 Aubry et Rau (1902), No. 343 bis. p. 504; Larombi\u00e8re, art. 1116, No. 3; 24 Demolombe, No. 175; Morrison v. The Universal Marine Ins. Co.[7]; Smith v. Chadwick[8]. His defence upon both the alleged misrepresentations, in my opinion, therefore fails.\nBut had he made a case which otherwise would clearly entitle him to avoid his contractual obligations (Bwlch-Y-Plwm Lead Mining Co. v. Baynes[9]), I incline strongly to the view that his delay in repudiating liability should, under all the circumstances, be taken to raise a presumption of acquiescence or confirmation\u2014of an election not to avoid, which precludes his doing so. Qui tacet consentire videtur.\nAccording to his own evidence, Mr. Robert made up his mind some time before the maturity of his underwriting on the 15th September, 1912, that he was not bound by it. He does not give more precisely the date when he learned of the falsity of the representations of which he complains. Although he was written to frequently\u2014by the plaintiff, on the 14th September. 1912, the 13th December, 1912, and the 7th of August, 1913\u2014and by J. A. Mackay & Company, on the 9th November, 1912, and the 5th of May 1914\u2014pressing for payment of his subscription, he took no step to repudiate liability\u2014he did not vouchsafe an answer to any of the letters so addressed to him. He simply allowed matters to rest in this position until after this action was begun in 1915. His first repudiation was that in his plea delivered on the 1st April, 1915. Under these circumstances he is, in my opinion, debarred from setting up the alleged misrepresentations as a defence. I think he would be so debarred if this action were brought by J. A. Mackay & Company or by the Canadian Jewellers, Limited, itself, as a transferee of his subscription; and his position is certainly not more favourable when sued by the plaintiff as pledgee for bon\u00e2 fide advances.\nIn the judgment of the Judicial Committee in United Shoe Machinery Company of Canada v. Brunet[10], (a case from the Province of Quebec, in which, however, the defence of misrepresentation was rejected because of positive acts implying acquiescence) it is formally laid down that in order to maintain a plea that he was induced by false representations to make the contract sued upon, a defendant must establish\n(1) that the representations complained of were made; (2) that they were false in fact; (3) that the person making them either knew that they were false or made them recklessly without knowing whether they were false or true; (4) that the defendant was thereby induced to enter into the contract; and (5) that immediately on, or at least within a reasonable time after, his discovery of the fraud which had been practised upon him he elected to avoid the contract and accordingly repudiated it. Lord Atkinson says:\u2014\nOf these the last is the most vital in the sense that it is the condition precedent which must be fulfilled before the respondents can escape from the obligation of the contracts they have entered into, however fraudulent those contracts may be. A contract into which a person may have been induced to enter by false and fraudulent representation is not void but merely voidable at the election of the person defrauded after he has had notice of the fraud. This rule in regard to voidable contracts has always been held to apply ratione subject\u00e6 materi\u00e6 with particular force to an agreement to take shares in a company.\nLord Davey, in his judgment in Aaron's Reefs v. Twiss[11], says:\u2014\nLapse of time without rescinding will furnish evidence of an intention to affirm the contract. But the cogency of this evidence depends on the particular circumstances of the case and the nature of the contract in question. Where a person has contracted to take shares in a company and his name has been placed on the register, it has always been held that he must exercise his right of repudiation with extreme promptness after the discovery of the fraud or misrepresentation, for this reason: the presence of his name on the register may have induced other persons to give credit to the company or to become members of it.\nMellor J. in delivering the judgment of the Exchequer Chamber in Clough v. London and North Eastern Railway Co.[12], so often quoted with approval said, at p. 35:\u2014\nSo long as he (the person on whom the fraud was practised) has made no election he retains the right to determine it either way, subject to this, that if in the interval whilst he is deliberating, an innocent third party has acquired an interest in the property, or if in consequence of his delay the position even of the wrongdoer is affected, it will preclude him from exercising his right to rescind.\nAnd lapse of time without rescinding will furnish evidence that he has determined to affirm the contract; and when the lapse of time is great, it probably would in practice be treated as conclusive to shew that he has so determined.\nWe are not here dealing with an ordinary contract to acquire from a shareholder shares already issued in a company organized and carrying on business. The defendant's agreement was an underwriting contract. It is so characterized upon its face. He must have been fully aware that his subscription might operate as an inducement to others to take stock in the Canadian Jewellers, Limited, or to a company or person in the position of the plaintiff either to give credit to it or to a person holding towards it the relation which J. A. Mackay & Company occupied, or to extend the term of such a credit, if already given. His position was not materially different in that respect from what it would have been had he made application for his stock directly to the company itself.\nA person seeking to set aside a voidable contract to take shares in a company on the ground of misrepresentation must take steps for that purpose immediately on discovering the misrepresentation.\nHe must proceed with the very utmost promptitude possible in such a case.\nOgilvie v. Currie[13].\nIf a man claims to rescind his contract to take shares in a company on the ground that he has been induced to enter into it by misrepresentation, he must rescind it as soon as he learns the facts or else he forfeits all claim to relief.\nSharpley v. Louth and East Coast Rly. Co.[14].\nIt is impossible,\nsaid Lord Cranworth in Oakes v. Turquand[15],\nto allow a person who has taken shares and has gone on for nearly a year taking his chance of profit to turn round when the speculation has proved a failure and claim to be released on the ground that he was ignorant of something with which the least diligence must have made him acquainted.\nStill more clearly must it be impossible where the case is one not merely of culpable ignorance, but of actual knowledge of the grounds of voidability.\nAs put by Mr. Justice Riddell, delivering the majority judgment in the Ontario Appellate Division in Morrisburg and Ottawa Electric Rly. Co. v. O'Connor[16], holding that repudiation of liability on a subscription for shares on account of matter entailing voidability must be made promptly after discovery of the facts, the subscriber is not bound, but may elect to approve or disaffirm\u2014in short the contract is voidable and not void. It is wholly immaterial on what ground or for what reason it is voidable\u2014the important matter is that it is so.\nCompare the language of Lord Cairns in Ogilvie v. Currie[17], at the beginning of p. 546: See Art. 1000 C.C.\nThe man who has learned facts which entitle him to avoid a contract cannot be allowed to defer indefinitely the exercise of an election in which others are interested. The time must come when he will be taken either to have foregone that right or to have exercised it in favour of affirming. In the case of subscriptions for shares in a company, as in that of contracts of a speculative character, a comparatively short delay will ordinarily be conclusive: Bawlf Grain Co. v. Ross[18]; Directors of Central Rly. Co. of Venezuela v. Kisch[19].\nViewed as a case of election, actual or presumed, prejudice to the plaintiff, to the Canadian Jewellers, Limited, or to its creditors or other shareholders would seem to be immaterial and irrelevant to the answer to the plea of misrepresentation. If, on the other hand, that answer should be regarded as one of laches, such prejudice may be a material element. From this point of view it may be that if the subscriber's delay in repudiating after having acquired knowledge of grounds of voidability has caused no prejudice whatever to the company, to its shareholders or to its creditors, it would be excusable. But where, as in the case at bar, the circumstances give rise to a strong probability that some such prejudice must have been occasioned, I think the burden will be on him to make out that case\u2014always difficult and under ordinary circumstances practically impossible. Or it may be that he will be required to establish that under the actual circumstances no such prejudice could have arisen. Nothing of the kind has been attempted here. Other subscriptions were hypothecated by Mackay with the plaintiff after that of the defendant had matured\u2014some of them as late as February, 1913. Having regard to what appears to have been the course of business between Mackay & Co. and the plaintiff it would seem altogether likely that these subscriptions were procured after September, 1912. The plaintiff's loan to Mackay & Co. was allowed to run on. At the time of the trial it was slightly larger than at the end of December, 1912. It is impossible to say that these later subscriptions and this extended term of credit may not to some extent have been influenced by the fact that the defendant allowed himself to continue to be regarded as an underwriter liable to contribute $9,500 to the company's capital. That fact may likewise have affected the loaning of $70,000 to the company of which the defendant has complained.\nWhere a clear and gross case of laches has been made, such as the evidence here discloses, I very much doubt that the courts can be called upon to enter on the inquiry whether prejudice has or has not in fact resulted in any of the many directions in which it might be possible\u2014an inquiry necessarily prolonged and far-reaching and as to the exhaustiveness of which the attainment of certainty must usually be impracticable. While I fully appreciate the force of the introductory observations of Sir Barnes Peacock upon the doctrine of laches in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Lindsay Petroleum Co. v. Hurd[20], I rather incline to the view that, in a case like that at bar, as in the case of a contract made with an agent to whom a secret commission has been paid, which we have had occasion recently to consider fully in Barry v. Stoney Point Canning Co[21], the possibility of prejudice will itself be deemed conclusive. It was the obvious impossibility of any such prejudice that led to relief being given the defendant in Aaron's Reefs v. Twiss[22], the delay there alleged having occurred only after the company had declared his shares forfeited.\nLest it might be thought to have been overlooked, I should perhaps refer to Farrell v. Manchester[23], in which passages are to be found, notably one at p. 356, at first blush somewhat at variance with views I have expressed. That was a case where there had been prompt repudiation followed by some delay in suing for rescission. There were special circumstances which were held sufficiently to account for and to excuse this delay\u2014and the case, it is said, at p. 359:\u2014\npresents few of those characteristics that differentiate the usual stock cases cited from others regarding fraud entitling to rescission, so as to render each day's delay strong evidence of (absence of) that promptitude justice in some cases demands.\nMere lapse of time may import acquiescence amounting to affirmation. If great, it may, without more, do so conclusively: Clough v. London & North Western Railway Co.[24]. Where the subject matter is highly speculative\u2014where the possibility of others being affected is very great, a comparatively short time may suffice. A man entitled to avoid a contract cannot indefinitely withhold his election in order to exercise it as may ultimately prove advantageous to himself. Had the Canadian Jewellers, Limited, turned out a great success, as a subscriber for $10,000 worth of preference shares out of $600,000 worth issued, and of $5,000 worth of common shares out of an issue of $670,000 worth, Mr. Robert's position would have been much better than it would have been, with like success, had the issued capital been $1,500,000 preference and $1,500,000 common; and in that case we should have heard nothing of repudiation. He cannot be allowed to defer his repudiation for nearly three years, with full knowledge of the misrepresentation of which he complains, until satisfied that his interest lies in that direction, having meantime taken the full benefit of the chance of success of the venture.\nHad the case at bar arisen in any of the other provinces of Canada, where English law prevails and there is no statutory prescription of the action of rescission for fraud, I should have been prepared to discard the defence of misrepresentation on the sole ground of delay under circumstances importing an election not to avoid, or the loss of the right to elect by acquiescence. The provisions of Art. 2258 C.C. (Art. 1304 C.N.),\n2258.\u2014The action (s) * * * in rescission of contracts for error, fraud, violence or fear are prescribed by ten years. This time runs * * * in the case of error or fraud from the day it was discovered\nand the doctrine of the civil law as to the requisites of tacit confirmation (3 Baudry-Lacantinerie, \"Des Obligations,\" Nos. 2024-5 and 2004-5) however are said to present obstacles to the application of this doctrine in the Province of Quebec. I assume Art. 2258 to be applicable at least by analogy to a defence of fraud. Yet we have the authority of the Privy Council in United Shoe Machinery Co. v. Brunet[25], that unreasonable delay in repudiation affords an answer to a defence of misrepresentation in Quebec. In Guy on v. Lionais[26], where Art. 2258 had been brought to their attention, their Lordships took the same view. At page 104, they say:\u2014\nThe transaction * * * was one which, upon a suit brought in proper time, Dame Marguerite Roy might successfully have impeached on the ground of fraud.\nAt page 107, they continue:\u2014\nThe action was no doubt commenced within, though only just within, the legal term of prescription. But that does not in such a suit relieve a party from the consequences of his own acts or laches. A Court of Justice will not give its aid to a person seeking to set aside his own solemn deed of sale, if it appears that he has acquiesced in it for years, lying by, until by circumstances, and the expenditure of capital, the subject matter of the sale has greatly increased in value and new interests have been created in it. He must sue promptly, or explain the delay.\nLemerle in his Treatise on Fins de Non Re\u00e7evoir says at page 186:\u2014\nQuiconque aurait gard\u00e9 le silence dans une circonstance o\u00f9 il devait parler, sur une action qu'il devait approuver, pourrait, dans certains cas, \u00eatre r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir donn\u00e9 un consentement, une approbation susceptible d'op\u00e9rer fin de non re\u00e7evoir.\nAnd at page 189:\u2014\nA-t-on gard\u00e9 le silence sur une exception d'incomp\u00e9tence, de nullit\u00e9, ou sur une demande susceptible d'\u00eatre form\u00e9e en premi\u00e8re instance, ce silence est r\u00e9put\u00e9 approbation et emporte renonciation aux moyens qu'on a n\u00e9glig\u00e9s.\nNo doubt, as put by Lord Wensleydale in Archbold v. Scully[27].:\u2014\nSo far as laches is a defence, I take it that where there is a Statute of Limitations, the objection of simple laches does not apply until the expiration of the time allowed by the statute. But acquiescence is a different thing; it means more than laches.\nIt implies an election to affirm or an abandonment of the right to elect to avoid. See too the language of Turner L.J. in Life Association of Scotland v. Siddal[28].\nMoreover it would seem eminently desirable that a subscription for shares in a company should entail similar obligations and that the right to avoid or repudiate it should be subject to the same conditions throughout Canada. All our companies are constituted and organized on a somewhat similar basis and shares in them are of the same nature in Quebec as elsewhere in Canada. Shares in the same company are very often underwritten or subscribed for in several provinces, including Quebec. The English idea as to the nature of the interest of the subscriber for shares or the shareholder and the incidents attached to it runs through all our companies' legislation. Many of the questions which arise in connection with the formation and administration of companies are determined in the Province of Quebec, as elsewhere in Canada, according to the principles established in the English courts. It would, I think, be most unsatisfactory if the right of a subscriber in Quebec for shares in a Dominion company to disaffirm his obligation to take or pay for them should endure for ten years after he had fully learned the facts which render that obligation voidable, whereas the like right of a subscriber in British Columbia or Ontario for shares in the same company would be unavailable to him should he fail to repudiate his obligation with the utmost promptitude reasonably possible after discovering its voidability. While I should deprecate any attempt to modify or affect any doctrine of the civil law of Quebec or an established construction of any legislation of that province by an introduction of English law or by adopting English views or practice merely for the sake of securing conformity, I incline to think that in regard to subscriptions for shares in companies, \"in the absence of any legislation in force in Quebec inconsistent with the law as acted upon in England\" and other provinces of Canada, and in the absence of any jurisprudence or established practice to the contrary, the courts of Quebec might well accept and apply the English rule imposing prompt repudiation as a condition of maintaining a plea of misrepresentation or granting the relief of rescission on that ground, and that while the right to repudiate on that ground may there be held not to be legally extinguished until the expiry of the limitation period prescribed by Art. 2258, the courts may decline to give effect to it in cases where that would be the attitude of courts administering English law. (Cory v. Burr[29]. The considerations which require the highest degree of diligence in the repudiation of voidable subscriptions for shares in companies under the English law apply with equal force in the Province of Quebec: Pr\u00e9fontaine v. Grenier[30].\nI am, for these reasons, of the opinion that Mr. Robert could not have successfully defended this action had it been brought by J. A. Mackay & Co. or by the Canadian Jewellers, Limited, as assignee of his agreement to take shares. The position of the present plaintiff is, if anything, more favourable.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Perron, Taschereau, Rinfret, Vall\u00e9e & Genest.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Brown, Montgomery & McMichael.\n[1] Q.R. 52 S.C. 73.\n[2] 35 Can.

As a condition of said deed, the respondent reserved to himself the faculty to buy and the appellant bound himself to sell that lot for the price of $1,000 per acre, payable $5,000 on the date of the deed of sale to be passed and the balance $2,000 per year.\nOn the 2nd July, 1914, a deed of transfer was passed between the parties by which the respondent retroceded to the appellant all his rights belonging to him in virtue of the above deed of promise of sale, in consideration of the payment of a sum of $60,000. This sum was payable $2,000 cash, $13,000 on the 17th of July, 1914, $5,000 on the 2nd of July, 1915, and $5,000 per year, with interest of 6% per annum.\nThe appellant paid to the respondent $2,000 cash and the payment of $13,000 due on the 17th of July, 1914; but failed to pay the instalment of $5,000 due on the 2nd of July, 1915, and $2,700 for interest.\nThe deed of transfer contained the following covenant:\n\"Si M. Gagnon faillissait \u00e0 faire le premier paiement de treize mille piastres ou tout autre paiement d'int\u00e9r\u00eat et de capital, le present transport sera nul ipso facto, sans mise en demeure, et la promesse de vente revivra en faveur de Mr. Lemay, dans toute sa vigueur. M. Lemay gardera le paiement de deux mille piastres ci-dessus dit fait comptant, ainsi que tout paiement subs\u00e9quent, dans le cas o\u00f9 M. Gagnon se laisserait arri\u00e9rer plus de trente jours dans aucune \u00e9ch\u00e9ance de capital ou int\u00e9r\u00eat, et ce, sans mise en demeure.\"\nAntonio Perrault K.C. and J. W. Jalbert for the appellant argued that, the above clause having put an end to the contract, the appellant was no more indebted toward the respondent.\nRobert Tascherean K.C. for the respondent cited Picard v. Renaud[2]; Peloquin v. Cohen[3]; Halcro v. Gray[4], and P\u00e9pin v. Savignac[5].\nAntonio Perrault K.C. and J. W. Jalbert for the appellant\nRobert Tascherean K.C. for the respondent\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014In this case, the appellant, in June, 1910, leased to the respondent a piece of property for ten years with a promise of sale; the purchase price was fixed at $30,000. In July, 1914, the same property was reconveyed by the respondent to the appellant for the sum of $60,000, payable $2,000 in cash and the balance in instalments, on account of which the respondent received $15,000. The appellant having failed to pay the difference of $45,000, this action was brought to recover a further instalment due on the purchase price.\nThe appellant denies all liability on the ground that the promise of sale sued on contains a stipulation in these words:\u2014\nSi M. Gagnon faillissait \u00e0 faire le premier paiement de treize mille piastres ou tout autre paiement d'int\u00e9r\u00eat et de capital, le pr\u00e9sent transport sera nul ipso facto, sans mise en demeure et la promesse de vente revivra en faveur de M. Lemay, dans toute sa vigueur. M. Lemay gardera le paiement de $2,000 ci-dessus dit fait comptant, ainsi que tout paiement subs\u00e9quent, dans le cas ou M. Gagnon se laisserait arri\u00e9rer plus de trente jours dans aucune \u00e9ch\u00e9ance de capital ou int\u00e9r\u00eat, et ce, sans mise en demeure.\nThe question to be decided is: What is the legal effect of this stipulation? There can, I think, be no doubt that of the whole contract it may be said:\u2014\nLes parties ont stipul\u00e9 express\u00e9ment qu'elles entendent faire un contrat de location, mais le rapport de droit, tel qu'il r\u00e9sulte objectivement des clauses de l'acte, correspond au contrat de vente, dont l'\u00e9lement sp\u00e9cifique, transfert de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, se trouve r\u00e9alis\u00e9.\nS. 1888, 1, 87; D. 96, 1, 57; D. 91, 1, 271.\nThe appellant contends that the stipulation in question is a resolutive condition which, when accomplished, effects of right the dissolution of the contract; and that the words used evidence the intention that it was to operate for the benefit of both parties. On the other hand, the respondent submits that this is a special stipulation to the effect that the deed of sale is voidable but only at his, the vendor's, option, if the purchase price or any portion of it is not paid at the dates fixed, that is the lex commissoria of the Roman law. I am inclined to hold that the peculiar form in which the stipulation is expressed reveals an intention on the part of both the contracting parties to make a special agreement, the effect of which would be in case the purchaser failed in his engagements to put both parties back in the position in which they were at the date of the contract, the appellant purchaser forfeiting, however, all payments made on account up to the date of the breach.\nThe differences between the Quebec Civil Code and the Code Napol\u00e9on must be borne in mind when considering the effect of this contract. (Compare articles 1536 C.C., 1088 C.C., 1065 C.C., with 1184 C.N. and 1654 C.N.) Under the Quebec law the seller of an immovable cannot demand a dissolution of the sale of the immovable by reason of the failure of the buyer to pay the purchase price, unless there is a stipulation to that effect. A lex commissoria is never presumed. The rule of the French law is to the contrary.\nIt must also be borne in mind that, according to Pothier, Vente, vol. 3, No. 459, a lex commissoria does not entitle the vendor; in the absence of express stipulation, to rescind ipso jure. He can only bring an action to have the contract declared void and, until judgment is given in such action, the buyer may still save his position by tendering the money, notwithstanding that the term fixed for payment has elapsed. In a word, if the condition fails through the money not being paid by the date fixed, the contract does not become ipso facto void, but the vendor has the option of rescinding it. The reason why the vendor has the option of rescinding or adopting the contract is obvious. If the contract became ipso facto void on non-payment of the purchase money, it would always be in the power of the purchaser by withholding it to rescind the sale from the moment of its conclusion and so to throw on the vendor the loss which would result from accidental destruction or damage occurring after delivery. If the condition is resolutive, the purchaser becomes owner of the property by delivery. He has all the ordinary rights of an owner and the loss falls on him if the property perishes before the condition is fulfilled. And in either case, whether the stipulation in question is a lex commissoria or a resolutive condition, in the absence of special agreement to the contrary, the avoidance of the contract entitles the purchaser to recover back any portion of the purchase money if it has been paid, subject always to claims for damages, revenues, etc. But here the contract does not say that the sale is voidable at the purchaser's option, the stipulation is that if the respondent fails to make any of his payments \"le pr\u00e9sent transfert sera nul ipso facto,\" the sale ceases to exist on the happening of the condition and then it provides against loss by the vendor. The promise of sale in his favour revives and the purchaser Gagnon forfeits all payments made on account of his purchase, $15,000.00.\nI must confess that the language of the stipulation conveys to my mind the impression that the parties must have intended to make a special agreement to meet the very special conditions under which this agreement was entered into and producing results entirely different from those which would follow from a lex commissoria. Vide Beudant, \"Effets de la Vente,\" pp. 196 and 197.\nBut as all the judges below and my colleagues here have reached a different conclusion, I submit to their better judgment.\nVide Pothier, vol. 3, No. 473. Davies J.\u2014I would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The intention of the parties so far as can be gathered from the contracts in question must govern. And the neat, though by no means simple, point raised herein is whether or not the nullification of the last contract between the parties as therein provided was intended to be dependent on the will of the vendor alone or on the will of either seeking to terminate it.\nI cannot by elaboration help any one for the case as presented in the judgments below and in argument here has been considered from every point of view.\nI need only say that if the appellant had in truth the rather improbable purpose in view of procuring the unusual right of a vendee to terminate the contract after he had paid one-fourth of the price, he would have been well advised in having had it expressed in less ambiguous language.\nThe point made by Mr. Justice Cross that the obvious right of the respondent to sue, within the thirty days specified for the vendee to save his rights, after default, is rather a formidable barrier in the way of construing the contract as appellant desires.\nI admit the suggestions made in the appellant's factum in reply thereto are very plausible and worthy the consideration I have given them, but do not carry the question far enough or indeed beyond the region of ambiguity which stands in appellant's way.\nIt is not a case where authority can help us much for the meaning of one contract is rarely helped by a decision upon another though only varying slightly from the one which has been decided. In truth it is not the law but the fact which troubles us herein.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs. Duff J.\u2014I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed for the reasons assigned by the Chief Justice of the Court of King's Bench[6]. The fact, as pointed out by that learned judge, that art. 1536 of the Civil Code of Quebec makes a provision directly contrary to that of art. 1654 of the Code Napol\u00e9on, materially lessens, if it does not destroy, the value in Quebec of the French authorities cited in his very able argument and factum by M. Perrault. A construction of the clause on which the purchaser (appellant) relies that would enable him to terminate his contractual obligations by making default in fulfilling them could be justified only by terms admitting of no other interpretation.\nThe clause in question, if we omit from it the terms \"ipso facto, sans mise en demeure\" is the ordinary \"pacte commissoire\" of the French law, of which Casault J. in Price v. Tessier[7], said, at pp. 218-19:\n\"Le pacte commissoire,\" disent Aubry & Rau, vol. 4, par. 302, p. 82, \"est la clause par laquelle les parties conviennent que le contrat sera r\u00e9solu, si l'une ou l'autre d'entr'elles ne satisfait pas aux obligations qu'il lui impose.\"\nLa simple stipulation dans la vente, de sa r\u00e9solution, faute de paiement, n'est, dans notre droit, qu'un pacte commissoire, auquel il manque la perfection de celui du droit romain, qui en faisait r\u00e9sulter la nullit\u00e9 de la vente; tandis que, avec nous, il ne comporte que le droit d'en demander la r\u00e9solution en justice. Le Code Civil, article 1536, fait de ce pacte une condition de la demande en r\u00e9solution de la vente des immeubles.\nDans notre ancien droit, cette condition de resolution \u00e9tait tacite et la r\u00e9solution, qu'elle permettait d'obtenir, devait \u00eatre demand\u00e9e en justice. Elle existe encore dans la vente des meubles. Mais, pour celle des immeubles, le Code Civil a mis fin \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution tacite, et la fait d\u00e9pendre, faute de paiement, d'une stipulation sp\u00e9ciale qui est, comme je viens de le dire, le pacte commissoire. Ce dernier laisse subsister la vente jusqu'\u00e0 ce que, sur poursuite, le jugement ait prononc\u00e9 sa r\u00e9solution, qui ne peut \u00eatre demand\u00e9e que par le vendeur. The law as thus stated has been recognized in Brisson v. Phurde[8], by the Court of King's Bench; in Picard v. Renaud[9], by the Court of Review (Taschereau, Cimon and Archibald JJ.); in the judgment of Demers J., in Halcro v. Gray[10], affirmed by the Court of Review; and in Pepin v. Savignac[11]. It may perhaps be noted that in the two latter cases the term sans mise en demeure occurred in the condition, but not the term ipso facto.\nUnder such a stipulation containing neither of these terms, where, as here, the contract is silent as to the place of payment, the debt is \"qu\u00e9rable\" and not \"portable\" (art. 1152 C.C.) it is necessary that the debtor should be put in default (mise en demeure) by a demand of payment at his abode, and the right of rescission can only be asserted by judicial proceedings. The clause is regarded merely as an expression (rendered necessary by art. 1536 C.C. in the case of contracts for the sale of immoveables) of a condition implied in other contracts by art. 1065 C.C., and as having the like effect[12]. The seller alone can invoke it. It is a privilege or right of which he is at liberty to take advantage or not; and, until dissolution of the contract has been judicially declared, the debtor may avoid that consequence by fulfilling his obligation. Art. 1538 C.C. What then is the purpose and effect of inserting the terms \"ipso facto\" and \"sans mise en demeure?\" In my opinion the latter term is merely designed to dispense with the necessity for demanding payment at the debtor's domicile. It does not alter the nature of the stipulation or render it any the less a \"pacte commissoire.\" Such was the view maintained in Halcro v. Gray10, and Pepin v. Savignac11. The purpose of the term \"ipso facto\" is to enable the creditor to assert the dissolution of the contract without being obliged to resort to the courts, and either immediately upon default, or upon the expiry of any stipulated period of grace, to deprive the debtor of the right to purge his default by payment under art. 1538 C.C. Requisite for these purposes, in accomplishing them these provisions are given operation and effect\u2014the operation and effect which I think the parties must have intended. It is quite unnecessary, and, in my opinion, unwarranted, to attribute them to the extraordinary purpose of enabling the purchaser to relieve himself of his contractual obligations by making default in fulfilling them. They do not sufficiently, or indeed at all, express such an intention. They, therefore, do not change the nature of the facultative (potestative) condition in which they are found and make of it an absolute resolutive condition having the effect stated by \"art. 1088 C.C. It remains a provision inserted for the benefit of the vendor[13]. Indeed the presence of the term \"sans raise en demeure,\" because of its utter inapplicability to the case of a purchaser asserting that by his default he has put an end to the contract, affords an additional reason for taking this view of the stipulation under consideration.\nIn at least two instances the courts have so construed clauses so nearly identical in terms with that before us that no real distinction between them can be suggested. In Peloquin v. Cohen[14], Mr. Justice Tellier held that such a clause confers the right of rescission on the vendor alone, and in La Compagnie Imp\u00e9riale d'Immeubles v. Collerette, not reported but quoted in extenso in the factum of the respondent, Mr. Justice Panneton was of the same opinion. As stated by the learned Chief Justice of Quebec,\nLa jurisprudence de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure est \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s unanime sur la question.\nIt is, I think, reasonable to assume that in inserting the clause in question the parties to the contract now sued upon meant it to have the effect which had been thus given to similar clauses in the jurisprudence of the province. No doubt such clauses have been placed in many contracts of sale in the belief that they would be given operation and effect in accordance with these decisions. We have it on the authority of such an experienced judge as Mr. Justice Cross that\nIn conveyancing practice clauses such as the one in question have for many years been treated as giving a right of rescission to the seller but as not opening any right in favour of the buyer.\nThe wisdom of not overruling judicial decisions of some years' standing, where numerous contracts must have been made and moneys paid on the footing of the law as established by them, and of not breaking away from previous decisions upon the construction of a well known document in constant use for a number of years, even in cases where, were the matter res integra, a different view might have prevailed, is fully recognized in the English system of jurisprudence. Palmer v. Johnson[15]; Dunlop & Sons v. Balfour Williamson & Co.[16]. I cannot think that anything so mischievous as unsettling the law in regard to matters affecting rights of property should be countenanced by courts administering the civil law. That would seem to have been the view of the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench in the present case.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: J. W.

The Supreme Court of Canada, allowing the present appeal, reduced the amount to $34,840 Mr. Justice Davies was of opinion to reduce it to $22,900 and Mr. Justice Idington to $26,540.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nAmyot for the appellant.\nBelleau K.C. and St: Laurent K.C. for the respondent. The Chief Justice:\u2014I agree in the conclusion reached by Mr. Justice Brodeur and would allow the appeal in part with costs. Cross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Audette of the Exchequer Court fixing the compensation to be allowed for a certain property of the respondent situate at Lauzon in the District of Quebec expropriated by the Crown.\nThe area of the land expropriated was 398,000 square feet and the compensation fixed by the learned judge was ten cents a square foot. There were two buildings on the property for which $3,000 was allowed. In all therefore $42,800 was allowed for the land and buildings and to this the learned judge added the sum of $4,280, being 10% for compulsory taking.\nThe appellant did not challenge the $3,000 allowed for the buildings or the interest allowance made. The sole questions were as to the allowance per foot to be made for the land and the 10% for the compulsory purchase.\nThe learned judge upon reviewing some of the evidence as to value concludes that\nUnder all the circumstances of the case, taking into consideration that a large area is expropriated, a fair and generous market price for the same would be about 8 to 10 cents a foot, and to make it very generous compensation, I will make it 10 cents a foot.\nIn appellant's factum and in counsel's argument at bar five cents was submitted as the price which should be allowed.\nCounsel for the respondent pressed certain offers which, it was stated in evidence by the defendant Lariv\u00e9e, had been made to him of $100,000 and other sums for the land expropriated. But the learned judge made no reference to these alleged offers evidently not considering them bon\u00e2 fide. Only one of the three parties who were said to have made offers was called as a witness (Lagueux), and his offer, if made at all, was after the expropriation had been made. From the report of the stoppage by the judge of the defendant's cross-examination, it was evident that he had concluded that the defendant's evidence, considering his age and infirmities, should not be accepted on the question of these offers. It appeared that if the other offers were made at all it was after the project of the dock had been determined on and its location fixed. Assuming their bona fides, they were mere speculative offers as to the compensation which might be allowed and not evidence at all of what, apart from the project of the dry dock, the market value of the land would be worth.\nAfter considering all the facts, and evidence called to our attention, I have reached the conclusion that the offer of the appellant of 5 cents a square foot is a very reasonable and fair one and that the compensation allowed of 10 cents should be reduced accordingly.\nI cannot see any grounds for allowing in a case such as this the 10% for compulsory purchase. The reasons which prevail and justify this 10% in many cases do not exist here and I would disallow this item.\nBefore concluding, I would again protest against \"generosity\" being an element entering into the arbitrator's or judge's consideration when fixing the compensation to be allowed for compulsory purchase. I am quite unable to find how much the learned judge added to the market value of the land taken in this case for generosity. He says a fair and generous market price would be about 8 to 10 cents a foot and to make it \"very generous compensation\" he would make it 10 cents. I would respectfully submit that the market value of the property to the owner when taken is the true test of the compensation to be allowed excluding any advantage due to the carrying out of the scheme for which the property is compulsorily acquired.\nThe element of generosity is not one which should enter into consideration in determining the compensation. If allowed, it would simply mean the addition to the market value of the land such sum as the arbitrator or judge might in the goodness of his heart think it desirable to add, and penalizing the party expropriating to that amount.\nI would allow the appeal with costs, and reduce the compensation to 5 cents a square foot disallowing the 10% for compulsory purchase and confirming the judgment as to the value ($3,000) to be allowed for the house.\nIdington J:\u2014The respondent bought some land in Lauzonin 1897 at sheriff's sale for $1,475, and in 902 sold a lot thereout, of irregular shape, at a price which stated in argument, and not denied, would amount to two and a half cents a square foot.\nThe remainder of the land so bought by respondent which it is agreed by the parties amounts to 398,000 square feet, was expropriated in January, 1913, and the judgment of the Exchequer Court has awarded him therefor $47,880 including an estimated value for buildings of $3,000.\nDeducting that estimate for buildings leaves $42,880 for the bare land.\nI assume that the sheriff's sale may have been at a sacrifice price yet an award that gives the respondent who paid it thirty-two times as much for market price at the end of sixteen years is startling. I assume that the price of two and a half cents a foot for that sold in 1902 must be taken as the market value at that time. I cannot agree that the stipulation to build a good house was of such a character as to render the price named an untrustworthy guide to the value. Men buy land to build houses upon. And the purchaser in that instance had long and easy terms of payment with interest at 6% per annum.\nIt is alleged by respondent, however, that the sale had been bargained for two years before.\nIf I am right in' assuming that price to have been the market value in 1902, or 1900, as alleged, then this award can only be maintained as correct by finding that such property in Lauzon had, within eleven years, or thirteen if the bargain was made two years earlier, more than quadrupled in market value. It was a town of three thousand population and, like many such, practically stationary, as Mr. Charland admits, but yet had increased to four thousand during that time. It had long had an important industry in the shipbuilding and repairing line. We are not told how many hands employed. Respondent's factum modestly says a considerable number of workmen are employed there. Another old industry is that of manufacture of trunks and boxes. A more recent establishment of the same kind is mentioned. These seem to tell all there is of sufficient importance to be called large or substantial industries.\nThe evidence of actual market value at the time of the expropriation is unusually unsatisfactory.\nIt seems almost impossible to get witnesses testifying to values as of a given date when speaking three or four years after the given date, and when there has been in the meantime some great impulse given to the apparent progress of a town and hence a sudden rise in values, to bear in mind exactly what is wanted and distinguish accurately between past and present values. Even when the right question is put an ambiguous answer is given by one leading witness herein.\nThe respondent's witnesses in this case as a group hardly furnish an exemplary exception to the truth of these general observations. I am not surprised, therefore, to find that the learned trial judge has not accepted their opinions as his guide.\nThey have, besides their mere opinions, given a great many illustrations of transactions which, unfortunately, for one reason or another, can hardly assist us much in determining by comparison the market value of the property in question. And some of these the learned judge seems to assume might help to arrive at the truth.\nI desire to test the matter by using the respondent's price for what he sold and another sale beside it.\nBesides the part of the property sold by the respondent, there is one other transaction directly bearing upon the earlier value of that in question and that is a sale of lots in an adjoining plot, No. 6, said by Mr. Charland to be of substantially as good value as that now in question. It took place in 1905 and was a sale of twenty-nine lots at one cent per square foot.\nTwo slight difficulties arise in the way of possibly making too much use of this One is that the quality of the land is said by respondent to be inferior to that in question and that it has not the same advantage for needed drainage. The other is that the transaction was eight years prior to this expropriation.\nYet making all due allowance for the alleged difference in want of drainage facility, I think it is a fair index that property there had not increased since respondent's sale already mentioned, and of the value of property immediately beside that now in question. As a matter of common knowledge we know, or ought to know, that property in towns such as described and presenting no greater rate of increase than shewn, does not quadruple in value within eleven years.\nUpon the advent of some great project likely to double the population very shortly, there may be found such rapid rises within very brief periods. But these exceptional cases can all be verified by clear and convincing testimony and the causes therefor explained. The extent to which these causes in any cases may have operated are also susceptible of lucid explanation.\nWe have no such evidence offered in this case. That presented of estimated value of the property in question has been so extravagant that the learned trial judge seems to have discarded it entirely.\nI think he was right in doing so.\nI cannot accept the theory that such properties as in question had quadrupled in value in Lauzon within eleven years. Much less can I accept opinion evidence which would require in some of the estimates put forward a rise in values based on such slow progress in the town that it would imply an advance in values of fifteen to twenty fold in eleven years, or even thirteen years. It rather seems to me that witnesses forget the actual foundations of real market values and the increase thereof.\nAt all events I cannot, in the absence of any better reasons than those given, accept such estimates, involving such rise in values as I have just pointed out.\nThere is also the municipal assessment for the property in question which was $2,100 for years 1906-1908 and 1910, then raised, in 1912, to $2,400, and after the expropriation was raised to $6,000. Assuming that it did not comply with the law and did not represent actual values, yet there is little doubt in my mind but that it would be approximately on the same low level throughout the town. If I am right in that, curiously enough Mr. Lagueux gives a piece of evidence that when applied destroys his high estimate. It is this:\nHe tells of buying a property valued by the assessor at $2,000, and selling part for $3,000. And then says he would not give what is left for $5,000. Assuming from these figures the reasonable deduction that the witness does not draw, but I do, that four times the assessed value is what might be expected for the property, and apply that to the assessments of this property now in question, would fix the value of it at about $9,600.\nAnd yet we are asked to maintain a valuation of $42,800 for land alone and houses at $3,000, and add 10% for the cruel taking of it.\nI really cannot believe that the assessor for so many years assessed this property, of such an attractive character as Mr. St. Laurent so well and ably painted it to us, at one-twentieth part of its value, and then, when he raised it, only added, at the dawn of better days, $300.\nBut when those better days had come he could yet find it worth only $6,000.\nThe respondent was one of those men whom nothing could change after he had made up his mind not to sell, and hence some could well afford to practice the joke of offering him a hundred thousand dollars knowing he would refuse it.\nI notice they did not venture to lay down the gold less a year's discount and give the respondent a fair chance, or succeed in inducing the learned judge to accept the words as representing a sincere reality.\nIn argument counsel for appellant pointed out that the learned trial judge had made an error regarding the price of some larger sales and thus in effect misdirected himself. I assume that would have been denied if incorrect, and I think it quite possible the error of calculation may have led to error in the judgment.\nAnother test of the intrinsic worth of the property and the demands for more house room, is the fact that the houses were used only in summer, although appellant says one of them had double windows and was fit to live in during winter.\nThe learned trial judge has not accepted the views of any set of witnesses and has come to his judgment from a survey of the general evidence in the case.\nFollowing the same lines I cannot accept his conclusions as to the value of the land and would cut the allowance for latter down to one-half what has been allowed therefor, including such additional percentage as he has added to value he finds, and reduce the amount of the judgment to $26,540.\nI would therefore allow the appeal with costs and dismiss the cross-appeal with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Brodeur.\nJ. Brodeur:\u2014Il s'agit d'un appel d'un jugement de la Cour d'Echiquier accordant une somme de $47,080 pour l'expropriation d'un terrain appartenant \u00e0 l'Intim\u00e9 et dont le gouvernement avait besoin pour la construction d'une cale s\u00e8che \u00e0 Lauzon.\nCe terrain comprend 398,000 pieds et la Cour inf\u00e9rieure l'a \u00e9valu\u00e9 \u00e0 10 sous du pied. La Cour a accord\u00e9 en outre 10% pour l'expropriation forc\u00e9e (compulsory taking) et $3,000 pour les b\u00e2tisses \u00e9rig\u00e9es sur le terrain item. Il n'y a pas de difficult\u00e9 quant \u00e0 ce dernier item; il est reconnu que ce chiffre de $3,000 repr\u00e9sente la valeur de ces b\u00e2tisses.\nL'Intim\u00e9 Lariv\u00e9e n'est pas satisfait du montant accord\u00e9 pour la valeur du terrain lui-m\u00eame et il demande per un contre-appel 50 sous du pied au lieu des dix sous qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9s.\nCe terrain repr\u00e9sente une grande \u00e9tendue de terre et a \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9 il y a quelques ann\u00e9es par l'Intim\u00e9 pour une somme assez modique. Il est incontestable que depuis il y a eu augmentation dans la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en cet endroit. La preuve d\u00e9montre que des terres d'assez grande \u00e9tendue se sont vendues dans le voisinage pour \u00eatre subdivis\u00e9es en lots \u00e0 b\u00e2tir. L'Intim\u00e9 a prouv\u00e9 que ces lots \u00e0 b\u00e2tir s'\u00e9taient alors vendus jusqu'\u00e0 17 cents du pied. Mais l'honorable Juge de la Cour inf\u00e9rieure, et cela, je crois, avec raison, n'a pas voulu accepter ce prix de lots subdivis\u00e9s pour \u00e9tablir la valeur marchande de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'Intim\u00e9. Voici ce qu'il dit:\nA number of sales were referred to in the course of the trial, and deeds in respect of a number of these sales were also filed of record.\nWith a few exceptions, most of the sales have reference to small building lots which sales represent no similarity to the piece of land in question in this case, which is composed of 398,000 sq. ft., and therefore would be a very misleading guide to follow.\nHowever, from the evidence of promoters and real estate men heard as witnesses, it appears that large farms were bought, at Lauzon, not long before the expropriation, at three cents and four to five cents a foot when buying a large area; and, after passing through the usual process of promotion, by sale and re-sale to syndicates and companies at very large figures, compared with the original purchase price, these lands were afterwards placed upon the market and sold as small building lots at 14 and 17 cents a foot and perhaps more. It is not rational to use as apposite the value of these building lots, but it is the original sale for a large area that really offers similarity with the present case, and helps to reconcile and bridge the gap between the opinion evidence adduced by the plaintiff and the defendant respectively. Dans les circonstances, je crois que ces ventes en bloc constituent un meilleur guide pour d\u00e9terminer la valeur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'Intim\u00e9 que ces ventes de lots subdivis\u00e9s.\nD'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, la Couronne elle-m\u00eame offre un prix plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que celui pay\u00e9 pour les fermes mais moindre que celui pay\u00e9 pour les lots subdivis\u00e9s.\nL'Honorable Juge de la Cour inf\u00e9rieure a eu l'avantage d'entendre les t\u00e9moins et il dit:\nA fair and generous market price for the same would be about 8 to 10 cents a foot, and to make a very generous compensation I will make it ten cents a foot.\nJe comprends par cet extrait de son jugement qu'une somme de huit sous du pied serait une indemnit\u00e9 raisonnable. Je ne saurais, pour ma part, accepter le principe que ces indemnit\u00e9s doivent \u00eatre bas\u00e9es sur une tr\u00e8s grande g\u00e9n\u00e9rosit\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, je consid\u00e8re que nous devrions r\u00e9duire la compensation accord\u00e9e \u00e0 huit sous du pied.\nJe suis d'opinion que l'appel devrait \u00e9galement r\u00e9ussir pour les 10% additionnels accord\u00e9s par la Cour inf\u00e9rieure.\nL'Intim\u00e9 ne retirait qu'une somme de $285.00 de revenu par ann\u00e9e sur cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et il devrait s'estimer heureux de recevoir un capital de $34,840 qu'il pourrait placer facilement en bons de l'Etat ou autrement de mani\u00e8re qu'il retirerait de suite un revenu de pr\u00e8s de $2,000 par ann\u00e9e, c'est-\u00e0-dire pr\u00e8s de sept fois plus que ce qu'il a aujourd'hui.\nIl a \u00e9t\u00e9 question d'offres de $100,000 qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites \u00e0 l'Intim\u00e9 pour son terrain. L'une de ces offres aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par le t\u00e9moin Lagueux; une autre par un nomm\u00e9 L\u00e9gar\u00e9; et la derni\u00e8re par un nomm\u00e9 Couillard.\nM. Lagueux, dans son t\u00e9moignage, nous dit qu'il a fait ces offres en mai 1913 c'est-\u00e0-dire apr\u00e8s l'expropriation. Quant aux offres de Couillard et de L\u00e9gar\u00e9, elles sont rapport\u00e9es seulement par l'Intim\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame. Or, le t\u00e9moignage de ce dernier, qui est un homme \u00e2g\u00e9, a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 si peu satisfaisant que le juge a \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 d'en interrompre la transquestion. On ne devrait donc pas y attacher d'importance. Quant \u00e0 l'offre Couillard, il est incontestable que c'est apr\u00e8s l'expropriation.\nPour toutes ces raisons, l'appel devrait \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens de cette Cour et l'Intim\u00e9 devrait recevoir comme indemnit\u00e9\npour son terrain . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $31,840.00\npour ses b\u00e2tisses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3,000.00\nTotal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $34,840.00\nLe contre-appel devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nCross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Drouin & Amyot.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Galipeault, St. Laurent; Gagn\u00e9 & M\u00e9tayer.\n"

Y., residing in Ireland, through an agent in Calgary listed land there for sale with a real estate broker. An agreement by S. to purchase this land, signed by the broker for Y., provided for a part payment in cash to be forfeited to the vendor and the contract to be null and void if the balance was not paid in one year time to be of the essence of the contract. When the balance became due March 1914, S. went to the broker to complete the purchase but was told that the conveyance had to be sent to Ireland for execution and to return in six weeks which he did and found the situation the same Subsequent inquiries succeeded no better and in December 1914, he formally tendered the money to the broker and shortly after wrote to Y. at Belfast repudiating the agreement and demanding the return of the money paid under it. Receiving no reply, in January, 1915, he took an action for rescission and repayment of the money in which Y. by counterclaim asked for specific performance. In February Y. tendered a conveyance of the land to S.\nHeld, that while' no place was named in the agreement for completion of the purchase it was to take place at Calgary and as Y. was to prepare the conveyance it was her duty to have it there for delivery to S. at the appointed time.\nHeld, also, that the assent by S. to the request of the broker to wait after the time of completion for the conveyance could not be considered an agreement for extension nor evidence of an intention not to rescind.\nIn the agreement the address of the vendor was given as Belfast, Ireland, instead of Dublin where she lived and the vendee's letter of repudiation sent to Belfast was not delivered\nHeld, Fitzpatrick C.J. dissenting, that this and other circumstances absolved the vendee from the duty of giving notice fixing a reasonable time within which the purchase must be completed or the contract be at an end.\nHeld, per Anglin J.\u2014The stipulation in the agreement that \"time shall be the essence of this agreement\" was binding on both parties though the vendee alone was to be penalized for its non-observance. APPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1] reversing the judgment on the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe material facts of the case and the circumstances on which the issues depend will be found in the above head-note.\nGeo. H. Ross K.C. and Barron for the appellants.\nThe vendor was to prepare and tender the conveyance and her default as to this precludes her from setting up the vendee's default as to payment. Foster v. Anderson[2], per Anglin J. at p. 574.\nIn a contract such as this if either party make default specific performance will not be decreed. Steedman v. Drinkle[3], Brickies v. Snell[4].\nThe provision that time should be the essence of the agreement applies, to both parties. Foster v. Anderson[5].\nThe tender of the conveyance was too late to have effect. In re Head's Trustees[6].\nThe contract was to be carried out in Calgary and the vendor's duty was to be in a position to complete the purchase there. Tasker v. Bartlett[7], at p. 363.\nJ. A Ritchie and A. B. Mackay for the respondent. The broker had no authority to do more than procure a purchaser. See Bowstead on Agency (5th ed.) pp. 79 and 101.\nPlaintiffs by conduct waived the rights to claim that time was the essence of the agreement. See Drinkle v. Steedman[8], Macarthur v. Leckie[9], McDonald v. Garrett[10], at p. 611.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014The respondent is a married woman resident in Ireland; she had a brother, one Robinson, who, prior to the occurrence leading up to this action, was for some time in Calgary, engaged in the office of Messrs. Wilkinson & Boyes, real estate agents in that city. Probably through this brother of hers, though I do not think the fact appears from the record, Mrs. Young contracted for the purchase of the city lots in question in this suit; at any rate, he listed them for resale with Messrs. Wilkinson & Boyes. It was, of course, a speculative purchase.\nMr. Wilkinson approached the appellants who were then carrying on business as building contractors in Calgary and eventually effected a sale which was carried out by the agreement of the 8th of March, 1913. The appellants paid the $1,550 on the execution of the agreement to Wilkinson who applied it in payment of the balance of the purchase money still due to Mrs. Young's vendors. Robertson had by that time returned to England.\nOn or shortly before the 1st March, 1914, the date for completion of the purchase, the appellant, Simson, went to Wilkinson and offered to give him a cheque for the balance of the purchase money if he had the transfer there. Wilkinson replied that he had not got the transfer but would have to write to Ireland; he said he would make out a transfer and send it along, it would be back in five or six weeks. Simson returned in six weeks but Wilkinson said he had had no reply. Simson subsequently continued his inquiries of Wilkinson but always with the same result. On or about the 3rd December, 1914, Simson went with his solicitor to see Wilkinson and made a tender of the balance of the purchase money but Wilkinson was still without the transfer. Thereupon, on the 7th of the same month the appellant's solicitors wrote a letter to the respondent, formally repudiating the agreement and on the 15th January, 1915, the present action was begun. On the 15th February, 1915, the respondent's solicitor tendered a transfer of the property.\nThe judgment of the Appellate Court proceeds on the ground that the appellants were bound to communicate with the respondent personally before attempting to rescind. I do not think this can be supported; where a payment has to be made there is a distinction between the obligation in case the party to whom it is to be made is out of the country; thus in Viner's Abridgment, Tender, G. 4, we read:\u2014\nIf the obligee, etc., be out of the realm of England, the obligee, etc., is not bound to seek him or to go out of the realm unto him; and because the feoffee is the cause that the feoffor cannot tender the money, the feoffor shall enter into the land as if he had duly tendered it according to the condition. Co. Litt. f. 210 b.\nSee also Hale v. Patton[11], and Dockham v. Smith[12]. The rule of the civil law is, where, as in this case, the sale is of a definite ascertained thing on credit and the place of payment is not agreed upon by the contract, then the payment must be made at the place where the subject matter was at the time the contract was entered into. Arts. 1152 C.C. and 1533 C.C.\nThe vendor being out of the Dominion was, I think, bound to appoint someone to whom payment could be made.\nThat does not, however, dispose of the matter. The purchasers clearly waived the condition for com- pletion of the purchase on the date originally fixed. They were, as they themselves say, willing to complete at any time up to the first days of December, 1914; if they then came to the conclusion that the matter had been allowed to stand over long enough they were allowed to give notice of this to the vendor and name such reasonable time within which the purchase must be completed or, failing that, the contract be at an end. Yet immediately, that is on the 7th December, they gave notice to put an end to the contract. This I do not think they could do. If they had given a notice fixing such a date for completion as would allow of communication with the vendor in the meantime, then, if they had obtained no satisfaction by the appointed time, they would have been justified in withdrawing from the agreement; but they could not, after allowing the matter to remain open till December, suddenly demand immediate completion and on failure to obtain it put an end to the contract; this, of course, more especially under the circumstances when to their knowledge the vendor was residing in a distant country.\nIn the case of Taylor v. Brown[13], Lord Langdale M.R. said:\u2014\nThe question which has been discussed in this case is, whether the defendant remains under any obligation to perform the agreement. He says he does not, and that he has ceased to be under any obligation from the 13th of July, 1836. Now, as I have before stated, where the contract and the circumstances are such that time is not in this court considered to be of the essence of the contract\u2014in such case, if any unnecessary delay is created by one party the other has a right to limit a reasonable time within which the contract shall be perfected by the other. It has been repeatedly so considered in this court; and where the time has been thus fairly limited, by a notice stating that within such a period that which is required must be done or otherwise the contract will be treated as at an end, this court has very frequently supported that proceeding; and bills having been afterwards filed for the specific performance of the contract, this court has dismissed them with costs. The appellants not having attempted to give any notice, it is unnecessary to decide to whom notice could have been given under the circumstances. It is, however, to be noted that the whole transaction so far as the appellants were concerned was conducted on behalf of the vendor through Wilkinson. The vendor's brother, admittedly her agent, was in his office, listed the property for sale with him on his return to England and left with him instructions for carrying out the sale. Wilkinson received the first payment on account of the purchase money and applied it in payment of the purchase money due to Mrs. Young's vendors, completed her title and sent the certificate of title to Robertson, who, he supposes, turned it over to the respondent; he prepared the transfer to the appellants and sent it for Mrs. Young's execution. When the respondent did at last think of taking any steps in the matter it was to Messrs. Wilkinson & Boyes that her husband wrote on the 12th September \"to know why the appellants had not paid the balance of the purchase money.\" She had the reply which Mr. Wilkinson wrote to her husband stating that he had prepared and sent the transfer for her execution; that the money had been tendered to him when originally due and was available upon surrender of the transfer. It was not until the 15th February, 1915, that the tender of the transfer was made. The respondent at no time gave to the appellants or evidently to Mr. Wilkinson himself the slightest intimation that he was not authorized to act on her behalf in the matter. I do not think it can be doubted that he was so authorized and I do not think the respondent could under such circumstances he heard in any court to repudiate his authority.\nCertainly the position would have been very different if the appellants had given to Mr. Wilkinson notice calling for the completion of the purchase at a date within a reasonable time. They, however, gave no such notice either to the respondent or any one else on her behalf.\nIt is not without some regret that I arrive at these conclusions, because I think that the respondent was much to blame for the delay. She had had the agreement for a year and it provides that the transfer is to be prepared by the vendor. She is therefore not entitled to say, as she does in her affidavit, that Mr. Wilkinson's letter was the first intimation she had received of any transfer requiring execution by her. Moreover, it is common knowledge that a conveyance of some sort by a vendor is required on every sale of lands, more so in the United Kingdom than in this country. That she was really aware of this fact is shewn by her previous statement in the affidavit that\nshortly before the balance of the purchase money became payable under the said agreement, my husband wrote to my brother to remind him of the fact and to arrange that the sale should be completed.\nThough, as she says, repeated letters to her brother met with no response, the time for completion was allowed to go by and nothing was done until the 12th September, when her husband wrote to Mr. Wilkinson \"to know why the appellants had not paid the balance of the purchase money.\" Though Mr. Wilkinson's letter was received in October, 1914, it was not until the 15th February following that the transfer was tendered, within two weeks of a complete year from the date when it should have been ready.\nThe appellants under the circumstances could, I do-not doubt, have claimed damages for the delay. Damages can be recovered by a purchaser from his vendor for delay in completing the purchase occasioned by the vendor not having used reasonable diligence to perform his contract. Jones v. Gardiner[14]. The appellants, however, have treated the contract as at an end and I do not see therefore how they can recover anything.\nThe appeal should, I think, be allowed to the extent that the appellants are not liable to pay interest on the balance of the purchase money; but otherwise the judgment should be confirmed. There should be no costs of the appeal.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court for Alberta, directing, under the circumstances I am about to set forth, specific performance of an agreement to purchase some land in Calgary.\nThe respondent, who lived in Ireland, having an agreement for purchase of said land listed it for resale with one Wilkinson carrying on in Calgary the business of a real estate agent.\nHe sold it on her behalf to appellant for $3,150 of which $1,550 was paid him in cash and the balance with interest at 8% was to be paid a year later.\nThe agreement was reduced to writing dated 8th March, 1913, and executed in duplicate by appellants and said Wilkinson, who signed his own name, writing thereunder the words \"for Eileen Young.\"\nHe does not say whether or not he sent the duplicate copy he signed to respondent, or any one for her. He does say that the other two copies were sent to respondent in Dublin to have her execute them and that they were returned executed, \"and one was handed to Mr. Simson and one was sent to Dublin to Mrs. Young.\"\nSimson, the appellant, denies ever seeing such second copy and the learned trial judge seems sceptical of Wilkinson's recollection of the facts relative thereto. I agree with him in that regard without doubting in the slightest the integrity of Mr. Wilkinson who seems to have given his evidence fairly.\nThe execution or non-execution of such second agreement is not of the slightest consequence in my view, but the attendant circumstances are of some value.\nThe respondent was described in the first writing as of Belfast, Ireland, but how in the second we know not.\nIf she saw herself so described and it was not according to the fact, how did she come to sign such a misleading document?\nAnd if \"one was sent to Dublin to Mrs. Young\" how could she imagine, or her husband imagine, that a transfer was not required?\nThe document is not a long one and has plainly written therein that she was to have a transfer prepared.\nPassing these curious incidents the appellant Simson went with the money to meet the second and last payment, to Wilkinson's office, either on the 1st March, 1914, when it was due, or the day before, and offered to pay him same.\nHe replied that he had not the transfer and preferred Simson to keep the money till it arrived, and assured him there would be no interest running upon the money in the meantime.\nHe mentioned to Simson that he had sent a transfer for execution. Indeed Simson seems to think he mentioned doing this twice, but Wilkinson only speaks of sending it once, about two weeks before the money was due.\nHe further says that that was sent to Robinson, a brother of respondent who had, whilst in Calgary, been her agent in listing the land with him (Wilkinson) and was the medium of the communication through whom the terms of sale had been settled by a cabling of messages that passed in the first few days of March, 1913, before Wilkinson signed the agreement.\nRobinson seemed indifferent for some reason or other that remains unexplained.\nAppellants were remarkably persistent and patient in waiting for the transfer and jogging Wilkinson's memory.\nOn the 13th October, 1913, Wilkinson wrote the husband of respondent at Dublin, Ireland, explaining what had transpired as above stated and urging a return of transfer duly executed.\nRespondent tells in her affidavit that the letter was received on the 28th October, 1914. One would have supposed that it should, under the circumstances, have occurred to respondent or her husband to go to a solicitor or notary in Dublin and get him to draw up a transfer, get it executed and returned forthwith to Calgary, or at all events to acknowledge the receipt of the letter and explained or given excuse for the delay. Nothing of the kind happened.\nAfter twelve days wasted in some useless and fruitless inquiries as to Robinson (which ended nowhere that we are told of) it occurred to respondent's husband to write solicitors in London to act on her behalf with a view to the completion of the sale. And they, on the 13th January, 1915, sent her a duplicate transfer which she actually executed before a notary public on the next day.\nWhen or how that was sent to America is not explained but evidently, if Wilkinson is correct, in March or April following he had a letter from respondent. Nor is there any explanation of why it took from the 7th of November till the 13th of January for London solicitors to prepare a transfer for which less than an hour's labour is needed.\nMeantime appellants' wonderful stock of patience had become exhausted and they consulted a solicitor in the beginning of December, 1914, who seems to have advised and brought about a tendering of the money to Wilkinson who could do nothing. He says, speaking of things at that stage \"I am quite well satisfied that if the title was there they would have paid.\"\nThe solicitors prepared and, on the 7th December, 1914, on behalf of appellants, mailed a letter to respondent repudiating the contract on account of her failure to deliver title, although appellants had repeatedly tendered the money and demanded the same. They, by same letter, demanded a return of the money already paid and of the taxes which they, the appellants, had paid as the agreement bound them.\nCopies of that were mailed to respondent and to Wilkinson but brought no response. Wilkinson got his but evidently, by reason of the respondent's treatment of his appeals to her husband and brother, could do nothing.\nRespondent's copy had been addressed to Belfast which, according to the agreement, was quite proper and was returned as uncalled for.\nThe appellants, after a six weeks' wait, instituted an action on the 15th January, 1915, for recovery of the moneys paid and so demanded to be returned.\nThe service of that on respondent on the 1st of February, 1915, seems to have prompted some response.\nThe defence to the declaration consists of a denial of its allegations and an averment of willingness and readiness at all times to fulfil the contract, followed by a counterclaim asking for specific performance of the agreement. This the court below, has, as stated above, granted.\nThe question raised thereby is whether or not a remedy which cannot be got by a suitor seeking relief to use the oft-quoted language of Lord Alvanley M.R., \"unless he has shewn himself ready, desirous, prompt and eager\" is open to one conducting her business in the manner of respondent.\nI cannot think so. And when we examine the agreement and consider the duties cast thereby in express terms upon respondent to observe same, there is no excuse which is presented that should avail her in seeking to enforce such a remedy.\nThe agreement specifically provides that the \"transfer shall be prepared by the vendor at the expense of the purchaser.\"\nThe appellants were entitled to have that ready for delivery in Calgary (and not in Ireland) to them upon payment of the balance of the purchase money.\nThe case does not permit of giving effect to the side issues raised, as excuses for the gross failure on respondent's part.\nThe defence alleging readiness is unfounded in fact.\nThe suggestion that appellants knew they were contracting with a vendee in Ireland loses all its force when the fact that Wilkinson (her local agent) seemed to be so held out by the vendee as possessing the power to receive about half of the purchase money and apply it in the way he did which was far beyond the usual power of a mere real estate broker.\nThe presumption was that he would be continued and be duly authorized, or armed, when the time came, with an effective transfer, ready to complete the sale when the time came.\nBe all that as it may, I have no doubt the vendee, under such circumstances, is not bound to go either to Ireland or China to present the payment and demand the transfer in any case. I confess I have been unable to find any decisions expressly dealing with such a situation and am not surprised at the absence of an illustration on the part of any suitor.\nThe general principles of law governing the respective duties and rights of debtor and creditor do not indicate such contention as maintainable in any ordinary case, much less in a case dependent upon the application of the principles governing cases of specific performance.\nAgain the express language of the agreement provides as follows:\u2014\nTime is to be considered as the essence of this agreement, and unless the payments are punctually made at all times and in the manner above mentioned, these presents shall be null and void and of no effect and all moneys paid thereon shall be absolutely forfeited to the vendor, and the vendor shall be at liberty to peaceably re-enter upon and resell the said land, together with all the buildings thereon, without notice to the purchasers, and purchasers covenant not to remove any buildings whatsoever that may be erected on said land.\nI construe this clause as making time the essence of the agreement.\nThe subsequent part of the clause after the word \"agreement\" probably was intended for another sentence, but however that may be it in no way impairs the force of the express language declaring that\ntime is to be considered the essence of this agreement.\nIt is further to be observed that there was only one payment to be made and that the transfer was to be ready to deliver contemporaneously with that payment and impliedly thus bound the vendor to observe the necessity of being ready, otherwise the vendee could not safely pay.\nIn that view the decisions of the court above in the case of Brickles v. Snell[15], and Steedman v. Drinkle[16], seem to put an end to the contentions set up herein by first depriving the party in default, in a time of the essence agreement, of any right to specific performance and in the next place by giving the right to the purchaser to recover the moneys paid on account of the purchase.\nThe suggestion that appellants, by listening to the appeal of the agent of the respondent to await return of the transfer sent for execution, waived this provision or any right under the agreement, does not seem to me entitled to any very serious consideration.\nThey did nothing and said nothing and merely acted the part of unusually fair minded men desirous of avoiding litigation or appearance of sharp practice or attempting to evade their obligations. All they did or submitted to was conditional and limited to the time needed to get a reply to the letter which they were assured had gone forward with a transfer to be filled up and executed.\nSee the decision of Jessel M.R. in Barclay v. Messenger[17], holding that an express enlargement of the time was not, unless fulfilled, a waiver.\nThe case sometimes does arise where the vendee or vendor, as the case might be, has entered into a more or less complicated arrangement for carrying out the completion of a sale and very properly have been held estopped thereby from breaking off abruptly the due execution of the mutual arrangement and falling back upon time being of the essence unless they gave due notice of such intention.\nThen they would be required to fix a term or specify that within a reasonable time they would do thus and so as the agreement entitled them.\nThe peculiarly amusing feature of this case is the argument in respondent's factum which disclaims Wilkinson as an agent of respondent and then falls back upon what happened between appellants and this man on the street or off the street when destitute of any sort of authority to represent the respondent.\nHow can she avail herself of anything passing between strangers? I am not at all sure, though coming from the respondent in support of her claim it is absurd, but that the facts, if fully investigated, would have borne out the suggestion that Wilkinson had no standing as representative of anybody. Assuredly appellants assumed they were dealing with one respondent had held out as her agent.\nThen alternatively I am of the opinion that even if there is no effect to be given the clause as to time being the essence of the agreement, yet on general principles by the failure of the vendor to prepare and tender within a reasonable time the transfer she was to have prepared, she has lost her right to specific performance, especially under the conditions of a speculative market such as had developed in Calgary.\nShe seemed to have had no regard for others, or consideration for the situation, however cruel it might have been, in which her conduct for nearly a year might have placed the vendees.\nIt is no answer to say that in this instance as things turned out it might not have made much difference to appellants. Not even they can perhaps yet guess whether or not, had the respondent's transfer been got on 1st March, 1914, the result would have been better for them or otherwise.\nThe question is whether or not a vendor, situate as respondent was, is entitled by law to treat vendees, situate as these appellants were, in relation to the bargain in question, as she has done and still claim specific performance.\nI submit with some confidence she is not, even if time had not been of the essence of the contract, but much more so when she insisted on having so rigourous a term imposed upon the vendees under circumstances which could only relate to one payment when her transfer was to be ready for delivery.\nI have treated the case thus far as relative to the validity of the judgment for specific performance. I think not only is that the true test of the right to appeal, and succeed in such an appeal, but also incidentally a good test of the appellant's right to treat the contract as rescinded, as they did in repudiating it and bringing this action.\nIf the situation created by respondent's conduct is such a breach of the contract as to disentitle her to specific performance thereof, then, if not before, she becomes clearly liable at common law for the breach of the contract in failing to have the transfer ready for delivery at the time named and to repay the money paid her or paid on faith of her contract, as to meet the tax bills, for example.\nShe has no answer to such a claim unless in equity of which the right of specific performance is the test.\nThus, I submit, rescission with all its incidents is in the net result of the operation of law and equity but the counterpart as it were, to the claim for specific performance.\nSuch, I submit, is the net result of the latest development of the law as exemplified in the cases I have cited above.\nThe counsel for respondent claimed that the mistake in the agreement in describing the respondent as of Belfast which evidently misled appellants in address- ing the notice of renunciation to her there, could have been rectified by an inspection of the transfer to her of the land in question in the registry office. And he seems to have tendered a certificate of title to prove this, but it does not appear in the printed case and I am assured by the officer in charge of the exhibits that no such document is on file.\nIn my view of the law governing the rights of the parties to the agreement, the result cannot be affected by the mistake, but if anything could be expected to flow from the possibility of the registry being inspected, proof should have been given of the fact.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiffs sue for the rescission of a contract to purchase some building lots in Calgary because of the vendor's default in making ready to complete the contract on the date fixed by it and for many months thereafter. The defendant resists that action and counterclaims for specific performance, alleging in excuse of her own default that the plaintiffs did not apprise her of their readiness to carry out their purchase and pay the balance of their purchase money.\nThe trial judge granted rescission, holding that the plaintiffs had done all that could reasonably be expected of them and that the defendant was clearly and inexcusably in default. The Appellate Division reversed this judgment on the ground that the plaintiffs had failed to make reasonable efforts to inform the defendant of their readiness to complete, that her duty to convey would have arisen only when they had done so, and that she had always been ready, eager and wiling to carry out her contract. I would add to the statement of the material facts given in the opinion of Mr. Justice Stuart[18], merely that the agreement provided that the transfer or conveyance should be prepared by the vendor at the expense of the purchasers and should be delivered to the latter \"immediately\" upon payment of the second and final instalment of their purchase money. If not overlooked, these two features of the contract would seem not to have been given the weight to which they are entitled in the Appellate Division.\nMoreover, between the 1st of March, 1914, the date fixed by the contract for closing the sale, and the 15th of January, 1915, when this action was begun, there had been a most material change in the desirability of the property and in the position of the plaintiffs. They were a firm of builders and required the land for use, at first as a stone cutting yard, and eventually as a site for an apartment block which they proposed to erect. After March, 1914, building ceased in Calgary and the plaintiffs had no further use for the land. They dissolved partnership shortly afterwards. War began in August, 1914. At the date of the trial (April, 1916) one of the former partners had enlisted for service overseas and the other was residing in Scotland. It is obvious that to compel the plaintiffs now to take and pay for the property would entail upon them substantial hardship, although probably not such as would in itself have afforded a defence to an action for specific performance (Fry, on Specific Performance, 5th ed., pars. 418-9, 426-7; 27 Hals. Laws of England, Nos. 61 and 65) had the defendant been entirely free from fault\u2014had she done everything that could reasonably be expected of her towards carrying out her contractual obligation and enabling the plaintiffs to fulfil theirs. Yet the hardship, such as it is, is a circumstance that may be taken into account in so far as the granting or withholding of specific performance may be in the discretion of the court. Harris v. Robinson[19], Colcock v. Butler[20], at pages 313-4; Fry, at page 19.\nNotwithstanding that the provision of the contract that \"time shall be of the essence of this agreement\" is followed by a statement of the consequences of default by the purchasers, I am not disposed to accept the view that it should therefore be held to apply only to the purchasers' obligation. I prefer to give to the words \"of this agreement\" their literal and natural meaning covering the contractual undertakings of both parties, and to assume that the silence of the contract as to the consequences of default by the vendor merely indicates an intention that they should be such as the law imposes. Foster v. Anderson[21], Seaton v. Mapp[22].\nIt is contended however that the plaintiffs by their visits to and inquiries of Wilkinson, notwithstanding his lack of authority to represent the defendant, manifested an intention not to rescind because of her un-readiness to complete punctually on the 1st of March, 1914, with the result that the contract should be treated as if the condition as to time being of its essence were eliminated from it. Kilmer v. British Columbia Orchard Lands[23], as explained in Steedman v. Drinkle[24], at pages 279-80. The case at bar differs from the Kilmer Case23, however, in that there was in that case a definite extension of time by agreement\u2014a new contract as to the time of performance (Goss v. Lord Nugent[25], at pages 64-5; Earl Darnley v. London, Chatham and Dover Railway Co.[26], at page 60, discussed in Ewart on Waiver Distributed, at pages 133-6; see, however, Morrell v. Studd and Millington[27]), in which the stipulation making time of the essence was held not to apply. Here there was no alteration by express contract of the time fixed for performance, and under the circumstances, I think a parol agreement for an extension should not be implied from the conduct of the parties, as it was in the Morrell Case27.\nBut it is said there was an election by the purchasers not to rescind their contract for the vendor's default but to continue it in force and that the right to take advantage of the stipulation as to time being of the essence having been thus relinquished, that term was in effect eliminated. Whether there could be such an election binding upon the purchasers without communication of it to the vendor; (Scarf v. Jardine[28], at pages 360-1; see discussion by Mr. Ewart in his Treatise on Waiver Distributed, at pages 88 and seq.); whether the letter from Wilkinson to the vendor's husband of the 13th of October should be regarded as such a communication; whether there was not a mere waiting or a suspension by the purchasers, when they found themselves unable to make a tender for their purchase money and were probably in uncertainty as to their legal position, of an exercise of their rights; (Clough v. London & North Western Rly[29], at page 34; Moel Ship Co. v. Weir[30]), but unequivocal conduct evidencing an election to treat the contract as unaffected by the vendor's default, are interesting questions upon which I find it unnecessary to express a definite opinion in this case. While strongly inclined to think that an election not to insist upon the right to terminate the contract for the vendor's default is not sufficiently established, I shall proceed on the assumption that it is.\nAs Mr. Justice Stuart has well said:\nThe whole dispute has arisen on account of a considerable delay on the part of the defendant in furnishing to the purchasers the title as agreed at the time agreed.\nThe chief issue is as to where responsibility for that delay should rest.\nUpon the facts in evidence I entertain no doubt whatever that the failure to carry out the contract on the date fixed and for many months thereafter is entirely attributable to the neglect of the defendant, resident abroad, to provide for the fulfilment of her obligation to be in readiness to convey at the date fixed for closing by either coming herself to Calgary or nominating a representative there clothed with the necessary authority to receive the purchase money and to deliver a transfer, and furnished with the means of carrying out his mandate and notifying the purchasers of such appointment, and in having allowed the mistake of an agent, whose acts she adopted, in misstating her address in the agreement of sale (Belfast instead of Dublin) to remain unrectified. Indeed in the peculiar circumstances of this case, had the vendor's address been correctly given, I gravely doubt that it would have been incumbent on the plaintiffs to seek her out and notify her that they were prepared to make payment before she would be required to put herself in readiness to deliver to them the transfer to which they would be entitled \"immediately\" upon payment.\nWith respect, I fail to find in the record evidence warranting the view expressed in the Appellate Division and said to be \"the turning point of the case\" that, when the plaintiffs \"really wanted to find her (the defendant) they were quite able to do so.\" On the 7th of December, 1914, they mailed a letter addressed to her at Belfast, Ireland\u2014the address given in the contract, and there is nothing to shew that in doing so they did not act in perfect good faith. How their solicitors learned in January, 1915, that her correct address was Dublin does not appear. It may be surmised that they discovered it by examining the transfer to her registered in the Land Titles Office. The fact that they did so scarcely warrants the assumption that the plaintiffs themselves could readily have ascertained the correct address months before, or that they were remiss in having failed to do so. I rather agree with the learned trial judge that the purchasers \"acted in good faith\" and tried to \"locate * * * the vendor and failed.\"\nMoreover, the defendant was apprised by Wilkinson's letter of the 13th October, 1914, received by her on the 28th, that the purchasers had \"tendered money against documents\" to him on or prior to the 1st of March. (Incidentally it may be remarked that this shews the understanding of the man who prepared the agreement of the purchasers\" conception of their rights and their attitude.) Yet no tender of a transfer was made to them until the 15th of February, 1915\u2014a month after this action was begun, a fortnight after the service of the statement of claim on the defendant, and eleven and a half months after the date fixed by the agreement for completion. Nor was there any communication before the 15th of February, 1915, to the purchasers of their vendor's intention to carry out her contract. The delay from the 28th of October to the 15th of February was, under the circumstances, in my opinion unreasonable, making every proper allowance for difficulties of communication.\nThe obligation of the purchasers to pay and that of the vendor to deliver a transfer were to be performed at the same time. They were dependent undertakings. The circumstance of the vendor's residence abroad as well as the form of the contract make it clear that the consideration moving each party was performance by the other and not a mere promise. The purchasers looked to obtaining the actual transfer of the land on payment and not merely a remedy more or less adequate against their vendor. A vendor seeking to enforce liability upon the purchasers' obligation under such a contract must shew punctual performance or an offer to perform his own undertaking although it be not certain that he was obliged to do the first act. 1 Wm's. Saunders (1871 ed.) 566. In addition to cases there cited reference may be had to Large v. Cheshire[31], and Marsden v. Moore[32]. Especially is this so where the remedy sought is specific performance. The plaintiff must shew that he was \"ready and prompt\" as well as \"desirous and eager.\" Millward v. Earl Thanet[33]; Mills v. Haywood[34], at page 202; Wallace v. Hesslein[35], at page 174; Fry (5th ed.), 457.\nEven if, upon a construction of the contract most favourable to her, the vendor,' had she been present in Calgary personally or by agent, might have been entitled to defer having the transfer prepared until actual payment or tender of the balance of the purchase money, and, by delivering it on the same or the following day or even within a day or two thereafter might have met the requirement that delivery of it should be made \"immediately\" upon payment, the agreement certainly did not contemplate that the purchasers should, after paying their purchase money, be obliged to wait for their transfer until it could be obtained from Ireland, remaining for a month or longer without title and with a right of action against a \"foreigner\" as their only security.\nIn my opinion the place of performance of this contract, no other being stipulated in it, was at Calgary. The ordinary rule of English law that a promisor is bound to seek his promisee, if ever applicable to a case where there are mutual obligations to be fulfilled concurrently, only governs\nwhere no place of performance is specified either expressly or by implication from the nature and terms of the contract and the surrounding circumstances.\u20147 Halsbury, Nos. 857-8.\nHere all these circumstances as well as the nature and the terms of the contract furnish unmistakable indicia that the intention of the parties was that performance should take place at Calgary. The contract was entered into there. Weyand v. Park Terrace Co. [36]. In making it the vendor acted through an agent resident there. It concerned land there. The transfer was to be delivered immediately upon payment of the balance of the purchase money. Title would pass to the purchasers only on the registration of the transfer in the Registry Office there. (6 Edw. VII. ch. 24, sec. 41.) Mr. Justice Stuart, who spoke for the Appellate Division, seemed inclined to the opinion that the purchasers were entitled to have the actual delivery of the transfer and payment of their purchase money take place contemporaneously in the Registry Office itself, citing Hogg on \"Ownership and Incumbrance of Registered Land\" at page 187. In view of the provisions of the \"Land Titles Act\" already adverted to, not a little may be said for that view (see Williams on Vendor and Purchaser (2nd ed.) 1186)\u2014but it is unnecessary to determine the point in the present case. Yet, although of the opinion that\nthe purchasers were not bound to go to Ireland and pay her (the vendor) the money there\nand that\nthe Land Titles Office at Calgary was the only place where they could safely part with their money,\nthat learned judge thought they were\nbound to communicate with her and notify her that they were ready and that if she did not produce title within a reasonable time the agreement would be repudiated.\nIn the first place the presence of the vendor in person or by authorized agent at Calgary being necessary for the fulfilment of the purchasers' duty to pay or tender their purchase money (if to do so should be regarded as a condition of the vendor's obligation to put herself in readiness to transfer the land), its performance would be excused by her absence. Comyn's Digest, \"Condition,\" L. 5. The giving notice of intention to rescind if completion should be delayed beyond a named reasonable time having likewise been made impracticable by the act of the vendor's agent in stating a wrong address in the agreement (the only information the purchasers had) and her subsequent neglect to rectify that error, she cannot insist on that condition of the right of rescission, ordinarily applicable where time is not of the essence originally or has ceased to be so. A notice addressed to her at Belfast would in fact have been futile, as is proved by the return of letters sent to that address. Although the purchasers did not know that it would have been so, the vendor cannot complain because they did not attempt to give her a notice there. Lex neminem cogit ad vana seu inutilia. The giving of notice of intention to rescind having been thus rendered impossible through the fault of the vendor, the purchasers were not bound to wait indefinitely for her to fulfil her contract.\nHaving regard to all the circumstances, the nature of the contract, its terms, the failure of the vendor to put herself in readiness to carry out her obligation, the fact that time was originally of the essence and probably remained so, and if not, that notice of intention to rescind unless the contract should be completed within reasonable time could not be given owing to fault ascribable to the vendor, that her delay both before and after she became aware of the purchasers' readiness to complete was gross and inexcusable, and that if obliged to take and pay for the property now the purchasers would be subjected to great hardship\u2014I am, with respect, of the opinion that this is not a case for specific performance and that the right to rescission has been established. No doubt the granting of rescission does not ensue as of course because the relief of specific performance is denied; Gough v. Bench [37]. The circumstances sometimes make it proper to leave the parties to their common law remedies. But if, as seems probable, time continued to be of the essence of the contract, the plaintiffs' right to rescission is unquestionable. If, on the other hand, time ceased to be of the essence of the contract, having regard to the circumstances, I think the purchasers are entitled to be placed in the same position as if they had duly given notice of intention to rescind should the vendor fail to deliver a transfer within a named reasonable time. Since they have paid a substantial sum on account of purchase money, recovery of which they would otherwise be obliged to seek by way of damages, and are themselves free from blame, equity and an application of the maxim ut sit finis litium, alike require that rescission and the return of the money paid on account of the purchase price, and for taxes should be decreed.\nThe circumstances, however, are not such as warrant a judgment for damages beyond the return of the money paid with interest. Indeed with rescission the plaintiffs are probably better off than they would have been had the defendant carried out her contract.\nThe judgment of the learned trial judge should be restored and the appellants should have their costs in this court and in the Appellate Division.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The appellants should succeed. They have done all in their power to carry out the agreement in question and to complete the sale. On the other hand, the respondent was too late to claim specific performance, since the purchaser had then rescinded the contract.\nFor reasons given by my brother Idington, I would allow the appeal with costs of this court and of the Appellate Division and I would restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 10 Alta.

Lafleur K.C. and Cr\u00e9peau K.C. for the appellant.\nSt. Germain K.C. for the respondent.\nLe Juge en Chef:\u2014Dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, appel est interjet\u00e9 d'un jugement rendu par la cour du Banc du Roi de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. L'action que l'Intim\u00e9e avait intent\u00e9e en recouvrement de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour r\u00e9paration du pr\u00e9judice que la mort de son mari lui a caus\u00e9, fut renvoy\u00e9e par le tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance. La Cour de revision infirma ce jugement; mais sa d\u00e9cision fut modifi\u00e9e par la cour du Banc du Roi, et c'est de ce dernier jugement qu'il est fait appel.\nLa preuve a bien \u00e9tabli que le d\u00e9funt \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'emploi de l'appelant comme sous-contremaitre au moment o\u00f9 il fut tu\u00e9, et il est \u00e9galement admis que sa mort fut caus\u00e9e par la plate-forme d'un monte-charge dont l'appelant se servait pour ex\u00e9cuter les travaux auxquels le d\u00e9funt \u00e9tait employ\u00e9.\nLe seul fait que cette mort a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e par une chose inanim\u00e9e sous la garde de l'appelant cr\u00e9e une pr\u00e9somption de faute \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de celui-ci, gardien de cette chose (art. 1054 C.C. par. 1). En d'autres termes, il suffit que la demanderesse prouve que l'accident a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 de la mani\u00e8re all\u00e9gu\u00e9e, pour que le gardien de l'objet en question devienne de plein droit responsable. Il n'\u00e9chappe \u00e0 cette responsabilit\u00e9 que s'il peut prouver que le fait g\u00e9n\u00e9rateur du dommage provient d'une cause qui lui est \u00e9trang\u00e8re. La jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise est formelle l\u00e0-dessus, et les juristes les plus autoris\u00e9s ont \u00e9nonc\u00e9 ce principe de droit avec une pr\u00e9cision qui ne laisse aucun doute:\nDans le cas d'un accident caus\u00e9 par un objet inanim\u00e9, aujourd'hui la jurisprudence fran\u00e7aise consid\u00e8re que l'article 1384 (qui correspond \u00e0 l'article 1054 plus haut cit\u00e9) cr\u00e9e une pr\u00e9somption de faute \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du gardien de cette chose inanim\u00e9e et, en cons\u00e9quence, elle fait peser sur lui la charge de la preuve. Il ne suffira pas au d\u00e9fendeur d'\u00e9tablir qu'il n'a commis aucune n\u00e9gligence, ni imprudence, il devra prouver que le dommage provient du cas fortuit, soit de la force majeure, soit de toute autre cause \u00e9trang\u00e8re\u2014v.g. de la faute de la victime ou de celle d'un tiers, en un mot, il faudra qu'il pr\u00e9cise le fait g\u00e9n\u00e9rateur du dommage subi par son adversaire.\nD.P. 1908. 1. 217.\nD.P. 1909. 1. 73\u2014Note de Planiol.\nS. 1910. 1. 17\u2014Note d'Esmein.\nS. 1913. 2. 257.\nD.P. 1913. 2. 80.\nS. 1913. 2. 164.\nGaz.

Sous l'article 1053, point de responsabilit\u00e9 sans preuve d'une faute personnelle du d\u00e9fendeur et d'un dommage en r\u00e9sultant; sous 1054, responsabilit\u00e9 d'un dommage caus\u00e9 par une chose ou sans faute de son gardien ou par une faute inconnue au demandeur en indemnit\u00e9, mais pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e contre le gardien, celui qui en avait la garde.\nL'article 1054 ne serait qu'une r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de 1053 s'il exigeait la preuve d'une faute. Or, les codificateurs n'ont pas voulu dire deux fois la m\u00eame chose, pourvoir deux fois aux m\u00eames cas. C'est pour ajouter \u00e0 1053, non pour le r\u00e9p\u00e9ter, qu'ils ont \u00e9dict\u00e9 1054. Et n'appliquer 1054 qu'au cas d'une faute par celui qui a la garde d'une chose, c'est lui faire r\u00e9p\u00e9ter 1053. En d'autres mots, ce n'est que parce que 1053 ne couvre pas le cas d'un dommage caus\u00e9 par une chose sans faute prouv\u00e9e que 1054 a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire. L\u00e0 o\u00f9 il y a faute, cadit questio; 1054 est alors inutile, n'a pas d'application; le dommage caus\u00e9 par la faute d'une personne n'est pas un dommage caus\u00e9 par une chose dans le sens de l'article. Les codificateurs l'ont dit, et ils sont juridiquement cens\u00e9s avoir voulu dire ce qu'ils ont dit: \"Toute personne est responsable du dommage caus\u00e9 par les choses qu'elle a sous sa garde.\" Pouvaient-ils s'exprimer en termes plus explicites?\nS'obstiner \u00e0 ignorer ce que le l\u00e9gislateur a dit pour \u00e9tayer des controverses doctrinales sur ce qu'il a voulu ou n'a pas voulu dire conduit infailliblement \u00e0 l'h\u00e9r\u00e9sie. A la page 10 de ce m\u00e9morandum, Sir Elz\u00e9ar Taschereau insiste de nouveau sur le fait qu'il y a faute pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e:\nR\u00e9sumons.\u2014La responsabilit\u00e9 du dommage caus\u00e9 par une chose sous l'article 1054 est fond\u00e9e sur une faute de la personne qui en avait la garde, mais cette faute est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e, et le demandeur en indemnit\u00e9 n'a pas \u00e0 la prouver.\nCons\u00e9quemment, il n'a, par exemple, qu'\u00e0 prouver ses dommages et le fait qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9s par une chose alors sous la garde du d\u00e9fendeur pour obtenir jugement quand le d\u00e9fendeur ne comparait pas, ou pour le mettre sur la d\u00e9fensive s'il a comparu.\nPrenant donc pour acquis que telle est la loi qui d\u00e9termine la responsabilit\u00e9 dans le cas d'un accident caus\u00e9, comme celui-ci, par un objet inanim\u00e9 manifestement sous le contr\u00f4le ou la garde du d\u00e9fendeur ou de ses employ\u00e9s, le seul fait qu'il est survenu un accident cr\u00e9e de plein droit la pr\u00e9somption de faute et le chef d'entreprise, en cette seule qualit\u00e9, est responsable des cons\u00e9quences qui en r\u00e9sultent. Dans la cause qui nous est soumise, nous n'avons en cons\u00e9quence qu'\u00e0 nous demander si l'appelant propri\u00e9taire a fait la preuve qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas responsable du fait g\u00e9n\u00e9rateur du dommage.\nExaminons la preuve au dossier. La compagnie appelante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9e de la construction d'un \u00e9difice \u00e0 l'angle des rues Ste-Catherine et Peel, dans la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. A chaque \u00e9tage de l'\u00e9difice en construction, elle avait plac\u00e9 un contrema\u00eetre pour y conduire les travaux et y exercer une surveillance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. L'\u00e9difice comptait en tout dix \u00e9tages, et le d\u00e9funt \u00e9tait employ\u00e9 comme contrema\u00eetre au quatri\u00e8me.\nPour \u00e9lever les mat\u00e9riaux \u00e0 la hauteur o\u00f9 ils devaient \u00eatre employ\u00e9s, la compagnie appelante se servait de monte-charge. A chaque extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 du corps principal de l'\u00e9difice, qui donnait sur la rue Ste-Catherine, une aile s'\u00e9tendait vers le nord. Entre ces deux ailes se trouvait un espace vide (well) dans lequel on avait install\u00e9 quatre monte-charge. Les deux les plus rapproch\u00e9s du corps principal \u00e9taient mus par la vapeur, et les deux autres par l'\u00e9lectricit\u00e9. L'accident a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par un des monte-charge \u00e9lectriques.\nCes monte-charge fonctionnaient dans une charpente \u00e0 jour et, \u00e0 chaque \u00e9tage, une passerelle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e dans une des fen\u00eatres des ailes pour y donner acc\u00e8s. L'entr\u00e9e en \u00e9tait prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par une pi\u00e8ce de bois mobile et, en sus, par un madrier solidement clou\u00e9 aux montants de la charpente en travers de l'ouverture, \u00e0 environ cinq pieds de hauteur du plancher de la passerelle.\nLe moteur \u00e9lectrique, au rez-de-chauss\u00e9, \u00e9tait sous la garde d'un m\u00e9canicien. Il est m\u00eame dit dans la preuve que ce m\u00e9canicien avait soin des quatre monte-charge. Mais \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le principe sur lequel je m'appuie pour juger cette cause, il n'y a pas lieu de faire plus que de mentionner ce fait. Les cables de traction \u00e9taient fix\u00e9s \u00e0 deux tambours au rez-de-chauss\u00e9e et actionn\u00e9s par le moteur \u00e9lectrique. Des marques de peinture blanche le long des cables servaient \u00e0 indiquer \u00e0 quel \u00e9tage se trouvait le monte-charge apr\u00e8s avoir quitt\u00e9 le rez-de-chauss\u00e9e. Lorsque le monte-charge \u00e9tait requis \u00e0 un certain \u00e9tage, le m\u00e9canicien en \u00e9tait averti par une sonnerie \u00e9lectrique. Voici, d'ailleurs, comment on explique, dans le factum des appelants, le syst\u00e8me de signaux que la compagnie avait adopt\u00e9 pour avertir le m\u00e9canicien Wood:\u2014Sur le montant de la charpente, \u00e0 la gauche de l'ouverture donnant acc\u00e8s au monte-charge, se trouvait un bouton de sonnerie electrique. En pressant ce bouton, on faisait sonner une cloche plac\u00e9e tout pr\u00e8s du poste du m\u00e9canicien au rez-de-chauss\u00e9e.\nDe plus, personne n'avait le droit de donner un signal pour faire mettre le monte-charge en mouvement, \u00e0 moins d'\u00eatre \u00e0 l'\u00e9tage o\u00f9 il stationnait \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. Cette r\u00e8gle ne souffrait d'exception que lorsque le monte-charge stationnait au rez-de-chauss\u00e9e. En cons\u00e9quence, si un homme au quatri\u00e8me \u00e9tage avait besoin du monte-charge stationnant\u2014disons au troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tage\u2014il lui fallait descendre \u00e0 cet \u00e9tage pour donner le signal voulu, ou bien demander \u00e0 quelqu'un alors au troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tage de donner ce signal \u00e0 sa place. Les instructions \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s formelles, et avaient pour but d'emp\u00eacher que le monte-charge ne quitt\u00e2t l'\u00e9tage o\u00f9 il stationnait, si ce n'est sur le signal d'une personne se trouvant sur le m\u00eame \u00e9tage.\nJ'appuie tout particuli\u00e8rement sur ce point des r\u00e8glements qui r\u00e9gissaient la manoeuvre du monte-charge, parce que, selon moi, l'accident provient de ce que le contrema\u00eetre Rice a cri\u00e9, du neuvi\u00e8me \u00e9tage, \u00e0 Robillard qui travaillait au quatri\u00e8me, pour lui demander le monte-charge avant qu'il e\u00fbt atteint le quatri\u00e8me.\nApr\u00e8s avoir donn\u00e9 \u00e0 toute la preuve l'\u00e9tude attentive que n\u00e9cessitent les jugements contradictoires des cours inf\u00e9rieures, j'en suis arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que le syst\u00e8me que le compagnie avait adopt\u00e9 pour la manoeuvre du monte-charge e\u00fbt comport\u00e9 assez de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pour les employ\u00e9s, si toutes les instructions eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 strictement observ\u00e9es jusque dans les moindres d\u00e9tails. Mais, comme le fait remarquer le surintendant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Hutton, c'\u00e9tait une erreur pouvant entra\u00eener des cons\u00e9quences fatales que de sonner d'un autre \u00e9tage que celui o\u00f9 stationnait le monte-charge pour le faire mettre en mouvement, et c'\u00e9tait une erreur non moins funeste, comme dans le cas qui nous occupe, que de crier pour demander le monte-charge alors qu'il \u00e9tait en mouvement. Il est manifeste que l'accident ne serait jamais survenu si le signal e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9tage o\u00f9 stationnait le monte-charge, ou lors qu'il se trouvait au rez-de-chauss\u00e9e. L'accident est d\u00fb au fait que Rice cria \u00e0 Robillard de lui faire parvenir le monte-charge, alors que le monte-charge \u00e9tait en mouvement et n'avait pas encore atteint le quatri\u00e8me \u00e9tage. Cet appel d\u00e9tourna l'attention de Robillard de son travail, et il omit de donner le signal pour avertir le m\u00e9canicien d'arr\u00eater le monte-charge au quatri\u00e8me.\nSi nous mettons de cot\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de Desjardins\u2014et je m'accorde avec le juge de premi\u00e8re instance dans sa fa\u00e7on d'appr\u00e9cier le t\u00e9moignage de cet homme en ce qui concerne les circonstances de l'accident,\u2014 nous devons admettre que le d\u00e9funt commit une imprudence en passant la t\u00eate \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur du puits pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l'appel de Rice, et qu'il se rendit coupable de n\u00e9gligence en omettant de donner en temps voulu le signal pour faire arr\u00eater le monte-charge au quatri\u00e8me. Mais si Robillard omit de donner le signal qu'il se proposait sans doute de donner, et s'il introduisit sa t\u00eate dans le puits pour mieux r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 Rice, la faute en est, en partie du moins, \u00e0 l'appel de Rice qui d\u00e9tourna l'attention de Robillard de son ouvrage et le for\u00e7a \u00e0 se d\u00e9placer. Vu les conditions des lieux et le syst\u00e8me en vigueur pour commander la manoeuvre du monte-charge, cet appel de Rice constitue un acte qu'aucune circonstance ne justifie, et une imprudence inexcusable dont il convient de tenir la compagnie responsable.\nEn effet, pour assurer \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s la protection voulue, la compagnie \u00e9tait tenue d'organiser des conditions d'emploi telles que les ouvriers pussent accomplir leur travail en s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, cette s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u00e9pendait principalement du syst\u00e8me en vigueur pour commander la manoeuvre du monte-charge. Celui qu'on avait adopt\u00e9 comportait selon moi, je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, une s\u00e9curit\u00e9 suffisante, pourvu que toutes les instructions \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard fussent observ\u00e9es avec une rigoureuse exactitude et une fid\u00e9lit\u00e9 absolue. Mais, d\u00e8s que l'accident peut \u00eatre raisonnablement attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 une op\u00e9ration d\u00e9fectueuse ou irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re du syst\u00e8me d\u00e9 manoeuvre, ou \u00e0 une faute d'omission ou d\u00e9 commission de quiconque accomplit un travail dont la compagnie doit r\u00e9pondre, la compagnie est de ce fait tenue responsable.\nPrenant en consid\u00e9ration toute la preuve au dossier, j'estime que l'appelant n'a pas rempli d'une fa\u00e7on satisfaisante l'obligation qui lui incombait, en vertu de la loi, de d\u00e9truire la pr\u00e9somption de sa responsabilit\u00e9, et que, bien qu'il y ait n\u00e9gligence et imprudence de la part du d\u00e9funt, l'accident est attributable aussi \u00e0 l'intervention de Rice au moment o\u00f9 le monte-charge \u00e9tait en marche \u00e0 destination du quatri\u00e8me \u00e9tage. Laurent, que nous avons cit\u00e9 plus haut, est formel sur ce point:\nLa faute la plus l\u00e9g\u00e8re est une cause de responsabilit\u00e9.\nLe contre-appel offre des difficult\u00e9s assez difficiles \u00e0 trancher. Mais, apr\u00e8s avoir longuement \u00e9tudi\u00e9 toute la preuve, comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, je n'y trouve pas mati\u00e8re \u00e0 infirmer la d\u00e9cision rendue par la cour du Banc du Roi.\nPour toutes les raisons sus-dites, je me prononce eu faveur du renvoi de l'appel et du contre-appel avec d\u00e9pens.\nIdington J. (dissenting):\u2014I incline to agree with the opinions expressed in the court below, and entertained, I understand, by some of my colleagues, that there was negligence on the part of the appellant in not having supplied a better system of signalling, and controlling the movements of the elevator, than the one in use. I am unable to see as clearly as they do the relation of such defect to the accident in question as the determining cause thereof. I agree with Mr. Justice Cross that the effective cause of the accident was the negligence of the deceased in placing his head where it should not have been under any such circumstances as presented, in any view of the evidence. I cannot find as much to justify or excuse his doing so as seems to have been held insufficient in the case of Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Fr\u00e9chette, in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council[1], where the brakesman was held disentitled to recover by reason of his imprudence in going between the cars, when moving, to uncouple them. Indeed the court above, in order to reach its conclusion in that case, had to discard the verdict of a jury which had found contributory negligence on the part of the defendant appealing, whilst in this case the learned trial judge expressly relieved the appellant from any blame which could be said to have contributed to the accident.\nI agree with him in his conclusions.\nI cannot, having regard to the respectively attendant consequences, either in fact or law, distinguish between the case of a man imprudently getting, without excuse, in the way of a freight car when moving horizontally, and that of one doing so when it is moving perpendicularly, and therefore think the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAnglin J.:\u2014There has been in this case a remarkable diversity of judicial opinion as to the proper conclusions to be drawn from the evidence. The learned trial judge found that the death of the plaintiff's husband was ascribable solely to his own imprudence; the Court of Review that he was entirely free from blame and that his death had been caused by fault on the part of the defendant; the Court of Appeal that faults of both contributed to cause the accident and that the damages, assessed by the Court of Review at $8,000, should therefore be apportioned. Mr. Justice Cross, dissenting, would have restored the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nIf the story told by the plaintiff's witness Desjardins should be accepted, as it was by the Court of Review, the conclusion based upon it by that court would be unassailable. But his testimony had been rejected by the learned trial judge as \"invraisemblable,\" and the same view of it was also taken unanimously in the Court of Appeal. I am not satisfied that it is clearly wrong.\nOn the other hand, the fault attributed to the defendant by the majority of the learned judges of the King's Bench\u2014its failure to provide an electric enunciator in the engine room\u2014while somewhat canvassed in the examination of one witness at the trial, does not appear to be covered by the allegations of negligence in the plaintiff's declaration. I therefore\u2014not without diffidence\u2014venture to question the advisability of founding a judgment against the defendant upon the absence of an enunciator as a specific proven defect in its installation. Yet the conclusion reached in the Court of Appeal should, I think, be upheld on broader grounds not open to this objection.\nNotwithstanding an allusion in the first consid\u00e9rant of the judgment of the Court of Review to the fact that the plaintiff's claim is founded upon arts. 1053 and 1054 C.C., the presumption of fault on the part of a person who has under his care a thing which causes damage arising under Art. 1054 is not invoked by it in support of the defendant's liability. With deference, however, that seems to me to be the basis on which the present defendant's responsibility, if it exists, must rest. At all events, in the absence of satisfactory affirmative proof of definite actionable fault on its part, this seems to me to be the point from which the inquiry into its responsibility should begin.\nIt is common ground that the unfortunate Robillard's death was caused by the defendant's elevator, and, if not common ground, it is indisputable that the elevator was under its control and care and was being used for its purposes and profit. The case, therefore, falls within the very terms of the first paragraph of art. 1054. For reasons fully stated in Shawinigan Carbide Co. v. Doucet[2] (to which I refer merely for convenience and to avoid repetition), I am of the opinion that the responsibility created by that article rests upon a presumption that an injury caused by an inanimate thing is attributable to fault on the part of the person under whose care it is\u2014presumptio juris, sed juris tantum et non de jure\u2014and therefore rebuttable.\nI have had no reason to change the view also expressed in the Shawinigan Case2 that the exculpatory provision of the sixth paragraph of art. 1054 does not apply to the first paragraph thereof but is confined in its application to paragraphs 2-5 inclusive. It is because of its nature and its consequences that I regard the presumption of fault on the part of a person having the care of a thing that causes damage as rebuttable. This is the view taken of it by the modern French authorities cited by my lord the Chief Justice.\nIn the case at bar it is not necessary to determine whether, in order to rebut the presumption of fault thus raised, a defendant is obliged to establish that the injury complained of was due to pure accident, vis major, or some other cause not imputable as a fault to him. D.P. 1909. 1. 73. He must, no doubt, meet and overcome the presumption of fault. D.P. 1914, 1. 303. He must prove that the injury was not caused by any negligence or misdeed attributable to him. Owing to the inherent difficulty of proving a negative such as this and the necessarily exhaustive character of the evidence requisite to establish it, a defendant will in many cases find himself compelled to specify and prove affirmatively the precise cause of the injury. Although not attempting to do this directly, should he succeed in demonstrating that the injury happened without any fault imputable to him, he will in most, if not in all, instances in so doing establish indirectly that it must be ascribed to pure accident, vis major, or some other cause not imputable as a fault to him. D.P. 1913. 1. 427, 428, 430.\nIn the case at bar, however, far from demonstrating that the defendant is entirely free from blame, the evidence rather suggests (if indeed it falls short of prim\u00e2 facie proof) that the lack of an electric enunciator was a material defect in the defendant's installation and also that the call of Rice to Robillard when the ascending elevator was approaching the fourth floor, calculated as it was to distract the latter's attention and to cause him to overlook giving the necessary stop signal, contributed to bring about the unfortunate occurrence and amounted to a fault attributable to the defendant. If its system of signalling permitted such a call to be given at that moment, it would seem to have been dangerously defective; if it did not, Rice, its servant, was culpably negligent in giving it.\nNo doubt the unfortunate Robillard's own imprudence materially contributed to his death, and cannot be wholly excused because he may have been distracted by Rice's improper call from the ninth floor. But upon the record before us it is, in my opinion, equally impossible to say that the presumption of fault dans locum injuri\u0153 on the part of the defendant, arising under art. 1054 C.C., has been satisfactorily rebutted. I would for these reasons dismiss both the appeal and the cross-appeal.\nBrodeur J.:\u2014Il s'agit d'une action en dommages institu\u00e9e par l'Intim\u00e9e pour un accident dont son mari a \u00e9t\u00e9 la victime lorsqu'il \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'emploi de la compagnie d\u00e9fenderesse appelante. Elle all\u00e8gue que le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de son mari, Charles-Edouard Robillard, a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par la chose du patron et qu'il y avait eu faute de la part de ce dernier. L'appelante pretend que l'accident a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par la faute de Robillard lui-m\u00eame.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a renvoy\u00e9 l'action et a maintenu la pr\u00e9tention du patron. La Cour de Revision a renvers\u00e9 ce jugement et a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le patron devait \u00eatre tenu responsable parce que l'accident \u00e9tait d\u00fb \u00e0 sa faute. La Cour d'Appel a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'il y avait eu faute commune et a r\u00e9duit de moiti\u00e9 les dommages qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9s \u00e0 la demanderesse par la Cour de Revision.\nLa Compagnie Norcross appelle de ce dernier jugement et il y a contre-appel de la part de la demanderesse.\nVoici dans quelles circonstances l'accident a eu lieu: La compagnie Norcross \u00e9tait \u00e0 construire un \u00e9difice de neuf \u00e9tages \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Afin de faciliter le transport des mat\u00e9riaux, elle avait temporairement reli\u00e9 les deux ailes de l'\u00e9difice au moyen de plate-formes qui correspondaient avec les neuf \u00e9tages et elle avait install\u00e9 des ascenseurs. Il y avait \u00e0 chaque \u00e9tage un bouton \u00e9lectrique par lequel on pouvait appeler ces ascenseurs; mais cette sonnerie \u00e9tait des plus primitives et ne pouvait indiquer \u00e0 celui qui avait \u00e0 mettre les ascenseurs en mouvement l'\u00e9tage o\u00f9 il devait les faire arr\u00eater.\nRobillard travaillait au quatri\u00e8me \u00e9tage et, ayant eu besoin de l'ascenseur, il a sonn\u00e9. L'ing\u00e9nieur en charge, le nomm\u00e9 Woods, qui \u00e9tait au soubassement, a alors mis l'ascenseur en mouvement. Pour faire arr\u00eater cet ascenseur au quatri\u00e8me \u00e9tage o\u00f9 il se trouvait, il fallait \u00e0 Robillard sonner de nouveau juste au moment o\u00f9 l'ascenseur se trouvait pr\u00e8s de cet \u00e9tage.\nIci il se pr\u00e9sente dans la preuve une divergence tr\u00e8s importance. Le t\u00e9moin Desjardins, qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 cot\u00e9 de Robillard, dit que ce dernier a sonn\u00e9 et que l'ascenseur est arr\u00eat\u00e9; mais qu'\u00e0 peine \u00e9tait-il arr\u00eat\u00e9, qu'il est reparti de suite sans ordre de leur part; et alors Robillard aurait eu la t\u00eate \u00e9cras\u00e9e par l'ascenseur et aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 tu\u00e9 instantan\u00e9ment. D'un autre cot\u00e9, Woods, l'ing\u00e9nieur, dit que l'ascenseur n'a pas arr\u00eat\u00e9 au quatri\u00e8me \u00e9tage et qu'on n'avait pas sonn\u00e9 pour le faire arr\u00eater. Il contredit donc formellement le t\u00e9moignage de Desjardins; et, sur ce point, il est corrobor\u00e9 par le t\u00e9moin Rice, qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 un \u00e9tage sup\u00e9rieur et qui observait les mouvements de l'ascenseur, vu qu'il en avait besoin lui-m\u00eame.\nL'Honorable Juge qui pr\u00e9sidait au proc\u00e8s a accept\u00e9 de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence la version des t\u00e9moins Woods et Rice. D'ailleurs, Desjardins lui-m\u00eame avait sign\u00e9 une d\u00e9claration apr\u00e8s l'accident que Robillard n'avait pas sonn\u00e9 pour faire arr\u00eater l'ascenseur au quatri\u00e8me \u00e9tage; et pour expliquer cette contradiction entre son t\u00e9moignage et sa d\u00e9claration ant\u00e9rieure il a simplement dit qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas sous serment quand il a fait cette d\u00e9claration. S'il a jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de dire d'abord une chose fausse, il s'ensuit que son t\u00e9moignage est bien affaibli et qu'il ne doit pas \u00eatre accept\u00e9, surtout quand il est formellement contredit par deux autres personnes.\nLe Cour de Revision a cependant pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 accepter la version de Desjardins; en disant, entr'autres choses, que ce dernier \u00e9tait absolument d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9, tandis que les deux t\u00e9moins, Woods et Rice, avaient int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 rejeter la responsabilit\u00e9 sur Robillard, vu qu'autrement ils seraient eux-m\u00eames en faute; le premier, Woods, pour ne pas avoir arr\u00eat\u00e9 sa machine, et l'autre pour avoir appel\u00e9 Robillard d'un \u00e9tage sup\u00e9rieur et l'avoir induit \u00e0 mettre la t\u00eate dans le puits de l'ascenseur pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 son interpellation.\nApr\u00e8s avoir lu et relu attentivement la preuve, je suis port\u00e9 \u00e0 croire que la th\u00e9orie la plus probable de l'accident est que Robillard n'aurait pas eu le temps de retirer sa t\u00eate du puits quand il r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 l'interpellation de son compagnon de travail, vu que ces ascenseurs marchent tr\u00e8s vite.\nLa Cour d'Appel n'a pas accept\u00e9 non plus la version de Desjardins; mais elle a trouv\u00e9 qu'il y avait eu faute commune de la part de l'employ\u00e9 et du patron, le premier en mettant sa t\u00eate dans un endroit si dangereux, et le dernier en n'ayant pas une sonnerie qui aurait indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ing\u00e9nieur l'\u00e9tage auquel l'ascenseur devait arr\u00eater.\nNous n'avons pas de preuve sur la valeur d'un syst\u00e8me plus perfectionn\u00e9 que celui en usage; mais il y a lieu de pr\u00e9sumer que le co\u00fbt en aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s faible et qu'il aurait bien mieux valu \u00e0 la compagnie faire les frais de cette d\u00e9pense additionnelle que d'avoir \u00e0 d\u00e9pendre sur la pr\u00e9voyance et la conduite des nombreux employ\u00e9s qu'elle devait avoir dans cet \u00e9difice.\nD'ailleurs, \u00e0 qui aurait incomb\u00e9 le fardeau de cette preuve?\nL'accident est d\u00fb au fait que Robillard a \u00e9t\u00e9 frapp\u00e9 par un ascenseur, c'est-\u00e0-dire par une chose dont son patron avait la garde. La pr\u00e9somption de la loi est que, suivant les dispositions de l'article 1054 du Code Civil, il y a eu faute de la part de celui qui avait la garde de cette chose-l\u00e0.\nCette question de pr\u00e9somption a fait le sujet d'int\u00e9ressantes discussions dans la doctrine et dans la jurisprudence pendant les derni\u00e8res vingt ann\u00e9es en France.\nEn 1896, la Chambre Civile de la Cour de Cassation a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la responsabilit\u00e9 du propri\u00e9taire d'une chose \u00e9tait \u00e9crite dans l'article 1384 du Code Napol\u00e9on, qui correspond \u00e0 notre article 1054, et qu'elle \u00e9tait engag\u00e9e du moment que les constatations du juge du fait repoussaient le cas fortuit et la force majeure.\nDalloz 1897-1-433.\nLe Premier Pr\u00e9sident de la Cour de Cassation, M. Ballot Beaupr\u00e9, disait en 1904, \u00e0 la c\u00e9l\u00e9bration du Centenaire du Code Napol\u00e9on, que cette d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait la cons\u00e9cration du risque professionnel. (Le Centenaire du Code Civil, p. 33.)\nCette d\u00e9cision de 1896 de la Chambre civile de la Cour de Cassation ne paraissait pas cependant \u00e0 plusieurs auteurs avoir la port\u00e9e que quelques autres voulaient y voir; et il faut bien admettre que l'impr\u00e9cision des termes dont elle s'\u00e9tait servie pouvait autoriser cette divergence d'opinion. Cependant les adh\u00e9sions assez nombreuses et assez formelles de la part des tribunaux d'appel \u00e0 la th\u00e9orie du risque professionnel, ainsi qu'on le voit dans les d\u00e9cisions suivantes,\nDalloz, 1900-2-289,\nDalloz, 1904-2-257,\nDalloz, 1905-2-417,\nDalloz, 1906-2-249,\npouvaient nous laisser voir le pr\u00e9lude d'une cons\u00e9cration formelle de la part de la Cour de Cassation. Aussi, en 1908 (Dalloz, 1908-1-217), la Cour de Cassation d\u00e9cidait que\nl'article 1384, alin\u00e9a Ier, C.N. en disant qu'on est responsable du dommage caus\u00e9 par le fait des choses qu'on a sous sa garde \u00e9tablit une pr\u00e9somption de faute. Mais cette pr\u00e9somption doit c\u00e9der devant la preuve de la faute exclusive de la victime.\nEt cette jurisprudence a \u00e9t\u00e9 toujours suivie depuis.\nDalloz, 1909-1-73,\nDalloz, 1910-1-17,\nDalloz, 1913-1-427,\nDalloz, 1914-1-303,\nLes auteurs qui, \u00e0 la suite de Planiol, avaient d'abord combattu cette th\u00e9orie de la pr\u00e9somption de la faute s'y sont d\u00e9finitivement ralli\u00e9s et aujourd'hui la seule divergence d'opinion qui para\u00eet exister dans la doctrine ne porte que sur la mani\u00e8re dont cette pr\u00e9somption peut \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente cause, le patron a tent\u00e9 de prouver que l'accident \u00e9tait d\u00fb \u00e0 la faute de la victime. Il me para\u00eet qu'en effet Robillard a \u00e9t\u00e9 coupable d'une imprudence; mais cette faute n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 la seule qui ait contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'accident.\nLe patron n'a pas repouss\u00e9 la pr\u00e9somption de faute qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mise \u00e0 sa charge. Il y aurait donc eu faute commune. Et la Cour d'Appel a donc bien jug\u00e9 en divisant les dommages entre les deux parties et son jugement devrait \u00eatre confirm\u00e9. L'appel et le contre-appel sont renvoy\u00e9s avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nCross-appeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Elliott, David & Mailhiot.\nSolicitors for the respondent: St. Germain, Gu\u00e9rin & Raymond.\n[1] [1915] A.C. 871.\n[2] 42 Can.

[1911] c. 115, s. 7\u2014\"Winding-up Act\"\u2014Leave to appeal.\nBy sec. 7 of the \"Life Insurance Policies Act\" of British Columbia a man may \"by any writing identifying the policy by its number or otherwise\" cause a policy of insurance on his life to be deemed a trust for the benefit of his wife for her separate use.\nHeld, per Davies and Anglin JJ., Fitzpatrick C.J. dubitante, Idington J. contra, that such declaration in writing may be made by will as the legislature of British Columbia, when enacting this provision, must be presumed to have adopted the judicial construction of similar legislation in the Province of Ontario.\nA. by his will bequeated to his wife \"the first seventy\u2014five thousand dollars collected on account of policies of life insurance.\"\nHeld, DAVIES J. contra, that said devise was not a writing \"identifying the policy by its number or otherwise\" as required by sec. 7 of the Act and said sum of $75,000 did not enure to the benefit of A.'s wife.\nAfter the death of A. his wife brought action against the Trust Company, executor of his will, and said company's liquidator under a Winding-up order to recover $75,000 out of the proceeds of life policies collected by the executor. On appeal from the judgement of the Court of Appeal in said action.\nHeld, Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that the case was not one subject to the provisions of sec. 106 of the \"Winding-up Act\" and leave to appeal was not necessary.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (35 D.L.R. 145) sustaining that at the trial (32 D.L.R. 301) affirmed. APPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming, by an equal division of opinion, the judgment at the trial[2], in favour of the defendants.\nThe action was brought to recover the sum of $75,000 bequeated to the appellant by the will of her husband, W. R. Arnold. The questions raised on the appeal were, first, whether or not leave of the court or a judge as provided by sec. 106 of the \"Winding-up Act\" was necessary; secondly, whether or not the declaration in writing required by sec. 7 of the \"Life\u2014Insurance Policies Act\" can be made by will; and thirdly, whether or not the devise identified the policy under the provisions of sec. 7. These questions are fully dealt with in the above head\u2014note.\nS. S. Taylor K.C. for the appellant. Any declaration in writing satisfies the requirement of sec. 7. A will is a writing and a declaration made by will is sufficient. Orange v. Pickford[3], at page 365; McKibbon v. Feegan[4].\nThe designation of all the policies on testator's life identifies the policy otherwise than by number. In re Lynn[5]; Beam v. Beam[6]; In re Harkness[7]; In re Roger[8].\nLafleur K.C. for the respondents. The declaration cannot be made by will. In re Watters[9].\nAs to identification of the policy see MacLaren v. MacLaren[10].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014At the hearing of this appeal an application was made by counsel for the respondent to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction. The ground put forward was that the respondent company being in liquidation, no appeal could, under secs. 22 and 101 of the \"Winding-up Act,\" be brought without leave of the Court.\nIn my opinion, this was founded on a misconception of the nature of the action; it is not one against the company or the liquidator properly speaking but only as executor of Wm. Arnold deceased. It involves the construction of the will of the deceased. In such an action it cannot be decided what the plaintiffs can recover against the liquidator as such but only what part of the estate of the deceased which can be so recovered the plaintiff is entitled to. If there are two persons each claiming to be entitled under a will the liquidator as executor may be a necessary party to a suit to determine their rights but it must obviously be a matter of indifference so far as the company is concerned which of the two is entitled. I have been assuming that the estate of the deceased would only have a claim on the assets of the company in liquidation but of course if there were specific trust funds in the hands of the liquidator as executor the case would be very much stronger. The matter is complicated by the plea which the defendants have put in that the estate of the deceased is insolvent and that they are creditors against it, but clearly the fact that they may have such a defence could not be any ground for preventing the action being brought against them as executors.\nTherefore I am of opinion that the action is not one which is within the prohibition of the \"Winding-up Act\" at all, and no leave being required, the application against the jurisdiction fails.\nI am of opinion that the appeal must be dis- missed on the ground that the will makes no such declaration of a trust as sec. 7 of the \"Life Insurance Policies Act,\" R.S.B.C., ch. 115, calls for. This section enables a man to declare that a policy effected on his life is for the benefit of his wife and children, but here we have nothing but a bequest to the testator's wife of $75,000 out of the monies which may be collected on account of policies of life insurance.\nIt is suggested that \"the Act should receive such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as will best ensure the attainment of its object,\" but this does not help us, for apart from the fact that the courts ought, if possible, to place such construction on every Act as will best ensure the attainment of its object, I think the object of this Act is, broadly speaking, to enable a man during his lifetime to make out of his earnings a provision for his family which shall be beyond his own or his creditors' reach. I do not think it was intended to enable him to retain his insurance as his own absolute property even after his death and under cover of the special protection afforded by the Act upon distinct conditions bequeath the proceeds, which may be the whole of his estate, in fraud of his creditors. This involves to a certain extent the question into which I do not wish to enter whether the declaration called for by the Act can be made by will.\nThe Chief Justice in his reasons for the judgment appealed against says:\nassuming the will to be such a writing as is contemplated by the Act.\nI gather from this that he probably shares the doubts which I certainly entertain whether a will is such a writing as the statute contemplates.\nThe only case in which the point seems to have received much consideration is one before the Ontario courts in which province the statute is similar to the one in British Columbia. In McKibbon v. Feegan[11], a majority of the court concluded that the declaration could be made by will but Osler J. dissenting, delivered what appear to me to be weighty reasons for holding the contrary view.\nIt is not necessary to decide this point in the present case because as I have said I do not find that the will identifies any policy by its number or otherwise as the statute requires.\nSince writing the above, my attention has been called to a newspaper report of a decision of Chief Justice Meredith, in the Province of Ontario, in the matter of the will of John Wesley Monkman, a soldier who was killed on active service. The learned Chief Justice held that a postcript to the will, though it may not be valid as part of the will, is a sufficient declaration for the purposes of the \"Insurance Act.\"\nThis is a step further in the liberal construction and interpretation of the Act. The writing could be no declaration during the life of the deceased and as a general rule at any rate the law does not recognize any testamentary disposition made otherwise than by will.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting):\u2014This appeal coming on for hearing, respondent moved to quash on the ground that leave to appeal had not been obtained under sec. 106 of the \"Winding-up Act\" and that such leave was necessary to give this court jurisdiction.\nI am of the opinion that the sections of this \"Windup Act\" relating to appeals are, as expressed in the 101st section of the Act, confined to\norders or decisions of the court or a single judge in any proceeding under this Act. This appeal from the judgment of the court of final resort in British Columbia is one conferred upon litigants by the \"Supreme Court Act\" itself and is not, in my opinion, a \"proceeding\" under the \"Winding-up Act\" requiring the leave of a judge before being taken, but an ordinary appeal from the final judgment of a court of last resort in the province in an action originating in a superior court. Leave to bring that action in the first instance was obtained under the 22nd section of the \"Winding-up Act.\" Thereafter the litigants had their statutory right of appeal under the \"Supreme Court Act.\" I think, therefore, the motion to quash for want of jurisdiction fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nThe question to be decided on the appeal is whether the sum of $75,000, being part of the proceeds collected from life insurance on the life of William Robert Arnold, deceased, belongs to the appellants who are the widow and infant children of the deceased or constitutes part of his general estate.\nThe determination of that question depends first upon the construction to be given to sec. 7 of the \"Life Insurance Policies Act\" of British Columbia (R.S.B.C. [1911] ch. 115).\nThe Act itself is entitled\nAn Act to secure to wives and children the benefit of life insurance and to regulate and prohibit insurance without an interest in the life of the insured.\nThe 7th section, upon the construction of which this appeal depends, provides that where an assured\nby any writing identifying the policy by its number or otherwise\nmakes\na declaration that the policy is for the benefit of his wife or of his wife and children or any of them, such policy shall enure and be deemed a trust for the benefit of his wife for her separate use and of his children or any of them according to the intent so expressed and declared. The deceased Arnold made a declaration in his will that the first $75,000 collected on account of his life insurance policies should be for appellant's benefit.\nIf the declaration required to be made by the statute can be made by will, then the only question remaining is whether or not the testator has complied with the statute in the matter of identifying his policies.\nMr. Lafleur for the respondent contended that the statutory declaration required could not be made by will, and even if it could that this will had failed to identify the policies of insurance.\nI am not able to agree with either contention. The British Columbia statute is in all material points of its 7th section which we have to construe substantially the same as sec. 5 of the Ontario Act. 47 Vict. ch. 20, securing to wives and children the benefits of insurance, while sec. 8 of the former statute is substantially the same as sec. 6 of ch. 136 of the R.S.O. 1887, as amended by 53 Vict. ch. 39, sec. 6.\nBy a series of judicial decisions in the Province of Ontario, including those of the Court of Appeal of that province, before the British Columbia legislature enacted the statute in question, it had been decided that the words \"any writing\" included a last will, and I think it must be assumed what when the legislature of British Columbia enacted the statute in question they did so with the knowledge of the judicial interpretation which had been authoritatively placed upon the Ontario statute on that point and with the intent that such interpretation would be followed in British Columbia.\nI may say that, while the question is one not free from all doubt I agree with the conclusion the courts of Ontario had reached that the words \"any writing\" in the section in question included a will. As to the question whether the will in this case sufficiently identifies the policies of insurance, I am of opinion that it does. I cannot accept the argument that the maxim ejusdem generis should be applied to the language of the statute, and that the words\nany writing identifying the policy by its number or otherwise\nshould be construed so as to limit the identification to something akin or similar to the number of the policy. On the contrary, I think that any language which sufficiently identified the policy or policies so as to prevent any mistake being made with respect to the declaration of trust would be sufficient. In the case now before us, the words of the testator's bequest were\nThe first $75,000 collected on account of policies of life insurance I give to my wife, Laura, etc.\nThere were ten insurance policies on Arnold's life in force at the time of his death amounting to $425,000 and of this sum $207,054, it is stated, had been collected. It does seem to me, alike on authority and principle, that the terms of the above bequest are sufficient to comply with the statute. The object of requiring identification of the policy or policies with respect to which a declaration of trust in favour of testator's wife or children might be made was to insure such certainty as would avoid any trouble or dispute as to the particular policy or policies of insurance as to which any such declaration applied. Any language insuring this result, however general, would, in my judgment, suffice. \"The first $75,000 collected on account of policies of life insurance\" means, of course, the testator's life insurance; and in my opinion, embraces all of testator's life insurance and does not leave any doubt as to testator's meaning or the sources from which the fund he was creating for his wife and children was to come. His object was to make a declaration of trust with respect to a specific portion of that life insurance for his wife and children. I am unable to appreciate the distinction attempted to be drawn between a bequest of all of his policies of insurance, which under the Ontario authorities, would undoubtedly be sufficient and a bequest of a specific amount \"first collected on account of those policies.\" The question to my mind is: Has language been used so identifying the policies as to place the question of their identity beyond doubt? I cannot see how the limitation of the amount as to which the declaration of trust was applicable, namely, the first $75,000 collected out of testator's policies could affect the identification of the policies from which the amount was to be collected. The fact was proved that at his death Arnold had ten life policies in force. The $75,000 was declared to be the first $75,000 collected from those policies. There could be no doubt in my judgment as to the identity of the policies out of which the fund declared to be in trust for the widow and children was to come. It is true that fund might come from one or more of these, ten policies but that possibility cannot alter the fact that the language of the bequest covered and identified each and all of the policies as those from which the fund bequeathed might come. It would be a narrow construction which determined that, although the words of the bequest covered and included all of the policies and so identified them, nevertheless as the $75,000 might be collected out of one of the $100,000 policies or two of them, that fact operated to destroy the identification.\nThe fund $75,000 testator settled on his wife and children was to be the first $75,000 collected on any or all of the policies but each and all of the policies were identified as being the sources or one of the sources from which the $75,000 might come. Nor can I see that because one or more of the companies which issued the policies resisted payment successfully of the amount insured, such fact could affect the question of identification. The argument would be equally strong if he had identified the policies by their numbers.\nI agree with the conclusion of Martin J. who, after citing several of the Ontario cases, says:\nIt is but a short easy and logical step from these cases, where all of the policies or only one policy are or is dealt with, to this case.\nMy conclusions are therefore that we have jurisdiction to hear and determine this appeal; that the words of the statute \"any writing\" embrace and include a last will of a testator; and that the testator has in the present case sufficiently identified the policies out of which the fund he desired to settle upon his wife and children was to come. I would therefore allow the appeal and direct judgment to be entered accordingly for the plaintiff.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs. I am of the opinion that the motion to quash the appeal should have prevailed.\nThe action was begun after the Trust Company, respondent, had been put in liquidation by an order under the \"Winding-up Act.\"\nPresumably sec. 22 of that Act, which prohibits the institution of any suit against a company after a Winding-up order is made\nexcept with the leave of the court and subject to such terms as the court imposes,\nwas duly observed. No such order, however, appears in the case now presented for our consideration. If it was properly obtained then the whole litigation is a proceeding under the Act. But if it was not obtained the whole proceeding is void and there can be no appeal allowed to help one so acting.\nIt is provided by sec. 101 of the Act that except in the North West Territories, any person dissatisfied with an order or decision of the court or a single judge in any proceeding under the Act may, by leave of a judge of the court, appeal therefrom.\nThree classes of cases are made thus appealable. One is if the question to be raised on the appeal involves future rights; another if the decision is likely to affect other cases of a similar nature in the Winding-up proceedings; and a third if the amount involved in the appeal exceeds five hundred dollars.\nSec. 102 provides for such appeals being carried to the respective appellate courts of the provinces named.\nSec. 103 provides for cases in the North West Territories being allowed an appeal to this court by leave of a judge thereof.\nSec. 106 is as follows:\u2014\n106.\u2014An appeal, if the amount involved therein exceeds two thousand dollars, shall, by leave of a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada, lie to that court from:\n(a) The Court of Appeal for Ontario;\n(b) The Court of King's Bench in Quebec; or\n(c) a superior court in banc in any of the other provinces or in the Yukon Territory.\nNo leave to appeal this case from the Court of Appeal for British Columbia has been given.\nHaving regard to the care taken by Parliament in the foregoing enactments for safeguarding any estate in liquidation under the \"Winding-up Act\" from becoming involved in unnecessary litigation and the consequent delays and expenses thereof, I have no doubt that it intended to limit appeals to this court in the way provided by this sec. 106.\nIf that was not its purpose in thus enacting, it puzzles one to understand what conceivable object could have been had in view; for the two thousand dollar limit named would cover almost any conceivable case and enable the parties concerned to come here by virtue of the provisions of the \"Supreme Court Act\" without special leave.\nTo hold, as I understand the ruling directing the argument to proceed would mean if adhered to, opening the way to appeals here in any litigation the judge in charge of the Winding-up proceedings may, as I presume he did herein, permit; whenever the amount in controversy or thing involved in any way of a claim against the company or its liquidators reaches the limit set by the \"Supreme Court Act\" for the particular province in which the litigation may have been permitted.\nIt was suggested in argument that the restriction in sec. 106 upon appeals here was designed to be applied in cases of a proceeding under the Act.\nThat is answered by the express language of the sec. 106 which contains no such language as to support the argument.\nThere is, I submit further, no litigation with the company or its liquidator which can be permitted except by virtue of sec. 22 and everything permitted thereunder is a proceeding under the Act in the language used in sec. 101.\nOn the merits of the questions raised in argument, I am of the opinion that the \"Life Insurance Policies Act\" (R.S.B.C. 1911, ch. 115) by its section seven never was intended to cover any case of a bequest by will or indeed any revocable instrument whatever. The first sentence of that section is as follows:\u2014\n7. In case a policy of insurance effected by a man on his life is expressed upon the face of it to be for the benefit of his wife, or of his wife and children, or any of them, or in case he has heretofore indorsed, or may hereafter indorse, or by any writing identifying the policy by its number or otherwise has made, or may hereafter make, a declaration that the policy is for the benefit of his wife, or of his wife and children, or any of them, such policy shall enure and be deemed a trust for the benefit of his wife for her separate use, and of his children, or any of them, according to the intent so expressed or declared; and so long as any object of the trust remains, the money payable under the policy shall not be subject to the control of the husband or his creditors, or form part of his estate when the sum secured by the policy becomes payable; but this shall not be held to interfere with any pledge of the policy to any person prior to such declaration.\nIt is expressed in the most imperative terms that in such cases, thus defined, the policy\nshall enure and be deemed a trust * * * according to the intent so expressed,\nand so long as any object of the trust remains the money payable\nshall not be subject to the control of the husband or his creditors, or form part of his estate.\nIt was obviously designed that the declaration should be irrevocable and once made should not only protect the objects of the trust but also protect the husband making it from the importunities or pressure of creditors.\nIt is urged that the Act in question herein was copied from an Ontario Act of the like import and that the Court of Appeal for that province upheld an appointment or declaration made by will. That decision does not bind us. With unfeigned respect for the court which so decided I cannot follow the decision. I prefer the reasoning of Mr. Justice Osler who dissented therefrom. Indeed I may be permitted to adopt the views he expressed and forbear enlarging further on that aspect of the case.\nEven if I could accept any revocable instrument such as a will continues to be until the maker of it is dead, there seems to me insuperable obstacles in appellant's way, in the adherent nature of the will in question.\nHe fails to identify the policy or policies upon which it might operate. The ascertainment thereof is left to the chances of the development of circumstances that cannot arise until some weeks after the testator's death. For there could be no payment of any policy until after probate had been obtained by the respondent Trust Company, or someone in its place, after its renunciation.\nMoreover, no part of the bequest is made payable to the appellant by any insurance company but it forms part of the estate and is payable out of the estate. The language of the section expressly prohibits that sort of thing.\nSec. 15 of the Act provides for the appointment by the husband of a trustee or trustees to receive the money but that is very far from what was done in this case.\nAnd I may add that the express provisions of that section for the nomination by a husband or father by his will of such trustees, seems to me instead of helping the appellant in her argument for the declaration required by sec. 7 being possible by will destroys the argument.\nIf the legislature had ever contemplated such a thing surely it would have so expressed itself.\nThe purpose it had in view in enacting sec. 7 could not be accomplished by any will or other revocable instrument. But some of those purposes could be promoted by adding the nominating power in sec. 15, without encroaching in the slightest degree upon the permanence and sanctity of the trust that had been created by virtue of sec. 7. ANGLIN J.\u2014The respondent moved to quash this appeal on the ground that the leave of a judge of this court to bring it was necessary under sec. 106 of the \"Winding-up Act\" (R.S.C., ch. 144), and was not obtained. This contention rests on the view that, owing to an order for the Winding-up of the defendant Trust Company, executor of the insured, having been made before this action was begun, \"leave of the court\" to commence it was required and was obtained under sec. 22 of the \"Winding-up Act.\" The like leave to proceed with the action, had it been already commenced before the Winding-up order was pronounced, would have been necessary. The court disposing of an application for leave under sec. 101 determines whether the pending or proposed action is one which should be permitted to go on\u2014whether having regard to the nature of the action and all the circumstances the interests of justice will be better served by allowing it to proceed, or, when that is possible, by requiring that the subject matter shall be dealt with by the judge or officer charged with the Winding-up in the course of the proceedings before him. When the leave is given the action is brought or proceeds in the court in which it is instituted subject to whatever incidents, including rights of appeal, the law attaches to it. The granting of this leave, whether it be to bring an action or to proceed with one already brought, does not make of it a \"proceeding under this Act\" within the meaning of sec. 101 of the \"Winding-up Act.\" By \"any proceeding under this Act\" is meant a proceeding in the Winding-up itself, e.g., the making of the Winding-up order, or the allowance or disallowance of a creditor's claim, or the determination of the liability of a contributory by the judge or delegated officer under whose direction the liquidation is carried on. The right of appeal in this action is conferred not by the \"Winding-up Act,\" but by the \"Supreme Court Act;\" and it is the ordinary appeal given by the latter Act from a final judgment of a court of last resort in the province in an action which has originated in a superior court. The motion to quash therefore fails.\nThe right of the plaintiff to the $75,000 insurance money in question as a preferred beneficiary under the \"Life Insurance Policies Act\" (R.S.B.C. [1911] ch. 115) is contested on three grounds\u2014that a will is not a \"writing\" within the meaning of sec. 7 of the statute by which a declaration of trust for preferred beneficiaries may be made; that the testator did not purport to declare such a trust, but merely to make a bequest or give a legacy to his wife; that the will does not identify the policy or policies \"by number or otherwise\" as sec. 7 requires.\nThe material part of sec. 7 of the British Columbia statute, first passed in 1895 (ch. 26), is a reproduction of sec. 5 of the Ontario Act to secure to wives and children the benefit of insurance, enacted in 47 Vict. as chapter 20, and carried into the R.S.O., 1887, as chapter 136. Sec. 8 of the British Columbia statute is substantially, and so far as material, a reproduction of sec. 6 of ch. 136 of the R.S.O., 1887, as amended in 1890 by 53 Vict. ch. 39, sec. 6. It had been decided by the late Chancellor Boyd, in Re Lynn [12], and again in Beam v. Beam[13], that a will is a \"writing\" within the Ontario section; and in McKibbon v. Feegan[14], these decisions had been approved by the Court of Appeal (Hagarty C.J.O. and Maclennan J.A., Osler J.A. dissenting). I think it must be assumed that the legislature of British Columbia was apprased of the judicial interpretation that had been thus definitely placed on the statutory provision under discussion when it adopted it in 1895, and that it intended that that interpretation should be followed in British Columbia. Casgrain v. Atlantic and North West Rly. Co.[15], at page 300; see also authorities collected in Maxwell on Statutes, 5 ed., at p. 500, and in 27 Hals. Laws of England, at p. 142. The \"Interpretation Act\" of British Columbia (R.S.B.C. 1897, and 1911) does not contain a provision excluding the application of this well-established rule of statutory construction such as we find in the R.S.C. [1906] ch. 1, sec. 21(4) and in the R.S.O. [1914] ch. 1, sec. 20. Without expressing any view as to what should have been the construction of the British Columbia statute had the matter come to us as res integra, I am of the opinion that we must now act upon the assumption that the construction placed upon the similar provision of the Ontario Act was intended by the legislature of British Columbia to be that which should be given to sec. 7, and that a will, if otherwise in compliance with the requirements of that section, must therefore be deemed a \"writing\" within its purview.\nIn numerous cases in Ontario dispositions by will in the form of bequests or legacies of insurance have been held to be sufficient as declarations to meet the requirements of the statute. The Lynn Case[16] and McKibbon v. Feegan[17], already cited, Re Cheese-borough[18], and Book v. Book[19], are instances. Once it is accepted that a declaration under the statute may validly be made by will, I think it follows that words of bequest or gift are sufficient in form. It would scarcely accord with the liberal construction which should prevail in the interpretation of this legislation and would have a deplorably unsettling effect were we to hold otherwise and overrule now decisions that have stood unchallenged for twenty\u2014five years and must have been acted upon very frequently since they were pronounced.\nThe question as to the sufficiency of the identification of the policies is in a different position. Induced no doubt by the desire to render as far-reaching as possible the scope and operation of what they deemed remedial legislation\u2014to advance the remedy which it was designed to provide\u2014the courts of Ontario have apparently refused to apply the well\u2014known ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis rules to the construction of the words \"or otherwise\" in the phrase\nby any writing identifying the policy by its number or otherwise.\nThey have held that where a testator had but one policy a bequest to a preferred beneficiary of his property \"including life insurance\" should be treated as a declaration under the statute sufficiently identifying that policy. Re Harkness[20]; Re Watters[21]. There are indications in the decided cases that a bequest of a definite portion of the proceeds of the testator's life insurance might be deemed sufficient where he had but a single policy. It has also been held that where there were several policies a bequest of\nall my property real and personal and including life insurance policies and certificates\n(Re Cheeseborough[22]; see, too, In re Cochrane[23], would satisfy the statute as to policies in force at the time of the making of the will and not made payable to named beneficiaries. Probably the most recent de- cision in Re Monkman and Canadian Order of Chosen Friends [24], goes further than any that preceded it. But in no reported case, so far as I am aware, has it been held that, where the testator has several policies, a bequest of a sum smaller than their gross amount to be paid out of his insurance or to be charged upon it, without any further identification of the policies to be so affected, is a good declaration of trust under the statute.\nIn going as far as they did in order to attain the purpose of the legislation under consideration, the courts of Ontario have, I think, reached, if they have not overstepped, the limit of what the legislature intended to permit when it prescribed, as a condition of the efficacy of \"any writing\" designed to take life insurance out of the assets available to satisfy creditors and make of it a trust fund exclusively for beneficiaries of the preferred class, that such \"writing\" should identify the policy or policies so dealt with \"by number or otherwise.\" Any method of identification, however widely different from identification by number, has apparently been treated as sufficient.\nBut the decided cases have not gone the length of entirely dispensing with identification and that, I fear, would be the result of holding sufficient a mere charge by will of an amount representing a fraction of their face value upon all a testator's life insurance consisting of numerous policies. With respect I cannot accept Mr. Justice Martin's view that to do so would be to take \"but a short, easy and logical step from these cases,\" i.e., those already decided. Assuming that the identification prescribed is to be found in all of them, it would be the step from identification of some kind to no identification at all. In the case at bar, the insurance, consisting of ten policies, two of them for $100,000 each, amounts in all to $425,000, of which $207,054.54 has been collected. The bequest is of\nthe first $75,000 collected on account of policies of life insurance.\nThe first $75,000 collected might come entirely out of one of the $100,000 policies or it might come partly out of the proceeds of several policies. The policies might be paid in full in a single payment or only by instalments. Some might be found wholly uncollectable. The executors might proceed more promptly in making proofs of claim to one company than to another. The diligence or the readiness in meeting claims against it of one company might be greater than that of another. Upon some or all of these contingencies would depend the source or sources from which the $75,000 first collected would come, and the determination of what assets would be taken out of the estate and what would be available for creditors. It is, in my opinion, impossible to say that under such circumstances there has been any identification whatever of the policy or policies, the whole or part of which is to form the subject of the statutory trust for the preferred beneficiary. However ready or even anxious we may be to give to a statute designed\nto secure to wives and children the benefit of life insurance,\nsuch construction as will tend to effect that purpose, we may not entirely dispense with the identification which the legislature has seen fit to prescribe. To do so would be to legislate, not to construe.\nI am, for these reasons, of the opinion that this appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs. The appellant, however, is entitled to her costs of the unsuccessful motion to quash which should be set-off against the costs of appeal to be paid by her. BRODEUR J.\u2014A motion to quash the appeal has been made by the respondent on the ground that this appeal has been taken without leave by a judge of this court.\nThe present action has been instituted by the appellant to claim a sum of $75,000, being part of the proceeds from life insurance of her husband, William Robert Arnold. The question to be decided in the case is whether that sum of $75,000 belongs to the preferred beneficiaries of the deceased or constitutes part of his general estate.\nWhen the action was instituted against the Dominion Trust Company, which had been appointed executors of the will of Arnold, a Winding-up order had been made against, the company, and under the provisions of sec. 22 of the \"Winding-up Act (ch. 144, R.S.C.), the leave of the Supreme Court of British Columbia was obtained.\nWhen the appeal came up before this Court, no leave was obtained, and it was contended by the respondent that the appeal should be quashed because no such leave was obtained.\nSec. 106 of the \"Winding-up Act,\" says that\nAn appeal if the amount involved therein exceeds $2,000 shall by leave of a judge of the Supreme Court of Canada lie to that court from (a) the Court of Appeal in the Province of British Columbia.\nThe appellant, on the other hand, claims that such leave is only required in proceedings under the \"Winding-up Act,\" and that the present action does not refer to any such proceedings.\nI see that no such distinction as alleged by the appellant is to be found in sec. 106; that section seems to be of a general nature. It is of importance that proceedings against a company being wound up should be expedited with rapidity, and it is also to be found in the general economy of the \"Winding-up Act\" that legal proceedings should not be taken unless by leave of the courts.\nIt is stated in sec. 18 that proceedings might be taken in any action against a company.\nSec. 22 provides, as I have already said, that no action might be instituted, except with the leave of the court and the same requirements are exacted in the case of appeals. Once the Winding-up order has been given all the legal proceedings are under the control of the courts and must be instituted only with the leave of the courts.\nIn those circumstances, I have come to the conclusion that, the appellant having failed to obtain leave from a judge of this court before proceeding, the appeal should be quashed.\nWe have already decided in the case of Ross v. Ross[25], that the appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada given by sec. 106 of the \"Winding-up Act\" must be brought within 60 days from the date of the judgment appealed from and that after the expiration of the sixty days so stated neither the Supreme Court of Canada nor a judge thereof can grant leave to appeal.\nAs the respondent has not made his motion within the time prescribable by the rules he should be entitled to the costs of his motion only.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Taylor, Harvey, Stockton & Smith.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Cowan, Ritchie & Grant.\n[1] 35 D.L.R. 145.\n[2] 32 D.L.R. 301.\n[3] 4 Drew. 363.\n[4] 21 Ont.

Having discovered that the first statement was untrue he, through his solicitor, wrote to the brokers enclosing money for payment on his purchase, and stating that he was completing it in order not to lose what he had already paid but that he did not waive his right to reparation for deceit and intended to bring action therefor. Later he discovered that the statement of purchase by the railway contractors was also false. In an action claiming rescission and, in the alternative, damages for deceit.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that by the above-mentioned letter, and by making subsequent payments, and offering to exchange some of the lots purchased for others B. had elected not to rescind and the discovery later of the second false representation did not entitle him to rescission as it was of the same nature as, and a fact of, the first.\nHeld, also, Fitzpatrick C.J. dissenting, that he was entitled to damages for deceit. Campbell v. Fleming (1 A. & E. 40) and Boulter v. Stocks (47 Can. S.C.R. 440) discussed.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (24 B.C. Rep. 283) reversed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment on the trial in favour of the defendants.\n[Page 456]The material facts are stated in the above headnote.\nGeo. H. Ross K.C. and Barron for the appellant. As to misrepresentation and the effect of a false statement on the contract, see Smith v. Chadwick [2], Nash v. Calthorpe[3], Shepheard v. Bray[4], and Macleay v. Tait [5].\nThe court may reverse on matters of fact even against the findings of two courts below. Bloomenthal v. Ford[6], Hood v. Eden[7], at page 483, and Polushie v. Zacklynski[8].\nDeceit is established and if rescission cannot be ordered the plaintiff is entitled to damages. Derry v. Peek[9].\nS. S. Taylor K.C. for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\u2014The appellant in the year 1898 was resident in Dawson City, where he carried on \"the clothing business, the jewellery and optician business, the pawn shop business, lending money too;\" in fact, making money any way he could. His attention was first called to the townsite of New Hazelton by the usual flaming advertisements by which a land boom is started. Through the local agent in Dawson he eventually selected and purchased the lots in respect of which he now claims damages, on the ground that he was induced to purchase them by misrepresentation.\nThe record is a terribly voluminous one, but I have read through all the evidence. The purchase, I have no doubt, was a speculative one. It is true that the appellant says that on account of his health he was obliged to leave Dawson City and was looking for a place where he could set up business and make his home, but I do not think he ever regarded New Hazelton as other than the merest possibility of such. Perhaps if the town had grown up with the phenomenal rapidity of Dawson City he might have moved there as well as to Calgary, where he went some three or four years later, or to any other place.\nReally the only substantial misrepresentation put forward in the statement alleged to have been made to him is that many lots in the townsite had already been sold when as a matter of fact they had not been. He has got hold of a nice expression of which he makes repeated use to the effect that he wanted to buy lots in a town and not a piece of prairie at all. This, however, does not accurately represent the facts, because all that he contracted to buy was land within the site of a projected town and he only thought that he had good reason to hope that a town was going to spring up on this site.\nI agree with the trial judge that even on the plaintiff's evidence, which is all that was heard, there is no proof of any intentional misrepresentations made to him and further that any such misrepresentations, if made, were not the inducements which caused him to buy. But, in any event, this, in my opinion, is not a case in which a court of appeal would be justified in reversing the judgment of the trial judge unless upon some clear ground of error shewn. A mere opinion, formed as it must be without the advantages of hearing the evidence of the plaintiff and his witnesses ought not to prevail against the conclusion at which the trial judge has arrived without the least hesitation. It is purely a question of fact that is involved; no one could do more than form an opinion and no one can be in as good a position as the trial judge to draw a fair conclusion from the evidence given before him. The present appeal being from a decision of the provincial Court of Appeal confirming the judgment, its reversal in this court would be the more open to objection.\nIt is perhaps immaterial to point out that a judgment for the plaintiff in this case would involve a good reason for setting aside quite innumerable similar transactions. It seems only common knowledge that those entering on such speculations cannot expect the sober accuracy of expression to be looked for in ordinary and proper business dealings. Enterprises which are held out as promising great fortunes in brief time and with no trouble must always have their attendant risks and uncertainties. It is not for the courts to scrutinize such contracts closely with a view to trying to find a ground for affording relief to those who have lost their money recklessly embarking it in such wild speculation.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nDAVIES J.\u2014After hearing the arguments of counsel and reading the evidence to which they called our attention I have reached the conclusion that this appeal should be allowed and the case should be remitted back to the court to have the damages for deceit assessed. This conclusion is the same as that reached by the dissenting judge, McPhillips J., in the Court of Appeal.\nThe action was one brought by the plaintiff appellant, to rescind certain agreements made by him with the defendants (respondents) for the sale to him of certain lots of land and in the alternative for damages in respect of misrepresentations made by the defendants to the plaintiff which induced him to agree to purchase the lots.\nThe specific misrepresentations alleged were that certain lots in the business section of the townsite of New Hazelton, in which townsite the lots the plaintiff agreed to purchase were situated, were sold to residents of the town of Hazelton which nearly adjoined the townsite of New Hazelton and that certain blocks of lots in the same townsite were sold to Foley, Welch & Stewart, well known as large railway contractors. That as a fact these representations were false and known to the vendors to be so and that they were inducing causes of the plaintiff's purchase.\nThe conclusions I have reached after the argument and reading of the evidence called to our attention were that these representations were false to the knowledge of the plaintiff's agent who carried out the sale and were inducing causes of the plaintiff agreeing to purchase.\nOn this branch of the case I did not entertain any doubt. The only doubt which arose in my mind was whether or not the plaintiff, after learning of the fraud practised upon him, had deliberately elected not to rescind the contract but to claim damages for the deceit which had induced him to purchase.\nI think the letter of plaintiff's legal adviser of the 6th of March, 1914, and the payments of the purchase money made concurrently with that letter and afterwards conclusive evidence that the plaintiff with full knowledge of the gross fraud practised on him had elected to affirm the bargain and confine his claim to damages for the deceit.\nBut it is argued by the appellant's counsel that though the plaintiff should be held to have had knowledge of the gross fraud practised upon him in the false representations made to him as to the sales of other lots knowledge of the full extent of that fraud was not known to him and was not discovered till afterwards. In other words, that while he ought to be held to have known when the letter was written and his election made not to rescind, that the representations as to the purchase by the residents of Old Hazelton of the lots they were represented to have purchased were false and fraudulent, he did not then know and did not discover till after the letter was written that the representations as to the purchase by the railway contractors, Foley, Welch & Stewart, were also false and fraudulent.\nHis conclusion was that the discovery of the fact that Foley, Welch & Stewart had not purchased when made by him entitled him to withdraw his previous election and to rescind.\nI am not able, however, to accept this argument. The false representation as to the purchase made by Foley, Welch & Stewart was only one of several incidents comprising the fraud, and it is not necessary, as Lord Denman says in Campbell v. Fleming [10], that a party\nmust know all the incidents of a fraud before he deprives himself of the right of rescinding.\nAs Patteson J. says at p. 42 of the report of that case:\nThis new discovery can only be considered as strengthening the evidence of the original fraud and it cannot revive the right of repudiation which has once been waived.\nIt is obvious, I think, that whether a new discovery of false representations after the purchaser has elected to affirm the contract must be treated as a mere incident in the fraud or may be determined as justifying revival of the right of repudiation must depend upon the facts of each case and that it is impossible to lay down any definite rule which should govern every case. Much will depend upon whether the several misrepresentations were inter-related or connected. See Ex parte Hale[11]. In the case of Boulter v. Stocks [12], decided by this court some years ago, in which the case of Campbell v. Fleming [13], was distinguished, it was held that an act which, under ordinary circumstances, would be held to amount to an affirmance of a contract to purchase a farm, did not under the circumstances of that case disentitle the plaintiff to rescission. The discovery that the acreage of the farm was very greatly less than the acreage represented by the seller when the contract was entered into was not related to, or connected with certain other representations as to the farm being free from noxious weeds, and as to there being a certain number of apple trees in the orchard. After the representations as to the absence of noxious weeds had been made, and the purchaser knew of their falsity he nevertheless gave a lease of the orchard and thus affirmed his contract to purchase the farm. Afterwards he discovered an enormous discrepancy between the acreage of the farm as represented to him when he purchased it and its actual acreage (some 46 acres), and sought on this ground to rescind the contract. The court held he was not estopped from doing so by his lease of the orchard and its affirmance of his contract to purchase. There was no inter-relation or connection between the representations as to the noxious weeds and the orchard trees and the acreage of the farm and it by no means followed that knowledge of the falsity of the representations as to the noxious weeds and the orchard trees would necessarily have led the purchaser to a positive assurance that he had been the victim of a fraud and that the whole contract had been a deception.\nNow with respect to the appeal before us it does appear to me that there is a direct connection between the representation that some of the lots in the townsite had been sold to a number of the inhabitants of Hazelton and other blocks of the land to Foley, Welsh & Stewart. It was the fact of the sales that was the controlling factor and I do not think it can be successfully argued that after discovery that none of the lots represented as having been sold to the residents of Hazelton were so sold and the deliberate affirmance notwithstanding of his contract of purchase by Barron that he should be permitted, because he later discovered that another alleged purchaser of part of the townsite represented as having purchased blocks of land therein had not done so, can now enable him to repudiate his election to seek compensation by way of damages for deceit and instead obtain rescission of the contract.\nThat conclusion does not affect, of course, the plaintiff's right to recover damages for deceit, and I would therefore allow the appeal and remit the case to the court in British Columbia for the assessment of such damages as plaintiff may have sustained by reason of the deceit practised upon him, with costs in all the courts.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant is the administratrix of the estate of her late husband Joseph D. Barron, who in his lifetime claimed that he had been induced, by material misrepresentations, to buy from respondent Kelly, town lots in a subdivision by him of a section containing six hundred and forty acres which he named Hazelton, and sought herein for the rescission of each of the contracts so induced, or alternatively, for damages.\nThere had long been established a Hudson Bay Company trading post known as Hazelton, some few miles from this section.\nThe line of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway did not touch Hazelton, but passed through said section.\nAs the work of construction of that railway developed it seemed to tempt different sets of speculators to try and found new towns in the district. The respondent Kelly called his subdivision \"New Hazelton.\"\nSome of those interested in the said railway company made another subdivision a few miles further west and called it \"South Hazelton.\" Another adjoining respondent's was projected by someone who called his the \"Hammond Townsite of Hazelton.\"\nThese rival projects developed a struggle for the establishment on each site of the railway station to serve that district.\nThe respondent Kelly brought the claim on behalf of his subdivision before the Railway Commission, and won out. That Board directed, in December, 1911, that a station should be established on his said section 882.\nThe subdivision thereof shewed only two streets of a hundred feet in width. Both ran from east to west. One called 9th Avenue was near the centre of the section and hence likely to become the more important one. It was thus made clear that he planning the townsite expected one or both to be leading thoroughfares in the place.\nRespondent Kelly had at an early stage entrusted the entire management of the selling of lots in New Hazelton thus planned (except some blocks to be presently referred to) to his co\u2014respondents Clements & Heyward, real estate brokers in Vancouver.\nImmediately the decision of the Board was published the firm of Harvey & McKinnon telegraphed from Hazlewood to Clements & Heyward to have a large number of the lots on said Ninth Avenue reserved for them.\nIt is not now pretended in argument or evidence, that they had bought all the lots so reserved, or were supposed to have done so. Yet all the lots so reserved, and many more reserved for other agents elsewhere to sell, were marked on plans distributed for the information of prospective purchasers, by a pencil stroke intended to represent them as sold.\nThe firm of Foley Bro., Welch & Stewart, prominent railway contractors, occupied three blocks of the subdivision whilst carrying on their work of railway construction. It is not explained upon what terms they so occupied them but no one seems to pretend that they had ever in fact purchased them, yet they were all marked off by the pencil stroke as sold.\nThese blocks were never given Clements & Heyward for sale and Heyward says he really did not know what the arrangement with Kelly was under which they were so occupied or why so marked off. One Firth, a general broker in Dawson, in the Yukon, applied to Clements & Heyward for information, and by their reply of 5th February, 1912, was offered the agency in Dawson for selling lots in the subdivision. He responded on the 23rd February, 1912, by telegraph, accepting the agency as follows:\u2014\nLetter fifth received. Agency accepted. Reserve Blocks Ninety, Ninety\u2014one, Hundred two. Forward blue print, literature, full instructions, information business section. They replied same day by letter which contained the following:\u2014\nReply to your wire of even date, we are mailing you a B-P of New Hazelton, Sub-division 882, Section Two, with all the lots sold to date marked off. We are unable to reserve for you the blocks you name in your telegram, but you can look over the B-P and it will give you an idea what lots you can sell and upon receipt of your application we will immediately confirm same if not already sold.\nThe merchants and residents of \"Old\" Hazelton are grouping along 9th Avenue in such blocks as 93, 92, 91, 90, 89, 104, 102, 101, 100 and 99. The blocks 119, 120 and 121, are where the Foley, Welch & Stewart Company have their headquarters located. This will give you an idea of how the town is being formed. The station we fully expect will be erected on the south side of the railway, very close to the centre, somewhere near Templeton or Laurier Streets.\nOn the back of this letter there was written as follows:\u2014\nBlocks marked off with an X are B.C. Government Reserves and not on the market. Lots marked with a stroke thus \/ are sold. Blocks 119, 120 and 121 are held by the Foley, Welsh and Stewart Company, Railway Contractors' headquarters.\nThe advertisement sent by them to Firth for distribution carried on these misrepresentations by such statements as the following:\u2014\nNearly all the business men and residents of the old town of Hazelton and vicinity are investing in the \"KELLY\" Townsite, and they are well pleased with the decision of the Commissioners. Read this telegram, which we assure you is genuine, and the number of lots since sold to them, who know what they are buying, proves its sincerity:\n\"Hazelton, B.C., Dec. 20, '11.\n\"Clements & Heyward,\n\"Vancouver, B.C.\n\"Old Hazelton people delighted Railway Commissioners' decision. Will wire long list of sales tomorrow.\n\"HARVEY & MCKINNON.\"\n***\nBIG LOCAL SALE.\nDuring the past week practically every person in town has purchased lots in New Hazelton. Every day Harvey & McKinnon have wired sales to Vancouver. The business men have taken from one to six lots in what will be the business district, and they are now taking lots in other parts of the town for residential and speculation purposes.\nThe latter will be a strong feature here in the summer and many lots will be turned over at a good profit. The old town is very enthusiastic now that the Railway Commission has settled on the one town.\nArmed with such authority and adequate means and methods of carrying out by fraudulent misrepresentation the sale of lots Firth, at that time I think innocent thereof, approached the deceased Barron, who then and for twelve years or more had carried on business in Dawson, made money and come to desire a less severe climate, and negotiated with him on the basis of the representations he had been thus instructed to contain the truth. He explained to deceased and other possible purchasers the several kinds of marks on the plans, and assured them that those marked with the stroke which stood for sold had already been sold. He succeeded in selling to him by virtue thereof and the respective isolations of Dawson and New Hazelton being such as to render investigation impossible if prompt action was to be taken.\nThe picture of so many actual sales and that so rapidly and especially to many of the people of Old Hazelton who alone of all men must know best the possibilities and probabilities of this newly-founded centre of trade and commerce, indicated that it was prompt action the situation demanded, or nothing.\nThe prompt result as designed and hoped for by means of said misrepresentations was got in the several agreements, now in question, alleged to have been thereby induced.\nThe facts were clearly proven by the books of the respondent Kelly that there had, when the deceased Barron made his first purchase, only been sold some 30 lots out of one hundred and fifty\u2014five represented in manner aforesaid as sold.\nThe learned judge, during the cross-examination of the first witness called for the defence, an- nounced that he saw no use prolonging the trial inasmuch as he had come to the conclusion that the deceased Barron was not induced by any of said misrepresentations to make the purchases he did, and dismissed the action accordingly.\nThe learned judge credited him with being honest in giving his evidence but presumed to find that\nthe inducements which led Mr. Barron to buy were the rosy inducements held out as to the future.\nI am unable to accept such a theory: Not only is it expressly controverted by the sworn testimony of deceased but it is quite inconsistent with the ordinary judgment of men of business, such as deceased was, in venturing to buy that of which they know little or nothing. The rosy inducement of a real estate advertisement counts for little with them compared with alleged concrete facts as they were in this instance assured to have taken place.\nDeceased had been in Dawson since 1898, without once getting out of the Yukon and was dependent, for aught one can see in the evidence, solely upon the general intelligence of men he met there, or newspapers, and upon the representations of the respondents. To assume that such a man would be so foolish as to discard the express statements by respondents of what many other men, including those on the spot, thought of the future, and evidenced by their actual purchases, and rely solely upon the airy nothings put forward at the same time, in the publications of these same respondents, is not, I respectfully submit, a correct method of reasoning or one upon which to found a judicial judgment.\nPerhaps the most potent factor governing the conduct of men in every walk of life, and especially in regard to subjects respecting which they know or can know but little, is their information of what other men, confronted with the like problems they have to solve, have done or are doing relative thereto. Even Firth, whose later conduct relative to the matters in question is not entirely commendable in some respects, discloses in his correspondence how highly improper he thought it would be to represent to possible purchasers lots as sold when they were not in fact sold, in his evidence testifies as follows:\u2014\nQ.\u2014At that time Mr. Barron had a great deal of faith in the townsite? A.\u2014Yes, we all had.\nQ.\u2014And was enthusiastic about it, from the information he had and from the literature which you supplied him? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014And from the sales which were apparently taking place there? A.\u2014Oh, yes, I presume, everything.\nQ.\u2014If a town is selling rapidly it is a great inducement to purchasers to invest? A.\u2014It is, it has its influence, yes.\nHe certainly had the commonsense view of the influence and inducement of previous rapid sales. The callous indifference of respondent Heyward to the consequences of such an act as marking, on the maps which he put in Firth's hands to be used in procuring purchasers, blocks as sold when not a lot therein sold, is well illustrated by his evidence given in examination for discovery as follows:\u2014\nQ.\u2014That would be misleading to an intending purchaser, to find a block marked sold, when it was not sold? A.\u2014That is up to them, I don't know how misleading it might be to somebody, but we never intended it to be misleading.\nThis attitude, of the man directly responsible for the wrong done by issuing such misrepresentations to catch possible purchasers, is not in my view improved by his swearing to the incredible statement that he did not intend it to be misleading. Why did he use such methods? He pretends in such explanation as given elsewhere in his examination that these markings were mere reservations which might possibly result in future sales. But his instructions quoted above, to Firth as a new agent when an entire stranger to the whole business, and to him, were unqualifiedly positive that the lots so marked were sold. It seems to me impossible to justify or excuse in law such conduct.\nI see no reason to doubt the story of the deceased that he accepted as true the gross misrepresentations in question and that but therefor he would not have made a single one of the purchases in question.\nThe only difficulty in the case I have ever had during or since the argument herein, is whether or not the deceased should be held to have elected by the letter of Mr. Congdon to respondents Clements & Heyward, dated 6th March, 1914, wherein he enclosed a post office order for $196.00 on account of purchase price of lots named and said:\u2014\nI have further to advise you that although Mr. Barron is completing his purchase rather than lose the money already paid on the' purchase price before he learned of the false and fraudulent representations made to induce him to purchase, he does not waive his right to insist on reparation for the deceit practised upon him, and proposes to bring an action on account thereof.\nThey in reply of 23rd March, 1914, point out that he had evidently made a mistake by including all the lots named and assumed he only intended to pay on lot 11, block 144, due March 21st, 1914, and add:\u2014\nThis is as per a\/c mailed from here to Mr. Barron on Feb. 17th last.\nThey proceed to apply the money accordingly to the one lot so named and ask \"Is this correct?\"\nThe account so referred to is not in the case. Nor do I find therein any reply to this letter.\nThe letter proceeds to reply to the charge of \"fraudulent representations\" by saying it had been answered by a letter to Mr. Firth of the 17th, and asking him and Mr. Barron to see that letter. I think it is not possible in light of the construction thus put upon Mr. Congdon's letter to those to whom it was addressed to hold it as any election relative to the numerous other contracts in question herein.\nSo far as the exact expression of the letter goes it is to be observed that it uses the singular number both as to \"purchase\" and \"purchase price\" and hence cannot, in any view, by itself be taken as a definite election as to other contracts. And by reason of its ambiguous character when closely examined and illuminated by the respondent's reply, does not seem of as much value in way of election as at first blush I was disposed to attach to it; even as to any single lot.\nMoreover, turning to respondents' pleadings I find the only claims made thereby in respect of waiver or election are as follows:\u2014\n(23) The plaintiff has waived the said alleged misrepresentations and has elected to retain the said lots and each of them. Particulars of said waiver and election are as follows:\n(a) He paid money on account of the purchase price after having knowledge of the alleged misrepresentations.\n(b) He offered the said lots for sale after knowledge of the alleged misrepresentations.\n(c) He applied to the defendants to exchange the said lots for others in the said New Hazelton Townsite after he had knowledge of the alleged misrepresentations.\nThe defendants therefore ask that this action be dismissed with costs.\nObviously the pleader did not attach much importance to the Congdon letter by itself as containing any definite election, and I do not think we should invest it with an importance he failed to find in it. Of course as a piece of such evidence as there may be supporting the pleading it is entitled to due weight. I cannot find that deceased ever had that knowledge, charged in the pleading, of the fraud practised upon him by the misrepresentations which I have referred to above, until after he had made his payment on account, by the remittance of $840 as third payment on lots 1, 2, 3, and 4, Block 97, New Hazelton, on 31st March, 1914. That was the last payment he made. The times for payment extended over four years from the date of each purchase. Then and prior to that time of said remittance he had nothing more that a shrewd suspicion derived from newspaper intelligence as to the progress or rather want of progress in way of building on the lots which had been marked as sold, and a possible purchase from or offer by respondents to sell two or three of the numerous lots which had been marked as sold.\nNo prudent man would think of repudiating contracts as fraudulent, and launching into a sea of litigation, upon such slender basis as deceased had up to then been furnished with. The case of two or three lots sold since he bought might have been susceptible of many explanations when the facts were investigated which would dispel all suspicion of fraud and want of progress in way of building might also have had another explanation.\nWhat deceased did was, in October, 1913, to draw Firth's attention to the fact that he was desirous of obtaining a site on Ninth Avenue to build upon, and proposed exchanging therefor some of what he had bought from respondents.\nFirth wrote on the 7th October, 1913, making them the suggestion, but got no reply. They pretended it never was received but there is reason to doubt the truth of such denial. But if true, then that proposal of exchange can hardly be counted in support of the pleading. There is nothing in the evidence of his complaining then of his suspicions.\nOn the 30th December following he wrote the respondents Clement & Heyward again proposing an exchange and at the same time telling them as follows:\u2014\nIt was represented to me, and to others in Dawson through your agent and literature that 9th Avenue, from Laurier to Pugsley Street, was all sold, but Block 97; so I bought that and more.\nHad the truth been told me, I would not have bought a dollar's worth of property in New Hazelton. On October 7th I called on your agent and told him that I wanted to exchange some lots and to write to you.\nI am positive that he wrote. I have never heard anything from you since.\nNow, I do not want to get into litigation, I will try and settle it between ourselves.\nThese seem to be the proposals for exchange referred to in the above quoted pleadings.\nI am unable to understand why such a proposal so framed as this and avowedly to avoid litigation should be held a definite election to retain what the deceased had been entrapped into buying.\nEven then he had no more than suspicion to go upon. On the 3rd March, 1914, Firth wrote them two letters, one dealing briefly with some other matters besides the Barron business, and at length in regard to that, in which he closes as follows:\u2014\nNow I certainly would like to have you try and arrange some satisfactory deal with Mr. Barron, as he is determined that if this is not done he will commence suit to recover the money paid on the grounds of misrepresentation, and this, as you know, would stir up a lot of trouble and harm, and if it can be avoided within reason I certainly would advise it to be done.\nThe other letter marked \"confidential\" dealt at length with Barron's claim. He begins by intimating Barron was preparing a case against them and warning them against giving information to a party he named, and said was a confidential adviser of Barron. This is very suggestive of the confidence Firth had that Barron was far from being possessed of any actual knowledge of the real facts. Later in same letter he says:\u2014 Personally, I do not believe that Mr. Barron has any case at all, for I cannot bring myself to imagine that a firm of your standing would deliberately mark off any portion of a townsite map as being sold when such was not so.\nIn passing I may remark what a commentary this expression furnishes of Firth's opinion, as a business man, of the worthless nature of the argument put forward that seeks to justify or excuse the fraudulent course of conduct pursued.\nHe urges a settlement. He ends by suggesting the reply should be of a duplex character. One sheet he wants to be confidential and the other so worded that, if necessary, it could be shewn to Mr. Barron.\nHe evidently was suspicious like Barron of what might be disclosed. He also was ignorant as he of the actual facts. He had not the callous courage of respondent Heyward who could answer as he did in evidence quoted above.\nIf Firth was ignorant and groping in the dark, even at that late date, how can we impute to Barron greater knowledge and say that the Congdon letter was written with that knowledge which would make it an effectual election? That was written only three days later. I see no reason to doubt the evidence of the deceased that it was not until he had, within a month thereafter, received a reply dated 30th March, 1914, to an inquiry of his dated 4th March from the publisher of the Omineca \"Herald,\" published at New Hazelton, telling that on Ninth Avenue, so far as he could learn, there had been no lots sold between Pugsley and Laurier Streets until recently, that he really became possessed of some actual reliable information of the magnitude of the misrepresentations conveyed by the respondents' plans, marking as sold the central properties so marked. Then he was told by Mr. Congdon that if he had known what was thus disclosed he should have advised against his sending the remittance above mentioned. He seems accordingly to have decided to pay nothing more.\nIn short he seems thereafter to have awaited results. I can see nothing, therefore, in support of the grounds pleaded as defence set forth above. And the advertisement and its reason as explained by deceased is in itself not worth labouring with.\nThe respondents took no action to recover the next payment when due.\nIn August, 1915, he left the Yukon and on his way out learned that none of the lots in the three blocks partly occupied by Foley Bros., Welch & Stewart, as above mentioned, had been sold though as already stated marked off on the plans as sold.\nThis action was started shortly afterwards. I think he has sufficiently answered the plea of having waived the right to rescission or (perhaps more correctly designated) of having made an election to abide by his purchases.\nIndeed it rested upon the respondents to prove knowledge on his part of the fraud when doing anything such as they charge as an election in order to entitle them to succeed in such defences as set up under that head. This they have failed to establish.\nMere delay or laches as has been often said short of falling within the Statute of Limitations is no bar to an action for rescission. It may be and often has been found so coupled with acts which have induced the vendor to change his position, or with circumstances, which in themselves evidence knowledge and election, as to disentitle him seeking rescission to claim such relief.\nIt was in substance said in the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of the Lindsay Petroleum Co. v. Hurd [14], and in like manner re-affirmed by the judgment of Lord Penzance in the case of Erlanger v. New Sombrero Phosphate Co.[15], that the contract having been induced by fraud and he defrauded, having the right to repudiate it when, if ever, it became a question in defence against the assertion of such a right, whether or not his refraining from doing so, had noc waived his right or elected to abide by the contract, that the burden of proof of knowledge of the fraud and time of acquiring same rested upon the party setting up such a defence.\nLord Cairns who doubted the decision of the majority in the latter case did not dissent from such proposition but pointed out these things on the surface, as it were, which might be held to constitute knowledge at the outset or shortly after.\nIn like manner a shareholder in Whitehouse's Case[16] having observed a discrepancy between the articles of association and the prospectus and withdrawn, yet paid thereafter a call, could not be held entitled on later discovering another discrepancy, to claim relief, because evidently the whole means of knowledge lay in the documents which he had first relied on and must have read.\nAgain in this case the respondent Kelly counterclaimed for specific performance and was adjudged so entitled.\nI am of the opinion that the courts below erred both in the refusal to rescind and in directing specific performance.\nI cannot assent to the view of the law taken below, except by Mr. Justice McPhillips who held deceased was entitled to damages. Derry v. Peek [17], had, I respectfully submit, when relied upon herein, been misapprehended. Derry v. Peek [18], clarified the law of deceit and obliterated some judicial refinements. Fraud, however, still remains fraud. That decision neither changed the moral law nor enabled men who deliberately or recklessly committed a fraud to free themselves from the charge by swearing they did not intend to mislead, nor yet did it absolve from liability the honest and ignorant principal whose trust had been such as to enable him he trusted as his agent to succeed in bringing into their respective coffers the money of others.\nIf I could not see my way to granting rescission I should certainly hold the appellant entitled to damages.\nI need not pursue that inquiry for the claim to damages is made only alternatively and not cumulatively as it was and maintained in the recent case of Goldrei, Foucard & Son v. Sinclair[19].\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout, the contracts be rescinded and the money paid by deceased repaid with interest.\nANGLIN J.\u2014A plaintiff claiming relief in respect of a contract on the ground that he was induced to enter into it by fraudulent misrepresentation, who has failed to convince either the trial judge or a majority of the judges of a provincial appellate court that he is entitled to judgment, can rarely hope to succeed on a further appeal to this court. The difficulty of demonstrating in such a case that there has been clear and manifest error in the findings of both the lower courts\u2014the sine qua non of a reversal\u2014is always very great and usually insuperable. Nevertheless, when convinced that such error has been demonstrated, our duty to reverse and to give the judgment which the provincial appellate court should have given is unquestionable. The right of appeal to this court is upon questions of fact as well as upon those of law. Hood v. Eden[20].\nIn the present case the evidence of the making of the representations that practically all the lots on 9th Avenue for half a mile had been sold to residents of Old Hazelton, and that lots on Pugsley Street for a like distance and the blocks 119, 120 and 121 had also been sold is so overwhelming, their misleading effect is so obvious and their materiality so clear that\u2014I say it with all due respect\u2014upon none of these points does there seem to be the slightest room for doubt. That there was actual dishonest intent is, I think, abundantly proved; that there was \"what in the view of a Court of Equity amounts to fraud\" (Dimmock v. Hallett[21], is beyond question. No good purpose would be served by detailing or discussing the proof. I would merely remark that if one were disposed to question the plaintiff's story, notwithstanding its corroboration in material particulars by other witnesses, Firth's letter of the 3rd of March, 1914, the materiality of which the learned trial judge appears to have been unable to appreciate, would remove all scepticism.\nThat the representations complained of in fact operated on the mind of the plaintiff as inducements would be a fair inference from their manifest materiality. His explicit testimony that but for them he would not have made the impugned purchases, credible in itself, is certainly not weakened by the trial judge's statement that he\nwould not suggest that Mr. Barron is not honestly telling his belief.\nI find nothing in the evidence to support the opinion that \"he (Barron) would have bought just the same\" and that he had \"honestly argued himself into that idea (that he would not have purchased had he known the truth) years after the event.\" Indeed I am at a loss to account for this view of the learned judge, unless it should be ascribed to the influence upon his mind of his attitude towards actions such as this, expressed by himself to be that \"of a doubting Thomas.\" Perhaps one should not be surprised, however. The learned judge also felt himself\ninclined to think there was no intentional misrepresentation.\nThe two learned appellate judges who upheld the judgment dismissing the action appear to have given to the findings of the trial judge what I cannot but think was, under the circumstances, undue weight.\nNo doubt in making his purchases the plaintiff took into account other matters such as his idea as to the probable location of the railway station. But, having regard to the fact that, if the defendants' representations as to sales had been true, he would have been buying desirable building lots in a town of assured prosperity and immediate growth, whereas if false (as they were), his purchases would be practically on the prairie, their materiality is so palpable and their influence would ordinarily be so preponderating that it is almost impossible to conceive that they had not some effect as inducing causes. It is trite law that it is not necessary that other inducements should be wholly excluded. Beckman v. Wallace[22].\nIt is also elementary that a party misled by such misrepresentations as the evidence here establishes has, upon discovery of their falsehood, the choice of repudiating his contract\u2014and (if restitutio in integrum be practicable) he may thereupon claim the equitable relief of rescission with reimbursement\u2014or of affirming it and pursuing the common law remedy of damages in an action of deceit. The present plaintiff seeks rescission. He claims damages only alternatively, i.e., if not entitled to rescission. His right to this alternative relief, although he should have lost his right to rescission, is, in my opinion, incontestible.\nThe defendants assert that, with knowledge of the falsity of the misrepresentations on which he relies, the plaintiff definitely elected to affirm the contracts in question and to claim damages and is, therefore, disentitled to rescission. This feature of the case has occasioned me some trouble. The evidence of the alleged election to affirm consists in a letter written by the plaintiff's solicitor at Dawson to the defendants Clements & Heyward, on the 6th of March, 1914, accompanied by a payment of $196 on account of moneys due under the contracts, and other acts about the same time\u2014a further payment of $840 on account, a proposal to exchange the lots purchased for others on 9th Avenue, and the publication of an advertisement asking offers for the lots. These other acts are less distinctly unequivocal than the letter, and if, owing to the circumstances under which it was written, it should be held not to afford conclusive evidence of a binding election not to seek rescission, they probably might be disregarded. In the letter it is stated that the plaintiff\nin completing his purchase rather than lose the money already paid on the purchase price before he learned of the false and fraudulent representations made to induce him to purchase, *** does not waive his right to insist on reparation for the deceit practised upon him, and proposes to bring an action on account thereof.\nIf the plaintiff, when this letter was written, had full knowledge of all the material facts entitling him to rescission, I regard it as conclusive evidence of an election on his part to forego rescission and to rely upon his remedy in damages for deceit. Whatever might be said had it been written by the plaintiff himself without professional advice, such a letter written with full knowledge by a solicitor imports affirmance of the contracts involving a deliberate choice between the two remedies which he must be taken to have known were open.\nBut the extent of the plaintiff's knowledge of the material facts is challenged. His story is that when his solicitor's letter was written, while he more than gravely suspected, he had no direct evidence that most of the lots on 9th Avenue had been unsold when he was induced to purchase. See 20 Halsbury's L. of E., page 749, note (b); Bower on Misrepresentation, page 269; and Carrique v. Catts[23]. The letter, however, is written not on a basis of suspicion but of actual knowledge and I incline to think the plaintiff's rights may not unfairly be determined on the footing that when he instructed the writing of it, he had such knowledge that the representation in regard to the sale of the 9th Avenue lots was false at the time it was made. Whitehouse's Case[24]. He swears, however, and his evidence is uncontradicted, that while he then believed it probable that the 9th Avenue lots had not been sold when he made his purchases, he was at the date of the solicitor's letter still under the impression that they had been subsequently sold. If that had been the fact of course the lots held by him would have been more desirable and of greater value, and his willingness to keep them and seek damages only may have resulted from his belief that it was so. According to his. story, which seems not improbable[Page 481]\nand stands uncontradicted, he learned positively that many of the 9th Avenue lots still remained unsold only in the middle, or towards the end, of April, on receipt of Mr. C. H. Sawle's letter of the 30th of March, 1914, written in answer to inquiry. This, however, was rather a fact which would influence him in making his election, than a fact which would give rise to his right to make it. Ignorance of it would not suffice to render revocable an election otherwise binding. See Ewart on Waiver Distributed, pages 72-76. The last payment made by the plaintiff was of $840, on the 31st of March, 1914. He says he made it because his solicitor had told him he would have a better chance to sue if he made prompt payments. He apparently had no suspicion throughout 1914 that blocks 119-121 had been unsold when he made his contracts of purchase. His letters of complaint and inquiry contain no reference to them. His testimony is that he first learned that these blocks had not been sold in August, 1915, when en route from Skagway to Vancouver returning from Dawson. This action was begun on the 7th of October, following.\nWhile the reading of the evidence left an impression on my mind that the plaintiff was much more affected in making his purchases by the alleged sales of the 9th Avenue lots to Old Hazelton people than by the misrepresentation as to the sale of blocks 119-121, yet I have found neither explicit testimony, nor anything to warrant the inference that his sworn testimony is untrue when he swears that, had he known that those blocks were not actually sold to, but were merely temporarily occupied by Foley, Welch & Stewart, he \"would have stopped there\" and would not have bought in New Hazelton. In other words, there is nothing to justify a conclusion that his belief that blocks 119-121 were actually sold did not in itself influence his conduct in making the purchases as an inducing cause. Fraudulent misrepresentation in a matter prim\u00e2 facie material and likely to operate as an inducement having been shewn by the plaintiff, the onus of satisfying the court that it did not in fact so operate is certainly cast upon the defendants. They have not discharged that burden. Had they done so in regard to the representation as to blocks Nos. 119-121, the present case would have been clearly distinguishable from Boulter v. Stocks[25].\nOn the other hand, the appellant's case is put by his counsel, at the beginning of their factum, in this form:\u2014\nThe specific misrepresentation alleged is that the defendants represented that certain lots in the business section of the townsite of New Hazelton were sold, when in point of fact such lots were not sold, thereby inducing the plaintiff to purchase eight lots in the said townsite.\nViewed thus it was substantially a single misrepresentation of development in the business section that induced the appellant to purchase. If so, the reason which led him to believe that the representation as to the sale of the 9th Avenue lots had been untrue, and satisfied him that he had been the victim of false and fraudulent misrepresentations, as his solicitor's letter asserts, should have made him realize that the whole scheme was one of deception. His own letter of the 30th December, 1913, and his solicitor's letter of the 6th of March, 1914, are susceptible of an interpretation indicating that he did so. If he did, the present case is brought within Campbell v. Fleming [26], distinguished by this court in Boulter v. Stocks [27], and the misrepresentation in regard to blocks 119-121 should be regarded not as a distinct fraud, but merely as \"a new incident in the fraud.\" That, said Patteson J., can only be considered as strengthening the evidence of the original fraud and it cannot revive the right of repudiation which has been waived.\n\"There is no ground\" says Lord Denman, \"for saying that a party must know of all the incidents of a fraud before he deprives himself of the right of rescission.\"\nSee too Whitehouse's Case [28].\nI have found some difficulty, however, in distinguishing this case from Boulter v. Stocks[29]. The fact, had it been true, that three entire blocks had been purchased by such large railway contractors as Foley, Welch & Stewart might well indicate to a man like Barron that large railway \"shops\" would probably be located permanently on them and would contribute materially to the rapid growth and prosperity of the new town. If so it would almost seem that the misrepresentation as to that purchase might be deemed of a distinctive character, quite as much so as was that as to the acreage in Boulter v. Stocks[30]. While I bow to the authority of that decision, I am not satisfied that, if a member of the court, I should have concurred in it. It appears to rest upon the view expressed by Mr. Justice Davies that (before the lease there relied upon as evidencing an election to affirm the contract had been executed)\nthe facts brought to the plaintiff's knowledge from time to time as he began cultivating the land in the spring, as to the dirty condition of the soil and the presence of large quantities of noxious weeds, would (not) of themselves be sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff that the sale of the farm to him was a fraud and a deception. The evidence was of a character, no doubt, to raise grave and serious doubts in his mind as to whether he had not been deceived in the transaction, but nothing more;\nand, as put by Mr. Justice Duff,\nHe (the plaintiff) may have had his suspicions as to Boulter's entire honesty, but it is quite clear that the possibility in shortages in acreage had not then occurred to him and he had no suspicion that the whole transaction had been on Boulter's part the swindle that it ultimately proved to be. It would probably seem to him to be most unlikely that the misrepresentations as to the number of apple trees\u2014so easy to expose\u2014had been made deliberately and as to the prevalence of noxious weeds that is a matter respecting which he may well have thought some exaggeration was to be expected. I think the evidence is quite consistent with the view that his discoveries in regard to these matters did not bring home to his mind a conviction that a fraud had been practised upon him such as would entitle him to impeach the sale.\nHere, on the contrary, the plaintiff in his own letter of the 30th December, 1913, after stating the representations made to him, says:\u2014\nHad the truth been told me I would not have bought a dollar's worth.\nIn Firth's confidential letter of March 3rd to the defendants, Clements & Heyward, so much relied upon by the plaintiff for other purposes, it is stated\nAs intimated, Mr. Barron is positively preparing a case against you for misrepresentation on account of marking off all the 9th Avenue lots as being sold when in reality they were not.\nThe nature of the charge made is indicated in these words:\nPersonally I do not believe that Mr. Barron has any case at all, for I cannot bring myself to imagine that a firm of your standing would deliberately mark off any portion of a townsite map as being sold when such was not so.\nIn the plaintiff's solicitor's letter of March 6th', he speaks of \"the false and fraudulent representations made to induce him to purchase\" and of \"the deceit practised upon him.\" That Barron then believed he had been the victim of a fraud is scarcely open to question. The case at bar therefore may probably be distinguished on this ground from Boulter v. Stocks[31].\nHaving regard to all the circumstances I have, not without some hesitation, reached the conclusion that the defendants have sufficiently shewn an election by the plaintiff which is a bar to his exercising the right of rescission.\nI have not taken the evidence of the witness Quinn into consideration at all. That, in my opinion, was the only proper course to follow since the learned trial judge saw fit to close the case before the cross-examination of that witness had been completed and thereupon delivered judgment dismissing the action.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and judgment should be entered for the plaintiff (by revivor) for recovery of damages, to be assessed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia upon a reference to the proper officer according to the usual practice of that court, for the deceit practised upon the original plaintiff in inducing him to purchase the properties described in the several agreements mentioned in the statement of claim.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014This is an action for the rescission of a certain agreement for sale of lots of land in New Hazleton or, in the alternative, in damages for deceit.\nNew Hazelton is a new townsite which was subdivided during the construction of the Grand Trunk Pacific. It was expected that a railway station would be erected at that place and Robert Kelly, the respondent, bought a large tract of land which he subdivided into lots and offered for sale. Clement & Heyward, a firm of real estate agents in Vancouver, were instructed by Kelly to make the sale of those lots and they, in their turn, appointed different Sub-agents in different towns of the West.\nThe Sub-agent they appointed in Dawson City was a man named Firth and they sent him a map shewing the townsite and several lots were marked on this map with a stroke. It is claimed by the plaintiff, Barron, who asks for rescission, that it was represented falsely to him that these lots so marked were sold and that he bought the nearest ones on the strength of those misrepresentations.\nOn the other hand, the defendants (respondents) claim that it was not represented that those lots were sold but simply reserved for sale or selected by some intending purchaser.\nThe trial judge found that there was no intentional misrepresentation and his judgment has been affirmed by a majority in the Court of Appeal. This is an appeal from that decision. The main point in the case is whether or not there has been misrepresentation.\nThe appellant has proved, not only by himself but by some other witnesses, that the agent, Firth, has represented to him that the lots on 9th Avenue nearest to the station had been taken. That representation is confirmed by the written evidence which was presented in the case. Firth had received a map of the townsite from his principals, Clement & Heyward, and it was stated on that map that the lots in question had been sold. Then, it is no wonder that the agent, in selling those lots to the plaintiff, would have represented that those lots had been actually disposed of.\nIt is in evidence, on the other hand, that, as a question of fact, they had not been sold. Proposals of sale might have been made but no actual agreement for sale had taken place. We all realize that such a representation might have induced the plaintiff to purchase some other lots in the neighbourhood when he saw that within a very short time so large a number of lots had been taken up by purchasers living in the neighbourhood, and consequently better posted as to the prospects of the place. The plaintiff was then living very far from there, could not very easily com- municate with the place and had no other information than what was conveyed to him by the respondent's representative.\nIt cannot be claimed that those representations were not of a fraudulent nature because why should the respondent state that those lots had been sold when, as a question of fact, they were still under their control? Why not represent the facts as they were, if they had simply reserved those lots for being sold by their agent at New Hazelton?\nThe only conclusion which I can reach is that there were misrepresentations and that those misrepresentations were fraudulent and induced the plaintiff to purchase the lots in question. There would be then no question as to the rescission, if the plaintiff, after being apprised of those misrepresentations, did not find it advisable to make some payments and to waive the right which he had for rescission.\nBy a letter which his counsel wrote to the respondent on the 6th March, 1914, he declared himself ready to complete his purchase; but did not waive his right to insist on reparation for the deceit practised upon him and proposed to bring an action on account thereof. If it were not for such a letter I would not hesitate to grant his action for rescission, but he should be all the same entitled to damages for deceit.\nThe judgment appealed from should be set aside; the appeal should be allowed and there should be judgment for the appellant for damages for deceit and an inquiry should be had to assess those damages.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Bowser, Reid, Wallbridge, Douglas & Gibson.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Russell, Macdonald & Hancox.\n[1] 24 B.C.

Archambault, (1918) 56 S.C.R. 488\nDate: 1918-05-07\nDame Mary Maher and Others (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nJoseph Archambault (Defendant) Respondent.\n1918: April 17; 1918: May 7.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF KING'S BENCH, APPEAL SIDE, PROVINCE OF QUEBEC.\nPartition\u2014Limitation:\u2014Parties\u2014Irregularity\u2014Second action in partition\u2014Arts. 1038, 1185 C.P.Q.\nThe father of the appellants, co-heir owner of a lot of land, was not made a party to a suit for partition, as prescribed by art. 1038 C.P.Q., apparently on account of his insanity and his absence from Canada. The respondent became the detenteur of the lot through sales following such licitation. The appellants, alleging the above nullity, took another action in partition against the respondent.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that the judgment entered in the first partition proceedings should have been first set aside on the ground of nullity before a second action in partition could be taken; and such relief cannot be granted in the present action as all the parties to the first proceedings are not before the court.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, and dismissing the plaintiffs' action with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nF. J. Laverty K.C. for the appellants.\nJ. O. Lacroix K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014I am of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs. Davies J.\u2014I will not dissent from the judgment proposed to be given by a majority of my colleagues confirming the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, Quebec, though I entertain grave and strong doubts as to its correctness.\nIdington J. (dissenting)\u2014The appellants claim that their late father Edouard Trudel who was admittedly owner of a share of certain lands in the Province of Quebec died without parting with such ownership and that respondent is the owner of the remaining shares therein and seek to have a partition or sale of said lands.\nThe respondent claims as heir or devisee of one Desparois whose title (if any) in or to the share of the appellants' father in said lands rests entirely upon certain alleged proceedings taken for partition resulting in an alleged licitation.\nEdouard Trudel had lived and married in New York State and become insane long before said proceedings and so continued during same and for many years until his death.\nArt. 1038 C.P.Q. provides that:\n1038. All the co-heirs or co-proprietors must be parties in the suit for a partition.\nThis seems imperative. Edouard Trudel was not made a party. A consent judgment sanctioned only by those owning other shares was entered. Later on upon it being discovered, as it must have been known to those acting, if care taken, that he was entitled to the share now claimed, an irregular entry was made on the cahier de charges that for his share of proceeds he would be entitled to claim. There is nothing to connect deceased with this particularly unauthorized proceeding. Nor is there even the shadow of pretence for it in law, but later on, through steps taken by one or more of the parties concerned, the wife of deceased was improperly induced to accept a sum of money pretended to be proceeds of the sale and hence it is pretended the appellant and her children are bound thereby.\nNo curator was ever appointed for him in Quebec. By a New York Court his wife was afterwards appointed his committee.\nIt is proven by expert testimony that by the law of New York this gave her no authority in respect of the sale of his real estate. She could collect rents of real estate but that is as far as her authority went even in New York State.\nAssuming for the moment that a foreign state where his land was could recognise her power in that respect, there was no such recognition or direction given by any one having power to give ft in Quebec. Nor does it seem very clear what could have been done in that way.\nI am unable, therefore, to understand how such proceedings can be held otherwise than a nullity so far as the share of the deceased was concerned.\nThis court, in the case of Serling v. Levine[2], held that the minor who was sued without a tutor being named and shortly afterwards came of age, and then had acted in many ways in such a manner as to induce some of us to hold that he had waived the right to object to the want of a tutor at the initiation of the proceedings, could not complain of such absence of a tutor. Instead of defying and disregarding the court when he came of age, he had submitted and acted in many ways that some of us thought precluded him from insisting upon such an objection.\nThe court above, however, overruled us, and held the whole proceedings a nullity[3].\nThe acts and submissions of the defendant in that case after his majority (which if memory serves me were more than detailed in the judgment of my brother Brodeur) seem to me to have been more important in the way of overcoming the initial difficulty than anything relied upon herein as done by the committee of the insane person in the way of ratification.\nIn principle I cannot distinguish that case from this in regard to the question of nullity.\nThere are many reasons why an insane man should be more jealously protected than an infant of somewhat mature years at least.\nThe law seems to make no distinction.\nIt seems idle to suggest that the proceedings are different, especially in face of the imperative language of the article I have just quoted. And in view of the fact that the first step to inquire as to in a partition suit is whether or not partition can advantageously be accomplished. See Art. 698 C.C. and 1040 C.P.Q., and other articles in each of the respective sections where they appear.\nIt so happens in most cases all the steps thus indicated as possible are needless, for a mere glance at the circumstances so demonstrates the situation and sensible people act accordingly and proceed to licitation.\nThey proceeded in this instance by a consent judgment, but who consented?\nThe folly of disregarding the article requiring all co-heirs or co-proprietors to be made parties became apparent in this instance for the consent should never have been given because one of the parties who should have been joined therein was in an insane asylum without a curator or committee. If that had been disclosed no doubt the judgment never would have been entered.\nThe conduct of someone was at fault and no need for harsh words, but yet it seems quite incomprehensible without suspecting someone of at least crass negligence.\nTo maintain such a proceeding it seems to me would be putting a premium on worse conduct in the like cases.\nHaving considered all the articles of the Civil Code and Code of Procedure cited to us, and many others, I do not see the necessity for elaborating the matter.\nThe case of Bank of Montreal v. Simson[4], illustrates how the law in Quebec has always looked at the interest of minors and the limited powers of tutors in regard to certain classes of property held by the minor.\nCurators stand in the same position relative to any powers they may have unless when expressed otherwise.\nAnd when we contemplate the shadow of one as it were acting by reason of an analogous appointment in a foreign state and not renominated under the law of the country where an immoveable is in question, I fail to be able to attach any importance to her acts or omissions as having any bearing upon what is really involved.\nAnd the importance sought to be drawn herein from what was done as if judicially done, suggests I should refer the inquiring mind to the case of Davis v. Kerr[5], at page 244, where Taschereau J. is reported as making some pertinent remarks which might well be applied to some things done or permitted in the proceedings in question herein.\nHolding the entire proceedings a nullity so far as the share of the deceased was concerned, I need not trouble myself as to the possibility or propriety of taking another course than that taken by those instituting the proceedings.\nNor do I see any difficulty in regard to the proof of the marriage of deceased and legitimacy of the appellants. Much less has been acted upon judicially.\nIndeed I respectfully submit if the ground taken by the court below and in respondent's argument that the original record was quite regular and the adjudication therein valid and the appellants' action denying positions so groundless as these suggested I do not see why that feature of the case and the utterly void conduct of the committee in what she did as representing the court in New York should be laboured with or given prominence as it is at every turn in both judgment and argument.\nThe English system relative to the insane and their property of which New York law is, as it were, the heir, does not furnish quite as much safeguarding or restriction as the French system in force in Quebec relative to the appointment of a guardian called in the one a \"committee\" and in the other a \"curator.\" The results are surprisingly alike, though possibly differing in origin and mode of appointment.\nBut in the last analysis the entire power of a committee of a lunatic is statutory and there is not a vestige of authority in the state of New York to maintain that which the wife of deceased was induced to assume. And it does not require much penetration to discern by whom and why she was so induced. Inasmuch as the principle upon which a licitation sale is rendered by Art. 1054 C.P.Q., in its results analogous to the effect of a sheriff's sale, our decision in the case of Leroux v. McIntosh[6], may be worth considering.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs here and below and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored.\nSince writing the foregoing the case has been re-argued but I see no reason for changing my opinion as the result thereof.\nAnglin J.\u2014We have heard this appeal argued twice. While careful consideration of it on each occasion has not entirely dissipated all doubt in my mind whether the conclusion of the learned trial judge\u2014at all events in so far as it established the title of the plaintiffs other than Mary Maher\u2014should not be restored for the reasons stated by him and by Mr. Justice Cross, I am not convinced that the several judgments entered in the partition proceedings, through which the defendant claims title, must not first be set aside, That relief, if sought, could not properly be granted in this action in which the parties to those proceedings are not before the court.\nAlthough it is expressly provided by art. 1038 C.P.Q.\nthat all the co-heirs or co-proprietors must be parties in the suit for a partition,\nit is conceded that there was no representation whatever of the interest of Edouard Trudel, one of the coheirs, in the partition proceedings until after the property had been sold and the record shews that neither he nor his foreign curatrix was made a party to them at any stage.\nI am by no means satisfied that under the law of the Province of Quebec a foreign curatrix or committee of a lunatic, who, according to the law of the forum of her appointment, was not authorized to dispose of his real property, could, by her approval and ratification of proceedings already had for the sale of the lunatic's interest, vest it in the purchaser. If she could, I question whether the terms of the power of attorney given by her to Mr. Prefontaine would enable him to give such approval or ratification on her behalf, or to represent her in the proceedings subsequent to its date. He does not appear to have had any other authority. As a matter of fact, although Edouard Trudel's interest as a co-heir was brought to the attention of the court, as appears from the cahier des charges, as already stated, neither he, nor his committee or curatrix, was ever joined as a party to the proceedings.\nIt is only\nafter the observance of all the formalities above required,\nincluding the joinder of all co-heirs or co-proprietors as parties, as prescribed by art. 1038, that the adjudication, under art. 1054 C.P.Q., transfers the property. Whatever there may be in the nature of an estoppel against the plaintiff, Mary Maher, the curatrix, by reason of her receipt and retention of the moneys representing her husband's share of the proceeds of the sale does not affect her co-plaintiffs. Nor, so far as I am aware, have their rights been extinguished by the expiry of any period of prescription.\nYet, while it may be a little difficult to understand on what ground a judgment pronounced in a proceeding to which neither he, nor any person representing or in privity of estate with him was a party, should be held so far binding on the owner of an interest in property that he is obliged to have it set aside before asserting his title in the courts against a person whom he finds in possession and claiming ownership, the procedure provided for by art. 1185 C.P.Q. et seq. would seem to indicate that this is necessary. On this ground alone, therefore, though not without hesitation, I concur in the dismissal of this appeal.\nBrodeur J.:\u2014La pr\u00e9sente action en partage est mal dirig\u00e9e contre le d\u00e9fendeur Archambault. Ce dernier, d'apr\u00e8s le demandeur, serait le d\u00e9tenteur d'un lot de terre qui appartenait jadis \u00e0 la succession Trudel et qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 vendu en 1893 par l'autorit\u00e9 judiciaire sur action en partage. La demanderesse pr\u00e9tend que cette vente judiciaire est nulle parce que son mari, l'un des h\u00e9ritiers, n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement mis en cause.\nIl appert par les proc\u00e9dures qui ont amen\u00e9 cette vente qu'Edouard Trudel, le mari de la demanderesse, n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9 comme l'une des parties. Plusieurs ann\u00e9es auparavant quelques-uns de ses fr\u00e8res avaient dispos\u00e9 de ses int\u00e9r\u00eats dans la propri\u00e9t\u00e9, vu qu'il \u00e9tait incapable de vaquer \u00e0 ses affaires et qu'il \u00e9tait alors dans un asile d'ali\u00e9n\u00e9s. Le tout para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 fait par ses fr\u00e8res avec la meilleure foi du monde et dans son meilleur int\u00e9r\u00eat.\nLa part qu'il avait \u00e9tait de peu de valeur. Cela avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait \u00e9videmment pour \u00e9viter des frais. A tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement lorsque le cahier des charges sur l'action en partage de 1893 fut pr\u00e9par\u00e9, on a d\u00fb d\u00e9couvrir que la vente des droits d'Edouard Trudel \u00e9tait nulle et alors on a ins\u00e9r\u00e9 une clause dans les conditions de vente par laquelle les droits d'Edouard Trudel \u00e0 un onzi\u00e8me indivis de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9taient reconnus. Des proc\u00e9dures furent prises par la demanderesse pour se faire nommer curatrice \u00e0 son mari et pour retirer sa part dans le prix de vente.\nLa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 fut vendue par la cour. La demanderesse toucha la somme qui repr\u00e9sentait les droits de son mari. La propri\u00e9t\u00e9 passa entre les mains de divers acqu\u00e9reurs; et, suivant la demanderesse, le d\u00e9fendeur Archambault en serait maintenant le propri\u00e9taire. Elle le poursuit en partage en all\u00e9guant que le premier partage est nul.\nIl est de principe \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire que les parties ne peuvent intenter une nouvelle action pour sortir de l'indivision tant que la nullit\u00e9 de la premi\u00e8re vente n'est pas prononc\u00e9e. Baudry-Lacantinerie, vol. 8, No. 3513; Demolombe, vol. 15, No. 518.\nMaintenant contre qui cette action en nullit\u00e9 doit-elle \u00eatre dirig\u00e9e? Est-ce contre le d\u00e9tenteur de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 ou contre ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 partie au partage?\nCette premi\u00e8re vente constitue un contrat judiciaire qui, comme les autres contrats, est susceptible dans certains cas d'\u00eatre annul\u00e9 ou d'\u00eatre nul. L'action en nullit\u00e9 attaque un contrat qui est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 avoir r\u00e9uni le concours de tous les h\u00e9ritiers. Je consid\u00e8re que cette action doit \u00eatre dirig\u00e9e contre tous les co-partageants. Duranton, vol. 7, No. 584; Demolombe, vol. 17, No. 457; Aubry & Rau, vol. 6, p. 577; Laurent, vol. x, No. 497.\nAvant d'instituer la pr\u00e9sente action, il \u00e9tait donc du devoir de la demanderesse de se pr\u00e9senter devant les tribunaux et de r\u00e9clamer, en pr\u00e9sence de ses coh\u00e9ritiers, la nullit\u00e9 du contrat auquel ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 partie en 1895, lors de la premi\u00e8re action en partage.\nIl peut se soulever entre ces co-h\u00e9ritiers des d\u00e9bats de comptes et partages qui pourraient an\u00e9antir ses droits dans l'immeuble en question en cette cause-ci.\nIl me semble que la demanderesse, avant d'attaquer Archambault, devra s'adresser \u00e0 ses co-h\u00e9ritiers.\nLa Cour d'Appel a donc bien jug\u00e9 en renvoyant son action.\nL'appel est renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Blais, Laverty & Hale.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

C.R. 104), was allowed, Davies and Idington JJ. dissenting.\nIn a grant from the Crown of a water-lot to the appellants' predecessor in title, it was provided for the resumption of it by the Crown at any time for purposes of public improvement upon giving twelve months' notice in writing of its intention to exercise that right.\nPer Anglin, Brodeur and Lavergne JJ.\u2014The Crown, by instituting expropriation proceedings in respect of this water-lot, elected not to exercise its right of resumption.\nSuch right, having been vested in the Quebec Harbour Commissioners under 22 Vict. c. 32, does not form part of the Crown domain, notwithstanding their public character and the nature of their trust.\nPer Brodeur and Lavergne JJ.\u2014This right, not having been exercised for a period of over thirty years, was extinguished by prescription under art. 2242 C.C. Anglin J. contra.\nPer Davies and Idington JJ. dissenting.\u2014The appeal should be dismissed as the appellants have no reason to complain of the amount of compensation allowed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], rendered in expropriation proceedings taken by respondent. The material circumstances of the case and the questions of law in issue on the present appeal are stated in the head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nLafleur K.C. and St. Laurent K.C. for the appellants.\nGibsone K.C. for the respondent His Majesty The King.\nDobell for the respondent the Quebec Harbour Commissioners.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014I would dismiss this appeal and confirm the judgment of the Exchequer Court with costs with a small variation arising out of an admitted error of $2,000 made by the learned judge in allowing twice over for the 6,335 square feet, being the block conveyed to the R. C. Bishop.\nThe judgment should be reformed by deducting this $2,000.\nIdington J. (dissenting).\u2014I do not see that the appellant has any reason to complain of the amount of compensation allowed and therefore would dismiss his appeal with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014No appeal has been taken against the valuation of $20,049 placed by the learned judge of the Exchequer Court upon the expropriated wharves. The parties interested have also agreed that compensation for a strip of land comprising 720 square feet held by the appellants under an emphyteutic lease from the authorities of the Church of England should be determined as if the latter had no interest in it and that they and the appellants will subsequently arrange amongst themselves what should be the share of the Church in whatever amount may be awarded. For a strip of land covered by water lying between the two parts of the water lot No. 2411 owned by the appellants, comprising 6,503 square feet, the Harbour Commissioners, whose title to it is no longer in dispute, have also accepted the compensation awarded, 25 cents per square foot, or $1,625.75. They are satisfied with the same valuation upon 2,220 square feet owned by them at the south end of lot 2415, amounting to $555. The Crown contests neither of these items.\nOnly two matters, therefore, form the subject of this appeal\u2014the respective rights of the Harbour Commissioners and the appellants in the parallelogram, comprising 6,335 square feet, forming the south-east part of lot 2411, and the value of the interest of the appellants in the properties taken other than those above mentioned and of the appellants and of the Harbour Commissioners (if any) in the parallelogram of 6,335 square feet.\nThe question of title to this parallelogram depends upon the effect that should be given to a condition in the grant of it by the Crown to the appellants' predecessor in title, the R. C. Bishop of Quebec, providing for the resumption of it by the Crown at any time for purposes of public improvement on giving twelve months' notice in writing of its intention to exercise that right and on payment of the value of any improvements made on the property, and to a statute vesting certain lands, revenues, etc., in the Quebec Harbour Commissioners. The learned judge treated the right of resumption as subsisting at the date of the expropriation and held that it had passed to the Harbour Commissioners.\nThere are no improvements on this water lot. Instead of itself giving notice of intention to resume possession under the condition in its grant, or having the Harbour Commissioners do so, the Crown saw fit to include this parcel in proceedings for expropriation. It relies upon the condition, however, as minimizing the value of the appellants' interest. The appellants on the other hand assert that by instituting expropriation proceedings in respect of this parcel the Crown elected not to exercise its right of resumption; that it should therefore be deemed to have been waived; and that it had been extinguished by prescription.\nAs the property affected forms part of a public harbour and any public improvement for which the right of resumption might be exercised would be in the nature of harbour works, if that right were still vested in the Crown at the date of Confederation, it would, in my opinion, thereafter belong to the Crown in right of the Dominion. Samson v. The Queen[2].\nI cannot assent to the suggestion of counsel for the Crown that the commencement of expropriation proceedings may be regarded as tantamount to the giving of notice of intention to exercise the right of resumption. I accept the view of the appellants that the pendency of these proceedings was inconsistent with the exercise of that right.\nBut up to the moment they were begun it was competent for the Crown (or the Quebec Harbour Commissioners) unless the right of resumption had been prescribed, to have given the requisite notice and to have acquired possession on the expiry of twelve months without payment of any compensation whatever. The appellants' interest would in that view have been merely a right to retain possession for twelve months. Why the Crown did not proceed in regard to this parcel by giving this notice itself or having the Harbour Commissioners give it is not now material. It is incontestable that it is the value of the owner's interest immediately before the expropriation for which he is entitled to compensation. Upon all the evidence I should incline to the view that that interest, if subject to this condition of resumption, had no substantial value.\nBut was the right of resumption vested in the Crown or in the Quebec Harbour Commissioners? And, in either case, was it prescribed?\nThe learned trial judge has found that it passed to the Commissioners under 22 Vict., ch. 32, and against this finding the Crown has not appealed. The Harbour Commissioners, through their counsel, stated that they were willing to accept an equal division between themselves and the appellants of the $2,000 allowed as compensation for this parcel as suggested by the learned trial judge; and the Crown has not appealed against the amount awarded. The appellants could not hope to increase that amount if the right of resumption still existed at the date of the expropriation. Therefore, unless the condition for resumption has been extinguished by prescription, neither the amount of the compensation nor its apportionment need be further considered.\nIf the right of resumption had remained vested in the Crown, I should have been inclined to regard it as a real right declared imprescriptible by art. 2213 C.C. and therefore not within art. 2215 C.C. invoked by counsel for the appellants. But a right vested in the Quebec Harbour Commissioners, notwithstanding their public character and the nature of their trust, does not\nform part of the Crown domain.\nQuebec Harbour Commissioners v. Roche[3]. On the other hand, I find it difficult to understand how the appellants holding under a deed subject to the condition under consideration can claim its extinguishment by prescription. Having shewn their title under the Crown grant there is no room for the application of the law of prescription to establish an independent possessory title in them. Labrador Co. v. The Queen[4]. Moreover a title so shewn helps to establish the defects of the possession which hinder prescription. Art. 2244 C.C. Had the condition entailed an obligation on the part of the grantee, that obligation would, perhaps, have been susceptible of negative prescription under art. 2210 C.C. by nonfulfilment of it during a period of thirty years, or during a shorter period under some other prescription provision. But I incline to think that the Crown's right of resumption did not impose any obligation upon the holder of the land. If there was anything that could properly be called an obligation contracted by the grantee and binding his successors in title, it was to surrender or deliver up possession of the property. That obligation would arise, however, only when twelve months had elapsed after notice had been duly given of intention to exercise the right of resumption and the other terms of the condition, if applicable, had been complied with. Since no one may prescribe against his title (art. 2208 C.C.) unless in the sense of freeing it from an obligation (art. 2209 C.C.), the possession of the appellants under their title derived from the Crown grant implied a constant and continued acknowledgement of the terms of that grant, including the right of resumption to which it was subject. For these reasons I should, with respect for my learned brothers who are of the contrary opinion, be disposed to accept the conclusion of the learned trial judge that the provision for resumption was not extinguished by prescription. I am also of the opinion that, as a right held by a public authority for the purposes of a \"port,\" the right of resumption for public improvements, although it had ceased to form part of the Crown domain, should nevertheless be deemed imprescriptible under art. 2213 C.C.\nThe precarious title of the appellants to this considerable area at the south-east of lot 2411, and their lack of title to the strip already referred to as vested in the Harbour Commissioners lying between the two portions of the water lot in front of lot 2411 held by them and also to the 2,220 square feet at the south end of lot 2415 likewise owned by the Harbour Commissioners, materially affect the value of the remainder of their property as a wharf site. As shewn by exhibit 15 there is at low tide at the end of the existing wharf on the latter lot from 6 ft. 7 ins. to 7 ft. 7 ins. of water and at the end of the wharf on lot 2411 from 7 ft. 3 in. to 8 ft. 5 ins. of water. According to the evidence of the witness Leclerc a deep water wharf should have fourteen feet of water at low tide. The depth of water at the Harbour Commissioners' line in front of these lots appears to range from fourteen to eighteen and twenty feet. They seem to have been the most western properties on the north shore of the harbour on which it was thought worth while to build substantial wharves. Opposite the adjoining land to the west owned by the Lampsons, where the shore is indented by a cove, the depth of water at the Harbour Commissioners' line is materially less, especially along its western half. That property is therefore not at all so suitable as a site for wharves as that owned by the appellants. There also would seem to have been some question as to the title of the Lampsons to the water lot on the eastern part of their property, which probably affected the price of it. In placing a value on the appellants' property, however, the learned Judge of the Exchequer Court appears to have been influenced by the fact that the entire Lampson property had been acquired by the Crown at a price equal to about twenty cents a square foot. On the other hand, the Hearn property, which adjoins that of the appellants to the east, was valued in the Exchequer Court at $1.64 a square foot and in this court at 65 cents a square foot[5]. We are told by Mr. Fraser, its purchasing agent, that the Crown paid for part of the Molson property, somewhat farther east, 65 cents and for the remainder 50 cents; for the B\u00e9langer property 70 cents and for the Allan property 95 cents. These properties are of course nearer to the centre of shipping activities in Quebec. In some respects, however, they resemble the appellants' property more than that acquired from the Lampsons does.\nIt is no doubt extremely difficult to arrive with even approximate accuracy at the value of a property such as that with which we are dealing. Taking into account all its features\u2014its advantages as well as its disadvantages\u2014disclosed by the evidence, its value seems to me to have been somewhat underestimated. For the area of 49,394 square feet taken from the appellants (which includes the 720 square feet leased from the rector and churchwardens, but not the parallelogram containing 6,225 square feet for which the sum of $2,000 was allowed separately) I think an average of 45 cents a square foot, or $22,027.30, approximately represents its value at the date of expropriation. In arriving at this figure I have, of course, considered all the evidence and I have not lost sight either of the materially higher prices offered by the Crown in its information of 1911, afterwards withdrawn, or of the much lower prices paid by the appellants when purchasing the property in 1901. I would vary the judgment in appeal accordingly and would fix the compensation of the appellants as follows:\u2014\nFor 49,394 sq. ft. of land . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n$22,227.30\nFor 6,335 sq. ft.

Il y a aussi une question de titre pour une partie de ce terrain; mais, au point de vue pratique, cette derni\u00e8re question n'a pas l'importance de la premi\u00e8re.\nLe terrain expropri\u00e9 fait partie des lots 2411 and 2415 du cadastre de Qu\u00e9bec, et il est expropri\u00e9 pour la construction du Transcontinental National. Il se trouve sur les bords du St. Laurent, dans le H\u00e2vre de Qu\u00e9bec, et il consiste surtout en quais et en lots \u00e0 eau profonde. Il se faisait autrefois \u00e0 cet endroit un commerce de bois consid\u00e9rable; mais depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es ces quais ont \u00e9t\u00e9 peu utilis\u00e9s. Nous avons eu dans une cause de Hearn v. The King[6], \u00e0 examiner la valeur de terrains situ\u00e9s \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 de celui dont il est question en la pr\u00e9sente cause. M\u00eame l'un des dix lopins de terre expropri\u00e9s dans cette cause de Hearn \u00e9tait voisin \u00e0 Test du No. 2411.\nPar la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite dans la cause de Hearn et que je retrouve dans cette cause-ci, il apparait que des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s semblables mais un peu plus rapproch\u00e9es du centre de la ville et appartenant aux successions Molson & B\u00e9langer et \u00e0 la Compagnie Allan ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vendues au Gouvernement. Celle de la succession Molson, qui se trouvait la plus rapproch\u00e9e des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s Hearn, a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue en partie pour 65 cents du pied. Me basant sur cette derni\u00e8re vente, j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 d'opinion qu'on devait accorder 65 cents dans cette expropriation Hearn.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente cause, notre attention a \u00e9t\u00e9 particuli\u00e8rement attir\u00e9e sur la valeur de propri\u00e9t\u00e9s situ\u00e9es plus \u00e0 l'ouest, savoir celles du S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec, de William Power, de A. O. Falardeau, de Frank Ross, de la succession Dobell, de la Marquise de Bassano et de la succession Lampson, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9es de cinq cents du pied \u00e0 vingt cents du pied. Mais ces derni\u00e8res propri\u00e9t\u00e9s n'\u00e9taient pas aussi bien situ\u00e9es pour les fins de la navigation que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 en question dans la pr\u00e9sente cause et, de plus, celle qui se trouve la plus rapproch\u00e9e de cette derni\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 vendue au prix de 20 cents, mais il ne s'agissait que d'une vente sans garantie. Les vendeurs ne paraissaient pas avoir un titre parfait.\nLa Cour d'Echiquier a accord\u00e9 une somme de 30 cents du pied aux appelants en la pr\u00e9sente cause. Je crois qu'en prenant en consid\u00e9ration les ventes ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9es, ainsi que le jugement rendu dans la cause de Hearn, je serais d'opinion que les appelants seraient parfaitement indemnis\u00e9s en leur accordant 45 cents du pied, ce qui ferait pour les 55,729 pieds de terrain $25,078.05. Il faudrait ajouter \u00e0 cela la somme de $20,049 pour les quais qui leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e par la cour inf\u00e9rieure, que je trouve raisonnable. Cette derni\u00e8re somme est bas\u00e9e sur le prix que nous avons accord\u00e9 pour les quais dans la cause de\nHearn.\nCes deux sommes r\u00e9unies de\n$25,078.05\net de forment un total de\n20,049.00\n$45,127.05\nCette somme correspond \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e0 celle qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte et accept\u00e9e par les parties en 1911. A cette derni\u00e8re date, en effet, la Couronne avait offert aux appelants, devant la Cour d'Echiquier, une somme de $42,597.00 pour 45,000 pieds de terrain. Cette somme avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e par les expropri\u00e9s.\nMais en 1912 l'expropriation fut discontinu\u00e9e et les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s remises \u00e0 leurs anciens propri\u00e9taires conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la loi. Plus tard, la Couronne a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de les exproprier de nouveau.\nLa preuve au dossier n'est pas bien pr\u00e9cise quant \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence de la valeur de ces terrains en 1911, date de la premi\u00e8re expropriation, et en 1913, date de la seconde; mais il parait y en avoir une l\u00e9g\u00e8re.\nReste maintenant la question du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la partie sud-est du No. 2411. Les lettres patentes \u00e9mises par le Couronne en 1854 stipulaient que Sa Majest\u00e9 avait le pouvoir, en donnant un avis de douze mois, de reprendre cette propri\u00e9t\u00e9 pour des fins publiques en payant au propri\u00e9taire la valeur des am\u00e9liorations qu'il y aurait faites.\nL'Intim\u00e9 dit maintenant qu'aucune indemnit\u00e9 ne devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9e pour ce morceau de terre, vu qu'il n'y a eu aucune am\u00e9lioration de faite et que la Couronne d\u00e9sire le reprendre. Si on avait proc\u00e9d\u00e9 sous les dispositions d\u00e9 ces lettres patentes \u00e0 exercer ce droit de rachat ou de reprise, la pr\u00e9tention de la Couronne pourrait avoir beaucoup de force; mais on n'a pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de r\u00e9clamer en vertu de ce droit de reprise. On a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 suivant les dispositions de la loi des expropriations et ce sont alors les principes de cette loi qui doivent s'appliquer.\nCette question s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e devant la Cour d'Echiquier il y a plusieurs ann\u00e9es dans une cause de Samson v. The Queen[7], et M. le Juge Burbidge a alors d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que, les proc\u00e9dures ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 prises en vertu de la loi des expropriations, l'indemnit\u00e9 devrait \u00eatre bas\u00e9e sur les principes de cette loi.\nD'ailleurs, ce droit de reprise ou de rachat existe-t-il encore? Si ce droit \u00e9tait encore entre les mains de la Couronne, je serais probablement venu \u00e0 la conclusion qu'il est encore en vigueur et qu'il peut \u00eatre exerc\u00e9, ou, du moins, qu'il devrait \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration en d\u00e9terminant l'indemnit\u00e9 (art. 2213 C.C.).\nMais ce droit, ainsi qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par la Cour d'Echiquier, a \u00e9t\u00e9 c\u00e9d\u00e9 et transport\u00e9 aux Commissaires du H\u00e2vre de Qu\u00e9bec par l'Acte de 1859, 22 Vict. ch. 32, et ces terrains, ainsi que les droits qui y \u00e9taient attach\u00e9s, ont cess\u00e9 de faire partie du domaine public de Sa Majest\u00e9. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par la Cour d'Echiquier que ce droit de reprise a \u00e9t\u00e9 c\u00e9d\u00e9 aux Commissaires du H\u00e2vre par la loi de 1859 et la Couronne n'a pas appel\u00e9 de cette partie du jugement.\nCe droit de reprise est-il prescrit? La Commission du H\u00e2vre peut-elle r\u00e9clamer une partie de l'indemnit\u00e9 pour la valeur de ce droit?\nEn vertu de l'article 2242 du Code Civil, tous les droits et actions dont la prescription n'est pas autrement r\u00e8gl\u00e9e par la loi se prescrivent par trente ans. Ce droit pour les Commissaires du H\u00e2vre de reprendre ce terrain a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 exister pour eux en 1859; et, ne l'ayant pas exerc\u00e9 pendant les trente ann\u00e9es qui ont suivi, il est donc \u00e9teint par le laps de temps et se trouve prescrit.\nQuebec Harbour Commissioners v. Roche[8].\nL'indemnit\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e par la Cour d'Echiquier aux Commissaires du H\u00e2vre pour la valeur de ce droit ne leur appartient pas et les appelants ont le droit de r\u00e9clamer la valeur enti\u00e8re de ce lot.\nL'appel doit \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens. Les appelants devraient avoir leur indemnit\u00e9 port\u00e9e \u00e0 la somme de $45,127.05.\nLavergne J. ad hoc.\u2014I am of opinion to maintain the appeal with costs and I concur in the notes of judgment of Mr. Justice Brodeur:\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Pentland, Stuart, Gravel & Thompson.\nSolicitors for the respondent His Majesty The King: Gibsone & Dobell.\nSolicitor for the respondents the Quebec Harbour Commissioners: A.

Bush (Defendant) Respondent.\n1918: May ; 1918: June 10.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA.\nContract\u2014Guarantee\u2014Bank and banking\u2014Illegal interest charged to principal debtor\u2014Variation of contract\u2014Liability of guarantor.\nA director of an incorporated company gave a written guarantee that he would pay any undebtedness of the company to a bank up to the sum of $3,000. The bank, in the course of its dealings with the company, charged in its books interest at 8% contrary to the provisions of the \"Bank Act,\" but, so far as appears, without the knowledge of the company. The amount of the principal and interest legally due by the company to the bank exceeded the amount of the respondent's guarantee.\nHeld, that the charging of the illegal interest did not constitute a variation in the terms of the contract of guarantee; and the respondent was not thereby discharged from liability to the bank for the amount legally due.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming, by an equal division of the court, the judgment of Hunter J. at the trial and dismissing the action of the plaintiff with costs.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgment now reported.\nF. E. Meredith K.C. and D. L. McCarthy K.C. for the appellant.\nEug. Lafleur, K.C., and Robert Cassidy, K.C., for the respondent. THE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014There are two points raised by the defence which fall to be decided on the present appeal; and first it is contended that on the pleadings the plaintiff\u2014appellant\u2014has not alleged that the principal debtor has made default. I am, however, of opinion that the allegations in the statement of claim which contain an averment that the principal debtor is indebted to the plaintiff and that payment has been duly demanded of the sufficiently state the claim.\nIt is said in the second place that the surety is not to be held liable because the bank charged the principal debtor upon advances made to him interest at the rate of 8% whereas the \"Bank Act\" provides that banks may take interest not exceeding 7% but no higher rate of interest shall be recoverable by the bank.\nThe point is not without difficulty, and if I have come to the conclusion that it cannot be allowed it is only upon the special circumstances of the case. For if the transaction were simply a loan of $3,000 and the bank had charged an exorbitant rate of interest there would be great force in the argument that the surety could say that he did not intend to guarantee a money-lending transaction, but was entitled to rely on the bank only charging interest at a rate which they were legally empowered to do, that is to say\nnot exceeding 7% and the excess beyond which at any rate they could not recover.\nBut that is not such a transaction as the one with which we are dealing in the present case. The surety here guarantees to the bank that the principal debtor will pay to the bank all moneys which may at any time be due to the bank from him.\nNow, of course, it is open to the surety to shew that the moneys alleged to be due from the principal debtor are not recoverable by the bank, but that is not the point of the defence which is, not that there are not moneys legally due and recoverable from the principal debtor, but that because in the course of the dealings between him and the bank the latter has made a charge which it was not entitled to make though this be outside and beyond the sum sought to be recovered from the surety.\nI do not think the transaction between the bank and the principal debtor can be called in question in this way by the surety. If he chooses to give a general undertaking to become liable for whatever may at any time be due to the bank from the debtor he must accept the consequences of their dealings which he can neither claim to control nor dispute as discharging his liability.\nAnd the mere fact that advances and charges were made, which by statute are made not recoverable, cannot in the absence of any proof of prejudice to the surety be any ground for discharging his liability for the ultimate debt properly due.\nThe \"Interest Act\" provides that on any money secured by mortgage made payable on the sinking fund plan no interest whatever shall be recoverable unless the mortgage contains a statement shewing the amount of the principal money advanced and the rate of interest chargeable thereon. The fact that the bank had made an advance on such a mortgage on which no interest whatever was recoverable though the rate of interest was not excessive could not be ground for discharging the surety.\nI think that the respondent must be held liable for $3,000 the amount to which his guarantee is limited with interest at 6% as also provided and I would therefore allow the appeal with costs. DAVIES J.\u2014This action was one brought by the bank against respondent Bush to recover the sum of $3,000 due upon a continuing guarantee given by him to the bank for the payment to it\nof all moneys which may at any time be due to the bank from the Seafield Lumber and Shingle Co.\nwith provision that the sureties' liability should not exceed $3,000 with interest at 6% from the time of payment being required.\nThe only defences set up by the defendant were that the bank had not specifically proved the debt due to it and secondly that in its dealings with the company the bank had charged interest at the rate of 8%, which was contrary to the provisions of the \"Bank Act.\"\nAs to the proof of the debt being due and not paid to the bank, I have only to say that I agree with the Court of Appeal in its holding that the pleadings admitted both facts, the debt being due and the company's default in not paying it. Mr. Lafleur's contention was that the moment the customer paid the illegal rate of interest to the bank that fact constituted a new contract between him and the bank and discharged the guarantor. But there was not a scintilla of evidence that any payment of the illegal interest charged had been made by the company with knowledge of the illegal rate. The only evidence on the point was the admission at the trial by the bank that it had charged in its books interest at 8%, but whether to the knowledge or not of the company does not anywhere appear. In my judgment, therefore, there was no change or variation in the contract as guaranteed which could discharge the guarantor.\nThe excess of interest charged could not possibly in any view affect the amount of $3,000 guaranteed because the amount of the items, principal and interest, admitted as properly charged and due by the company to the bank greatly exceeded the limited amount of the respondent's guarantee.\nThe charging of an excessive rate of interest would only in an accounting between the bank and the guarantor have the same result as charging improperly an item of principal. In either case they would be struck out. As I have pointed out already, apart altogether from any excess of interest the balance of account due by the company to the bank exceeded largely the limit of the guarantee and the guarantor was not and could not be prejudiced by the excess of interest charged.\nI would therefore allow the appeal with costs and direct judgment to be entered for the amount guaranteed, $3,000, with interest as provided in the guarantee and with costs in all the courts.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The respondent was a shareholder in, and director of, a corporate company known as the Seafield Lumber and Shingle Company, Limited, carrying on business in British Columbia, who, with others, gave appellant at Nanaimo, on the 17th November, 1914, their joint and several guarantee that said company would up to a named sum pay appellant all moneys which might at any time be due to it from said company.\nThe guarantee was of the usual kind taken by banks when requiring a customer to furnish some guarantor for the payment of the ultimate balance of the customer's indebtedness. In this case, the liability was limited to three thousand dollars and six per cent, per annum thereon from the time of payment being required. The company went into liquidation in February, 1916, and then owed over $4,900 to the appellant.\nThis action was brought by appellant to recover from respondent the sum of $3,000 on account of said indebtedness.\nThe appellant had been charging the company eight per cent, per annum on its loans.\nThe learned trial judge held that in law the respondent was thereby discharged from his guarantee.\nThis view was also entertained by Mr. Justice Eberts in the Court of Appeal but no one else there ventured to support it.\nMr. Justice Martin held the appeal should be dismissed because sufficient proof had not been adduced of the indebtedness in question and declined to express any opinion upon the other point as in that view he had taken it was immaterial. The Chief Justice and Mr. Justice McPhillips held that appellant was entitled to succeed. In the opinion of the latter, he suggests that the charging by banks of a higher rate of interest than the maximum statutory rate may be said to be matter of common knowledge. I think he is right in so assuming and especially so in regard to dealings in the western provinces. I should be much surprised to find any business man, of the standing which the admitted facts indicate respondent to have been, ignorant of such a common practice. The respondent in his examination for discovery denies that he knew what rate was being charged by appellant to the said company.\nI accept his denial implicitly for he seems to have retired from business; but he was not asked as to his knowledge of the usual rate, as he doubtless would have been, had he been able to deny all knowledge of such rates as eight per cent, being originally required. There is not the slightest indication in the guarantee itself or, in the meagre evidence we have relative to the surrounding facts and circumstances, that can entitle us to read into the documents any implication of a condition relative to the limitation of the rate of interest to be charged.\nNo business man signing such an instrument, in recent years, can ever have conceived that the bank could not, if it chose, exact as a condition of its making advances a higher rate than seven per cent.\nThe well-known case of The Union Bank of Canada v. McHugh [2], referred to at the trial herein, and on argument here, had been decided in this court over three years before the guarantee in question was given. And if my memory serves me, I think cases preceding that by many years which bore the mark of dealings in what the learned trial judge referred to as killing rates had been presented for our consideration. There never was any serious doubt as to the permissive character of the provisions in the \"Banking Act\" and bankers in the zones where it was necessary to charge more than seven per cent, deducted from the advances made accordingly, or got out of business.\nThe question of what could be collected on overdue amounts gave rise to a difference of opinion here and was set at rest by their Lordships in the Privy Council in the McHugh Case [3], before this guarantee was given.\nI therefore am unable to understand why any one, signing such documents thereafter, could pretend they were entitled to read into that writing they had so signed, a something not found there.\nNor can I find any legal principle upon which a surety could claim a discharge by virtue of any such supposed implication. If we refer to the cases cited there is, on examination, nothing found to maintain such a proposition of law. If we turn to DeColyar on Guarantees to find something amongst the many means, tabulated by the author, whereby a surety may be discharged, we can find nothing to give us any hint of a suggestion upon which such a proposition can rest.\nIn short, there was neither fraud nor variation of the contract or the contractual relation for which the respondent stood as guarantor.\nThe improvidence of the principal is not a legal basis for such discharge unless it has been stipulated against and is in truth the reason for the banker shifting the burden thereof, in part at least, on to him willing to become a guarantor.\nTo maintain the proposition that in face of an elaborate document, framed to meet every hitherto known contingency whereby a surety might escape answering for the ultimate balance due by a principal, or the part of it he had undertaken, we must find therein an implied condition, agreed to by appellant, and broken so soon as signed and accepted.\nThe statement relied upon for proof of the rate of interest being eight per cent, expresses the fact that such rate\nhad been charged the company right along.\nIs the suggestion of an implied condition under such circumstances not too absurd for acceptance?\nThe examination of respondent for discovery as well as the frame of the pleadings, relieves me from any discussion of the point made as the proof of indebtedness.\nThis appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and judgment be entered for the amount claimed with interest at six per cent, per annum as stated in guarantee.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I agree with the view taken by the majority of the learned judges of the Court of Appeal as to the sufficiency of the allegation in the plaintiff's claim of the indebtedness and default of its principal debtor and as to the effect of the absence of any specific denial thereof in the plea of the defendant.\nThe only defence set up is an alleged variation of the contract between the bank and its debtor in regard to the rate of interest payable by the latter, which the defendant asserts has discharged him as a surety. He contends, I incline to think with reason, that his guarantee must be presumed to have been based on a contract between the principal debtor and the bank not ultra vires of the latter under the \"Bank Act,\" and, therefore, importing an agreement for interest at a rate not exceeding 7%. The variation alleged is based on an admission of counsel made at the trial that the rate charged against the principal debtor in the books of the bank has been 8%.\nThere is no evidence of any assent by the debtor to this charge or that he was cognizant of it. No agreement to pay it would have bound him except in so far as he had actually paid it or had assented to a stated account containing items of interest charged at that rate. McHugh v. Union Bank [4]. There is no proof of any such payment or account stated. Therefore no binding agreement between the principal debtor and the bank to vary the terms of the contract guaranteed has been shewn, and in order that it hould effect the discharge of the surety an agreement for a variation in the terms of the contract of the principals must be legally binding. Both the debtor and the guarantor would have been entitled to have the account of the bank taken on a footing of interest at 7%\u2014or, it may be, at 5%.\nHad actual payment of interest to the bank by the primary debtor at a rate exceeding 7% been shewn to have been made subsequently to the giving of the defendant's guarantee, it may be that he would have been discharged, unless, indeed, it should be clearly established that the guarantor's risk\u2014the likelihood of his being called upon under the guarantee\u2014was not thereby appreciably affected.\nSolely on the ground that the defendant has failed to shew any variation in the terms of the guaranteed contract legally binding upon either the primary debtor or himself I would allow this appeal with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and would direct the entry of judgment in the plaintiff's favour for the amount claimed by it with costs of this action.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The action by the appellant is on a guarantee given by the respondent to the effect that if a certain company did not pay to the bank its indebtedness the respondent as guarantor would pay to the extent of $3,000.\nThe contract of guarantee provided that the liability would cover not only the capital sums advanced by the bank to that company but also all interests, costs, charges for commissions and other expenses which the bank, in the course of its business, could charge in respect of any advances or discounts made to the principal debtor.\nIt appears that the bank, in the course of its dealings with the customer, charged an interest of 8%, contrary to the provisions of the \"Bank Act\" which authorized an interest of 7%. The amount representing that excess of rate could not be large for the advances covered a short period of time, and it seems very clear that the amount due by the customer was much larger than $3,000 when the action on the guarantee was instituted, even after having deducted that excess of rate of interest.\nThe respondent claims that he is discharged from any liability because the bank charged 8% instead of 7% on the advances made to the principal debtor.\nThere is no doubt that the bank had no right to charge more than 7% and the contract between the bank and its customer as to interest is void and the bank could recover only statutory interest, as it was decided in the case of McHugh v. Union Bank of Canada [5]. The guarantor may, when he is called upon to pay the debt of the principal debtor, refuse to pay more than the statutory rate of interest. He could only be compelled to make good what the company owed up to the sum of $3,000.\nThere is no evidence that when the contract of guarantee was signed there was a contract between the bank and the company. But later on, advances were made to the latter; and if, in making those advances, some illegal thing has been done, it does not render the contract of guarantee null and void; but the advances made as a result of such an illegal thing could not be claimed from the guarantor.\nIt is said, however, that it was an implied part of the contract of guarantee that no larger rate of interest than 7% should be charged, and that the bank had varied that contract.\nI fail to see in this contract any implied covenant as the one suggested. The parties, on the contrary, have formally stipulated as to the interest; and it is a well-settled principle of law that the courts will not by inference insert in a contract implied provisions with respect to a subject which the contract has expressly provided for. Beal, Legal Interpretation, p. 129.\nBesides assuming that such an implied covenant would exist in this contract, the alteration would require to be substantial in order to discharge the surety. Holme v. Brunskill[6].\nFor these reasons, the bank should succeed and its appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Abbott, Macrae & Company.\nSolicitors for the respondent: McKay & O'Brian.\n[1] [1918] I.W.W.R. 383; 38 D.L.R. 499.\n[2] 44 Can.

A. McDiarmid for the appellant.\nH. H. MacLean K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting):\u2014The city, for the purpose of a street improvement, passed a by-law on the 29th May, 1910, for the expropriation of certain land belonging to the respondent. All necessary proceedings were taken, except that the by-law was not published, nor registered, in the Land Registry Office in the district in which the land is situate, as provided for in sec. 50, sub-sec. 142 of ch. 32 of the statutes of B.C., 1906.\nThree arbitrators were duly appointed to determine the compensation payable to the respondent, and having heard the evidence and counsel for both parties they made an award, subject to the opinion of the court, whether the city was liable to pay the compensation.\nThe city from motives of economy desires to abandon the intended scheme of improvement and has set up as a ground of non-liability to pay the compensation, the fact that the by-law was never published as aforesaid.\nThe concluding sentence in sub-sec. 142 of sec, 50 is all that is material, and it reads:\nEvery by-law passed under the provisions of this sub-section shall, before coming into effect, be published in the British Columbia Gazette and in some newspaper published.in the municipality.\nThe contention on behalf of the appellant is that this means that the by-law shall not become effective until such publication has been had, in other words, that the statute must be read as if it had said:\nNo by-law passed under this sub-section shall come into effect until it has been published, etc.\nI do not think this is a legitimate or even possible interpretation of the meaning of the words used. I think they necessarily contemplate the coming into effect of the by-law whether published or not and they only direct that before it does come, into effect it shall be published. This seems to me the natural .interpretation to put upon the words used, and not only reconciles the sub-section with section 86, but is just what we should expect in view of the provisions of that section, which provides that every by-law passed by the council of any municipality * * * shall be registered in the County Court * * * and such by-law shall take effect and come into force and be binding on all persons as from the date of such registration.\nIt would require clear words to override this absolute and general provision and we have not got them because it is perfectly possible to read sub-section 142 as if after the words\nbefore coming into effect\nthere were added\nas by section 86 hereinbefore provided.\nThere is no validity in the claim advanced by the appellant that the upholding of the award would be a hardship to the local property improvement owners, which the quashing of it certainly would be to the respondent. The expropriation was made by the representatives of the former and must be considered as if it were their own act: Moreover, it is a salutary rule in the courts that private individuals ought to be protected from oppression at the hands of corporations with whom they have to contend on such unequal terms. A corporation is vested with the extreme power of expropriating private property only in the necessary interests of the public, and it certainly would be oppressive if it could take all necessary proceedings so far as the owner dispossessed is concerned and then avoid payment of the compensation.by pleading its own neglect to observe procedure directed by the statute the due observance of which can hardly be a matter that individual owners are under obligation to ascertain or even to have knowledge of. Nowell v. Worcester[2]; Maxwell on Statutes, 5th ed., p. 598, says: When nullification would involve general inconvenience or injustice to innocent persons, or advantage to those guilty of the neglect, without promoting the real aim or object of the enactment, such an intention is not to be attributed to the legislature.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This was a special case stated by arbitrators for the decision of the court and the question was whether, under the special facts as stated by them, they had power to make an award of compensation for lands of the respondent alleged to have been expropriated by the city under a by-law passed by the council for a proposed widening of a public street.\nThe decision of the trial judge, Mr. Justice Murphy, was that the arbitrators had such power\u2014that the city was liable to pay the compensation awarded.\nOn appeal the court was equally divided and the judgment of the trial judge accordingly stood.\nI think this appeal must be allowed and that the question submitted should be answered that the arbitrators had no power to make an award of compensation because the by-law authorizing the widening of the street and the necessary expropriations therefor had never been published.\nThe determination of the question submitted depends upon the construction of sub-sec. 142 of sec. 50 of \"The Municipal Clauses Act, 1906,\" empowering municipal councils from time to time to make, alter and repeal by-laws on a number of specified subjects.The question is whether sub-sec. 142 of sec. 50 was merely directory in its provisions, as to publication of a by-law, or was mandatory. I have no hesitation in reaching the latter conclusion and in holding that publication is essential to make a by-law under that sub-section valid. The latter part of the section provides:\u2014 Every by-law passed under the provisions of this sub-section shall, before coming into effect, be published in the British Columbia Gazette and in some newspaper published in the municipality, or if no newspaper is published in the municipality, then in a newspaper circulating in the municipality, and a certified copy thereof shall be filed in the Land Registry Office of the district in which the land affected by the by-laws is situate.\nI cannot think of language which would more clearly carry out the evident intention of the legislature than that used. It provides that\nbefore coming into effect\nevery by-law passed under the provisions of the subsection should be published in the way and manner provided. Publication was made a condition precedent to the by-law coming into effect.\nThe 5th section provided (inter alia) for the establishing, opening and widening of roads, streets, squares, etc., and for expropriating, taking, or using any real property in any way necessary or convenient for any of the specified purposes without the consent of the owners.\nIt was not the owners alone who were interested in the exercise of the powers granted to the corporations in this section. The great body of the municipal ratepayers who had to pay the moneys necessary to carry out the improvements mentioned were interested, and it was no doubt to bring to their notice before it became valid any by-law passed by the municipal council under the sub-section that the language was used providing that \"before coming into effect\" the by-law should be published as provided.\nFor us in this court to say that any by-law passed under this sub-section was valid before and without publication, where the legislature has said that \"before coming into effect\" it must be published, seems to me to amount to legislation on our part and not simply construction of legislation enacted by the proper authority.\nI would allow the appeal with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The question raised by this appeal turns upon the meaning or want of meaning to be found in sub-sec. 142 of sec. 50 of the \"Municipal Clauses Act\" of British Columbia, passed in 1906.\nSaid section 50, which evidently was intended to define with great particularity the subjects respecting which a municipal council might make by-laws and the limitations of power it might so exercise, reads as follows:\u2014\n50. In every municipality the council may, from time to time, make, alter and repeal by-laws for any of the following purposes or in relation to matters coming within the classes of subjects next hereinafter mentioned, that is to say:\u2014\nThere follow this introductory enactment one hundred and ninety sub-sections, of which sub-section 142 is as follows:\u2014\n(142) For establishing, opening, making, preserving, improving, repairing, widening, altering, diverting or stopping up roads, streets, squares, alleys, lanes, bridges, or other public communications within the boundaries of the municipality or the jurisdiction of the council, and for entering upon, expropriating, breaking up, taking or using any real property in any way necessary or convenient for the said purposes without the consent of the owners of the real property, subject to the restrictions contained in sections 251 and 252 of this Act. Every by-law passed under the provisions of this sub-section shall, before coming into effect, be published in the British Columbia Gazette and in some newspaper published in the municipality, or if no newspaper is published in the municipality, then in a newspaper circulating in the municipality, and a certified copy thereof shall be filed in the Land Registry Office of the district in which the land affected by the by-law is situate.\nIt has been held below that the last sentence of this sub-section was merely directory and hence null.Those so holding do not use this language, but I respectfully submit that is the effect of the decision, if allowed to stand. In short the imperative words therein\nshall before coming into effect\nare given no effect to.\nThe sentence in which these words occur was an amendment to the \"Municipal Act\" in 1903. If intended to be entirely directory it should never have contained these words. As a purely directory enactment, having nothing in the way of sanction to secure its observance, once these words are deleted, it would stand as a unique piece of legislation.\nIn argument I pressed counsel for respondent to suggest any possible purpose the legislature could have had in view in such an enactment if the argument that these words were not to be given, any operative force should stand good. I am yet without any explanation or suggestion of anything the legislature could have had in view if the words in question were not to be given any effect.\nI think the plain ordinary meaning of the language used requires us to say that the by-law, so called, now in question, which has been acted upon, never was effective as a by-law and never should have been acted upon or given any appearance of vitality.\nIt seems idle to disregard the scope and purpose of section 50 expressly designed to define the exact limitations and conditions to be observed in exercising effectively the by-law making power, and rely upon section 86 of the Act appearing among others under the caption \"Passage, and Authentication of by-laws\" which deals with filing of by-laws in the County Court and incidentally uses the words:\u2014\nshall take effect and come into force and be binding on all persons as from the date of such registration, etc. and treat these words because now in same statute as predominant over any others therein. Surely it was quite competent for the legislature to impose any terms it chose to declare as preliminary to any by-law becoming effective. And if section 86 at first blush is misleading and puzzling when we find the restriction in sub-sec. 142 of sec. 50 was enacted as an amendment thereto, long after section 86 had stood as law with the words just quoted, we must doubtless conclude the amendment was designed to restrict all else, including, if necessary, this older section 86 in its operation so far as related to by-laws of the class named in sub-section 142.\nTo test that reasoning further and see if this language used in section 86 can be applied in the way suggested, instead of presupposing any by-law it refers to as an already effective and valid by-law, let us follow the subject under the caption of \"Quashing by-laws,\" as found in section 89 et seq., and see where it would land us.\nWe find that so-called by-laws registered in the County Court may possibly have been null and void and liable therefore to be quashed.\nThe reading of section 86 in the imperative and wide sense urged upon us by counsel for respondent as absolutely effective, would render it impossible to quash any by-law no matter how absurdly beyond the competence of the council, once it got registered in the County Court.\nThe mere statement of such a proposition shews how untenable it is.\nThe language used in section86, relied upon herein for respondent, evidently does not and never was intended to mean that whatever form of by-law is filed in the County Court it is effective. Publicity, and the furnishing of an accessible record, fixing the starting point of time when, but not before, any by-law might become effective, would seem to have been the purpose of enacting section 86, requiring registration in the County Court of all by-laws which had passed through certain named formalities.\nWhatever the object to be accomplished thereby, or however clumsy and inapt the language used, matters little for our present consideration.\nIt seems very clear that the amendment of section 142 by adding the provision now therein for publication and registration of any of the by-laws of the class named therein in the Land Registry Office, was intended to fit the law to the reasonable needs of those concerned in their dealings with real estate, affected by such by-laws, and render it quite safe for them to rely upon the real estate record alone.\nThe absurdity of requiring such persons to watch the County Court Office instead of the usual record in the Land Registry Office was put an end to by the amendment and doubtless was so intended.\nWith great respect I submit it was not merely directory but imperative in its terms, and constituted a much needed condition precedent to the operation of any by-law of the class in question.\nAnd if regard had been paid by respondent to its terms she need not have appointed an arbitrator and brought all the trouble that has followed the doing so upon herself.\nThe appellant has done no wrong to any one by refraining from proceeding to the publication and registration and thereby abandoning its project when found improvident.\nThe clerk of the municipality may have erred in sending the notice he did, but five years' lapse of time should have suggested it was a mere error.\nThe legislature also may have erred in letting such a curiosity as section 86 presents stand in its present shape.\nI submit, however, none of these things present any reasonable ground for our punishing other owners of real estate by depriving them of the protection of a beneficent amendment to the law.\nThat amendment never having been observed the question submitted by the arbitrators should be answered in the negative.\nI therefore think the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout.\nANGLIN J.\u2014At the threshold of this appeal we are confronted with the contention that this proceeding should not be entertained because the validity of the submission and of the appointment of the arbitrators and their authority, which they have seen fit to make the subject of \"a special case for the opinion of the court,\" declaring their award to be conditional upon their right to make it being upheld, is not a\nquestion of law arising in the course of the reference\nwithin the meaning of sec. 22 of the \"Arbitration Act,\" R.S.B.C., 1911, ch. 11. I rather incline to the view that it is not. From the fact, however, that there is no allusion whatever to this objection in the judgment delivered in the provincial courts, or in the factums filed here, I infer that it was not raised below. Counsel for the respondent took it in this court only after he had fully presented his argument on the merits, and had some reason to think the court was not in his favour. Since the result of deciding that the objection to the status of the special case should prevail might be that the condition which the arbitrators have attached to their award would alone be held bad and the award itself in favour of the respondent, shorn of that condition, absolute, it will probably be better, under the circumstances, to deal with the question submitted on the assumption that it is properly before the court. That question is whether the publication and the filing in the Land Registry Office of by-laws of the special class within it, which sub-sec. 142 of sec. 50 of the \"Municipal Clauses Act,\" 1906, ch. 32, prescribes shall take place\nbefore (their) coming into effect,\nare thereby made conditions of their efficacy, or whether this is merely a directory provision, non-compliance with which does not render such by-laws invalid or prevent their being in force.\nThe by-law was passed in May, 1911. Notice of expropriation was given in June. The respondent promptly presented her claim for compensation, which was rejected; and the council named an arbitrator. No further action was taken until 1916 when the respondent also named an arbitrator, and a third arbitrator was named either by the two, as stated by the appellant, or by a Judge of the Supreme Court, as averred by the respondent. The city's representatives appear to have taken part in these proceedings without protest. When the arbitrators first met, however, the city took exception to their jurisdiction on the ground of the invalidity of the expropriation by-law. The arbitrators nevertheless proceeded and published a conditional award in March, 1917.\nIf sub-sec. 142 stood alone I agree with the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal that\nits construction would be simple enough. It might very well be read as making publication a condition precedent to the coming into force of the by-law. Indeed I think it would admit of no other construction. Is there anything in the history of the legislation which tends either to confirm this as the proper construction of the clause added in 1904 to sub-sec. 142 (formerly sub-sec. 127) of sec. 50 or to render it improbable that such a construction was intended? Is there anything in the context of the statute which clearly requires that a different construction be placed upon that clause?\nThe question is one of intention. The history of the legislation\u2014the provision of the Revised Statute of 1897 (ch. 144, sec. 83) prescribing that every by-law passed by any council\nshall come into effect, and be binding on all persons after publication of the same in the British Columbia Gazette and in some one or more of the newspapers selected by the council and circulating in the municipality;\nthe substitution in 1902 (2 Ed. VII., ch. 52, sec. 22) for such publication of registration in the office of the County Court with like consequences; and the revival in 1904 (3 & 4 Ed. VII., ch. 42, sec. 9) in the terms in which it is couched of the requirements as to publication, apparently because greater publicity than registration in the office of the County Court would afford was found to be necessary or desirable in the case of the by-laws specially dealt with in sub-sec. 127 of sec. 50 of the \"Municipal Clauses Act\" (R.S.B.C., 1897, ch. 144)\u2014in my opinion, makes it reasonably obvious that the legislature meant to impose such publication and filing in the Land Registry Office as conditions of the validity and efficacy of such by-laws.\nNo doubt the provision of section 86 of the \" Municipal Clauses Act,\" 1906, applicable to all by-laws,\u2014that they shall be registered in the office of the County Court, and,\nshall take effect and come into force and be binding on all persons from the date of such registration\u2014 presents a difficulty of construction. I think that difficulty is to be met, however, and the intention of the legislature carried out rather by treating sub-sec. 142 of sec. 50 as creating a condition (as its language imports) which the legislature assumed would have been already complied with, in the case of by-laws to which it relates, before section 86, which occupies a later position in the statute, would be acted upon, than by straining the language of sub-section 142 in order to make of it not the imposition. of a condition, but a mere direction as to the time at which publication and filing in the Land Registry Office should take place, i.e., before registration in the office of the County Court, treating that as the time of\nthe coming into effect,\nof by-laws within sub-section 142. No other provision of the statute is referred to as presenting any difficulty. I find nothing therefore in the context which requires or justifies a refusal to give to sub-section 142 the effect that its terms indicate was intended.\nThis case appears to be distinguishable from Nowell v. Mayor of Worcester[3], and Montreal Street Railway Company v. Normandin[4], much relied upon by the respondent. In the Nowell Case[5] a statute was held directory chiefly because, as put by Pollock C.B.\nno means are given them (the contractors with the municipality) of ascertaining the fact\nwhether the prescribed duty had or had not been fulfilled.\n\"How are the plaintiffs who contracted to do work for the corporation,\" asks Baron Parke, \"to get information as to whether a report has been made by their surveyor?\"\nHere the failure to publish and to file in the Land Registry Office could easily have been ascertained by any person. In the Normandin Case[6] general inconvenience would have resulted from holding the neglect of the prescribed duty fatal and the main object of the legislature would not have been thereby promoted. Here, so far as appears, the respondent alone will be adversely affected by holding the by-law to be invalid and the main object of the legislature, which was to secure further publicity, might be frustrated were the provision in question to be treated as merely directory. The section does not designate an official to discharge the duty imposed and no sanction is provided to ensure its fulfilment.\nMoreover, the statute with which we are dealing empowers taxation as well as an exercise of eminent domain. On both grounds a strict compliance with the terms in which it authorizes the exercise of the rights conferred may properly be exacted.\nI am further of the opinion that no conduct of the municipal council or of its officials can have the effect of rendering binding steps taken under a by-law subject to an unfulfilled condition such as that imposed by the amendment of 1904, or can estop or preclude the municipal corporation from setting up the consequent invalidity of the by-law in any proceeding in which it is sought to enforce it or to compel its being carried out. It would be quite too dangerous to permit conditions imposed by statute to be thus evaded. To-day it is the municipal corporation which urges that noncompliance with the terms of its statutory authority renders its by-law ineffective: to-morrow a taxpayer or a landowner may have occasion to press a like objection. In either case the construction of sub-section 142 and the effect of the omission to carry out its requirements must be the same. I say nothing as to any possible right of action that any person injuriously affected by an attempt made by the municipal corporation or any of its officers to carry out \u2014or act upon such an invalid by-law may have.\nCounsel for the respondent further contended that, assuming the invalidity of the by-law, the arbitration proceedings and the award of compensation to his client might nevertheless be supported under section 251 of the \"Municipal Clauses Act\" of 1906, ch. 32. But that section deals with the making and ascertainment of compensation for lands taken or injuriously affected\nby the corporation in the exercise of any of its powers.\nThe power to take or injuriously affect land for, inter alia, the widening of a highway is conferred by sub-sec. 142 of sec. 50 of the same Act, and the means thereby prescribed for the exercise of that power is the enactment of a by-law according to the terms, and subject to the conditions which it and other sections of the statute impose. That is the power which the council ineffectually sought to exercise. If it possessed any other it did not attempt to use it. A valid and effectual exercise of a power to take or injuriously affect land is the foundation upon which proceedings under sec. 251 must rest. Without that foundation such proceedings are unauthorised and ineffectual.\nI am, for these reasons, with respect, of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed.\nBRODEUR J.

The \"Companies Act\" was subsequently amended by enacting the following provision:\u2014\n\"Where an action, suit, or other proceeding has been dismissed or otherwise decided against an extra-provincial company on the ground that any act or transaction of such company was invalid or prohibited, by reason of such company not having been licensed or registered pursuant to this or some former Act, the company may, if it is licensed or registered as required by this Act and upon such terms as to costs as the court may order, maintain anew such action, suit, or other proceeding as if no judgment had therein been rendered or entered.\"\nHeld, that the appellant was not obliged to bring an action de novo, but had the right to ask for a re-instatement or revivor of the dismissed action at the stage at which it was when the judgment based upon the statute subsequently held ultra vires was pronounced.\nThe judgment appealed from holding that the action must be begun de novo is a final judgment within the meaning of par. (e) of section 2 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\" APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], maintaining the judgment of Clement J. at the trial, by which the plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs.\nThe material facts of the case and the issues raised in the present appeal are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nH. J. Scott, K.C. for the appellant.\nChrysler K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014The appellants brought suit which after trial was, on the 22nd of March, 1911, dismissed upon the merits. An appeal from the judgment was dismissed not on the merits but on the ground that the transaction in respect of which the action was based was invalid by reason of the plaintiff not having been licensed pursuant to the \"Companies Act\" then in force.\nThe \"Companies Act Amendment Act\" 1917 (7 &8Geo. v., ch. 10) repeals sections 168 and 169 of the \"Companies Act\" (R.S.B.C. 1911, ch. 39) and substitutes a provision therefor as sec. 168. Subsection 3 of the said substituted section is as follows:\u2014\nWhere an action, suit or other proceeding has been dismissed or otherwise decided against an extra-provincial company on the ground that any act or transaction of such company was invalid or prohibited by reason of such company not having been licensed or registered pursuant to this or some former Act, the company may, if it is licensed or registered as required by this Act, and upon such terms as to costs as the Court may order, maintain anew such action, suit or other proceeding as'if no judgment had therein been rendered or entered.\nThe marginal note is \"remedial provision.\"\nThe form of the legislation would seem rather unfortunate. The sub-section does not appear to be properly placed in the \"Companies Act\" for it cannot be read without reference to the Act by which it was passed. No doubt the intention is that any suit decided prior to the Act of 1917 can be maintained anew and presumably only suits so previously decided.\nIt is unnecessary to refer to the circumstances. which led to the passing of this remedial provision, it is sufficient to say that they are such as to render it incumbent on the court to afford every possible relief that the terms made use of will admit in favour of those litigants for whose benefit it was passed and this in accordance with the intention of the legislature which cannot be doubted.\nNow this was a motion to the Court of Appeal\nfor an order that the appeal herein, for which notice was given on the 17th day of June, 1911, be entered for rehearing as if no judgment had been rendered or entered herein.\nThe Court of Appeal dismissed the motion on the ground that it had no jurisdiction to make the order sought. That\nto maintain anew in these circumstances means to bring and maintain, that is to say, an action de novo.\nThe question therefore, is, whether the Court of Appeal is right in holding that the statute cannot be construed so as to enable the appellants to take up and continue their action at the point when the court decided that their action could not be maintained by reason of their not having been licensed as if such judgment had not been rendered.\nI think the position is the same as if the appeal had not yet come on for hearing, and that I think is certainly in accordance with the intention of the Act.\nIt is not to be expected in such a special case that we can find any guidance in the rules or in authority. We have nothing but the obvious intention of the statute to assist in construing the terms made use of. It would have been difficult to provide for every possible case, impossible perhaps to foresee a suit left in such a position as this. Now the Court of Appeal has said\nthat to maintain anew in these circumstances means to start the action all over again\nand it is precisely in the words\nin these circumstances\nthat the error in the decision is to be found. Even if it be conceded that under some circumstances the words\nto maintain anew\nmight bear the meaning put upon them by the Court of Appeal, I do not think they can or ought to be so interpreted in the actual circumstances.\nI think the provision for maintaining\nanew such action, suit or other proceeding as if no judgment had therein been rendered or entered\nmay very properly be held to mean that the Court of Appeal should hear the appeal as if its previous decision had never been rendered and I certainly think that this will be only giving effect to the intention of the legislature in enacting the measure of relief to those who suffered hardship through the mistaken view of the law then held.\nDAVIES J.\u2014My impression at the close of the argument in this case and of the motion to quash for want of jurisdiction was that the motion should be dismissed, the appeal allowed and the case remitted back to be heard on the merits, with costs on the motion and in the appeal. Further consideration has satisfied me that my impression was right.\nOn the question of our jurisdiction to hear the appeal, I am of the opinion that there was alike finality in the judgment appealed from and also that a substantial right on plaintiff's part to continue the present action was adversely determined upon.\nOn the merits, I am of the opinion that subsec. 3 of sec. 2 of the \"Companies Act\" should not be construed as giving the unlicensed company whose action had been dismissed on that ground simply a right to begin another action after it had become licensed but a right to maintain or continue the dismissed action at and from the stage at which it was when dismissed. I construe the words maintain anew, as used in that sub-section, as meaning continue anew.\nThe result would be the same as if this court had on appeal reversed the judgment dismissing the action.\nI would therefore refer the case back to the Supreme Court for hearing on the merits.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014There are two appeals; both and motions to quash each of them herein were argued together.\nThe respondent has moved to quash these appeals and relies upon the decision in Saint John Lumber Co. v. Roy[2] wherein it was held that an order allowing the service of a writ out of the jurisdiction of the court could not become the subject of an appeal to this court.\nInasmuch as the only question there was of the forum before which the parties were held bound to appear and submit to its jurisdiction, and these appeals in the last analysis involve only the question of forum, the point seems well taken if that decision is to be held binding.\nHowever, those who decided that case are agreed it does not govern and I am content; especially because in each case there was, in my opinion, a substantial right in controversy in the action involved in the appeal. I do not think there should be any costs of the motions.\nThe British Columbia Legislature has passed a rather drastic licensing Act relative to foreign corporations doing business in that province and thereby attempted to deprive those failing to comply therewith of all rights to contract or sue upon contract made there in the British Columbia courts. This legislation was held by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to be ultra vires the legislature. Meantime an action had been tried and on the merits dismissed by the learned trial judge who declined to rely upon the said statute. Upon appeal to the Court of Appeal that court relied upon the said statute and dismissed the appeal. To rectify the possible wrongs done a suitor in cases wherein effect had been given to the said ultra vires statute the legislature in 1917, by the \"Companies Act,\" ch. 10, sec. 2, repealed the said statute and re-enacted by section 168 thereof new licensing provisions applicable to companies, and amongst other things in the said section subsection 3 enacts as follows:\u2014\nWhere an action, suit or other proceeding has been dismissed or otherwise decided against an extra-provincial company, on the ground that any act or transaction of such company was invalid or prohibited, by reason of such company not having been licensed or registered pursuant to this or some former Act, the company may, if it is licensed or registered, as required by this Act, and upon such terms as to costs as the court may order, maintain anew such action, suit or other proceeding as if no judgment had therein been rendered or entered.\nThe neat point involved in each of these appeals is whether or not any suitor desiring to take advantage of the relief thus provided must do so by bringing a new action. The Court of Appeal has so held. It might be possible, following the refining and technical means of interpretation of the section which has been so adopted, to maintain that view. I prefer, instead of such critical way of approaching the interpretation and construction of such a statute, to have due regard to the rules laid down for construing an enactment by the Barons of the Exchequer in Heydon's Case[3] which rules can be found either in Maxwell on Statutes or Hardcastle on Statutory Law, as follows:\u2014\nFor the sure and true interpretation of all statutes in general (be they penal or beneficial, restrictive or enlarging of the common law), four things are to be discerned and considered. (1) What was the common law before the making of the Act. (2) What was the mischief or defect for which the common law did not provide. (3) What remedy the Parliament hath resolved and appointed to cure the disease of the commonwealth. (4) The true reason of the remedy. And then the office of all the judges is always to make such construction as shall suppress the mischief and advance the remedy, and to suppress subtile inventions and evasions for the continuance of the mischief and pro privato commodo, and to add force and life to the cure and remedy according to the true intent of the makers of the Act pro bono publico.\nI venture once more to quote these rules as the most cogent and concise argument in answer to the reasons in support of the appeal. I am clearly of the opinion that the appeal ought to be allowed with costs and the appellant permitted to renew or revive its motion for appeal before the Court of Appeal and have its case heard upon the merits.\nANGLIN J.\u2014In John Deere Plow Co., v. Wharton[4], the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that:\nPart VI. (sections 139\u2014173) of the \"Companies Act\" of British Columbia (R.S.B.C. 1911, ch. 39), which in effect provides that companies incorporated by the Dominion Parliament shall be licensed or registered under that Act as a condition of carrying on business in the province or maintaining proceedings in its courts, is * * * ultra vires the provincial legislature under the \"British North America Act,\" 1867. In 1917 (ch. 10) the legislature repealed secs. 168 and 169 of the \"Companies Act\" (R.S.B.C. 1911, ch. 39; sec. 123 of the \"Companies Act,\" 1897, ch. 44) and substituted therefor the following:\n168 (1) No unlicensed or unregistered company shall be capable:\u2014\n(a) of maintaining any action, suit or other proceedings in any court of the province in respect of any contract made in whole, or in part, within the province, in the course of, or in connection with, its business; or,\n(b) of acquiring or holding land, or any interest therein, in the province, or registering any title thereto under the \"Land Registry Act.\"\n(2) Where an extra-provincial company has heretofore become licensed or registered under this, or any former Companies Act, or becomes licensed or registered under this Act, or a licence or certificate of registration of any such company is suspended, revoked or cancelled, and is subsequently restored or reinstated, the provisions of the foregoing subsection and any prohibition having a like effect formerly in force, shall be read and construed as if no disability thereunder had ever attached to the company, notwithstanding that any such contract was made or proceeding in respect thereof instituted, or any land or interest therein acquired or held, before the first day of July, 1910.\n(3) Where an action, suit or other proceeding has been dismissed or otherwise decided against an extra-provincial company on the ground that any act or transaction of such company was invalid or prohibited by reason of such company not having been licensed or registered pursuant to this or some former Act, the company may, if it is licensed or registered as required by this Act and upon such terms as to costs as the Court may order, maintain anew such action, suit or other proceeding as if no judgment had therein been rendered or entered.\nWhile the chief purpose of these amendments unquestionably was to meet the objections which had prevailed against the former legislation, there can be little room for doubt that subsection 3 was designed to undo as far as possbile whatever injustice had been sustained by extra-provincial corporations whose actions had been dismissed for non-compliance with the legislation which the Privy Council held to be invalid.\nWhen these amendments were enacted the plaintiff company found itself in this position: This action brought by it in 1909, while still unlicensed, to recover the price of machinery furnished by it to the defendants had been dismissed at the trial in 1911 on the merits, the trial judge holding that the machinery did not fulfil the requirements of the contract under which it had been sold. On the 8th Nov., 1912, the Court of Appeal, by a majority of the judges, upheld the judgment dismissing the action, but on the ground that the plaintiff, as an unlicensed extra-provincial company, had been prohibited by the \"Companies Act\" of 1897 from making the contract sued upon and that its licence, obtained in September, 1909, after the commencement of this action, did not entitle it under an amendment of 1910 (ch. 7) further to maintain and prosecute it. Two of the four judges who constituted the court expressed views favourable to the appellants on the merits [5].\nConceiving itself entitled to prosecute its action under the legislation of 1917\nas if no judgment had therein been rendered or entered\ndismissing it on the ground that its contract sued upon was invalid or prohibited by reason of the company not having been licensed or registered under the \"Companies Act\" of 1897 (ch. 44, sec. 123), in order to meet the requirements of the \"War Relief Act\" (1916, ch. 74) and the \"War Relief Amendment Act\" (1917, ch. 74), the plaintiff company applied for and obtained from Mr. Justice Gregory, on the 30th of October, 1917, an order declaratory of its rights to proceed with the action, notwithstanding the provisions of those statutes.\nIt then applied to the Court of Appeal upon motion\nfor an order that the appeal herein, for which notice was given on the 17th day of June, A.D. 1911, be entered for hearing as if no judgment had been rendered or entered therein upon such terms as to costs as the court may order, and for such further order and directions as to the court may deem fit.\nThis motion was dismissed on the 20th Nov., 1917, the court (Martin, Galliher and McPhillips JJ.A.) holding that the statute of 1897 did not entitle the plaintiff to prosecute the action which had been dismissed in 1911-12, but enabled it to bring and maintain a new action for the same cause of action.\nMaintain anew * * * means bring again.\nIt is from this order that appeal No. 1 is now brought to this court.\nMeantime the defendants had appealed from the order of Mr. Justice Gregory. Adhering to the view that the action in which that order purported to be made had been finally dismissed in 1911-12 and was not resuscitated by the legislation of 1917, the Court of Appeal on the 22nd January, 1918, allowed this appeal and set aside Mr. Justice Gregory's order. This judgment forms the subject of appeal No. 2.\nThe respondent moves to quash both appeals on the ground that the judgments appealed from are not \"final judgments\" within the meaning of paragraph (e) of section 2 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" as enacted by 3 & 4 Geo. V. ch. 51, sec. 1. The motions and the appeals were heard together.\nBoth the judgments of the Court of Appeal determined that the plaintiff's action was at an end and negatived the right to maintain or prosecute it further. In my opinion that right is\na substantive right in controversy in the action\nwhich has been determined adversely to the plaintiff, within the definition of section 2 (e) of the \"Supreme Court Act\" I find it difficult to appreciate the argument that a judgment which holds that an action is at an end, with the result that it stands forever dismissed, is not a final judgment. Its finality seems to be so obvious that it scarcely brooks the aid of definition. The definition of \"final judgment\" now found in the \"Supreme Court Act\" was required to bring within that term judgments, which, though finally dispositive of substantive rights in controversy therein, did not terminate the actions or judicial proceedings in which they were rendered. St. John Lumber Co. v. Roy[6] It was not needed to meet the case of a judgment dismissing an action or declaring it to be finally disposed of and terminated.\nIt was also urged that the orders appealed from were discretionary and dealt with mere matters of procedure and were therefore not appealable. I cannot understand how an order denying a claim of statutory right on the ground that, properly construed, the statute does not confer it can be said to be in any sense discretionary. Neither in my opinion is the matter disposed of by the orders one of procedure only. I regard it as one of substantive right\u2014the right to maintain this action. The motions to quash, in my opinion, fail.\nWith deference, I am unable to agree in the construction placed by the Court of Appeal on subsec. 3 of sec. 168 of the \"British Columbia Companies Act\" as enacted in 1917. The word \"maintain\" is obviously equivocal. As Mr. Chrysler frankly admitted in the course of his able argument, it may mean either to bring or institute an action or proceeding or to continue or further prosecute an action or proceeding already commenced. It is, however, coupled in the statute with the word \"anew,\" and, no doubt, not a little may be urged in support of the view that \"maintain anew,\" if standing alone, would imply\ncommence or begin afresh. But this phrase may not be segregated from its context without doing violence to a fundamental canon of construction. Not only does the word \"such,\" which precedes the words\naction, suit or other proceeding,\nclearly referring back as it does to the\naction, suit or proceeding\nmentioned at the commencement of the subsection, indicate that it is the very action, suit or other proceeding which has been dismissed or otherwise adversely decided that the extra-provincial corporation is empowered to \"maintain anew,\" but the concluding clause of the sentence,\nas if no judgment had therein been rendered or entered\nwould appear to put the matter beyond doubt. It is the action which has been dismissed (such action)\u2014the action wherein the judgment, based\non the ground that (the) act or transaction of (an extra-provincial) company was invalid or prohibited by reason of such company not having been licensed or registered * * * has been rendered or entered\nthat the company is authorized to maintain anew.\nWith great respect, I fear that the significance of the words of reference, \"such\" and \"therein,\" must have escaped the attention of the learned appellate judges. I cannot conceive of a legislature employing the terms of subsection 3 to express the idea that a new action might be brought for the same cause of action as was involved in that which had been dismissed. The language used clearly points to a reinstatement or revivification of the dismissed action or proceeding\nas if no judgment had therein been rendered or entered,\ni.e., at the stage at which the dismissed action was when the judgment based upon the statute subse- quently held ultra vires was pronounced. Not only are two well-known rules of construction\u2014one, known as \"The Golden Rule,\" that\nin interpreting all written instruments, the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words is to be adhered to, unless that would lead to some absurdity or some repugnance or inconsistency with the rest of the instrument,\nand the other that\nremedial statutes should be construed liberally and so as to suppress the mischief and advance the remedy,\nthus given due effect, but the apparent purpose of the legislation of 1917\u2014to place extra-provincial corporations, as far as possible, in the same plight and position as if, in litigation to which they were parties, judgments based on the statute held to be invalid had never been pronounced\u2014is best attained. The costs of the litigation incurred up to the date of the judgment that should not have been rendered are not thrown away, as they would be if a new action should be brought. Moreover, if obliged to bring new actions, many plaintiffs, who had suffered dismissals based on the statute held to be invalid, would find their causes of action barred by statutes of limitations. It is most probable that the legislature had this in view and therefore authorized the prosecution of the very action so dismissed rather than the institution of new proceedings, in which the remedy which the legislature meant to afford might prove illusory. By empowering the court to deal with the costs\u2014\nupon such terms as to costs as the court may impose\u2014\nit has been made reasonably certain that no injustice to any party will ensue.\nWhile the use of the terms\nas if no judgment had therein been rendered or entered\nmight at first blush lead one to think that it was meant that in every case the action should stand for judgment before the trial court, although it had, as here, been there dismissed on the merits and not because of any lack of status of the plaintiff, further consideration of the subsection as a whole I think warrants the view that the only judgment with which it was intended to interfere was a judgment based on the ground that the failure of the company to obtain licence or registration was fatal to the validity of the act or transaction forming the subject matter of the suit. It follows that the appellant company was right in applying to the Court of Appeal to reinstate this action in that court as it stood before it pronounced its judgment on the 5th of Nov., 1912\u2014the first judgment which based the dismissal of the action on the ground of the invalidity of the plaintiffs' contract by reason of its not having been licensed or registered.\nWhether the Court of Appeal should hear further argument, whether it should allow any amendments, if sought, or the introduction of any further evidence are questions of practice and procedure which that court may more properly deal with. Pronouncing the order which, in our opinion, the Court of Appeal should have made, we merely direct that the action of the plaintiff company be reinstated in the Court of Appeal of British Columbia and be dealt with by that court as if its judgment of the 5th Nov., 1912, had not been rendered or entered\u2014subject to such terms as to costs as it may see fit to direct or impose.\nThe appellant is entitled to its costs in this court, of the appeals and of the motions to quash and also to the costs of the appeal to the Court of Appeal from the order of Mr. Justice Gregory.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur with my brother Anglin.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McPhillips & Smith.\nSolicitor for the respondent: D.

In an action by the owners of the wharf and warehouse for wharfage and for work and labour performed in salving the goods there was a counterclaim for damages.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia (51 N.S. Rep. 291), that as it was proved that the collapse of the wharf was caused by the piles having become wormeaten and unable to support the superstructure, and that the life of a pile in Halifax harbour is about ten years; and as it was not proved that the piles had been properly inspected or renewed during the sixteen years of the existence of the wharf; the warehousemen had not exercised the reasonable care required of a bailee for hire and were responsible for the loss and injury to the warehoused goods.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1], reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nJenks K.C. for the appellants.\nW. A. Henry K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014There can, I assume, be no doubt about the law which governs the relations of the parties to this case. At the argument, both parties agreed that the wharfinger stands in the position of an ordinary bailee for hire and is therefore not an insurer of the safety of his dock. But he is under an obligation to use reasonable care to keep it in a safe condition.\nThe whole controversy here turns upon the condition of the dock at the time the appellants (the owners) and warehousemen agreed to discharge, pile and re-load the cargo of the \"Cammo,\" a Belgian relief ship which put into Halifax harbour for repairs. The bare fact of the accident may not be sufficient to cause a presumption or permit an inference of negligence; but that fact taken in connection with the physical cause or causes of the accident may shew that the responsible human cause of the particular accident in question was a fault of commission or omission on the part of the defendant.\nRitchie J. gave judgment for the plaintiffs (appellants) for $7,107.64 and dismissed the counterclaim. He said:\u2014\nThere is danger about every wharf, because as soon as the supporting piles are driven the worms attack them\u2014the failure of one pile may cause a collapse. The plaintiffs, no doubt, were fully alive to the danger of worms. The question is whether or not, having regard to the danger, they used reasonable care as prudent men in the maintenance of the wharf. The evidence of the witnesses called by the plaintiffs has convinced me that they did use such care.\nThe late Chief Justice Sir Wallace Graham, with whose opinion Russell and Chisholm JJ. concurred, said:\nThe company cannot claim that this was a case of inevitable accident or that the defect in the piles was a latent defect so far as they were concerned. It was either known to the company or would have been known to them, if they had used proper care in examination and in renewing the piles which had been ravaged by the worms.\nHe quotes at length from the testimony in respect to the cause of the breaking of the piles and the opportunity of knowing the condition of the defective piles.\nThe wharf was constructed in 1899 and the evidence is that in Halifax the average life of piles is 10 years. The Chief Justice says:\u2014\nIf 10 years is the life of a pile, the company in the course of 15 years would, at least, be expected to have renewed all the piling under this wharf. There is no evidence to that effect. As a fact, a majority had not been replaced.\nI entirely agree in the conclusions reached by the court en banc. The diver, who was in the best position to give evidence as to the conditions under the water, was not produced as a witness and no explanation is given for his absence. His name is not mentioned and therefore the respondent had no opportunity to discuss his competence. Ample opportunity existed on the other hand to check the accuracy of the statement made by Mr. Jefferson Davis and in the absence of any attempt to contradict him I am disposed to accept the conclusion he reached. If, as appears to be admitted by both sides, the life of a pile in Halifax harbour is 10 years and the wharf was over 16 years old, every original pile put in had outlived its usefulness at the time of the accident and the omission to prove that the piling had been renewed or properly inspected taken with the fact of the accident is sufficient to permit an inference of negligence.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014This was an appeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia holding the defendant, appellants, liable for the damages caused to the respondent's goods warehoused on their wharf by the defendants.\nThe wharf collapsed after the goods were so warehoused, the underpinning piles of the wharf giving way and many of them breaking off about at or below low-water mark. The evidence shews I think clearly that a number of the supporting piles of the wharf had been eaten almost through by worms and that they had in consequence become unable to give the necessary support to sustain the weight placed in the warehouse of the plaintiffs' goods, and had not been replaced by sound and strong piles.\nThere is no doubt that the plaintiffs took great pains to keep that part of their wharf which was above low water in good order and repair. Reasonably constant inspections of this part of the structure were made from time to time and if anything in this case depended upon the discharge by the appellants of their duty in that regard I should have for one been prepared to say that they appeared to have fully and fairly discharged that duty.\nBut it does not appear to me that the full discharge by the appellants of their duty in respect of the superstructure of the wharf down to low water affects the question whether they discharged their duty with respect to the piling below low water on the strength and soundness of which the whole superstructure depended. The appellants were, it is true, as warehousemen only bailees for hire of the goods warehoused and as such had a limited liability. They were not insurers but were obliged to take reasonable care of the goods and chattels warehoused by them. In the case of Searle v. Laverick[2], Blackburn J., in delivering the judgment of the court, says:\nThe obligation to take reasonable care of the thing intrusted to a bailee of this class (amongst which he had previously mentioned warehousemen as included) involves in it an obligation to take reasonable care that any building in which it is deposited is in a proper state so that the thing deposited may be reasonably safe in it. The question in this case is thus reduced to the single one whether the appellants did take such reasonable care with respect to their warehouse on their wharf. Reasonable care necessarily, of course, required such care of the underpinning of the wharf on which the warehouse rested.\nDid the appellants prove reasonable care in that respect? I think not. They, it is true, employed a diver to make the necessary examination of the underpinning below low water on which the safety of the whole structure above depended. But this diver was not shewn to be a competent person for the task assigned him, nor was he called at the trial, nor evidence given shewing that his presence could not be had. As far as I can gather, his name was not even given or his absence from the trial explained, or his qualifications for the important duties assigned him shewn. It is true that it was proved a diver had been employed to make the necessary inspection and Mosher's evidence is to the effect that wherever this diver told him a new supporting pillar should be placed in lieu of the one destroyed by the worms, he, Mosher, placed it.\nOn this crucial and necessary point of the competency of the diver employed to discharge the duties assigned to him either by his own evidence or by other evidence the appellants failed to shew they had discharged their duty and their obligation to take reasonable care of the goods entrusted to them.\nThe proper inference to be drawn from the collapse of the wharf and the warehouse and the examination of the supporting and broken piles made after the collapse in the absence of any direct evidence on the point is that the diver was not a competent man for the important duty entrusted to him and failed to discharge it. On this ground I hold that the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014I do not think the evidence adduced on behalf of the appellants at the trial satisfies the requirements of the law imposed upon them as the result of the unexplained reason for the collapse of the wharf in question in face of the assurances given the respondent to induce him to unload his vessel.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014I have not been convinced that the conclusion reached by the majority of the learned judges of the court en banc is erroneous. The evidence makes it reasonably certain that the cause of the collapse of the defendants' wharf was the weakening of supporting piles due to the action of limnoria, rendering it incapable of sustaining the weight of the cargo of the \"Camino,\" which, as placed on the dock, averaged 311 lbs. to the square foot, with a possible maximum weight of 413 lbs. to a square foot at some points. It was well known that wooden piling of wharves in Halifax harbour is exposed to this cause of deterioration. Adequate inspection at reasonably frequent intervals, followed by such repairs and replacements as such inspection discloses to be necessary, is admittedly the proper means that should be taken to guard against this danger. Under the circumstances of this case the onus was upon the defendants to establish that they had taken these means. In my opinion they failed to discharge that burden satisfactorily. The evidence and absence of evidence which warrants this conclusion has been fully stated by the late learned Chief Justice of Nova Scotia and no good purpose would be served by again detailing it.\nI would dismiss the appeal. Brodeur J.\u2014It is common ground that it was the duty of the appellant company to exercise reasonable care that the condition of the wharf was such that the vessels using it would not be exposed to injury. That principle of law placed upon the appellants the burden of proof that reasonable care was taken to avoid accidents.\nThere is no doubt that the wharf collapsed on account of the piles being defective and wormeaten. The evidence shews that after the accident the piles were examined and found to be in that condition.\nThe appellants claim, however, that they had during the previous year the wharf examined and repaired. The report of their inspector shews, in fact, that he had examined a certain part of those piles; but he could not say himself whether or not the part which was covered by water at that time had been duly inspected.\nThe appellants claim that a diver had been sent to examine that part covered by water; but they failed to bring the diver in evidence to shew that he was a competent man and that he had duly performed his work. It was the duty of the appellants under these circumstances to adduce such evidence; and having failed in that respect to shew that they had exercised reasonable care of their property they should be held liable for the accident which has destroyed the cargo of a vessel of which the respondent was the master.\nFor these reasons, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: W. H. Fulton.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W. A. Henry.\n[1] 51 N.S. Rep. 291; 35 D.L.R. 150.\n[2] L.R. 9 Q.B. 122.\n"

If the city engineer considered that the work was not properly done he could have it performed at the company's expense and could, at his discretion, order the company to remove the snow and ice entirely. By a provincial statute this by-law was ratified and confirmed \"in all respects as if (it) had been enacted by the legislature.\" At a certain point on its line the company swept the snow four feet back from the track where it formed a bank sloping somewhat steeply down to the track, and E., attempting to board a car, fell on this slippery surface and was severely injured. The city engineer never objected to this method of removing the snow.\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Court of Appeal (28 Man. R. 363), Davies J. dissenting, that the company had not performed its statutory duty of keeping the street safe for traffic and was liable in damages to E. for the injury so sustained.\nHeld, per Anglin J., that the nature and extent of the statutory duty, the manner in which it should be performed and the correlative rights of the defendant company were not properly presented to the jury and there should be a new trial.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe material facts are stated in the above head-note. B. L. Beacon for the appellant. As to breach of statutory duty see Fulton v. Norton[2], and Butler v. Fife Coal Co.[3].\nThe clause of the by-law respecting the removal of snow and ice is part of a public statute (R.S.M. [1913] ch. 168, secs. 5 and 9) and should be construed liberally in favour of the public. Craes Statute. Law (4th ed.), page 465; Shea v. Reid Newfoundland Co.[4], at page 544.\nThe case, from the evidence produced, could not have been withdrawn from the jury and the verdict should not have been disturbed. See Toronto Power Co. v. Paskwan[5], at page 739.\nLaird K.C. for the respondent. The by-law was merely a contract between the city and the company and gave no right of action for a breach to one of the public. City of Kingston v. Kingston &c., Electric Railway Co.[6]; City of Toronto v. Toronto Railway Co.[7], at page 547.\nThe contract provides for a summary enforcement of the company's obligation which is the only available remedy. City of Winnipeg v. Winnipeg Electric Railway Co.[8].\nIf there is a statutory duty it is one for the benefit of the city only. Johnston v. Consumers Gas Co.[9]; Sharpness New Docks v. Attorney Generality[10].\nB. L. Beacon for the appellant.\nLaird K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I agree that the appeal should be allowed with costs for the reasons given by Mr. Justice Idington. Davies J. (dissenting)\u2014This is an appeal from the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba setting aside a judgment for $4,000 in favour of plaintiff entered by the trial judge on a general verdict of a jury who found that amount as damages.\nThe claim of the plaintiff is one for personal injury caused to her as she was about to enter one of the defendant's cars and is and must be based upon the defendant's negligence.\nThe plaintiff, it appeared in evidence, was with her daughter at the corner of Portage Avenue and Belmont St. waiting for a west bound car which, when it came along, stopped a little west of its usual stopping place. They walked west to where the car was standing and when they arrived opposite to the entrance door of the car, but before plaintiff had reached up her hand to grasp the rail, she slipped and fell. The evidence shewed that there was a slope or incline in the snow starting about three and a half or four feet north of the north rail of the car track and sloping to the edge of the rail. Deacon, one of plaintiff's witnesses, stated that at the point where the accident happened the snow\nwas swept clear from the track between the rails and swept back, sloping back to a ridge about four feet;\nand that from that point to the north curb the street was level. The same witness further states that at the time\nthere was a lot of automobile and jitney traffic on Portage Avenue, that they ran one wheel between the rails and the other on the incline in order to keep off the deep snow and that the effect of this traffic was to make the incline or slope hard and slippery.\nSome evidence was given by defendant's witnesses to the effect that the incline was not as great as Deacon stated but of course the jury had a right to accept his evidence in preference to that of others and assuming they did so the vital question arises in what respect were the defendants guilty of negligence causing or contributory to the accident?\nThe defendant company was incorporated by the Legislature of Manitoba by legislation which expressly validated and confirmed a by-law of the City of Winnipeg giving to the defendant company the right to construct and operate a street railway on the streets of the city of Winnipeg for the carrying of passengers and prescribing the terms and conditions of such construction and operation. Full provision is made as to the location and manner of construction of such railway subject to the approval of the city engineer.\nSub-clause f of clause 3 of the by-law deals with the main question of the defendants' liability in such a case as this and is as follows:\n(f) The said applicants shall at all times keep so much of the streets occupied by the said line of railway as may lie between the rails of every track and between the lines of every double track and for the space of eighteen inches on the outside of every track cleared of snow, ice and other obstructions and shall cause the snow, ice and other obstructions to be removed as speedily as possible, the snow and ice to be spread over the balance of the street so as to afford a safe and unobstructed passageway for carriages and other vehicles. Should the said engineer at any time consider that the snow or ice has not been properly or as speedily as possible removed from or about the tracks of the railway lines or not properly or as speedily as possible spread over the street, he may cause the same to be removed and spread as aforesaid and charge the expense to the said applicants who shall pay the same to the city. If, however, the engineer is of opinion that the snow or ice should be removed entirely from the streets so as to afford a safe passage for sleighs and other vehicles the said applicants shall at once do so at their own expense and charge, or in in case of their neglect the engineer may do so and charge the expense to them and they shall pay the same.\nApart from the question of negligence in carrying out the obligations which this sub-clause (f) imposes upon it the company is not liable for the condition or non-repair of the city's street. It is the duty of the city to keep the streets in repair and if by reason of its failure to do its duty in that respect any one sustains injuries it is the city that would be liable.\nThe city is not a party to this action and I do not desire to express any opinion whatever as to its liability for the plaintiff's injuries.\nThe question then in this case is whether or not the defendants have been guilty of negligence in discharging their obligations with respect to the removal of the snow and ice which would from time to time in Winnipeg gather on and alongside of their car tracks.\nI do not think the defendants' obligation as to the removal and disposition of the snow can be expressed more clearly than the sub-section above quoted has expressed them. The city engineer is to determine whether the company has or has not properly removed the snow from about the track of the railway lines and if he decides they have not he is empowered to remove it at their expense. There was not a scintilla of evidence to shew that the engineer had at any time determined that the company had not properly removed the snow at all times. The only inference to be drawn from the evidence is that he was quite satisfied.\nIf the company complies with its obligation in that regard without negligence and causes injury to others no liability for damages rests upon them, on the plain and simple ground that the doing of an act authorized by the legislature cannot, without negligence involve liability to others for injuries they may suffer in consequence.\nThe rule or principle of law on this point seems clearly beyond doubt. In the case of Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Roy[11], their Lordships of the Privy Council held expressly that a railway company authorized by statute to carry on its railway undertaking in the place and by the means adopted is not responsible in damages for injury not caused by negligence but by the ordinary and normal use of its railway or, in other words, by the proper execution of the powers conferred by statute. In that case some sparks which escaped from an engine drawing a train of the railway company set fire to and destroyed the plaintiff's barn, but as there was no negligence on the part of the company they were held not to be liable for the loss.\nSee also Geddis v. Bann Reservoir[12], at pp. 455-6, and Hammersmith Railway Co. v. Brand[13].\nThe claim in this case is that the accident to the plaintiff was caused by a slippery incline from the main surface of the snow on the street to the rail upon which incline the plaintiff slipped and fell. But this incline was necessarily caused by the company in the exercise of its statutory powers and obligations in removing the snow from its tracks and spreading it upon the street. That afterwards it was pressed down by motor and jitney traffic leaving a hard smooth \"surface\" sloping upwards from the rails is something for which the company is in no way responsible. Such a slope or incline as made by the company was unavoidable if they were to fulfil their obligations. If the defendant company had removed all the snow from the eighteen inch strip outside of the rails leaving a perpendicular wall at the eighteen inch distance from the street the incline or slope would naturally have been greater, and the danger to the public much greater than its removal from the rails on a gradual incline. The fact, as Mr. Justice Perdue remarks, that part of the snow remained upon the strip was not an act of negligence which either caused or contributed to plaintiff's accident. The 18 inch strip of the incline complained of was entirely covered by the overhanging car and the steps of the car and plaintiff's accident occurred further up on the incline just before reaching out her hand to catch the rail or raising her foot to step on the car.\nThe actual facts are that in a city like Winnipeg, where there are such heavy falls of snow in the winter time, there must without negligence necessarily be in the removal of the snow from the track by the most modern and improved methods an incline or slope to the top of the snow in the street, that this incline or slope was at the time of the accident to the plaintiff made hard and slippery by the automobile and jitney traffic and that this condition was aggravated by a recent light fall of snow. Neither for the effect of the motor and jitney traffic in hardening and making slippery the incline or slope or for the light fall of snow which aggravated and increased the danger of these conditions the combination of which caused plaintiff's accident can the company be held liable.\nThere was no evidence whatever that the city's engineer was not satisfied with the manner in which the company had discharged its obligations with regard to the removal of the snow from and adjoining its tracks and on the other hand there was clear and undisputed evidence that they had so removed it by the latest and most approved methods and without negligence of any kind.\nI agree with the learned judges of the Court of Appeal that the only evidence from which negligence could possibly be inferred was with regard to the incline and that no such inference could properly be drawn. It is not stated by any one that this incline was steeper than it should have been or that defendants could have avoided making an incline if they discharged their obligations.\nThere were only two ways in which the company could discharge its obligations with respect to the snow outside of the outer rail for the distance of 18 inches; one was to remove it entirely for that distance and either leave a perpendicular wall of snow 18 inches outside the rail and from the top of that wall leave or make an incline or slope to the top of the snow on the street level or remove the snow as they did by well-known modern appliances in an incline or slope from the rail to the snow on the street level. They adopted the latter course which had the approval, as I infer, of the engineer inasmuch as he never disapproved in any way. The other course of leaving a perpendicular wall at the 18 inches limit from the rail would obviously have created an intolerable and dangerous condition alike to vehicular traffic and to pedestrians and would doubtless have met with the prompt disapproval of the engineer. The slippery condition of the incline was caused by the motor and jitney traffic and was increased by a light fall of snow the night before the accident. For neither of these was the defendant in any way responsible.\nFor these reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014The legal foundation upon which, beyond question, appellant's right of action herein can be rested is that what was improperly done or left undone by respondent resulted in unjustifiably putting a public highway so out of repair as to constitute thereby that sort of public nuisance for which an action will lie at the suit of any traveller injured thereby, as she claims she was, against the party so creating the nuisance or contributing thereto.\nThe relevant law is daily applied for example against the negligent teamster who has left improperly his waggon or machine or load on the highway, or the contractor engaged in repair or reconstruction of part thereof, who has improperly done or left undone something whereby he has endangered needlessly those using, as of right, the highway, and thereby caused any injury and damage to any of them.\nThe Electric Railway Company given by virtue of any legislation a franchise for the use of any highway is protected, so far as acting within the powers so conferred, from liability to any action for accidental results solely and necessarily due thereto. But it must so absolutely live up to the terms and conditions of its franchise that the accident complained of, in any action for damages arising therefrom, cannot be attributed to its having done or left undone that which the terms of its legalized franchise may have imposed or rendered obligatory upon it.\nIts licence is limited to that which it can rightfully enjoy, concurrently with an observance of such terms. An habitual disregard thereof may entitle the Attorney-General or other duly constituted public authority in that behalf to move the courts to deprive it of the franchise or enforce its observance.\nUnder our English system of law the private individual has, however, no such right to complain to the courts, unless and until he has suffered injury resulting from the non-observance of the said terms and conditions. Then he or she suffering have, in case a public nuisance is created, a right to complain.\nIt is this phase of the law which distinguishes the case of Ogston v. Aberdeen District Tramways Co.[14] from some other cases.\nThe law as laid down in that case relative to the result of non-observance of the terms and conditions of the franchise leading to the creation of a nuisance is applicable here.\nThe observance of the respective set of terms and conditions used in any such like cases of a purchase may lead to different results as illustrated by the case of City of Montreal v. Montreal Street Railway Co.[15], where that complained of was held to have been conceded to the railway company by the city's by-law and hence could furnish no ground of complaint. See also the cases of Morrison v. Sheffield[16], distinguishing Great Central Railway Co. v. Hewlett[17], which itself illustrates how the company had been adjudged liable and then protected by a later Act enabling it to maintain what had formerly been adjudged a nuisance, and the cases of the Dublin United Tramways Co. v. Fitzgerald[18]; Geddes v. Bann Reservoir[19]; Mersey Docks Trustees v. Gibbs[20]; Metropolitan Asylum District v. Hill[21], and Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Parke[22], where the obligation not to be negligent is implied in the legislative grant if proven. See also cases cited in earlier reports of these cases.\nThe law, I take it, rendering liable one so transgressing its rights and disregarding its duties needs no elaboration, but from the argument adduced it seemingly needs in order to have confusion in thought and law eliminated from the discussion to have it pointed out that though the city may also have incurred liability in regard to what has taken place and is in question herein that does not in law excuse or exonerate the respondent.\nIn like manner and for the like purpose I may observe that it is quite possible that the appellant's action may be rested upon the statute which confirmed the contract between the city and respondent.\nI avoid passing any decisive opinion upon that subject for the two-fold reason that it is not necessary herein to do so, and the elaborate examination of the law on that point to bring the question so raised within the range of easy solution and determination would be useless and needlessly confusing.\nOnce it might be shewn that the statute by its purview or language, to adopt the rule laid down by Lord Cairns in the case of Atkinson v. Newcastle Water Works Co.[23], would support the action what have we gained?\nWe need not go further than the elementary principles of law which I have adverted to.\nIf the statute gives an action it can herein only proceed upon the same identical principles relevant to the application of the facts in either case. The whole question involved and all the questions involved, in any way one can look at the matter, must turn upon the tests of whether or not the respondent lived up to the terms and conditions of its licence to invade the highway and whether or not it was a result of its non-observance thereof which caused the appellant's injuries.\nIn directing the jury the learned trial judge used the word \"negligence\" which at first blush I was inclined to think might not most aptly describe all that was needed to direct the jury, once they were told the nature of the obligation resting on respondent.\nI have tested it in many ways in my own mind and I cannot find any one that would better convey to the jurors' minds what in the last analysis was left for them to decide upon the evidence as applicable to the obligation resting upon the respondent when exercising its powers.\nThere certainly was evidence that would have to be submitted to the jury and their determination of it ought to have been held final and left undisturbed unless some misdirection shewn.\nThere was nothing complained of at the trial by counsel for respondent which gives any legal ground for setting the verdict aside.\nThe disregard of the request to submit questions to the jury is not in Manitoba a misdirection.\nMuch often is to be said in favour of submitting questions but I cannot think an obligatory rule of that sort would promote the administration of justice. Take for example the case of Jamieson v. Harris[24], which presented ordinary everyday sorts of facts which any jury ought to have been able to decide upon, by applying their common sense, yet after twenty-six questions submitted and answered it was decided here that the learned trial judge had missed the right mark to direct attention to.\nThe next ground of complaint made at the trial in regard to the charge was that the action had not been based on any breach of alleged statutory duty.\nInasmuch as (which I have already tried to explain) the real question to be decided, was (so far as facts upon which the jury had to pass were concerned) identically the same whether presented as a breach of statutory duty or as the liability arising from the creating of a nuisance, I fail to see any valid ground of objection in \"what is thus put forward.\nThe more elaborate presentation which was made of the objection resolves itself into a mere verbal distinction without containing anything in substance.\nSo far as pointed at the question raised as to the possibility of resting an action upon the statute it can be of no avail, in my view, that the action can rest upon the liability for nuisance quite independently of the statute.\nIt is not always that a charge which possibly proceeded in the misconception in the mind of the learned trial judge of the exact expression applicable to the name of the relevant law can be upheld.\nBut in this case it could by no possibility have misled the jury in the most rigorous discharge of their actual duties. They were identical in either way that the case might have been presented.\nAnd still more is that the case when we come to weigh the term negligence to which, in some way not made clear, objection may have been intended to have been taken.\nThe learned trial judge upon mere mention of it at once assumed the question of contributory negligence had not been passed upon and corrected as it seems to me the erroneous impression of counsel, who seems to have assented.\nThere seems to have been some ten or more acts or omissions which appellant had put forward as acts of negligence on the part of the respondent.\nIn one part of the charge the learned judge seems to say that if respondent was guilty of any of these it must fail. This seems too broadly stated but is not objected to and the general tenor of the charge was such as to confine the jury's attention to the question of whether respondent had properly observed its obligations in a clause of the contract referred to as \"F\" and which imposed upon it a manner of dealing with the snow which certainly does not seem to have been observed else the situation created thereby would not have been that which was presented in evidence.\nA slope of eighteen inches over the three and a half feet of snow turned into ice on any street lying next outside the rail seems to have been the condition which produced the accident in question.\nThat certainly was not what one would have expected to find as the product of the due observance of the contract in question, nor was it a fit condition for vehicular travel.\nIf that resulted from respondent's treatment of the snow problem, then I see no defence to the action, or reason for interfering with the verdict of the jury.\nBut even falling a long way short of such a product there seems no reason for a new trial which is prohibited by the \"Court of Appeal Act\" unless there has in truth been a miscarriage of justice within the meaning of same.\nIt has occurred to me that the specification \"F\" requiring a clear space between the rails and eighteen inches outside the rail was not very suitable for probable conditions and that a slope may have been treated by way of compromise.\nMoreover, that is only surmise and at best could not help the respondent which could be no party to anything but that specified.\nThe afterthought suggestion that the snow was to be spread over the balance of the street so as to afford a safe and unobstructed passageway for carriages. and other vehicles but did not provide for pedestrians does not seem to have much weight. If such a passageway for carriages and other vehicles had been produced, the walking would not have been bad.\nWhat is complained of was neither fit for pedestrians nor passengers by carriages or other vehicles. No doubt the jury understood this and assumed rightly pedestrians had full right to travel there to reach the car.\nIf the slope had only been a full eighteen inches wide it would have been overcome by the overhanging side of the car and have done appellant no harm.\nHad the actual specification in \"F\" been adhered to pedestrians would have been quite safe in trying to get aboard a car, but I imagine the city and its engineer would have had to face a problem they do not, as was their duty, seem to have efficiently tried to have discharged.\nThat is no reason for setting aside appellant's judgment.\nThe respondent asks for a new trial if we should be disposed to disturb the appellate court's judgment.\nThe only thing put forward in that regard not already considered and dealt with is the interesting question of the non-reception in evidence of photographs of the street as it existed a month or more after the accident. I think the learned trial judge was right in such refusal.\nThere has been quite enough of confusion of law and of fact introduced into this simple case without giving such another cause therefor. Whether photographs can ever be insisted upon or not I will not pass upon but certainly as a guide to the condition of snow and ice on a street in Winnipeg a month before taken is asking too much. The appeal should be allowed with costs here and in Court of Appeal and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nAnglin J.\u2014I am with respect unable to accept the conclusion reached in the Court of Appeal in this case that there was no evidence on which a jury could reasonably base a verdict for the plaintiff. The very condition of the roadway as described by some of the witnesses\u2014a slope extending from the rails outward rising eighteen inches in four feet\u2014might (of course I must not be understood as saying or meaning that it should) be considered by the jury to have been not \"safe\" * * * for the passage of carriages and other vehicles,\" and to have been due, in part at least, to some negligence on the part of the defendant company's servants in exercising its statutory right (or duty) to spread \"over the balance of the street\" the snow removed from the railway tracks and the adjoining eighteen inch strips.\nBut I am of the opinion that the case was not properly submitted to the jury on this vital issue and that the defendant is entitled to a new trial. As the action should therefore, in my opinion, go before another jury, it would not be proper for me to discuss the issues involved further than is necessary to make clear the ground on which I would direct a new trial.\nUpon the charge of the learned trial judge, although the jury should be of the opinion that in disposing of the snow handled by them the company's servants had done all that was required\nto afford a safe and unobstructed passage for carriages and other vehicles,\nthey might, if they thought that there was a condition dangerous to pedestrians ascribable in some degree to the acts of the defendants' servants, find a verdict for the plaintiff. After reading the first sentence of clause (f) of the regulations embodied in by-law 543 of the City of Winnipeg, validated by sec. 34 of 55 Vict., ch. 56, whereby the defendant company was declared to be entitled to\nall the franchises, powers, rights and privileges thereunder,\nthe learned judge said to the jury:\nBut apart altogether from the statute, but at the same time not inconsistent with it, the street railway company may remove such snow from its tracks and such portions of the streets as may be necessary for the operation of its cars. But if it does remove the snow, or alter its natural condition in any way, there is a duty cast upon it to do so in a reasonable manner and without negligence. If it removes snow from its tracks and throws it upon part of the highway adjoining the tracks in a careless and negligent manner or leaves it piled up or heaped up with a dangerous slope upon a highway, and if it was by reason of such negligence that the plaintiff slipped and fell, then (subject to the rule of contributory negligence which I will presently explain) the defendant would be liable.\nYou may quite properly require a high degree of care to such of the public who may in the ordinary course of events attempt to board a street car or who, in other words, are invited to cross, to the car, that portion of the street cleaned and distributed, but excepting in so far as the defendant may have rendered the street dangerous by its acts, it is not liable for the dangerous condition of a public street on which it receives and discharges passengers. However, in removing snow from one part of the street and depositing it on another part at an angle, you may fairly charge the defendant with knowledge of the traffic and its probable effect upon the snow so distributed.\nExcept under the authority of the by-law ratified by the legislature the defendant company had no right to interfere with the normal conditions of the highways. Anything in the nature of an obstruction or danger to lawful traffic thereon of any kind caused wholly or in part by its interference resulting in injury would, apart from the statutory sanction, amount to an actionable nuisance. The legislature saw fit, however, to give the company the right to remove snow and ice from their tracks and a defined space on either side of them in order to permit of the free operation of their tramcars. In doing so it thought proper to approve of the condition annexed by the city by-law to the exercise of the right so conferred, viz., that the company should spread the snow and ice so removed \"over the balance of the street.\" It had no right to take away any of the snow or ice to any other place, unless the city engineer should so direct, when in his opinion that should become necessary\nto afford a safe passage for sleighs and other vehicles.\nThe by-law approved by the legislature specified the manner in which the snow should be spread by the company, i.e.\nso as to afford a safe and unobstructed passageway for carriages and other vehicles.\nNo doubt, as put by the learned judge, in this connection the defendant may fairly be charged with knowledge of the traffic on the highway and its probable effect. But the measure of its duty\u2014the condition of the exercise of its right\u2014is that, having regard to such traffic, it should spread snow and ice removed from its tracks, etc., so as not to obstruct or render unsafe vehicular traffic\u2014always of course so far as the exercise of reasonable care and skill will enable that to be done. If, notwithstanding the exercise of such care and skill, a condition dangerous to pedestrians should ensue\u2014either because of the excessive quantity of snow and ice thus accumulated on \"the balance of the street,\" or because of other conditions not attributable to any neglect of the company's servants in the exercise of its statutory right with its incidental obligation, the company is not legally responsible. It would only have done that which the legislature authorized it to do in the very manner and to the extent specified by the approved by-law. It is solely because this aspect of the case was, in my opinion, improperly presented to the jury that there should be a new trial.\nObjection to the learned judge's charge on this ground was probably sufficiently taken by counsel for the defendant, when he urged that\nno person can set up a claim in law for damages based on negligence against a party who has complied with a statutory power or a statutory duty,\nand again, that the plaintiff would not have a cause of action arising out of the slope in the highway unless that defect falls \"within the purview of the statute\"\u2014meaning, I take it, that a condition due to the acts of the company's servants, which, although unsafe for pedestrians, was reasonably safe and unobstructed for vehicular traffic, would not entail liability on the company.\nI would merely add, with respect, that this appears to be a case in which the learned trial judge might very properly have yielded to the suggestion of counsel for the defendant that questions, covering the several issues, should be submitted to the jury.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This is a case arising out of a street railway accident. By virtue of a by-law passed by the City of Winnipeg, the respondents were bound to keep the part of the street occupied by their lines for a space of 18 inches on both sides of the track clear of snow, ice and other obstruction and to spread over the balance of the street the snow or the ice so as to afford a safe and unobstructed passageway for carriages. This by-law was validated and confirmed by the legislature in all respects\nas if the said by-law had been enacted by the legislature.\nIt appears by the evidence that on the day of the accident there was a slope which might be of a dangerous nature spreading at the rail and extending back about four feet to a height of about 18 inches. When the appellant came to board the street car she fell by reason of that dangerous condition and was very seriously hurt.\nIt is claimed by the appellant that the duty imposed upon the respondent company was a statutory one in view of the declaration made by the legislature and that the by-law should be considered as being enacted by the legislature itself. That view has been accepted by the trial judge but the Court of Appeal would not adopt it and reversed on that ground the judgment of the Court of King's Bench of Manitoba.\nIf the legislature had simply confirmed the by-law, the latter should be considered as a contract between the city and the street railway company. But in declaring that this by-law becomes a legislative enactment that duty imposed upon the railway company becomes a statutory duty and if in the exercise of those powers, or in the carrying out of those duties, the company acts negligently then there is liability on its part towards any person who might be injured as a result of that neglect.\nSome evidence has been adduced to shew that this incline on the street was caused by the company and by the way the snow had been removed from the centre of the street and there was certainly sufficient evidence to justify the jury in coming to the conclusion that the duty imposed upon the company had been negligently carried out. On that ground, I should be of opinion that the findings of the jury should be sustained. Besides, the company in exercising a statutory power is under a common law duty not to injure the public. Geddes v. Bann Reservoir[25]. It is suggested, however, that a new trial should be ordered because the judge did not properly instruct the jury as to the nature of the duty and obligation of the company.\nIf I refer, however, to that charge I fail to see that he has not given those proper instructions. I notice that he uses, in one part of his charge, the following words, and I think they cover the objection which has been raised:\nBut apart altogether from the statute but at the same time not inconsistent with it, the street railway company may remove such snow from its tracks and such portions of the streets as may be necessary for the operation of its cars, but if it does remove the snow, or alter its natural condition in any way, there is a duty cast upon it to do so in a reasonable manner, and without negligence. If it removes snow from its tracks, and throws it upon part of the highway adjoining the tracks, in a careless and negligent manner, or leaves it piled up or heaped up with a dangerous slope upon the highway, and if it was by reason of such negligence that the plaintiff slipped and fell, then the defendant would be liable. You may quite properly require a high degree of care to such of the public who may in the ordinary course of events attempt to board a street car, or who, in other words, are invited to cross to the car that portion of the street so cleaned and distributed. But excepting in so far as the defendant may have rendered the street dangerous by its acts, it is not liable for the dangerous condition of a public street on which it receives and discharges passengers. However, in removing snow from one part of the street and depositing it on another part, at an angle, you may fairly charge the defendant with a knowledge of the traffic and its probable effect upon the snow so distributed.\nIn those circumstances, I think that the judgment appealed from should be reversed and the judgment of King's Bench should be restored with costs of this court and of the courts below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Benjamin L.

Shaw (Plaintiffs) Respondents.\n1918: June 17, 25.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, C.J., and Idington, Anglin, Brodeur JJ. and Cassels J. (ad hoc).\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO.\nContract\u2014Loan of money\u2014Interest at specified rate \u201cuntil paid\u201d\u2014Maturity of loan\u2014Payment of interest after maturity.\nWhere a contract is made for the loan of money \u201cwith interest at 2\u00bd per cent. per month till paid\u201d the borrower is not obliged to pay interest at said rate after maturity of the loan.\nPayment of interest at such rate after maturity is voluntary and the excess over the statutory rate cannot be recovered back.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (40 Ont. L.R. 475), reversing that on the trial (39 Ont. L.R. 440), reversed in part.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment at the trial[2], in favour of the defendants.\nThe appellants gave promissory notes for money borrowed from respondents agreeing to pay interest at the rate of 2\u00bd per cent. a month. In an action on the notes two defences were offered, that the respondents were money-lenders and the transaction was harsh and unconscionable and therefore void under the Dominion or Ontario \u201cMoney-Lenders Act.\u201d The Supreme Court held that they were not money-lenders and these Acts did not apply.\nThe second ground of defence was that in any case the rate of 2\u00bd per cent. a month would only govern until maturity of the notes.\nThe trial Judge held[3], that respondents were money-lenders and the transaction harsh and unconscionable. The Appellate Division[4], reversed his decision and gave judgment against appellants for the full amount claimed.\nJ.M. Ferguson and Coffey for the appellants.\nA.A. MacDonald and W.J. McCallum for the respondents.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed in part and the judgment modified as stated by Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014At the close of the argument of counsel for appellant the substantial part of the appeal was held untenable.\nHe failed to establish either that respondents were money-lenders within the meaning of the Ontario \u201cMoney-Lenders Act,\u201d R.S.O., [1914] ch. 175, or that the rate of two per cent. per month for such loans as in question could be held harsh and oppressive within the meaning of section 4 of said Act, even if it is applicable to transactions, between a borrower and another not such a money-lender, that fall within the meaning of the Act.\nThe appellants\u2019 counsel took, however, the further point that the contracts in question did not provide for such an excessive rate of interest as two per cent. per month after maturity.\nAs to so much of said interest at said excessive rate as was paid (if any) in respect of interest falling due after maturity, the payments must be held to have been voluntary, and hence not recoverable or to be interfered with in the accounting.\nBeyond the date of maturity, or time after maturity up to which interest may have been paid, and up to the signing of judgment for the principal, the rate should only be computed at the rate of five per cent. per annum unless a higher rate clearly is stipulated for in the respective contracts in question.\nThe $2,500 note bore no rate of interest as expressed on its face and such contract as existed relative thereto does not seem to extend to renewals of which that sued on seems to have been one of many.\nThe same would seem to hold good of the two smaller notes sued upon.\nThe note for $950 reads at end thereof; \u201cInt. 2% per mo. till paid.\u201d It is dated 22nd November, 1915. There appears in the case a letter of 22nd July, 1915, which refers no doubt to the original note for same loan which expressly provides for interest at the rate of two per cent. per month until paid, but I cannot see how that can be extended to renewals, for it is not so expressed.\nThe note sued on therefore must in such case stand on what it expresses. It has been held that such like expressions mean, prim\u00e2 facie, when due but this note is on demand. And the evidence shews such demand was made within a few days after given.\nA moderate rate of interest even exceeding the rate of five per cent. per annum might well be held as extended beyond the due date when coupled with later payments at such moderate rates but that reasoning from conduct does not extend to such an excessive rate as two per cent. per month. See Leake on Contracts, (4th ed.), p. 784, and cases there cited, also cases of St. John v. Rykert[5], and The Peoples Loan and Deposit Co. v. Grant[6], cited by appellants\u2019 counsel in argument.\nI conclude, therefore, that if the sum of $452.22 allowed by the Appellate Division is based, as claimed and not denied, upon the computation of interest at two per cent. per month on any of these several contracts there is an error in the judgment which should be rectified by a computing of the rate of interest at five per cent. per annum from the respective dates thus in question up to which the appellant had paid interest, down to the date when judgment was entered for the principal sum.\nIf the parties cannot agree as to the result of such computation the matter should be referred to the registrar to determine the amount.\nThe appeal to that extent should be allowed and the judgment appealed from reformed accordingly.\nThe appeal having failed in its main object, I cannot say there should be costs thereof allowed, but think under all the circumstances there should be no costs to either party here or in the Court of Appeal.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The defendants in my opinion have failed to establish that\nhaving regard to all the circumstances the cost of the loan(s) is excessive (or) that the transaction(s) (are) harsh and unconscionable\nwithin the meaning of s. 4 of the Ontario \u201cMoney-Lenders Act\u201d (R.S.O., ch. 175).\nThe male defendant is a solicitor and real estate dealer of considerable experience and is a most unlikely person to be the victim of a \u201charsh and unconscionable\u201d bargain. He was in a position to know whether the rate of interest was or was not excessive, having regard to the conditions of the money market during the currency of the loans. Presumably he would also know the nature and value of such securities as he had to offer, and would appreciate the risk which the lender was taking. A perusal of the evidence does not enable me to say that the Appellate Division erred in finding that a case within section 4 of the \u201cMoney-Lenders Act\u201d has not been made out.\nThe contention that the respondents were \u201cmoney-lenders\u201d within the meaning of either the Ontario \u201cMoney-Lenders Act\u201d or of the \u201cDominion Interest Act\u201d (R.S.C. ch. 122) is still more hopeless. There is no evidence whatever to support the suggestion that they carried on money lending as a business.\nBut on another branch of the appeal I think the plaintiffs are entitled to some relief. A stipulation for interest at a certain rate on a loan \u201cuntil paid\u201d is established by a long series of cases, of which it is needful to refer only to St. John v. Rykert[7], and People\u2019s Loan and Deposit Co. v. Grant[8], in this court, to import a contract to pay interest at the specified rate only until the maturity of the loan. To carry the contract for the stipulated rate beyond the maturity of the loan explicit provision to that effect must be made. It follows that after the maturity of the several obligations taken by the plaintiffs (including any renewals which specified the rate of interest) the defendants were under no contractual liability to pay interest at the high rate agreed upon. They were liable only for the statutory rate of 5%.\nBut payments at the higher rate actually made cannot be recovered back. They were voluntary. If made under any mistake, it was a mistake of law. Union Bank v. McHugh[9], may be cited as a comparatively recent illustration of the application of this well-known doctrine of English law.\nIn respect of the periods whch have elapsed since the several dates at which the respective obligations (including such renewals as specified the rate of interest) matured, any interest unpaid can be recovered only at the statutory rate of 5%. The judgment in appeal should be modified accordingly.\nIn view of the divided success there should be no costs of this appeal or in the Appellate Division.\nOur attention was called during the argument to what was said to be an accidental error in the judgment of the Appellate Division under which the female defendant might be required to pay $2,196 in addition to the amount recovered against her co-defendant. This was admittedly not intended and any correction necessary to limit the whole recovery to the amount for which Donald C. Hossack is found liable should be made. His co-defendant is jointly liable with him for a portion of that amount.\nBRODEUR J. concurred with Anglin J.\nCASSELS J. (ad hoc).\u2014I have carefully considered the questions argued on appeal in this case. The question has resolved itself into the one question of what rate of interest should be allowed after maturity of the loans and from the date of the payments after maturity.\nI have had the benefit of a perusal of the reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Anglin, and can add nothing further to what he has stated. I concur with his conclusions and with the disposition of the appeal as stated in his reasons for judgment.\nAppeal allowed in part.\nSolicitors for the appellant, Donald C.

Judgment of the Appellate Division, 40 Ont. L.R. 619; 39 D.L.R. 221, affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing the judgment on the trial in favour of the defendants.\nThe appellant by its policy dated 15th June, 1916, insured the respondent for one year from 17th June, 1916, to the amount of $1,500.00 against loss or damage by fire in respect of the stock of merchandise and store furniture and fixtures in the respondent\u2019s premises on Claremont street in the town of Thorold. A cash payment of $22.50 was made.\nThe policy was by its express terms subject to the statutory conditions set forth in section 194 of the Ontario Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1914, ch. 183. Among these conditions are the following:\u2014\n\u201c11. The insurance may be terminated by the company by giving seven days\u2019 notice to that effect, and, if on the cash plan, by tendering therewith a ratable proportion of the premium paid, for the unexpired term, calculated from the termination of the notice, and the policy shall cease after such notice or notice and tender as the case may be, and the expiration of the seven days.\n\u201c15. Any written notice to the assured may be by letter delivered to the assured or by registered letter addressed to him at his last post office address notified to the company or where no address is notified and the address is not known, addressed to him at the post office of the agency, if any, from which the application was received.\u201d\nOn the 15th day of December, 1916, the appellant sent by registered letter addressed to the respondent at her proper street address at Thorold a notice in the following terms:\nDear Sir,\u2014I beg to hand you enclosed herewith in legal tender the sum of $11.34 being the unearned premium for balance of the current. term of Policy No. 10514765 of this company issued to you dated June 17th, 1916, expiring June 17th, 1917, covering $1,200 on groceries, meats, cigars and tobacco and $300 on store furniture and fixtures, including refrigerator, cheese-cutter, shelving, electric fans, clock, table and stove, all while contained in the 3 storey brick building, occupied as laundry, grocery store, hall and dwelling situate as above, which is hereby cancelled and this company will not be held liable should any loss occur after the 22nd December, 1916.\nYours truly,\nALFRED WRIGHT,\nManager. Enclosed with the notice was $11.34 in legal tender to cover the ratable proportion of the cash premium paid for the unexpired portion of the term.\nOn the 25th day of December, 1916, during the absence for some days of the respondent, a fire occurred by which the insured property was destroyed.\nThe respondent had not in fact received the notice of cancellation although it arrived at Thorold in due course of post. The respondent is an Italian married to one Sam Savino. According, it is said, to the custom of her people, she retained after marriage her maiden name of Veltre but among the English-speaking people of Thorold, including the postmaster and his clerks, she was known only as Mrs. Savino. Letters are not delivered at Thorold but must be called for at the post office. The respondent\u2019s husband had taken a box at the post office in his own name, although he himself was not in business, but, as the name of Veltre was not identified with him or his wife in the minds of the people at the post office, no notice was placed in his box of the arrival of the registered letter. Under these circumstances, knowledge of the letter did not reach the respondent or her husband until after the. fire, when they were told by the insurance agent that such a letter had been sent.\nThe appellant claimed that the mailing of the notice with the money to be returned, operated as a cancellation of the policy according to its terms, relying upon the conditions hereinbefore set forth. Action was brought upon the policy and the trial judge gave effect to the appellant\u2019s contention and dismissed the action. The Appellate Division (Meredith C.J.O. dissenting), has reversed the judgment holding that the mailing of the notice and the enclosing of the money therewith did not effectually cancel the policy. R. S. Robertson for the appellants. The notice and tender complied with the requirements of condition 11 and were effective from the date of mailing. Mercantile Investment Co. v. International Co. of Mexico[2]; Union Fire Insurance Co. v. Fitzsimmons[3]; In re Simmons and Dalton[4]; Bruner v. Moore[5]. See also Maldover v. Norwich Union Fire Ins. Co.[6]\nA. C. Kingstone for the respondent referred to Bank of Commerce v. British America Assur. Co.[7]; May on Insurance (4th ed.) par. 67k.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur in the opinion stated by Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014This appeal ought to turn upon the construction of two conditions indorsed upon the policy of insurance in question and the application of the relevant facts.\nThe respondent, an Italian woman, whose maiden name was Franzesco Veltre, entirely ignorant of English, married one Savino, carried on with his assistance a shop in Thorold and obtained from appellant an insurance against fire upon the contents thereof for a year from the 17th June, 1916, which were consumed by fire on the 25th December following.\nThe policy was issued to F. Veltre, Esq., and had indorsed amongst other conditions the following:\u2014\n11. The insurance may be terminated by the company by giving seven days\u2019 notice to that effect, and, if on the cash plan, by tendering therewith a ratable proportion of the premium paid for the unexpired term, calculated from the termination of the notice, and the policy shall cease after such notice or notice and tender as the case may be, and the expiration of the seven days. 15. Any written notice to the assured may be by letter delivered to the assured or by registered letter addressed to him at his last post office address notified to the company or where no address is notified and the address is not known, addressed to him at the post office of the agency, if any, from which the application was received.\nThe appellant decided to avail itself of the said No. 11 condition and sent a registered letter enclosing the money mentioned and addressed as set forth therein, which letter reads as follows:\u2014\nLondon & Lancashire Fire Insurance Co. Limited of Liverpool,\nEngland.\nCanada Branch, Toronto, Ont.\nToronto, 15th December, 1916.\nF. Veltre, Esq.\n82-84-86 Claremont St.,\nThorold, Ont.\nDear Sir.\u2014I beg to hand you enclosed herewith in legal tender the sum of $11.34 being the unearned premium for balance of the current term of Policy No. 10514765 of this company issued to you dated June 17th, 1916, expiring. June 17th, 1917, covering $1,200 on groceries, meats, cigars and tobacco and $300 on store furniture and fixtures, including refrigerator, cheese-cutter, shelving, electric fans, clock, table and stove, all while contained in the three storey brick building, occupied as laundry, grocery store, hall and dwelling situate as above, which is hereby cancelled and this company will not be held liable should any loss occur after the 22nd December, 1916.\nYours truly,\nALFRED WRIGHT,\nManager.\nThe letter never was received by respondent till some time after the fire.\nThe appellant contends it was by such a letter so addressed, being so sent, relieved from any possible claim under the policy.\nThere never was any address notified to the company within the language of condition No. 15 and I cannot think that it was entitled to assume that such an address as used could be effective for such a purpose.\nIf the sender had tried to have a letter miscarry he could hardly have done better.\nEither the correct address was known or unknown. If known it should have been sent correctly addressed and not sent to a woman with the addition of \u201cEsq.\u201d If unknown it should, in order to comply with the condition, if available to it, have been sent to Merritton.\nThat might not have been any more successful in reaching the respondent.\nI do not feel called on to express any opinion upon the question of what the result might have been if the letter had been properly addressed within the meaning of any alternative in condition No. 15.\nI should be the more reluctant to do so seeing there are no less than four other conditions indorsed on the policy each involving the question of how written notice from the company may in certain cases respectively affect the legal relations of insurer and insured.\nIt may well be that condition No. 15 is intended to become operative only in regard to any one of three of these other conditions and yet ineffective in the case of tendering money.\nIn confining myself to the narrow issue I have dealt with I am only adhering to an observance of the issue joined by the pleadings.\nAnd I am by no means troubled over the suggestion of appellant\u2019s counsel that respondent is incorrectly described in the policy. She is the person insured, no matter how blunderingly described by appellant.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014This action is brought to recover on a fire insurance policy. The issue on the appeal is as to the sufficiency of a notice of cancellation given under the 11th and 15th statutory conditions, prescribed by the Ontario Insurance Act, R.S.O., ch. 194, s. 183. It is stated in the principal judgment of the Appellate Division, delivered by Hodgins J.A., as follows:\u2014 The respondent company pleads that it validly cancelled the policy under statutory conditions Nos. 11 and 15. This was effected, as the company contends by mailing to the appellant in a registered letter addressed to her under the name, \u201cF. Veltre, Esq., 82\u201184-86 Claremont St., Thorold, Ont.,\u201d a notice cancelling the policy, and by enclosing in this letter the respondent company\u2019s cheque for $11.34 or legal tender to that amount \u201cbeing the unearned premium for balance of the current term of Policy No. 10514765.\u201d\nThe letter containing the notice and money was never delivered to, or recieved by, the appellant until after the fire.\nThe sole question raised is whether the method thus adopted was an effective compliance with the conditions which require a tender of the unearned premium to be made as well as the giving of notice.\nIt was held by the learned trial judge that if the notice putting an end to the policy, the distinct end aimed at, can be given in writing by registered letter, the tender of the unearned portion of the premium may be made in the same way.\nThe learned judge held the tender insufficient and that the notice would be effective only from the time of its receipt by the insured. Magee J.A. concurred as to the insufficiency of the notice and Maclaren and Ferguson JJ.A. agreed in the result. Meredith C.J.O. dissented, holding that a tender by letter was authorised and that the notice was effective from the time of posting, or, at all events, from the time when in the ordinary course the letter would reach the person to whom it was sent.\nMailed at Toronto on the 15th of December, 1915, the notice reached Thorold in the ordinary course of mail on the 16th, but was never actually received by the insured and only came to her knowledge after the loss, which occurred on the 25th. The $11.34 enclosed ($11.25 in legal tender and 9 cents in postage stamps) was admittedly more than sufficient to cover the unearned proportion of the premium.\nThe insured was the wife of one Sam Savino. It is customary with the peoples of countries where the civil law prevails, that a married woman should be designated by her maiden name in business transactions, legal documents, etc. The plaintiff was accordingly insured as \u201cF. Veltre, Esq.\u201d\u2014the Esq. being added through some unexplained mistake. That is her designation in the policy, which she accepted and retained and on which she now sues.\nThere is no local mail delivery in Thorold. Probably owing to the notice of cancellation having been addressed to \u201cF. Veltre, Esq.,\u201d instead of to Mrs. Mde., or Signora Savino, it was not placed in Sam Savino\u2019s box at the local post office, or otherwise delivered, although it seems probable that some inquiry was made for the Savino mail at the general delivery wicket. The Savinos left Thorold on the 24th December, apparently for the purpose of spending Christmas in Toronto. The fire occurred during their absence. The 11th and 15th statutory conditions indorsed on the policy read as follows:\u2014\n11. The insurance may be terminated by the company by giving seven days\u2019 notice to that effect, and, if on the cash plan, by tendering therewith a ratable proportion of the premium paid, for the unexpired term, calculated from the termination of the notice, and the policy shall cease after such notice, or notice and tender as the case may be, and the expiration of the seven days.\n15. Any written notice to the assured may be by letter delivered to the assured or by registered letter addressed to him at his last post office address notified to the company or where no address is notified and the address is not known, addressed to him at the post office of the agency, if any, from which the application was received.\nFor the assured it was contended that\n(1) Condition 15 does not apply to a notice of cancellation:\n(2) The notice of cancellation was not addressed as condition 15 prescribes;\n(3) Tender of the proportion of the premium for the unexpired term cannot be made by post; it must be made personally;\n(4) A notice given under condition 15 is effectual only from the date of its actual receipt; (5) If effectual from the time at which it would in the ordinary course of post have reached the insured, the notice given for cancellation on the 22nd would be insufficient: a date having been named it could not operate to effect cancellation at a later date on the expiry of seven days from the time at which it should have reached the insured in the ordinary course of post.\nThe company on the other hand asserts its right to give written notice of cancellation by registered post if the letter contains a sum of money at least equal to the proportion of the premium unearned, and that such a notice, if addressed as prescribed, should be deemed to have been given when deposited in the post office.\n(1) I have no doubt that a written notice of cancellation under the 11th statutory condition is within the 15th condition and may be given by registered post. The literal terms of the 15th condition, taken in their ordinary acceptation, cover it. The collocation and history of the condition and a comparison with its counterpart, condition No. 7, seem to me to put the matter beyond doubt. The provision for sending written notice of cancellation by registered post, formerly itself part of the 19th statutory condition providing for cancellation by notice (R.S.C. 1897, ch. 203, sec. 168), was made the subject of a separate condition (No. 15) and extended to all written notices to be given by the company when the Ontario Insurance Act was re-enacted, preparatory to the revision of 1914, by 2 Geo. V., ch. 33. The obvious purpose was to have a general provision applicable to all notices in writing to be given by the company to the insured, precisely as condition No. 7\u2014formerly condition No. 23, R.S.O. 1897, ch. 203, sec. 168\u2014provides that all notices in writing to the company may be sent by registered post.\n(2) In the policy the insured is designated as \u201cF. Veltre, Esq.\u201d It is proved that the Savinos resided over their grocery shop (which contained the property insured) described in the policy as \u201cNos. 82-84 on the north side of Claremont St., in the town of Thorold.\u201d This was either the post office address notified to the company within the meaning of condition 15, or it was the known address of the insured. In either case the notice was rightly addressed to \u201c82-84-86 Claremont St., Thorold, Ont.\u201d The addition of the figures 86 to the 82-84 mentioned in the policy is immaterial. Suing as she does in the name of F. Veltre on the policy issued to F. Veltre, Esq., and accepted by her on that name, the plaintiff cannot, in my opinion, successfully maintain that the address of the notice was insufficient.\n(3) For the reasons assigned by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, I am satisfied that the tender provided for by the 11th condition is properly made if the amount of money to be tendered be enclosed with the notice of cancellation in a duly registered envelope, properly addressed to the insured. I cannot place any other reasonable construction on the word \u201cthere with\u201d in the 11th condition, if that condition contemplates, as I think it clearly does, that the notice of cancellation may be in writing, and the 15th condition applies to it. It certainly was not the purpose of the 11th condition, in my opinion, to impose compliance with the formalities of a strict legal tender on the company. \u201cTendering\u201d is used in the sense of \u201coffering presently to refund.\u201d\n(4) In considering from what time the seven days which are to elapse between the notice of cancellation and the determination of the policy are to be com- puted, the nature of the condition and the purpose for which the seven days are allowed must be taken into account. Rights both of the insured and of the insurer are expressed in the eleventh condition. The latter is entitled to terminate its risk. The former is entitled to a reasonable period, fixed by the legislature at seven days, within which to protect himself, if he so desire, by procuring other insurance. The condition must, if at all possible, be so construed that these reciprocal rights shall be given fair and full effect. The insurer, solely for its own benefit, is allowed the option of giving the notice by making use of the post office as its agent to convey it in lieu of making a personal communication of it to the insurer. If it selects the latter, which may be regarded as the normal method, the policy is determined only on the expiry of seven full days from the moment of communication to the assured of the intention to cancel. Can it have been intended that the company by choosing to make use of the alternative method of giving notice through the mail should be entitled in practically every case to lessen the comparatively short period which the legislature meant the insured should have in which to reinsure, and, in some cases, to deprive him of it entirely? That would be the necessary effect of holding that the seven days should be computed from the moment of depositing the notice in the post office. I am satisfied that was not intended. Strong J., in Caldwell v. Stadacona Fire and Life Ins. Co.[8], at p. 238, speaks of a condition as\ngrossly unfair in not providing that notice should be given a reasonable time before the cancellation should take effect, so that the assured might have the opportunity of covering himself by another insurance.\nThe cases cited by Mr. Robertson are all readily and clearly distinguishable. They were cases in which numerous persons, who might be scattered in many places, were to be notified of calls or meetings, etc. It would be impossible in such a case to fix any one definite date at which the term of the notice should expire unless that term should commence from the moment of deposit in the post office. No such difficulty arises in the case of a notice to a single insured.\nOn the other hand, it is said that if the notice was meant to be effective only from the moment of its actual receipt by the insured, it is difficult to appreciate the object of the legislature in imposing the registration of it on the company, and it is therefore argued that the notice must have been intended to be operative at least from the time at which it would have reached the insured in the ordinary course of post. It seems to me to be a more reasonable explanation that the legislature directed that notice, if given by mail, should be by registered post in order to facilitate proof of the fact whether a notice so sent had or had not reached the insured. It would be a strong thing to hold that the insurer could extinguish the contractual rights of the insured under his policy without any prior actual notice being given to him. In the absence of an explicit statement that notice of cancellation should be deemed effectual from the time at which it would in the ordinary course of post have reached the insured, nothing short of an irresistible inference from the terms in which the condition providing for notice by post is couched that that was the purpose and intention of the legislature would suffice to justify a court in holding that the contractual rights could be thus extinguished. Dealing with a substantially identical provision made by what was then the 23rd statutory condition (R.S.O. 1897, ch. 203, sec. 168)\u2014now the 7th\u2014the Ontario Court of Appeal in Skillings v. Royal Ins. Co.[9], affirming a judgment of Lount J[10], unanimously held that a letter from the insured to the insurance company notifying it of his intention to cancel his insurance would take effect only from the time of its actual receipt. Maclennan J.A. says, at p. 403:\u2014\nAn actual delivery of notice is evidently what the statutory condition intends.\nGarrow J.A., citing with approval the unanimous decision of the New York Court of Appeal in Crown Point Iron. Co. v. The \u00c6tna Ins. Co.[11], says, at p. 405:\u2014\nThe notice sent before, but not received until after, the fire was wholly ineffectual.\nIt was argued that the Skillings Case[12], is distinguishable because the notice there sent was wrongly addressed. But the decision turns on the fact that it was not received\u2014not that it did not fulfil the requirement of the condition as to address.\nNotwithstanding section 20 of the Ontario Interpretation Act (R.S.C., ch. 1) it may fairly be assumed that in making the 15th condition a counterpart of the 7th in the Act of 1912, ch. 33, the legislature was not unmindful of the construction which the Court of Appeal had, as recently as 1903, put upon the 7th clause.\nThere is no provision in the Ontario practice for the service of legal process or notice by registered post such as is found in the English O. XLVII., R. 2. It is noteworthy that in that rule, in order to make a notice so sent operative not from its actual receipt but from the time at which it would be delivered in the ordinary course of post, an explicit provision to that effect was apparently deemed necessary. A not unreasonable inference is that without it the service would be effectual only from the time of the actual receipt of the mailed document. A provision in the English Interpretation Act of 1889, ch. 63, sec. 26, creates the like presumption in regard to any document which a statute authorises or requires to be served, given or sent by post\u2014\u201cunless the contrary is proved.\u201d Here the contrary has been proved.\nIt would, no doubt, have been much more satisfactory had the statute explicitly declared from what time the seven days should be computed in the case of notices by registered post but, in the absence of some such provision as is found in the English rule cited, the terms of condition 15, in my opinion, do not warrant a holding that by resorting to it an insurance company can deprive an insured of the benefit of the whole or any part of the seven days\u2019 notice upon giving which condition 11 enables the company to terminate its risk. Notice, unless the contrary be clearly provided, must mean actual notice.\n(5) Although in view of the conclusion that the 4th objection to the notice of cancellation must prevail it may be unnecessary to deal with the 5th, it is perhaps better that I should express the opinion I have formed upon it. Since a power of cancellation must, no doubt, be strictly exercised, I was at first much impressed with the view that because the company\u2019s letter expressed its intention to terminate the risk on the 22nd of December its notice could not be good for any subsequent date. But on further consideration I incline to think otherwise. Emmott v. Slater Mutual Fire Ins. Co.[13], was a very similar case. A notice of intention to cancel on the 20th of February, mailed on the 13th was received by the insured on the 14th. The property covered was destroyed on the 22nd. Ames C.J., delivering the judgment of the Superior Court of Rhode Island, upholding the cancellation as effectual, said, at p. 565:\u2014\nThe notice received by the plaintiff on the 14th day of February, informed him, in substance, that from and after the 20th of that month, \u201cno member of his class would be held insured,\u201d as the policy would be cancelled at noon on that day, under the power reserved by the by-law, and in pursuance of the vote of the company. The purpose of the by-law, in requiring seven days\u2019 notice of the intent to cancel his policy, to be given to a member before the cancellation would become effectual, was, to give him seasonable warning, if he would be protected by insurance, to get it elsewhere. This purpose seems to us to have been as fully answered by the notice given to the plaintiff, as if the 21st day of February, instead of the 20th, had been inserted in the notice as the day from and after which his policy would stand cancelled. By warning him to procure other insurance earlier than the by-law, considering the time he received the notice, permitted, it could not mislead him to his injury; and when the seven days had expired after his receipt of the notice, he had all the notice which the by-law either in its letter or spirit, required; that is, seven days\u2019 notice of the intent of the company to cancel his policy on a day subsequent to the giving of the notice.\nAs the loss happened after the plaintiff had received the seven days\u2019 notice of the intent to cancel his policy, we hold that his policy was then cancelled, and order judgment to be entered up for the defendants, with costs.\nI find in Philadelphia Linen Co. v. Manhattan Fire Fire Ins. Co.[14], cited in 19 Cyc. at p. 646, an authority to the same effect. I have unfortunately been unable to see the report itself. The notice of intention to cancel need not specify any date as that on which the risk is to come to an end. When it is given the statutory condition applies and effects the cancellation on the expiry of seven days. The statement of the date on which the notice is to become effective is therefore superfluous. The insured knows, or must be presumed to know, that he is entitled to seven days from the time at which he receives the notice. I therefore incline to the opinion that if the plaintiff had actually received the notice of cancellation seven days before the fire occurred she could not have recovered on the policy, which would have ceased to be in force, not upon the 22nd of December, but at the expiry of seven days after actual receipt of the notice.\nIn the result the appeal fails and should be dismissed.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The question is whether the insurance was terminated when the fire took place on the 25th of December, 1916.\nThe insurance was for a year from June, 1916, to June, 1917. Section eleven of the statutory conditions gave power to the company to terminate it sooner\nby giving seven days\u2019 notice to that effect and if on the cash plan by tendering therewith a ratable proportion of the premium paid for the unexpired term.\nThe statutory condition No. 15 provided that any written notice could be given by a registered letter addressed to the assured\nat his last post office address notified to the company or where no address is notified and the address is not known addressed to him at the post office of the agency, if any, from which the application was received.\nIn this case the notice cancelling the policy was sent on the 15th of December, 1916, by registered letter to F. Veltre, Esq., 82-84-86 Claremont St., Thorold, Ont., and there was enclosed therein the sum of $11.34, representing the unearned premium for the balance of the current term of the policy.\nThe letter was not delivered to the insured and remained in the post office at Thorold until after the fire which took place on the 25th of December.\nThe insured never had any intimation before the fire that the policy was cancelled or to be cancelled. Everything points to the good faith of the insured. The insurance had been taken through the agency of the company at Merritton, a suburb of the town of Thorold. The insured was an Italian lady married to a man named Savino. The application for the insurance was taken by the agent of the company on a stock of groceries and on fixtures situated in a store bearing Nos. 82-84-86 Claremont St., in Thorold. By the mistake of the company or of the agents, the policy was issued in the maiden name of Mrs. Savino, \u201cF. Veltre.\u201d It is customary amongst Italians that the married women preserve and are called by their maiden names.\nThe company added, however, on the policy to the name of F. Veltre, \u201cEsq.\u201d\nMr. Savino had a box in the post office at Thorold and he was well known there. But the name of F. Veltre Esq. was entirely unknown to the postmaster or the employees of the post office; and it does not appear by the evidence that the address of F. Veltre was known to be in Thorold. \u201cF. Veltre, Esq.\u201d was certainly unknown in Thorold. The address of the respondent was never notified to the company. So the company, not knowing the address of the respondent and not having been notified of her address, its duty was, according to the statutory condition 15, to send the notice to its agency in Merritton.\nBesides, I am of opinion that the tender of money should have been made personally to the insured or at least at her domicile or place of residence and that on that ground the alleged tender made in this case is not valid.\nThe statutory condition never contemplated that an insurance company could be at liberty to deposit legal tender money in the post office and that from that moment the notice of cancellation would have its effect. Sir Edward Coke (Co. Litt., p. 210,) says that tender must formally be made only to the creditor himself.\nIt is contended by the appellant that the use of the word \u201ctherewith\u201d in statutory condition eleven entitled the company to enclose the money with the notice and that a personal tender is not required.\nI am unable to agree with that contention. The right which the company possesses to cancel a valid contract is contrary to the ordinary rules affecting contractual relations. If the legislature intended to avoid the necessity of a tender being made personally they would then have so provided in the clearest of language. I am unable to find such an intention in construing the conditions referred to. The company had no right to depart from the ordinary rule that the tender should be made to the creditor personally. (Harris, Law of Tender, p. 97.)\nFor those reasons the judgment a quo which maintained plaintiff\u2019s action should be maintained and the appeal dismissed with costs.\nCASSELS J.\u2014As the majority of the court are in favour of dismissing this appeal, I concur.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Fasken, Robertson, Chadwick & Sedgewick.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Ingersoll, Kingstone, & Hetherington.\n[1] 40 Ont.

Held, Davies and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that a caveat filed by a married woman under the \"Married Woman's Home Protection Act,\" ch. 4, Alberta statutes 1915, must be supported by an affidavit of bona fides as required by the provisions of sec. 85 of the \"Land Titles Act.\"\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta reversing the judgment of Hyndman J. in chambers[1], in favour of the defendant.\nThe material facts of the case and the circumstances on which the issues depend will be found in the judgments now reported. R. B. Bennett K.C. for the appellant.\nJ. D. Matheson for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014Some time prior to the 12th August, 1916, the appellant commenced an action against her husband for alimony and on this date filed a caveat under the \"Married Woman's Home Protection Act,\" c. 4, statutes of 1915, against his land.\nThe claim for alimony was refused by the trial judge on the ground that the appellant had sufficient means of her own. On the 27th day of April, 1917, the respondent executed a transfer of his land to one D. Gillen. The \"Dower Act,\" c. 14 of the 1917 statutes, came into force on the 1st of May, 1917, and by that Act the \"Married Woman's Home Protection Act\" was repealed. On the 1st June, 1917, the respondent gave notice of motion for an order to remove the caveat and in October, 1917, judgment was rendered refusing the application.\nThe judge of first instance held that under the \"Interpretation Act,\" section 48, saving acts done and rights existing,\nthe wife is entitled to maintain her caveat, notwithstanding the repealing statute, until the same is removed in the manner provided by the Act creating the right and in the \"Land Titles Act.\"\nThe judge does not deal otherwise with the application to remove the caveat.\nFour judges of the Appellate Division, without giving any reasons, reversed that judgment and ordered the caveat removed.\nIt was argued here that because Mr. Justice Walsh held in the alimony action that the wife was provided for to the extent that an award of alimony was unnecessary she was not entitled to her caveat.\nThe judgment of Mr. Justice Walsh is not in this record and there is no evidence that the appellant has a private estate.\nIt is also urged that the caveat should be removed because it is not supported by affidavit as required by the provisions of section 85 of the \"Land Titles Act,\" and in that contention I concur.\nThe \"Married Woman's Home Protection Act\" was passed subsequently to the \"Land Titles Act,\" but section 8 of the former Act provides:\nThis Act shall be read with and as part of the \"Land Titles Act.\"\nIf the \"Land Titles Act\" is read with the provisions of the \"Married Woman's Home Protection Act\" inserted in the proper place, having regard to those provisions, we have a statute which enables any married woman to file with the registrar an instrument to be known as a married woman's caveat and which is described in all the sections dealing with the matter as a caveat and for which a special form is provided.\nThen we have section 85 which reads as follows\nEvery caveat filed with the registrar shall state the name and addition of the person by whom and on whose behalf the same is filed and except in the case of a caveat filed by the registrar as hereinafter provided shall be signed by the caveator, his attorney or agent, and shall state some address or place within the province at which notices and proceedings relating to such caveat or the subject matter thereof may be served and the nature of the interest claimed and the grounds upon which such claim is founded, and shall be supported by an affidavit that in the belief of the deponent the person by whom or on whose behalf the caveat is filed has a good valid claim in respect of the land, mortgage or encumbrance intended to be affected by the same, and that the caveat is not filed for the purpose of delaying or embarrassing the applicant, or owner, or any person claiming through him, which affidavit or affidavits may be in the form X in the schedule to this Act.\nThis section provides that all caveats with the single exception of a caveat filed by the registrar under section 100 must be supported by an affidavit as to good faith, etc. Independently of the very broad terms of section 85, there are very obvious reasons why such an affidavit should be required in the case of a caveat filed by a married woman.\nIt is quite conceivable that an unscrupulous adventuress alleging herself to be the wife of a homesteader or even a lawfully married woman moved by some unworthy motive should improperly and without justification seek to embarrass a man in dealing with his property. I can see no difficulty in framing an affidavit in accordance with the general provisions of form X to meet the requirements of section 85 with respect to the married woman's caveat.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDAVIES J. (dissenting):\u2014The single question to be determined on this appeal is whether a caveat filed and registered by the appellant, the wife of the respondent, against the sale of their homestead, was a valid caveat without the affidavit required for an ordinary caveat by the \"Land Titles Act.\"\nThe trial judge held it was a good caveat. His judgment was reversed by the Appeal Court which ordered that the caveat should be removed from the register and vacated. No reasons were given for their judgment.\nI am of the opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nThe reasons for the appeal court judgment must, of course, have been that as the \"Land Titles Act\" required all caveats to be supported by an affidavit of the caveator in the form given in the schedule to that Act, and as the \"Married Woman's Home Protection Act,\" which was passed subsequently to the \"Land Titles Act,\" provided that \"it should be read with and form part of the 'Land Titles Act,' \"it was not a valid caveat unless supported by the affidavit. That affidavit required the caveator to swear amongst other things \"that this caveat is not being fyled for the purpose of delaying or embarrassing any person interested in or proposing to deal therewith,\" that is in or with the lands to protect the estate or interest in which the caveator fyled his caveat.\nThe answer which seems to me to be a good one to this argument is the one advanced by Mr. Bennett at bar, viz., that the \"Married Woman's Home Protection Act,\" which came into force 17th of April, 1915, was a special Act passed with a special purpose, viz., to protect a married woman thereafter from being deprived of all her interest in the homestead property which she in many cases did as much to make valuable as her husband did. The caveat required covered the homestead property only and did not affect other lands of the husband. A special form was set out in a schedule to the Act which was strictly followed in this case. It was called a married woman's caveat and had no form of affidavit attached to it nor did the Act itself in any way refer to or suggest that any affidavit was required.\nThere are many differences in the object and purpose of the ordinary caveats, and those of the married woman's caveat. The object of the former is to protect some right or interest of the caveator in certain lands and the caveator is properly obliged to swear that he does not fyle the caveat for the purpose of delaying or embarrassing any person interested in the land or proposing to deal therewith. The main object of the married woman's caveat was to protect her rights in the homestead and in order to do so to delay her husband so that he could not sell the homestead over her head and deprive her of her rights. That being her object and purpose, how could she conscientiously make affidavit that it was not? Reading the two Acts together, it does seem to me an unfair construction to put the married woman in such a position or dilemma that she must swear falsely or lose her rights in her homestead? A reasonable construction should be placed upon both of the statutes in question when read together so that effect may be given to the intention of the legislature.\nSuch construction is not consistent with requiring an affidavit to be made which could not have been intended to apply to the \"Married Woman's Home Protection Act,\" because an honest, truthful woman could not swear that her caveat was not intended to hinder or delay her husband in dealing with the homestead by sale or otherwise. It was so intended. It was the manifest intention of the \"Married Woman's Home Protection Act\" to delay and embarrass the husband so that he should not convey away or mortgage the homestead and deprive her of her rights. To say you must either swear to that which is false or your caveat will be vacated is to put an unreasonable and improper construction upon the two Acts which are to be read together.\nI am therefore of the opinion that in following strictly the form given in the \"Married Woman's Home Protection Act\" and in omitting the affidavit required in the cases of ordinary caveats by the \"Land Titles Act,\" which she could not honestly or conscientiously take, the appellant was within her rights and her caveat was good.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The Alberta Legislature passed an Act called the \"Married Woman's Home Protection Act\" which by section one enacted as follows:\u2014 Any married woman may cause to be filed on her behalf with the registrar an instrument to be known as a married woman's caveat in form WW in the schedule to this Act against the registration of any transfer, mortgage, encumbrance, lease or other instrument made by or on behalf of her husband affecting a homestead as defined in sec. 2 of this Act.\nThe last section of the Act reads as follows:\u2014\nThis Act shall be read with and as part of the \"Land Titles Act.\"\nThis seems clearly to have intended the Act to constitute part of the \"Land Titles Act\" just as much as if under a distinct caption it had been placed therein originally, otherwise there was no sense in such a provision.\nThe \"Land Titles Act\" by section 85 enacts as follows:\u2014\nEvery caveat filed with the registrar shall state the name and addition of the person by whom or on whose behalf the same is filed and except in the case of a caveat filed by the registrar as hereinafter provided shall be signed by the caveator, his attorney or agent, and shall state some address or place within the province at which notices and proceedings relating to such caveat or the subject matter thereof may be served and the nature of the interest claimed and the grounds upon which such claim is founded, and shall be supported by an affidavit that in the belief of the deponent the person by whom or on whose behalf the caveat is filed has a good valid claim in respect of the land, mortgage or encumbrance intended to be affected by the same, and that the caveat is not filed for the purpose of delaying or embarrassing the applicant, or owner, or any person claiming through him, which affidavit or declaration may be in the form X in the schedule to this Act.\nThe form of affidavit by the second clause is as follows:\u2014\nI believe that I have (or the said caveator has) a good and valid claim upon the said land (mortgage or encumbrance), and I say that this caveat is not being filed for the purpose of delaying or embarrassing any person interested in or proposing to deal therewith.\nSworn before me, etc.\nThe \"Land Titles Act,\" by section 100 thereof, specifically exempts certain caveators from making an affidavit, thereby emphasizing the necessity for an affidavit in all other cases where the Act provides for the use of a caveat. The appellant filed a document (in the form of the caveat which she was enabled to use under the Act), with the registrar, relative to certain lands of respondent her husband, without any affidavit or proof of who she was, or in any manner pretending to verify the facts as required by the above section 85 of the \"Land Titles Act.\"\nThis was done pending an alimony suit which she had instituted against respondent and which ended in the learned trial judge finding she was so circumstanced as not to need any alimony.\nThen respondent moved to set the registration aside. Mr. Justice Hyndman refused the application, on the ground that no affidavit was necessary. The Court of Appeal reversed that judgment and directed the removal of the caveat.\nWe have no notes of why the court so directed, but the counsel arguing here seem to admit it was because of non-compliance with the \"Land Titles Act\" in failing to file the affidavit I have referred to and that is the point most elaborately dealt with in respondent's factum.\nI agree with that view and hence think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nI see no difficulty in any honest married woman complying with the Act if in truth she needs to resort to that means for her protection.\nIf she does not then she is quite clearly not one of those the legislature desired to protect and hence should not attempt its use. I can conceive of no reason why she should if entitled to file the caveat refrain from making the affidavit. Moreover, I can conceive of many reasons why she should be required to make the affidavit, and cannot understand the argument addressed to us for distinguishing in that regard this caveat from others when the Act has not made any exception in its favour and if so minded could so easily have applied the excepting part of the Act thereto.\nTo pretend that the legislature when enacting this statute and declaring it part of an Act which in most imperative terms required by said section 85 every caveat filed with the registrar saving the specified exception to have an affidavit of verification and negation of improper motive did not mean it to apply to a married woman's caveat seems like a mockery of the legislature so enacting.\nThe kind of argument that is presented for supporting the appeal I respectfully submit seems to be that which the rules in Heydon's Case [2] suggested it should be the office of the judges to repel, by requiring them to suppress the mischief and advance the remedy, and to\nsuppress subtle inventions and evasions for the continuance of the mischief and pro privato commodo, and to add force and life to the cure and remedy according to the true intent of the makers of the Act pro bono publico.2\nIt seems to me obvious that this class of caveat, such as enabled, more than any other needs the restraint of an affidavit such as the statute requires in all but the specifically excepted cases and hence it must have been intended that it should be made. The reason for making the claim, in short, the foundation for it, which the statute required set forth in any affidavit, is needed so that the court on whom the burden is cast may have had defined that which is to be tried.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Notwithstanding the able and forceful argument presented by Mr. Bennett on behalf of the appellant, further consideration of the \"Married Woman's Home Protection Act\" with the \"Land Titles Act\"\u2014with and as part of which the former Act is by its 8th section required to be read\u2014has convinced me that the legislature intended that the requirement of section 85 of the \"Land Titles Act\" as to an affidavit of bona fides should apply to a married woman's caveat.\nNo good reason has been advanced for depriving the owner of property upon which it is sought to register such a caveat of the protection against fraudulent and purely vexatious claims which an affidavit of bona fides by the caveator may afford. She should at least be required to pledge her oath that she is the wife of such owner and that the property was occupied by her as a homestead. These facts are implied in the first clause of paragraph 2 of the prescribed affidavit:\u2014\nI believe that I have a good and valid claim upon the said land.\nNor does the further clause\u2014\nthat this caveat is not being filed for the purpose of delaying or embarrassing any person interested in or proposing to deal therewith,\ni.e., with such land,\u2014present the difficulty which at first blush seemed most serious. Embarrassment and delay to the owner and to any other person proposing to deal with the land are no doubt consequences likely to ensue as a result of the lodging of a married woman's caveat, just as they are likely to ensue as a result of the filing of any other caveat. But the primary \"purpose\" of the married woman must be the same as that of any other caveator\u2014to protect the \"good and valid claim\" which she believes she has upon the land. To the existence of that purpose she may well be obliged to pledge her oath. I am satisfied that a judge required to construe an affidavit made in the prescribed form upon a charge of perjury should direct a jury, or himself, that the affiant could not be con- victed unless it was established beyond reasonable doubt either that she did not honestly believe that the claim in respect of which she lodged her caveat was good and valid, or that her purpose in fyling it was not to protect such a claim but solely to delay or embarrass some person interested in or proposing to deal with the land. The requirement of an affidavit imposed by section 85 is, in my opinion, mandatory and not merely directory and a caveat lodged without such affidavit, although accepted by the registrar, is fatally defective. Solely upon this ground I would dismiss the appeal.\nBRODEUR J. (dissenting):\u2014We have to decide in this case if a woman who has executed a caveat under the \"Married Woman's Home Protection Act\" of Alberta is obliged to fyle the affidavit required by section 85 of the \"Land Titles Act\" of the same province.\nThere was also a question of jurisdiction which was raised before us as to the right of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta; but it was not strongly pressed. Besides, it appears that the appellant, who was respondent in the Appellate Division, had not thought fit when they were before that court to discuss that question of jurisdiction; and it seems to me now too late, when the parties are before this court, to say that the court below was without, authority to deal with the case. The jurisdiction of the Appellate Division was then accepted by both parties and the appellant should not be permitted now to set it aside.\nComing to the question of registration of the caveat, it is advisable to state that the Torrens System established in Alberta by the \"Land Titles Act\" provided that a person claiming an interest under a will, a transfer or a mortgage in any land may fyle a caveat forbidding the registration of any instrument affecting that land, unless that instrument be subject to the claim of the caveator (section 84).\nIt was also provided that the caveator was bound to fyle an affidavit shewing, 1st, that he has a valid claim and, 2nd, that the caveat is not fyled for the purpose of delaying or embarrassing any person interested in the land in question.\nIn 1915 the Legislature of Alberta passed the \"Married Woman's Home Protection Act\" which gave to a married woman the right to fyle with the registrar a caveat forbidding the registration of any sale by her husband of her homestead.\nThat Act gave also the power to the husband to apply to a judge for the removal of that caveat; and section 8 provides that \"This Act shall be read with and as part of the 'Land Titles Act.' \"\nThe appellant, Mrs. Russell, fyled such a caveat under the \"Married Woman's Home Protection Act\" and the respondent, her husband, has applied to a judge for the removal of the caveat. His application was dismissed but in appeal he obtained judgment in his favour.\nMrs. Russell is now appealing from that judgment and contends that the Appellate Division has erroneously held that her caveat should be removed because she has not fyled the affidavit-required by section 85 of the \"Land Titles Act.\"\nI am, with due deference, unable to agree with the view expressed by the Appellate Division. The \"Married Woman's Protection Act\" is an enactment which is to be considered by itself. It is true that it is to be read, as section 8 declares, with and as part of the \"Land Titles Act;\" but in all cases where the provisions of the \"Land Titles Act\" are inconsistent with the \"Married Woman's Home Protection Act,\" or where there is a formal provision in the latter Act, then the provisions of the \"Married Woman's Home Protection Act\", should prevail.\nThe instrument which the married woman is entitled to register should not be, if it had not been so determined by the Act, called a caveat The ordinary caveat is a claim made by a person that he has some interest in certain lands; it is essentially of a temporary nature according to section 89 and is deemed to have lapsed after the expiration of sixty days, unless some proceedings have been instituted in the meantime.\nThe ordinary caveat also would not prevent the property encumbered to be sold; it could be sold subject to that incumbrance. The ordinary caveat also being based upon a statement of a person that he has a claim upon the property by way of an agreement of sale or mortgage, it is only reasonable that it should be accompanied by a sworn statement.\nNone of those requirements of the ordinary caveat present themselves in the right which the wife may exercise under the \"Married Woman's Home Protection Act.\"\nFirst, the statute declares that the wife may register an instrument which will be called a married woman's caveat. It is not then, as we see, the ordinary caveat; but it is a particular instrument which the law calls a caveat.\nThe law also declares (section 3) that \"upon the receipt of such married woman's caveat the registrar shall take the same proceedings as in the case of the filing of any other caveat under this Act.\"\nThe law does not say that upon the receipt of that instrument and of an affidavit the registrar will do this and will do that; but it simply says that upon the receipt of the instrument in question the registrar will give notice. The law does not require there any affidavit and section 4 says that so long as such caveat remains in force the registrar shall not register any transfer or other document affecting the homestead in question.\nThat is very different from the ordinary caveat, which requires such affidavit. A sale could take place but subject to the right of the person claiming a right upon the property.\nThis right of the woman is not an uncertain right like the one of the person who would claim under an agreement of sale or a mortgage. It is an absolute right which is given to the woman and I could understand that, in such a case, an affidavit would not be required. The affidavit required by section 85 is for the object of swearing that the caveator has a good and valid claim. Here, in the case of the wife, it is not a claim that she asserts; it is her right which the legislature has granted. It seems to me that the affidavit is not required in the case of the married woman's caveat.\nFor these reasons, the appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 12 Alta.

The King, (1918) 57 S.C.R. 118\nDate: 1918-06-25\nRichard Robert Shorten Appellant;\nand\nHis Majesty The King Respondent.\n1918: June 25.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, C.J. and Davies, Idington, Anglin and Brodeur J.J.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF SASKATCHEWAN.\nCriminal law\u2014Indecent assault\u2014Evidence\u2014Complaint elicited by questions\u2014Admissibility\u2014Corroboration\u2014Criminal Code, s. 1003.\nThe appellant was indicted for an indecent assault on a girl of seven years of age. At the trial evidence was admitted of the answers given by the girl to questions put by her mother immediately on her return home after the assault, the mother promising not to spank her if she told the whole truth.\nHeld, that the evidence was properly admitted as corroborating the credibility of the girl (who told what had happened without being sworn), as required by section 1003 of the Criminal Code.\nHeld, also, that the mother's promise not to punish the child did not make what she said her \"assisted story.\"\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan, rendered on a case reserved for the opinion of the court by the trial judge.\nThe appellant was charged with carnally knowing Olive King, a girl of seven years of age. The evidence shewed that he met her and another girl of five years of age on the street and brought them into an empty house where the offence is alleged to have taken place. Both little girls made statements in court but did not give evidence under oath.\nThe mother of the girl gave evidence as to the answers given by her daughter when she was asked to explain the reasons of her prolonged absence; and the mother admitted having promised not to spank her if she would tell the whole truth. The questions for decision were whether the evidence of the girl was \"corroborated by some material evidence in support thereof implicating the accused,\" as required by section 1003 of the Criminal Code, and whether the statements made by her to her mother were \"spontaneous.\"\nC. J. Bethune for the appellant cited The King v. McGivney[1].\nHarold Fisher for the respondent referred to Rex v. Gray[2]; The King v. Daun[3]; Rex v. Scheller[4]; and The King v. Burr[5].\nThe Chief Justice:\u2014I am of opinion that the statement of the child made to her mother immediately on her return home after the assault was properly admitted. It is true that the mother, irritated and alarmed at the prolonged absence of her daughter, was obliged to persuade her to explain the reason of that absence; but nothing that was said can be construed as questions of an inducing or intimidating character. The child understood that she was expected to explain the cause of her absence and nothing more.\nThere is also corroboration in other particulars, as pointed out by my brother Idington, and I have no doubt of the sufficiency of the proof of identification.\nDavies J.:\u2014The only doubt I entertained in this case of the admission in evidence of the young girl Olive King's statement to her mother as to what the prisoner had said and done to her arose, not from the fact that some natural and reasonable questions were put to the child by her mother which elicited the statement in question, but the fact that before making it the mother had promised not to spank her if she told the whole truth. I rather doubted whether this promise was not an inducement to make the statement, depriving it of being spontaneous.\nAfter reading the evidence of the mother and the two late decisions of the Criminal Court of Appeal, Rex v. Osborne[6], and Rex v. Norcott[7], I am satisfied the evidence was under all the circumstances properly received. I am also satisfied that there was sufficient corroboration of the evidence of the child Olive King to convict the appellant.\nThe appeal should be dismissed;\nIdington J.:\u2014As the majority of the Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, the only question within our jurisdiction and therefore which we can consider is what the learned dissentient judge may have expressed as his ground of dissent.\nThat if I understand him aright was that there was no evidence of corroboration which, I take it, means of the story of the little girl who says she was assaulted, including, of course, the identification of the appellant as the party implicated.\nI think there was sufficient evidence, apart from that of the other little girl, of corroboration to satisfy the statute.\nIt consists of many little circumstances which I think it needless to dwell upon.\nThe identification of the appellant is the weakest part of the case and yet so ample that it could not have been properly withdrawn from a jury had there been one in the case.\nI think as part thereof that the mother's entire story was properly admitted and considered. I cannot agree with some of the expressions of the learned judge who gave the judgment of the court in the case of Rex v. Dunning[8]. The question of the weight to be given the evidence of those whom the law in a variety of cases requires to be corroborated varies so much that I should hesitate to attempt to define the limits thereof or what question may be put by a mother to her child. The case of Rex v. Osborne[9], illustrates the problem of admissibility but only governs so far as that case decided. Each case stands on its own bottom.\nJudges must as well as Crown officers ever be on the alert in cases of this kind to see that there is no ground for suspecting the good faith of mothers or others in putting forward the charge. The possibility of inciting the child or other persons to make such a charge as herein must ever be jealously guarded against.\nOnce assured of that good faith I should be sorry to test the admissibility of the evidence by any requirements upon the expressions a mother may have used in order to elicit the truth.\nOf course the possibility of the child being innocently as it were misled into an assent to the mother's suggestive questions must be guarded against.\nThat again may come back to the question of weight to be given the evidence rather than its admissibility.\nI do not think such cases as this must necessarily be governed for example by the rule against accepting admissions of a prisoner when induced by some one in authority.\nThe appellant's identification as the man seen with the children seems complete and is corroboration which cannot be rejected. I should have preferred to have had related so far as admissible facts and circumstances the facts which led the police officer to arrest the accused.\nThe same line of thought which guided him if founded on circumstantial evidence might have aided the court in coming to the right conclusion as to the implicating of the accused.\nIt may, as experience teaches me, have been mere instinct, as it were, that guided the police officer or that he was told to get the man seen with the girls on the occasion in question.\nIn either such case his evidence could not furnish further facts.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed.\nAnglin J.:\u2014I think there was evidence in corroboration of the evidence given by the child. Two witnesses identified the accused as a man who had been seen with the child not very long before the offence was committed. (Rex v. Murray[10]). He had no business whatever to be with her. When confronted with the child, he said:\n\"You never saw me before\u2014you don't know me.\" This conduct aids in his identification.\nThe evidence of the child's statement to her mother was, in my opinion, admissible. It was made shortly after the occurrence. It was \"spontaneous\" in the sense indicated by Lord Reading C.J. in Rex v. Norcott[11]. Nothing more than mild persuasion led to its being made; there is nothing to indicate that it was \"put into her mouth by some one else\" or was not \"her own unvarnished and unassisted story,\" The evidence was not inadmissible by reason of the fact that \"questions were put to the girl to get her to tell her own story.\" Nor does the fact that \"the circumstances indicate that but for the questioning there would probably have been no voluntary complaint\" justify the exclusion of the evidence as was suggested in Rex v. Osborne[12].\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nBrodeur J.:\u2014I concur with my brother Anglin.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] 22 Can. Cr. Cas. 222; 15 D.L.R. 550.\n[2] 68 J.P. 327.\n[3] 11 Can. Cr.

Scott, having met with an accident in doing so, recovered damages from respondent, who then took action against appellant for indemnification under the above clause.\nHeld, that Scott, at the time he was injured, was performing labour embraced in the agreement.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], maintaining, upon an equal division of the court, the judgment of Murphy J. at the trial[2], by which the plaintiff's action was maintained with costs.\nThe circumstances of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head\u2014note and in the judgments now reported. Geo. F. Henderson, K.C. for the appellant.\nWallace Nesbitt K.C. and C. C. Robinson for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The case really depends upon the interpretation of clause 5 of the agreement between the parties which reads:\u2014\n5. That the S.S. Co. shall hold the Stevedoring Company entirely harmless from any and all liability for personal injury to any of the Stevedoring Company's employees while performing labour embraced in this agreement.\nIt has been held and I think rightly that an employee of the respondents was injured while performing labour embraced in the agreement. If the workman's employment compels him to be at a particular place when the accident happens, the accident must be taken to arise out of the employment, although it is not being contributed to in any way by the nature of the employment. It is not, I think, disputed that the accident was due to the respondents' negligence.\nThe trial judge held that clause 5 above quoted was intended and the language used was sufficiently wide to cover the respondents' own negligence.\nIn the appeal court, where there was an equal division of opinion, Chief Justice Macdonald thought that the contract should be construed only to relieve the respondent of the burden of making compensation to employees under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act,\" which compensation is payable irrespective of the employee's negligence. He relied in support of this view on the case of Price & Co. v. Union Lighterage Co.[3], but with all respect I think he has failed to appreciate the principle on which that decision is based. Mr. Justice Walton, the trial judge whose judgment was approved by the Court of Appeal, says:\u2014 There is a well-established rule of construction applicable to the present case. The law of England, unlike in this respect the law of the U.S. of America, does not forbid the carrier to exempt himself by contract from liability for the negligence of himself and his servants; but, if the carrier desires so to exempt himself, it requires that he shall do so in express, plain, and unambiguous terms.\nAnd this is no arbitrary distinction of the case of carriers but depends on the fact that a carrier is liable not only for the due conveyance of goods as he is of passengers but is also liable as an insurer of the goods. It is fallacious to say that the greater liability of carriers than of other classes of contractors is \"merely a question of degree.\" Under his contract the carrier has a duty of conveyance for the neglect of which he is liable, but as an insurer he is liable irrespective of any negligence on his part and this is a liability of a different kind. The rule of construction established in the case of the contracts of carriers is that the exemption clause refers to conveyance in contradistinction to insurance\u2014that it limits the liability not the duty.\nBut in truth these cases have nothing to do with the present one, for in all contracts, even including those of carriers, it is a question of what was the intention of the parties. Now, I think nothing can be clearer than the intention of the parties to express in clause 5 of the agreement under consideration that the respondents should be relieved of all liability, however occurring, to any of their employees. Mr. Justice McPhillips says that to construe the provision in accordance with the submission of the appellant would be to render it wholly illusory; it certainly would restrict its operation within very narrow bounds, for it cannot consistently be held to apply even to all cases under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act,\" since damages may of course be recovered under this Act where the employer has been guilty of negligence as well as when he has not. The wording of this clause of the contract is as wide as possible and there is no reason for attributing to the parties any intention of restricting its natural meaning. I do not think, therefore, the rule of construction adopted for a totally different class of contracts and for reasons which have no application here can be invoked to restrict such natural meaning.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant having contracted with respondent for services to be performed by its men, amongst other things, agreed as follows:\u2014\nThat the Steamship Company shall hold the Stevedoring Company entirely harmless from any and all liability for personal injury to any of the Stevedoring Company's employees while performing labour embraced in this agreement.\nThe appellant having failed in its supply of what it had contracted for, one of the men was sent to get it from the respondent's warehouse. He met with an accident in doing so for which he had recourse against the respondent and rightfully recovered damages. The appellant claims this liability for a personal injury did not fall within the meaning of what the contracting parties had in contemplation in the clause I have quoted.\nI cannot so fritter away the very obvious purpose of such a contract of indemnity. It does not appear to me that the appellant can be heard to say that its own default in making the service more onerous than it might have turned out can thus escape responsibility.\nThe very obvious purpose of such a contract as in question was to free the respondent from that incidental loss that every employer of labour may incur, and in all probability must incur, by reason of negligence, from time to time in the course of executing what he has undertaken.\nThe cases relied upon do not seem to me to touch the question.\nIf the accident had arisen from something wilful on the part of respondent then one could hardly say that it had fallen within the scope of what in reason was within the contemplation of those making such a contract.\nNor can I see how the contract, under which the parties had been operating beyond the period originally named can be said, as argued for appellant, to have terminated when they by mutual consent, to be implied from their conduct, had extended its operation. All the terms of any such like time contracts are in law, when so extended, presumed, so far as applicable, to govern those so acting thereunder.\nI suspect if the appellant had been sued for an increased rate of wages it would have been able to see the point and understand the law in the sense I refer to.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014It is common ground that one Scott, an employee of the plaintiffs, recovered judgment against them in respect of a personal injury sustained on the 31st of July, 1915, which was caused by negligence imputable to them either at common law or under the \"Employers' Liability Act.\" Rightly or wrongly the defendants have admitted that the finding of such liability is binding upon them. The plaintiffs, on the other hand, do not suggest that their liability to Scott could have been based on anything other than fault or negligence.\nThe chief defences to their claim to indemnity made in this action are that Scott at the time he was injured was not \"performing labour embraced in (the) agreement\" for stevedoring made between the plaintiffs and the defendants, and that injuries ascribable to the plaintiffs' negligence are not within the provisions for their indemnification, which reads as follows:\u2014\nThat the Steamship Company shall hold the Stevedoring Company entirely harmless from any and all liability for personal injury to any of the Stevedoring Company's employees while performing labour embraced in this agreement.\nIt was also alleged that the stevedoring agreement had been terminated before Scott was injured.\nIt recites that\nThe Stevedoring Company is desirous of undertaking the stevedoring business of the Steamship Company at Vancouver, B.C., and Victoria, B.C., and the Steamship Company is willing to accord this privilege upon terms and conditions and at prices hereinbefore set forth,\nand it provides that it shall\nremain in force for a period of one year from the date hereof (20th Nov., 1911) and if not then terminated, to remain in force thereafter until either party should give three months' notice in writing terminating the same.\nPrim\u00e2 facie this agreement would continue in force unless some step were taken to bring it to an end at the close of the first year. Action by one of the parties was required to terminate it on the 20th Nov., 1912. No evidence of any such action or of any subsequent notice to bring it to an end on the expiry of three months was given. The burden of proving termination was, in my opinion, on the party alleging it. The agreement must therefore be deemed to have been in force when Scott was injured.\nFor the reasons assigned by the learned trial judge I am also satisfied that the work Scott was engaged on when injured was \"labour embraced in (the) agreement.\" He was carrying out a lawful direction to bring from their place of housing or storage some wheelbarrows belonging to the plaintiffs which were required for unloading coal\u2014part of the stevedoring work undertaken by the plaintiffs. The arrangement that the defendants were to supply all necessary gear did not necessarily make it part of their obligation to bring such gear to the ship's side. They appear to have arranged to \"borrow\" these wheelbarrows from the plaintiffs. Obtaining them from the place where they were ordinarily kept in order to use them in unloading would seem to have been part of the stevedoring work for which the defendants undertook to supply labour and therefore to have been \"labour embraced in (the) agreement.\"\nUnless the plaintiffs were \"undertakers\" within the meaning of that term as defined by section 2 of the \"Workmen's Compensation Act,\" R.S.B.C., 1911, ch. 244, they would not be liable under that Act for personal injuries sustained by their employees. Section 4 restricts its application to employment by \"undertakers\" as defined in the Act.\n\"Undertaker\" (as defined) in the ease of a railway means the railway company; in the case of a factory, quarry, laundry, smelter or workhouse, means the occupier or operator thereof, in the case of a mine, means the owner thereof; and in the case of an engineering work or other work specified within this Act means the person undertaking the construction, alteration, repair or demolition.\nI agree with Mr. Nesbitt's contention that a person or company engaged in the work of stevedoring is not an undertaker within this definition.\nApart from that established by the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" in cases that fall within it, I know of no foundation for liability of an employer to his employee for personal injuries sustained by the latter in the course of his employment except fault or negligence imputable to the employer either under the common law or the \"Employers' Liability Act.\" Under these circumstances, since it was against liability of the plaintiffs to their employees for personal injuries that the defendants engaged to indemnify them, I think such liability arising from negligence must not only have been within the contemplation of the parties but must have been the very thing in respect of which they were contracting. The case of the City of Toronto v. Lambert[4], relied upon by counsel for the appellants, is clearly distinguishable on this ground. Had this view of the matter presented itself to the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia I incline to think he would have reached the same conclusion. His citation of McCawley v. Furness Ry. Co.[5], appears to warrant this inference.\nI express no opinion on the question whether injuries caused by negligence of, or ascribable to, the Stevedoring Company would or would not have been within the purview of the term \"any and all liability for personal injury,\" were it not reasonably certain that such liability must have been, and that liability apart from and without negligence or fault cannot have been, within the contemplation of the parties to the agreement under consideration\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The liability of the appellant depends upon the construction of an agreement between the parties by which the appellant company undertook to hold the respondent company\nentirely harmless from any and all liability for personal injury to any of the Stevedoring Company's employees while performing labour embraced in this agreement.\nIn my opinion, there is no doubt that the man Scott was injured when he was doing some stevedoring work contemplated by the contract. Wheelbarrows were required for the unloading of the ship and when he was bringing them he had an accident for which he sued and obtained judgment against his employer, the respondent company. The latter now seeks to be indemnified by the appellant under the above clause of the contract.\nIt is common ground that the accident was due to the stevedoring company's negligence. Nobody would suggest, however, that the negligence was wilful. But it is one of those accidents inherent to the carrying out of work of that kind. The indemnity clause is a very wide one. It is not restricted to liability arising out of the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" or \"Employers' Liability Act\"; but it is general \"from any and all liability for personal injury.\"\nOne of the greatest risks the contractor for labour must incur is his liability for damages for personal injury to his workmen. The number of persons employed and the lack of care on the part of some of those employees render the undertaking a risky one.\nIn this case we have besides a provision in the contract that all the gear and apparatus for performing the work should be supplied by the Steamship Company.\nThe defective appliances are to a very large extent the cause of those accidents to workmen. It was only natural for the parties to agree that all those accidents, whether they were caused by the ordinary neglect of the steamship company or of the stevedoring company, should be provided for. It is not giving then to the contract too wide an interpretation to declare that the liability of the appellant company covers a case similar to the one we have before us. The judgment that has declared the appellant company liable should be confirmed with costs.\nCASSELS J. ad hoc.\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Tupper & Bull.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Davis & Co.\n[1] 38 D.L.R. 468; [1918] 1 W.W.R. 196.\n[2] [1917] 1 W.W.R. 791.\n[3] (1904) 1 K.B. 412.\n[4] 54 Can.

VII., c. 50, s. 8:\nSection 294 of the \"Railway Act\" means that if animals are allowed by their owner to be at large within one-half mile of the intersection of the railway and a highway at rail level, the owner takes the risk upon himself of any damage caused to or by them upon the intersection; but if such damage is caused to the animals not upon the intersection but upon the railway property beyond it, the company would be liable unless it established that the animals \"got at large through the negligence or wilful act or omission of the owner or his agent.\"\nPer Davies and Anglin JJ.\u2014Section 294 is intra vires of the Parliament of Canada and is not in conflict with provincial legislation which permitted animals to be at large unless restricted by municipal regulations.\nSection 294 is a code by itself and is not altered by section 254 which requires railway companies to maintain cattle-guards.\nPer Idington and Brodeur JJ.\u2014Sub-section 5 of section 294 is limited in its operation to the requirements of sub-section 1 imposing on the owner of animals the duty of providing some competent person to be in charge.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan en banc[1], affirming the judgment of Elwood J. at the trial[2], which dismissed the plaintiffs' action for damages for horses killed on the railway tracks of the defendant company.\nThe facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nChrysler K.C. for appellant.\nTilley K.C. for respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014This is an appeal from the unanimous judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan en banc confirming the judgment of the trial judge dismissing plaintiff's action.\nThe action was brought to recover damages for the loss or injury caused to the plaintiff's herd of ponies which were killed upon the railway track either at the intersection of the railway and the highway at level or upon the track somewhat beyond that intersection.\nThe right of the plaintiff to recover depends in my judgment upon the construction given to section 294 of the \"Railway Act\" of Canada as amended in 1910.\nA suggestion was made that the section was ultra vires of the Parliament of Canada and was in conflict with provincial legislation which permitted animals to go at large unless restricted by municipal regulations. I cannot for a moment entertain the suggestion of the section being ultra vires nor do I think that it is necessarily in conflict with the provincial legislation. It simply means that if animals are allowed by their owner to be at large within one-half a mile of the intersection of the railway and a highway at level the owner takes the risk upon himself of any damages which may be caused to or by them upon the intersection, and if such damages are caused to the animals not upon the intersection but upon the railway property beyond it the company would be liable for them unless it established that the animals\ngot at large through the negligence or wilful act or omission of the owner or his agent, etc.\nIn the case before us I am strongly inclined to think the evidence shewed the animals to have been killed at the intersection of the railway and the highway. If so, the animals being at large contrary to the provisions of the section, the plaintiff by the express words of the sub-section 3 was deprived of any right of action for their loss.\nIf, on the contrary, the animals were killed not at the intersection but on the railway track beyond it, then the plaintiffs would have a right of action under the 4th sub-section for damages caused by their loss unless the company proved that they were \"at large\" by \"the negligence or wi ful act or omission\" of the owner.\nThat this was proved is beyond doubt. The plaintiffs admitted that they allowed the ponies to be at large on a section adjoining that through which the railway track ran and that they must have wandered or strayed away till they had got upon the highway and then on to the intersection of the railway. The trial judge found these facts on, satisfactory evidence to have been proved. In my judgment the animals were beyond doubt at large by the plaintiffs' \"wilful act.\" It was not \"negligence\" on the plaintiffs' part which allowed the animals to get \"at large\" but the intentional, deliberate act of the plaintiffs who allowed them to go at large. That was the plaintiffs' \"wilful act\" which when proved by the company deprived them under sub-section 4 of a right to recover damages for the loss of the animals. The result therefore in my opinion is that, if the animals being at large within half a mile of the railway and the highway crossing at level wandered or strayed on to the railway track and were killed on the intersection, the plaintiffs were deprived by sub-section 3 of their right of action and if killed beyond the intersection on the railway track were also deprived of their right of action by sub-section 4 for their loss, once it was established that the animals were at large by their \"wilful act.\"\nIt was contended that as the cattle-guards had not been maintained at the intersection as required by section 254 the company was liable whether the animals were killed on the intersection or not and whether they were at large by the plaintiffs' wilful act or not. But I think clearly this is not so. Section 294 is in my opinion a code in itself, with respect to the rights and obligations of the Railway Company and of the owners of animals killed upon the company's track whether at the intersection of the railway and the highway level, or on other railway property beyond it. Section 254 is of general application but it cannot control or alter the operation of section 294 which deals with the particular case now before us and defines with particularity and care the respective obligations and rights of the company and the owners of animals at large in the neighbourhood of level crossings of railways and highways.\nIdington J.\u2014The decision of this appeal ought to turn upon the effect to be given to section 294, sub- section 5. The whole section reads, as amended by 9 & 10 Ed. VII., c. 50, sec. 8, as follows:\u2014\n294. No horses, sheep, swine or other cattle shall be permitted to be at large upon any highway, within half a mile of the intersection of such highway with any railway at rail level, unless they are in charge of some competent person or persons, to prevent their loitering or stopping on such highway at such intersection, or straying upon the railway.\n2. All horses, sheep, swine or other cattle found at large contrary to the provisions of this section may, by any person who finds them at large, be impounded in the pound nearest to the place where they are so found, and the poundkeeper with whom the same are impounded shall detain them in like manner, and subject to like regulations as to the care and disposal thereof, as in the case of cattle impounded for trespass on private property.\n3. If the horses, sheep, swine or other cattle of any person, which are at large contrary to the provisions of this section, are killed or injured by any train, at such point of intersection, he shall not have any right of action against any company in respect of the same being so killed or injured.\n4. When any horses, sheep, swine or other cattle at large, whether upon the highway or not, get upon the property of the company, and by reason thereof damage is caused to or by such animal, the party suffering such damage shall, except in the cases otherwise provided for by the next following section, be entitled to recover the amount of such damage against the company in any action in any court of competent jurisdiction, unless the company establishes that such animal got at large through the negligence or wilful act or omission of the owner or his agent, or of the custodian of such animal or his agent; Provided, however, that nothing herein shall be taken or construed as relieving any person from the penalties imposed by section 407 of this Act. (9 & 10 Ed. VII., c. 50, s. 8).\n5. The fact that any such animal was not in charge of some competent person or persons shall not, if the animal was killed or injured upon the property of the company, and not at the point of intersection with the highway, deprive the owner of his right to recover.\nThe owner is given by section 4 a right of action unless the company prove that the animal got at large through negligence or wilful act or omission of the owner or his agent.\nDoes sub-section 5 dispense with this right of the company when its default causes the accident?\nOr is it only limited in its operation to the requirements of sub-section 1, imposing the duty of providing some competent person to be in charge? The common sense of sub-section 5 in depriving the company of a defence when animals not killed on the highway but on the railway track by reason of the company's default in not observing the law suggests it ought to have been made to apply to all such cases.\nI incline, however, to think Parliament has failed to so express itself and that the latter or second class is only what is covered and not the former.\nThat would not prevent the operation of the exception in sub-section 4 in favour of the company.\nThe case of Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Eggleston[3], wherein it was decided that the owner of a band of horses, though in a sense in charge, which in 1902 strayed upon an unfenced railway track had no remedy for their slaughter by the defendant's train, I imagine led to this attempt to bring the law in harmony with due regard by railway companies for the rights of others.\nI regret that the effort at amendment seems to have partially miscarried.\nI cannot say the court below is wrong in the holding that an owner leaving his horses at large on an unfenced section of land falls within same.\nI agree the legislation of the local legislature cannot invade the express declaration of parliament in a railway Act such as that in question.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Davies.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I agree with Mr. Justice Idington.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Seaborn, Taylor, Pope & Quirk.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Fish & Ferguson.\n[1] 10 Sask.

(dissenting).\nThe Public Utilities Commission, constituted by R.S.Q. 1909, art. 718, is not a \"court\" in the sense of that word in the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec, maintaining the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Commission in this case.\nThe Public Utilities Commission granted a petition of C. J. Fleet and ordered the appellant to permit the Intercolonial Railway to run its engines and cars over the railway line of the appellant.\nThe appellant made an application for the cancellation of this order on the ground that the Commission had no jurisdiction in the case but the application was refused. On appeal to the Court of King's Bench the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Commission was affirmed.\nThe appellant then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada and applied to the registrar to affirm the jurisdiction of the court and to have the security approved, which application was granted for the following reasons.\nThe Registrar.\u2014This is an application to affirm the jurisdiction of the court coupled with a motion to allow a bond offered as security for the appeal. Mr. Walker appears for the motion, Mr. Darveau appears for the King. No exception is taken to the nature of the security offered if the court has jurisdiction.\nThe facts appear to be as follows:\u2014\nR.S.Q., art. 718, establishes the Quebec Public Utilities Commission and art. 742, as amended by 1 Geo. V., ch. 14, sec. 4, provides that the Commission should have general supervision over all public utilities subject to the legislative authority of the province, and may make such orders regarding equipment, appliances, safety devices, extension of works or systems of reporting and other matters as are necessary for the safety or convenience of the public or for the purpose of carrying out any contract, charter, or franchise involved in the use of public property or rights.\nC. J. Fleet, Esq., K.C., residing in Montreal, on the 11th June, 1917, presented a petition to the Commission asking that an order should be made requiring the Canada & Gulf Terminal Railway Company to permit the Intercolonial Railway to run a train over the line of the former company from Mont Joly Junction to Little Metis; and thereupon the Commission made an ex parte interim order granting the petition and ordered the Canada & Gulf Terminal Railway Company to permit the Intercolonial Railway to run its engines and cars over the railway line of the Canada & Gulf Terminal from Mont Joly Junction to Little Metis. It also provided that the Intercolonial should furnish the necessary motive power and the crew for operating its trains and directed the Canada & Gulf Terminal and Intercolonial Railways to appear before it on the 26th June, 1917, for the purpose of determining the compensation to be paid by the latter company to the former. Both companies appeared before the Commission and the Canada & Gulf Terminal Company confined its objection to the question of jurisdiction of the Commission and asked for the cancellation of this order on the ground that the Intercolonial Railway was not subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, and because the Commission had no power to accord running rights to one railway company over another. This objection was overruled on the 10th July following.\nArt. 763 gives an appeal to the Court of King's Bench (appeal side) from any final decision of the Commission upon any question as to its jurisdiction or upon any question of law, but such an appeal can be taken only by permission of a judge of the said court given upon a petition presented to him within 15 days from the rendering of the decision.\nThe appeal was apparently regularly taken to the Court of King's Bench, which pronounced judgment on the 3rd April, 1918, affirming the jurisdiction of the court below (two judges, Carroll and Pelletier JJ. dissenting). The present application is based on the right of appeal conferred by sec. 37, s.s. a, of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" which provides as follows:\u2014\n37. Except as hereinafter otherwise provided, an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any final judgment of the highest court of final resort now or hereafter established in any province of Canada, whether such court is a court of appeal or of original jurisdiction, where the action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding has not originated in a superior court, in the following cases;\n(a) In the Province of Quebec if the matter in controversy involves the question of or relates to any fee of office, duty rent, revenue, sum of money payable to His Majesty, or to any title to lands or tenements, annual rents and other matters or things where rights in future might be bound; or amounts to or exceeds the sum or value of two thousand dollars;\nThe applicants contend, first, that the matter involved exceeds the sum or value of $2,000 and in any event his case falls within the words \"matter in controversy involves the question of or relates to any title to lands or tenements, annual rents and other matters or things where rights in future might be bound.\"\nWith respect to the amount involved, an affidavit is filed by the vice-president of the applicant company in which he says that the amount involved exceeds the sum of $2,000, while the traffic manager of the Canadian Government Railways files an affidavit in which he says that the compensation which should be allowed to the applicant for the use of the railway for the season of 1917 should be materially under $2,000. The only other evidence bearing on the amount involved is the petition of Fleet presented to the Commission, in which it is said that the Intercolonial Railway had offered $2,000 for the running rights during the year and that the applicant company had demanded $5,000. The Commission never determined the compensation owing to the objection taken to its jurisdiction. If I had to determine the application solely on the question of the amount involved for the privilege of using the applicant's railway, I should have little hesitation in holding that it must exceed $2,000 as the order which has been made is not limited to one year. I am, however, of the opinion that there is jurisdiction because titles to lands or tenements, annual rents and other matters or things where rights in future might be bound are involved. This provision of section 37 is substantially the same as section 46 (b) which has been the subject of consideration by the court in a number of cases. The right conferred upon the Intercolonial to use the roadbed and rails of the applicant company is quite as much an interest in lands under this section as are the servitudes which have been declared to confer jurisdiction in the cases of Macdonald v. Ferdais[1], and the other cases to be found collected in Cameron's Supreme Court Practice, at pp. 225-228.\nI am therefore of the opinion that the court has jurisdiction and grant the motion. Costs in the cause.\n(Sgd.) E. R. Cameron.\nThe respondent then made a motion, by way of appeal to the Supreme Court, to reverse the decision of the registrar.\nC. V. Darveau K.C for the motion.\nH. N. Chauvin K.C. contra.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting)\u2014In my opinion this appeal should be allowed. The case does not come within sec. 36 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" and I cannot quite understand how section 37 can be applied. The Public Utilities Commission is not a court (vide section. 740 R.S.Q.) and the statute which creates the Commission provides for an appeal to the Court of King's Bench subject to limitations which shew that it was the intention of the legislature to limit appeals to certain specified questions and to the Court of King's Bench in an advisory rather than a judicial capacity (vide sections 763 et seq. of the R.S.Q.). More-over, in the present instance the Commission exercised the jurisdiction formerly vested in the Railway Committee of the Provincial Executive Council.\nThe appeal should be allowed.\nDavies J.\u2014I am to dismiss the appeal from the registrar with costs and to affirm our jurisdiction to hear this appeal.\nIdington J. (dissenting)\u2014The constitution of a Public Utilities Commission in Quebec does not create a court in the sense of that word in the \"Supreme Court Act\" and hence there does not seem to be any place in that Act for appeals from the Court of King's Bench (appeal side) rendering a judgment pursuant to the provisions of art. 763 of the revised statutes of Quebec. It is manifest that such a proceeding as in question herein did not originate in any superior court and hence the jurisdiction given by section 36 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" cannot be invoked to support an appeal here.\nNo more can section 37 of same Act which in the first part thereof giving jurisdiction in cases originating in other courts reads as follows:\u2014\nExcept as hereinafter otherwise provided, an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any final judgment of the highest court of final resort now or hereafter established in any province of Canada, whether such court is a court of appeal or of original jurisdiction, where the action, suit, cause, matter or other judicial proceeding has not originated in a superior court, in the following cases:\nIt is to be observed that this section relates only to judicial proceedings which the exercise of power given the Utilities Commission is not. The nature of the powers given are purely administrative and not judicial.\nThe power conferred upon the King's Bench to determine whether or not the Commission has acted within its jurisdiction, and according to law is of course a judicial jurisdiction, but that did not originate in any other court as contemplated by the section I have just quoted.\nThe proposed appeal should be quashed with costs of the motion.\nAnglin J.\u2014Although at first of the opinion that the appeal from the registrar's order affirming jurisdiction should succeed, further consideration has led me to the contrary conclusion. Admittedly not within section 36 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" because the proceeding did not originate in a superior court, the appellant maintains that this appeal is within our jurisdiction under section 37 (a) on the grounds: (a) that the matter in controversy involves a question of or relating to title to lands or tenements and (b) amounts to or exceeds the sum or value of $2,000.\nAs the registrar points out, it has been established by affidavit that the value of the running rights granted by the order of the Public Utilities Commission exceeds $2,000. Their annual value is said to be over $1,000 and the order is for an indefinite term. While the matter in controversy on the proposed appeal is merely the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities Commission to make the order which it did, the matter in controversy in the proceeding is the running rights; and it has been determined in a number of cases that the words \"the matter in controversy\" in section 37 (a) mean not the matter in controversy on the appeal but the matter in controversy in the proceeding. While I cannot think that it was ever intended that an appeal should lie from these provincial boards to this court, section 37 (a) in terms covers this case.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs. Brodeur J.\u2014Il s'agit d'un appel, de la part de l'intim\u00e9, d'une d\u00e9cision du R\u00e9gistraire de cette cour qui a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que nous avions juridiction pour entendre la pr\u00e9sente cause.\nLa compagnie appelante est une compagnie de chemin de fer incorpor\u00e9e par la L\u00e9gislature de la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Sa ligne se raccorde \u00e0 Mont Joli avec le chemin de fer Intercolonial. Une demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite devant la Commission des Services d'Utilit\u00e9 publique de Qu\u00e9bec sous l'autorit\u00e9 des dispositions des articles 740 et suivants des statuts refondus de la province de Qu\u00e9bec pour que la compagnie appelante soit tenue de donner un droit de passage sur sa voie \u00e0 certains trains de l'Intercolonial. La compagnie appelante s'est object\u00e9e \u00e0 cette demande en all\u00e9guant que la Commission des Services d'Utilit\u00e9 publique n'avait pas le pouvoir et la juridiction n\u00e9cessaire pour accorder cette demande.\nLa Commission a le 10 juillet 1917 maintenu la demande. Suivant les dispositions de l'article 763 des Statuts refondus de la province de Qu\u00e9bec, un appel a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9 devant la Cour du Banc du Roi par la compagnie appelante de cette d\u00e9cision de la Commission des Service d'Ulilit\u00e9 publique. Le jugement de la Commission a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 et la Compagnie Canada & Gulf Terminal institue le pr\u00e9sent appel.\nPar l'article 36 de l'acte de la Cour Supr\u00eame, il est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il y a appel \u00e0 cette cour de tout jugement final de la plus haute cour de dernier ressort \u00e9tablie dans toute province du Canada, que cette cour soit une cour d'appel ou une cour de premi\u00e8re instance, dans le cas o\u00f9 la cour de premi\u00e8re instance est une cour sup\u00e9rieure.\nPar la section 37 de l'acte de la Cour Supr\u00eame, il est d\u00e9clar\u00e9 cependant qu'il peut y avoir appel de tout jugement d\u00e9finitif de la Cour du Banc du Roi de Qu\u00e9bec m\u00eame quand la poursuite n'a pas pris naissance devant une cour sup\u00e9rieure, si l'affaire en litige\na trait au titre \u00e0 des biens-fonds, \u00e0 des rentes annuelles et \u00e0 d'autres affaires o\u00f9 choses ou peuvent se rencontrer des droits futurs; ou bien si le montant de l'affaire atteint ou d\u00e9passe la somme ou la valeur de deux mille dollars.\nCette cour a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 plusieurs reprises \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter une disposition semblable qui se trouve \u00e0 la section 46 de l'acte de la Cour Supr\u00eame et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les poursuites concernant les droits de passage affectaient le titre d'une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et, par cons\u00e9quent, pouvaient donner lieu \u00e0 un appel devant cette cour.\nVoir Macdonald v. Ferdais[2], et les autres causes qui sont mentionn\u00e9es dans Cameron's Supreme Court Practice, pp. 225 et 228.\nMais on dit: La Cour d'Appel, en vertu de l'acte, ne peut intervenir dans les causes qui ont origin\u00e9 devant la Commission des Services d'Utilit\u00e9 publique que dans les questions de droit ou de juridiction; et alors la mati\u00e8re qui est en litige devant nous n'est pas la question du droit de passage que l'on demande sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'appelante, mais simplement la question de savoir si la Commission des Services d'Utilit\u00e9 publique a jurisdiction ou non.\nJe crois qu'en adoptant ce point de vue-l\u00e0 on arriverait \u00e0 des cons\u00e9quences assez \u00e9tranges. Les montants en litige qui sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement demand\u00e9s par la poursuite entrainent presque toujours la d\u00e9cision de questions de droit et faudrait-il dire alors que nons n'avons pas juridiction parce que le fonds du litige repose sur une question de droit seulement? Evidemment non. Il faut aller aux sources; il faut examiner la nature de la demande faite devant les tribunaux inf\u00e9rieurs; et si cette demande a pour objet une somme d'argent exc\u00e9dant $2,000 ou un droit de servitude et si cette demande ne peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e que dans le cas o\u00f9 la cour superieure aurait juridiction il n'en reste pas moins vrai que la mati\u00e8re en litige sera de savoir si telle somme est due ou si telle servitude doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9e ou refus\u00e9e.\nLe jugement que nous aurons \u00e0 rendre dans cette cause-ci est, suivant les dispositions de Particle 51 de l'acte de la Cour Supr\u00eame, celui qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre prononc\u00e9 par la Commission des Services d'Utilit\u00e9 Publique, c'est-\u00e0-dire refuser ou accorder la demande qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite pour un droit de passage sur la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de la compagnie appelante.\nJ'en suis donc venu \u00e0 la conclusion que nous avons juridiction pour entendre cet appel et que le jugement rendue par le r\u00e9gistraire doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\n[1] 22 Can.

S. then wired to McC. & V. as follows:\u2014\n\"Certificate of title value five thousand assessment four thousand \"fifty Jones allowed penalty on taxes. No declarations from \"Love or Jones as to moneys received or paid only one lot looks dear. \"Please explain and guarantee holding draft give men's standing \"we are afraid been away from home caused delay.\"\nOn the same day was wired the following reply:\n\"Value on title made low to reduce registration costs are getting \"declaration as to monies received from Love who is good man \"agreement good and guarantee it.\"\nHeld, Davies and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that the last mentioned document was ambiguous and was shewn by the circumstances to have been intended as an assurance that the vendor was a man of good financial standing and the property in question good security for the money and the agreement and title passed thereby in proper legal form, but did not guarantee payment of the purchase money.\nPer Davies and Brodeur JJ. dissenting:\u2014The document is a guarantee of the agreement including the undertaking to pay if the main debtor makes default.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan[1], reversing the judgment of Newlands J. at the trial and dismissing the plaintiff's action with costs. The material facts of the case and the questions in issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nTilley K.C. for the appellants.\nChrysler K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The action is brought on an alleged guarantee by the respondents of the payment of the balance of the purchase price under an agreement for sale, the vendor's rights under which were acquired by the appellants.\nThe guarantee was contained in the telegram which reads:\u2014\nValue or title made low to reduce registration costs are getting declaration as to moneys received from Love who is good man agreement good and guarantee \"it.\"\nThere was a letter confirming this telegram but I do not know that it carries the matter much further even if it was admissible in evidence which it probably was not since it was not received until the appellants had completed the purchase of the agreement.\nSome time prior to the transaction in question in this suit the appellant, in reference to similar ones had inquired of the respondents on what terms they would be prepared to guarantee the due completion of such agreements for sale. The respondents replied stating in a general and rather vague manner terms on which they would give a guarantee which apparently would have been for the payment of the balance of purchase money remaining due.\nThe matter went no further, but the trial judge interpreted the guarantee given by the respondents in this case by the light of this letter and held that the same meaning must be given to the guaranteein this case. I do not think there was any occasion for doing so but rather the contrary since here the respondents made no stipulation for any commission or other remuneration for themselves for giving such a guarantee. Indeed the only consideration for their giving it which the appellants are able to suggest is \"the appellant purchasing the said agreement for sale from Robert W. Love\" and this seems entirely inadequate as a consideration for the respondents, who were merely agents, undertaking to guarantee the payment of the purchase money under the agreement.\nI think the simple and natural construction of the guarantee is as stated in the judgment appealed from\nthat it did not guarantee payment of the agreement, but went no further than to guarantee that the agreement was a bon\u00e2 fide one, and that the property and the parties were good.\nIn their letter confirming the guarantee the respondents say\nin talking the matter over we decided to guarantee it, which should be sufficient for your requirements.\nIt appears from the correspondence that the respondents were aware that the appellants were only speculating in the purchase of these agreements for sale with borrowed money and that they had the greatest difficulty in getting the banks to advance money for the purpose. I think it is therefore probable that when they said\nthis should be sufficient for your requirements\nthey had in view that the guarantee was to satisfy the bank lending the money of the bona fides of the agreement in which no doubt the respondents believed.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nDavies J. (dissenting).\u2014I am of the opinion that the appeal in this case should be allowed with costs and the judgment of the trial judge restored. Mr. Justice Lamont, who dissented in the Appeal Court, was of the same opinion on the latter point.\nThe question at issue between the parties is whether the proper construction of the guarantee in question of an agreement for the sale of certain lands sold by the respondents to the plaintiffs, appellants, was a guarantee of the agreement including its payment or was limited to the agreement being a bon\u00e2 fide one only as to property and parties.\nThe respondents were real estate agents carrying on business in Saskatoon and the appellants were business men residing in Woodstock, Ont. Prior to May, 1913, the appellants had purchased from respondents a number of agreements for the sale of land and a proposition had apparently been made by the appellant plaintiffs to the defendant respondents respecting the guarantee of those agreements. On November 1st, 1912, Blow, one of the plaintiffs, wrote the following letter to defendants:\u2014\nWoodstock, Ont., Nov. 1, 1912.\nMcCallum & Vannatter,\nSaskatoon, Sask.\nDear Sirs:\u2014Your letter is received and glad to hear that everything is being put in proper shape and trust that everything will end well.\nAnd now about further business. I think agreements ranging from one thousand to three, but smaller or a little larger would not make much difference if we could prove that they were gilt-edged. About what would it be worth to guarantee them as you propose? Now if three or four real good ones came to you and you could mail them to me in haste by registered letter I could do better by exhibiting them and attending to it and returning promptly to you if you thought wise.\nI am,\nTruly yours,\n(Sgd.) J. W. Blow.\nP.S.\u2014Please give me the nature and details of the guarantee you could give and oblige.\nIn reply the defendants wrote on the 7th November a letter in which are the following paragraphs:\u2014\nAs before written to you, we will not submit anything to you that is not first class, but if you will just leave the matter in our hands, we will secure agreements for you and put through the papers without any delay. As you know, when these people bring in an agreement to sell, they want the money right away, so we could handle them in this way having the papers put through the Land Titles Office without loss of time if we knew how you wished them made out:\nAs to this guarantee you mention would say that we consider it worth 5 per cent., and would give you any kind of a binding agreement of that nature that you could wish. We, of course, would expect that settled at the time and we would be fully responsible for all payments so that if the party on the agreement did not come through, we would have to come through ourselves.\nOn the 17th April, 1913, defendant wired plaintiffs offering them the agreement now in controversy and plaintiffs replied expressing their willingness to purchase. The papers were sent forward to them through the bank at Woodstock with a draft attached for the purchase price. After examination of the agreement and the other papers, the plaintiffs were not satisfied and wired defendants as follows:\u2014\nWoodstock, Ont., May 10, 1913.\nMcCallum & Vannatter,\nSaskatoon, Sask.\nCertificate of title value five thousand, assessment four thousand fifty Jones allowed penalty on taxes. No declarations from Love or Jones as to moneys received or paid only one lot looks dear. Please explain and guarantee holding draft, give men's standing, we are afraid being away from home caused delay.\n21; o6k. Schell and Blow.\nTo this telegram, plaintiffs replied:\u2014\nFrom Saskatoon, May 12 1913.\nTo M. Schell and J. Blow,\nValue on title made low to reduce registration costs, are getting declaration as to monies received from Love who is good man, agreement good and guarantee it.\nMcCallum & Vannatter.\nOn the same day the defendants wrote plaintiffs a letter in which they explaimed that the certificate of title is\nno guide to the real value of the property\nand that\nas to the assessment from what we can learn this is figured on a 40% basis for property of this description\nadding: However in talking the matter over we decided to guarantee it which should be sufficient for your requirements. We know Mr. Love personally and know for a fact that he has considerable means and while we are not personally acquainted with Mr. Jones we are told he is good and will make payments promptly being a drug traveller.\nOn the 14th May, the plaintiffs wired defendants:\u2014\nYour telegram explaining reason low valuation on duplicate certificate and guaranteeing agreement as good came to hand on Monday afternoon and we paid draft yesterday.\nReading the correspondence and the telegram together, I cannot have any doubt that when the defendants telegraphed the plaintiffs saying, \"agreement good and guarantee it\" they meant what any ordinary businessman would mean that they guaranteed its payment. The letter sent by them the same day in which they say,\nHowever in talking the matter over we decided to guarantee it which should be sufficient for your requirements\ntaken in conjunction with their previous letter of 7th November in which they explain what they mean by the guarantee mentioned in the plaintiff's letter they were answering was that\nwe would be fully responsible for all payments so that if the party on the agreement did not come through we would have to come through ourselves\nplace the question of the meaning of the guarantee and the intention of both parties as to what it covered beyond any doubt in my mind. Defendants say what they mean by guaranteeing agreement and I cannot agree with the limited and narrow construction which the Court of Appeal placed upon it that\nit went no further than to guarantee that the agreement was a bon\u00e2 fide one and that the property and the parties were good.\nSuch a limited construction is right in the teeth of their letter and their telegram.\nI would allow the appeal with costs. Idington J.\u2014The appellants and respondents had for some months prior to the transaction now in question been negotiating with each other for the purchase by the appellants of securities known as \"Purchasers' Agreements\" for the purchase of lands and the covenant for the payment of the money.\nThe appellants resided in or about Woodstock, in Ontario, and the respondents in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Several transactions of that kind had taken place during these negotiations prior to the one in question, which was an agreement for the purchase of some land in Saskatoon alleged to have been purchased by one Jones from one Love, both of Saskatoon, for the price of $12,000 on which a sum of $4,000 on account of principal was supposed to have been paid. Love made an assignment of the agreement of purchase by an instrument dated 18th April, 1913, to the respondent Schell.\nThe respondent who procured this drew upon the appellants for the amount agreed upon as the price of said security, making their draft payable at Woodstock, Ontario, and accompanying the draft with the assignment and other documents relative thereto.\nOn the 12th May, 1913, by night lettergram, the appellants wired respondents as follows:\u2014\nCertificate of title value five thousand assessment four thousand fifty Jones allowed penalty on taxes. No declarations from Love or Jones as to moneys received or paid only one lot looks dear. Please explain and guarantee holding draft give men's standing we are afraid been away from home caused delay.\nThe respondents on the same day wired reply as follows:\u2014\nValue on title made low to reduce registration costs are getting declarations as to moneys received from Love who is good man agreement good and guarantee it.\nUpon this instrument lastly mentioned the appellants brought an action which was instituted on the 18th September, 1916, claiming that respondents had guaranteed to them in writing the payment of the balance of the purchase price under the said agreement for sale. The learned trial judge maintained the claim, but the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan reversed that judgment and dismissed the action. Hence this appeal which should be determined solely by the correct construction to be placed upon the said telegram.\nI think the document is very ambiguous and capable of more than one meaning. Counsel for the appellants contends that it must mean a guarantee by the respondents of the payment by Jones of the amount of the balance of purchase money of the land or by Love, his vendor, who covenanted therefor. On the other hand, counsel for the respondents contended that it could have no such meaning or any meaning beyond being an assurance that Love was a good man and the agreement in proper form and possessing the validity such an agreement should have.\nI confess that from the perusal of the judgments, and listening to the argument of counsel for the appellants, I had received the impression that an interpretation and construction midway between these extreme contentions was more consonant with reason and better fitted to express in truth what the parties had in view. According to that impression I should hold that it represented Love as a man of good financial standing, the property in question good security for the money and the agreement and title passed thereby in proper legal form. In that view, if Love could be shewn to have been at the time in question of such apparent good financial standing as would answer the description and the land of the value which the agreement represented and the title perfect, there could be no recovery; and on the other hand, if it turned out that between the date of the telegram and the recovery on the action brought by appellants against Love and Jones financial disaster had overtaken one or both or the condition of the market value of the land in question had become such that the land had fallen far below the market value of that of previous years, these circumstances should not be taken into account in determining adversely to these respondents their liability. I am still inclined to think that is the correct view of the nature of the instrument sued upon and the liability thereunder.\nCounsel for the appellants repudiated in argument any such construction as possible. Possibly the circumstances that had transpired were of such a nature as to indicate that an action seeking to enforce that view would be of little avail.\nI cannot accept the interpretation and construction contended for by appellants that it was distinctly intended that the respondents should, on default of those liable under the agreement and the assignment thereof, become liable to pay the balance of the purchase price of the land named in the security. The instrument being of an ambiguous character I think that anything which had passed between the parties prior thereto, and leading up to it, as well as that concurrent therewith and the acts of the parties immediately after, may be looked at. Counsel for appellants relies in that connection upon a letter of the 7th November, 1912, from the respondents to Mr. Blow, one of the appellants, in which they further explain to him the nature of the business involved in the buying such like securities and used these words:\u2014\nAs to this guarantee you mention would say that we consider it worth 5% and would give you any kind of a binding agreement of that nature that you could wish. We, of course, would expect that settled at the time and would be fully responsible for all payments so that if the party on the agreement would not come through, we would have to come through ourselves.\nThese two sentences taken from the middle of a long letter are evidently an answer to a letter of Mr. Blow of the 1st November in which, amongst other things, he says, speaking of such like agreements:\u2014\nAbout what would it be worth to guarantee them as you propose?\nand then adds the following postscript:\u2014\nPlease give me the nature and details of the guarantee you could give and oblige.\nI am very far from finding anything in that correspondence to support the appellants in their view of the transaction now in question. Indeed, I think that a letter written only five months before so expressly stipulating for 5% being paid at the time of the sale of such a security, as the price of the guarantee for its payment, excludes the possibility of the parties hereto having ever intended that such a guarantee was to be implied in the telegram in question.\nThere was no 5% paid or anything paid by way of securing an assurance of payment, and when reliance is placed upon a letter written on the same day as the telegram but not received until after the draft had been paid, I do not think it helps.\nStress is laid upon an expression in that letter that the respondents had decided to guarantee, I do not attach the importance to the expression in the letter that counsel seems to think was attached to it. In short, the circumstances to be gathered from the correspondence clearly shew that appellants' difficulty and hesitation in accepting the draft was what the night lettergram indicates. The difficulty seems to have been that the certificate of title valued the property at $5,000 and the assessment only $4,050 and that Jones the purchaser had allowed the imposition of the penalty for non-payment of taxes. Hence the suggestion of a declaration from Love or Jones as to the moneys received or paid for what looked dear. These were the things that were to be explained and guaranteed against as well as an assurance relative to the man's standing, and pursuant thereto a declaration was got from Mr. Love verifying the price and terms of the cash payment according to the terms of purchase and also his own standing to the extent that he had not been sued for the money or it garnisheed.\nIt is to be observed that the parties had several transactions of a like kind between the date of the letter and the telegram in question, but in not a single instance was a 5% premium for guarantee resorted to.\nI do not think under such circumstances that the construction contended for by appellants of the document sued upon can or should be maintained and I therefore think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014I concur in the dismissal of this appeal substantially for the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Idington.\nBrodeur J. (dissenting).\u2014The appellants by their action claimed from the respondents the payment of a sum of money for which they say the respondents gave a guarantee, that sum of money being originally due by Love and Jones.\nThe respondents claim that they did not guarantee the payment of the obligation of Love and Jones but simply guaranteed that the agreement was bon\u00e2 fide and that Love and Jones were good.\nThe appellants succeeded before the trial judge; but the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan en banc by a majority dismissed their action and reversed the judgment of the trial judge. For some time, the appellants had some business dealings with the respondents and had been purchasing some agreements of sale through the respondents or from the respondents. They were purchasing the interest of the vendor in those agreements, taking assignments thereof.\nIn the month of April, 1913, the respondents offered for sale the agreement of Love and Jones for the sum of $7,300, and they sent a few days afterwards a draft for the purchase price as was the usual custom of dealing between the appellants and the respondents.\nThe appellants, after having inspected the document, were not satisfied, having found out that the certificate of title valued the property only at $5,000 and that the municipal assessment was only $4,050 and they asked whether they would guarantee.\nThe respondents answered stating that the value and title were made low in order to reduce the registration costs and they added, \"Agreement good and guarantee it.\" They sent a confirming letter stating that having thought the matter over, they had decided to guarantee it.\nI must state that in a previous correspondence exchanged between the parties, the respondents had been willing to guarantee the debts which they would sell to the appellants who were living in Ontario when those agreements of sale were made in the Province of Saskatchewan. They said, however, that a sum of 5% should be given to them for such a guarantee and they added:\u2014\nWe, of course, would expect that settled at the time and we would be fully responsible for all payments so that if the party on the agreement did not come through we would have to come through ourselves.\nWe see by that letter the nature of the guarantee which the respondents were willing to give concerning those agreements of sale. But outside of that what is the nature of the contract of guarantee?\nIt is an undertaking to answer for another's liability and collateral thereto. It is a collateral undertaking to pay the debt of another in case he does not pay it. It is a provision to answer for the payment of some debt or the performance of some duty in the case of the failure of some person who in the first instance is liable for such payment or performance. Bouvier, \"Law Dictionary,\" word Guaranty.\nIt is in the nature of that contract of guarantee that the primary debtor will perform his contract and the guarantor has to answer for the consequence of the primary debtor's default.\n13 Halsbury, vbo. Guarantee, sec. 864. Anson on Contract, 10th ed., p. 73.\nWhat was the obligation of Love and Jones in this case? It was to pay a certain sum of money when it would become due. There is no statement, no warranty in their contract that they were solvent at the time they made it or that the agreement was a bon\u00e0 fide document. Then, what obligation would a guarantor of their debt contract? It would be the obligation of payment when the debt would become due. As I have said, the contract of guarantee presupposes a primary debt and when a person becomes a guarantor he undertakes to carry out that obligation if the main debtor makes default.\nThe contract of guarantee made in this case would necessarily induce the appellants to accept the draft of the respondents because the latter were undertaking to pay the debt if Love and Jones would not pay it. If the respondents wanted to restrict the nature of their contract or wanted to give to the word guarantee another meaning than the one which is being naturally given, then it was their duty to specify in a clear manner that they were undertaking not to guarantee the obligation of the main debtor but the fact that the debtor was solvent and that the agreement was bon\u00e2 fide. As they have not done it, the word guarantee should be considered in its ordinary sense, which means that the respondents undertook to pay the debt of the principal debtor if the latter failed to do it.\nI have come then to the conclusion that the appellants should succeed. The judgment a quo should be reversed with costs of this court and of the court below and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Carrothers & Williams.\nSolicitor for the respondents: G. H. Yule.\n[1] 10 Sask. L.R. 440; 38 D.L.R. 133.\n"

C. 919.\nAt the Government House at Ottawa.\nPresent:\nHis Excellency the Governor-General-in-Council.\nWhereas there is an immediate and urgent need of reinforcements for the Canadian Expeditionary Force and the necessity for these reinforcements admits of no delay;\nAnd Whereas it is deemed essential that notwithstanding exemptions heretofore granted a substantial number of men should be withdrawn forthwith from the civil life for the purpose of serving in a military capacity;\nAnd Whereas having regard to the number of men immediately required and to the urgency of the demand, time does not permit of examination by exemption tribunals of the value in civil life, or the position, of the individuals called up for duty;\nTherefore His Excellency the Governor-General-in-Council, on the recommendation of the Right Honourable the Prime Minister, and in virtue of the powers conferred on the Governor-in-Council by the \"War Measures Act, 1914,\" and otherwise, is pleased to make the following regulations which shall come into force as soon as approved by resolution of both Houses of Parliament, and the same are hereby made and enacted accordingly:\u2014\nRegulations,\n1. In these regulations,\u2014\n(a) \"Minister\" shall mean the Minister of Militia and Defence,\n(b) \"Act\" shall mean the \"Military Service Act, 1917.\"\n2. Class 1 under the Act shall, in addition to the men included therein as in the said Act mentioned, include all men who,\u2014\n(a) Are British subjects; and\n(b) Are not within the classes of persons described in the exceptions mentioned in the schedule to the Act; and\n(c) Have attained the age of 19 years; but were born on or since 13th October, 1897; and (d) Are unmarried or widowers without children; and\n(e) Are resident in Canada.\n3. Class 2 under the \"Military Service Act, 1917,\" shall, in addition to the men included therein as in the said Act mentioned, include all men who,\u2014\n(a) Are. British subjects; and\n(b) Are not within the classes of persons described, in the exceptions mentioned in the schedule to the said Act; and\n(c) Have attained the age of 19 years; but were born on or since 13th October, 1897; and\n(d) Are married or widowers with children; and\n(e) Are resident in Canada.\n4. The words \"In any theatre of actual war\" in the fifth exception in the schedule to the Act shall not include the high seas or Great Britain or Ireland and the said exception shall be interpreted accordingly.\n5. The Governor-in-Council may direct orders to report for duty to issue to men in any class under the Act of any named age or ages or who were born in named years or any named year or part of a year and any exemption theretofore granted to any man of any such named age or year of birth shall cease from and after noon of the day upon which he is ordered so to report and no claim for exemption by or in respect of any man shall be entertained or considered after the issue to him of such order, provided, however, that the Minister may grant leave of absence without pay to any man by reason of the death, disablement or service of other members of the same family while on active service in any theatre of actual war.\n6. The age stated in any claim for exemption made by or on behalf of any man or in any other document signed by the man shall be conclusive evidence as against him of his age and year of birth.\n7. The Minister may, from time to time, direct that no orders to\nreport for duty be issued to men who have been examined by military medical boards and placed in such medical categories as are specified in such direction.\n8. All men included in Class 1 by virtue of the provisions of these regulations shall report to the Registrar or Deputy Registrar under the Act as required by Proclamations; they shall be subject to military law as in such Proclamation set out and shall, in the event of their failing to report, be liable to the penalties specified in the Act and the regulations thereunder.\n9. (a) Any man now unmarried, who at any time hereafter attains the age of 19 years and is then a British subject resident in Canada and not within one of the exceptions in the schedule to the Act, shall; and\n(b) Any man who, having attained the age of 19 years, being then a British subject resident as aforesaid and not within one of the exceptions in the schedule to the Act, becomes a widower without children, shall, il the class within which he then falls has been called out on active service: Forthwith become subject to military law and shall within ten days thereafter report to the Registrar or Deputy Registrar under the province or the part of a province in which he resides. He shall be placed on active service as provided by the Act, by the regulations thereunder or by these regulations, and shall, until so placed on active service, be deemed to be on leave of absence without pay.\n10. Where under or pursuant to any treaty or convention with any foreign Government or any country provision is now or hereafter be made that the subjects of such Government or the citizens of such country resident in Canada may be made liable by law to military service, such subjects or citizens of such Government or country may be called out by Proclamation and shall report, be liable to military law and be placed on active service as may be specified in said Proclamation or in the Act or the regulations thereunder.\nThe said order-in-council was passed on April 20th, 1918, and under the said regulations the applicant Gray, who had been granted exemption from service, was ordered to report for duty and refusing to do so was arrested by the military authorities. He then applied to Mr. Justice Anglin to be discharged on habeas corpus.\nChrysler K.C. for the applicant. The applicant asks for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus to discharge him from the custody of the military authorities who hold him for refusing to obey an order to put on uniform and enter into military service. This action was taken under the order-in-council of April 20th, 1918, which directed that all men in Class 1 (of which the applicant was one), could be directed to report for duty and that all exemptions granted to such men should cease.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Is this a criminal matter under section 62 of the Supreme Court Act?\nChrysler K.C:\u2014It is my Lord. By section 74 of the \"Military Service Act\" (R.S.C. [1906] ch. 41) the \"Imperial Army Act\" is made part of the statute law of Canada and under it Gray could be sentenced to imprisonment. The real question is as to the scope and effect of the order-in-council of April 20th, 1918. Can a resolution of the two Houses of Parliament confer the powers contended for on the Governor-in-Council? We submit it cannot and that what this order-in-council purports to do can be done only under the authority of an Act of Parliament. See Rex v. Halliday[1]; Sprigg v. Sigcan[2]; Cox v. Hates[3].\nGeoffrion K.C. follows for on the same side. The specific enumeration of matters with which the Governor-in-Council can deal shews that only orders-in-council can pass in respect to matters ejusdem generis as those enumerated.\nThe power to make rules and regulations cannot be extended to the power to legislate.\nThe \"British North America Act, 1867,\" does not authorize Parliament to amend the constitution and gives it no authority, express or implied, to delegate its powers.\nC. C. Robinson was also present on behalf of the applicant.\nBennett K.C. was heard to point out the distinction between this case and that of Re Lewis[4] in the Court of Appeal for Alberta which held the order-in-council ultra vires. He cited the case of Clowes v. Edmonton School District[5].\nNewcombe K.C. contra. Parliament is empowered to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada (\"British North America Act, 1867,\" section 91) and must be granted the widest discretion for attaining that object. Riel v. The Queen[6], per Lord Halsbury, at pages 678-9. Smiles v. Belford[7], discussed in Lefroy on Legislative Power, page 214. Parliament in its sphere has powers as extensive as those of the Imperial Parliament. \"Orders\" and \"Regulations\" are merely the terms used to designate the mode of exercising the powers conferred on the Governor-in-Council.\nThe question of delegation has been settled by the House of Lords in Rex v. Halliday[8]. Formerly all the outlying portions of the Empire were governed by order-in-council; see Taylor v. The Attorney-General[9]; and some of them are still so governed. It cannot be said that there is any change in the constitution by this mode of proceeding.\nTilley, K.C., on same side.\nChrysler K.C. for the applicant.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I have no doubt respecting the right of this court to entertain the present application for a writ of habeas corpus. Indeed, in any case of an application for this writ which, as is said in Maitland's Constitutional History of England,\nis unquestionably the first security of civil liberty,\nthis court, the court of last resort in the country, would not willingly admit any doubt of its authority to grant to any of his Majesty's subjects the protection which the writ affords.\nThe facts out of which these proceedings arise are fully set out by Mr. Justice Anglin in the reasons for judgment which he has delivered. In these I concur. But, in view of the importance of the question involved, I desire to add a few words of my own to emphasize my view of the points raised. The sole question for determination is whether there was authority for the order-in-council of the 20th of April, 1918, cancelling the petitioner's exemption from military service, granted under the provision of the Act respecting military service, passed in the year 1917.\nParliament, after the declaration of war, passed the \"War Measures Act, 1914,\" to confer upon the Governor-in-council certain powers. Section 6 of the Act provides that:\u2014\nThe Governor-in-council shall have power to do and authorize such acts and things, and to make from time to time such orders and regulations, as he may by reason of the existence of real or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection, deem necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada; and for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms, it is hereby declared that the powers of the Governor-in-council shall extend to all matters coming within the classes of subjects hereinafter enumerated, that is to say: (a) censorship and the control and suppression of publications, writings, maps, plans, photographs, communications and means of communications; (b) arrest, detention, exclusion and deportation; (c) control of the harbours, ports and territorial waters of Canada and the movements of vessels; (d) transportation by land, air, or water, and the control of the transport of persons and things; (e) trading, exportation, importation, production and manufacture; (f) appropriation, control, forfeiture and disposition of property and of the use thereof.\n2. All orders and regulations made under this section shall have the force of law and shall be enforced in such manner and by such courts, officers and authorities as the Governor-in-council may prescribe, and may be varied, extended or revoked by any subsequent order or regulation; but if any order or regulation is varied, extended or revoked, neither the previous operation thereof nor anything duly done thereunder, shall be affected thereby, nor shall any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued, accruing or incurred thereunder be affected by such variation.\nThe practice of authorizing administrative bodies to make regulations to carry out the object of an Act, instead of setting out all the details in the Act itself, is well known and its legality is unquestioned. But it is said that the power to make such regulations could not constitutionally be granted to such an extent as to enable the express provisions of a statute to be amended or repealed; that under the constitution parliament alone is to make laws, the Governor-in-council to execute them, and the court to interpret them; that it follows that no one of these fundamental branches of government can constitutionally either delegate or accept the functions of any other branch.\nIn view of Rex v. Halliday[10], I do not think this broad proposition can be maintained. Parliament cannot, indeed, abdicate its functions, but within reasonable limits at any rate it can delegate its powers to the executive government. Such powers must necessarily be subject to determination at any time by Parliament, and needless to say the acts of the executive, under its delegated authority, must fall within the ambit of the legislative pronouncement by which its authority is measured.\nIt is true that Lord Dunedin, in the case referred to, said:\nThe British constitution has entrusted to the two Houses of Parliament, subject to the assent of the King an absolute power untrammelled by any written instrument, obedience to which may be compelled by some judicial body.\nThat, undoubtedly, is not the case in this country, which has its constitution founded in the Imperial statute, the \"British North America Act, 1867.\" I cannot, however, find anything in that Constitutional Act which, so far as material to the question now under consideration, would impose any limitation on the authority of the Parliament of Canada o which the Imperial Parliament is not subject.\nThe language of section 6 is admittedly broad enough to cover power to make regulations for the raising of military forces. That power is directly covered by the words\nsecurity, defence, peace, order and welfare. As Lord Halsbury said in Reil v. Reg.[11]:\nThese words are apt to authorize the utmost discretion of enactment for the attainment of the objects pointed to.\nBut it is said that the enumeration of several matters in section 6 of the \"War Measures Act\" limits the effect of the general power conferred. The answer to this objection, as urged by Mr. Newcombe, would appear to be 1st, that the statute itself expressly provides otherwise; and 2nd, that the reason for introducing specifications was that those specified subjects were more or less remote from those which were connected with the war, and it was therefore thought expedient to declare explicitly that the legislative power of the government could go even thus far. The decisions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council) under section 91 of the \"British North America Act,\" upon similar language exclude such limited interpretation. (See Lefroy, p. 119.)\nIt was also urged, at the argument, that the powers conferred by section 6 were not intended to authorize the Governor-in-council to legislate inconsistently with any existing statute, and particularly not so as to take away a right (the right of exemption) acquired under a statute. Here, again, Mr. Newcombe's answer appears to be conclusive. There is no difference between statute law and common law, and consequently if effect is given to that point the government would be denied any power to amend the law as a war measure, no matter how urgent or necessary that might be for public safety. Such an interpretation seems absurd and impossible. It seems to me obvious that parliament intended, as the language used implies, to clothe the executive with the widest powers in time of danger. Taken literally, the language of the section contains unlimited powers. Parliament expressly enacted that, when need arises, the executive may for the common defence make such orders and regulations as they may deem necessary or advisable for the security, peace, order and welfare of Canada. The enlightened men who framed that section, and the members of parliament who adopted it, were providing for a very great emergency, and they must be understood to have employed words in their natural sense, and to have intended what they have said. There is no doubt, in my opinion, that the regulation in question was passed to provide for the security and welfare of Canada and it is therefore intra vires of the statute under which it purports to be made.\nNow, I want to add a few observations. In August, 1914, the Empire was at war. De jure and de facto Canada and all the British dependencies were at war. There can be no doubt as to the individual liability at that time of all the male population of Canada between the ages of 18 and 60 for military service. It is so expressly declared by section 10 of the \"Militia Act,\" ch. 41, R.S.C. 1906. By section 25 of the same Act, the Governor-in-council is authorized to make regulations for the enrolment of persons liable for military service. That Act is merely a re-enactment with amendments of the \"Militia Act\" passed in 1868, immediately after Confederation\u201431 Vict. ch. 40. Section 69 of the \"Militia Act\" authorizes the Governor-in-council to place the militia on active service anywhere in Canada, and also beyond Canada, for the defence thereof. Of course, it is unnecessary to add that so long as Canada remains a part of the British Empire, the defence thereof may depend, as suggested by Sir Louis Davies, in the course of the argument, on the success of the military and naval operations carried on far beyond its borders. The main departure from the provisions of the \"Militia Act\" which the \"Military Service Act, 1917,\" was intended to introduce, is to be found in the recital in the latter Act that\nby reason of the large number of men who have already left agricultural and industrial pursuits in Canada to join such Expeditionary Force as volunteers, and of the necessity of sustaining under such conditions the productivity of the Dominion, it is expedient to secure the men still required, not by ballot as provided in the \"Militia Act,\" but by selective draft.\nWhen, in April of this year, the government came to the conclusion that it was necessary to cancel the exemptions granted under the \"Military Service Act\" of 1917, the effect of the order-in-council was really nothing but a return to the status under the \"Militia Act\" In force since Confederation, by which all are liable for service with the variations in the order of their calling out introduced by the Act of 1917.\nThere are obvious objections of a political character to the practice of executive legislation in this country because of local conditions. But these objections should have been urged when the regulations were submitted to parliament for its approval, or better still when the \"War Measures Act\" was being discussed. Parliament was the delegating authority, and it was for that body to put any limitations on the power conferred upon the executive. I am not aware that the authority to pass these regulations was questioned by a vote in either house. Our legislators were no doubt impressed in the hour of peril with the conviction that the safety of the country is the supreme law against which no other law can prevail. It is our clear duty to give effect to their patriotic intention.\nSir Louis Davies:\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin. Idington J. (dissenting)\u2014 The question raised herein is of a somewhat remarkable character.\nIn a brief session of the Dominion Parliament held in August, 1914, as a result of the declaration of war between the British Empire and Germany the \"War Measures Act, 1914,\" was duly passed and assented to on the 22nd of said month of August.\nSection 6, subsection 1, is as follows:\u2014\n6. The Governor-in-council shall have power to do and authorize such acts and things, and to make from time to time such orders and regulations, as he may by reason of the existence of real or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection, deem necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada; and for greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms, it is hereby declared that the powers of the Governor-in-council shall extend to all matters coming within the classes of subjects hereinafter enumerated, that is to say:\u2014\n(a) Censorship and the control and suppression of publications, writings, maps, plans, photographs, communications and means of communication;\n(b) Arrest, detention, exclusion and deportation;\n(c) Control of harbours, ports and territorial waters of Canada and the movements of vessels;\n(d) Transportation, by land, air or water and the control of the transport of persons and things;\n(e) Trading, exportation, importation, production and manufacture;\n(f) Appropriation, control, forfeiture and disposition of property and of the use thereof.\nBesides the sub-section 1 just quoted there was a subsection 2 which declared that all orders and regulations made under the said section should have the force of law, enforceable in such manner and by such courts, officers and authorities as the Governor-in-council might prescribe, and provided for variations and revocations by any subsequent order or regulation and then proceeded:\nBut if any order or regulation is varied, extended or revoked, neither the previous operation thereof nor anything duly done thereunder shall be affected thereby, nor shall any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued, accruing or incurred thereunder be affected by such variation, extension or revocation. The \"Militia Act\" by its many provisions gave a much wider scope for the operations of a government to be carried on by orders-in-council than the above quotation from the said section 6 of the \"War Measures Act\" indicates.\nMoreover, there were in the latter Act itself three other sections which gave unusual powers to the government each of which obviously furnished scope for the possible and indeed probable exercise of some such power as conferred by section 6 thereof.\nAll these and possibly cognate subjects by way of irrelevant details would give ample scope for the operation of the powers conferred by said section 6 beyond those somewhat crudely indicated in its s.s. (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) in subsection 1 thereof.\nAnd I have not a shadow of doubt that its widest conceivable operation within the minds of the legislators concerned was confined to subserving the purposes I have suggested. And I agree with such conception.\nIf any doubt could have existed relative to the scope of power conferred thereby it must have been regarding some minor details.\nFor the law relevant to government by order-in-council so far as directly connected with the war stood so till the session, of 1917 when the \"Military Service Act\" was enacted in consequence of it being discovered that the \"Militia Act\" as it then stood providing for drafting men by ballot might operate to the detriment of agricultural and industrial pursuits, and hence it was necessary to reconcile the imperative demands for more men with a system of conscription that might not press unduly upon the productive capacities of the Dominion.\nHence that Act was passed after reciting many reasons therefor of which the last was as follows:\u2014 And whereas by reason of the large number of men who have already left agricultural and industrial pursuits in Canada to join such Expeditionary Force as volunteers, and of the necessity of sustaining under such conditions the productivity of the Dominion, it is expedient to secure the men still required, not by ballot as provided in the \"Militia Act,\" but by selective draft.\nThat Act was as clearly intended to be an absolute and paramount code for carrying out its provisions in the way therein indicated and provided as anything which can be described or defined in the English language.\nLocal Tribunals, Appeal Tribunals, and a Central Appeal Judge were provided thereby and powers were again conferred upon the Governor-in-council to make regulations to secure the full effective and expeditious operation and enforcement of the Act.\nThe applicant Gray is a young farmer, unmarried, and a homesteader on land in Nipissing whereon he had done such settlement duties that he has some thirty-six acres in crop and no one to help him, and upon an appeal founded upon that situation, under the said Act, the Local Tribunal did not allow his claim for exemption, but upon an appeal taken to the Appeal Tribunal his claim was allowed, and at this moment he thereby stands exempt under said \"Military Service Act.\"\nAn appeal was taken by the military authorities to the Central Appeal Judge.\nPending that appeal, he has been, without his case having been disposed of by due process of law, seized and tried as an offender against neither the \"Militia Act,\" the \"Military Service Act,\" nor any other statute of his country unless he falls within an order-in-council dated 20th April last and alleged to have been passed by virtue of the said section 6 of the \"War Measures Act, 1914,\" which it is strongly argued before us overrides all the enactments in and regulations made under the \"Military Service Act\" to which I have adverted.\nReliance for such contention so far as I can understand the argument, is based solely upon the powers conferred by section 6 of the \"War Measures Act\" of 1917,\nto make from time to time such orders and regulations as he may by reason of the existence of real or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection deem necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada\ncoupled with the following subsection (5) of section 13 of the \"Military Service Act, 1917\":\u2014\nNothing in this Act contained shall be held to limit or affect the punishment provided by any other Act or law for the offence of assisting the enemy nor the powers of the Governor-in-council under the \"War Measures Act, 1914.\"\nThe fact that the order-in-council now in question was supported by a resolution of the two Houses of Parliament was very properly discarded by counsel for the Crown as failing to give any statutory efficacy thereto.\nThe bald proposition put forward in argument that notwithstanding the elaborate provisions of the \"Military Service Act\" evidently designed as a paramount code to govern the mode of selecting draftees under its provisions in substitution for the \"Militia Act\" and all therein contained was liable to be repealed or nullified by an order in council, I cannot accept.\nNor can I as a matter of law subscribe to any such doctrine as contained in the startling propositions put forward that it was quite competent for the Governor-in-council to have proceeded under the \"War Measures Act\" of 1914 not only independently of but to repeal and render inoperative all the provisions of the \"Military Service Act\" of 1917, and to substitute therefor what the Governor-in-council might \"deem necessary or advisable\" including therein the levy of such taxes as needed to meet such exigencies; and in short to govern the country according to such conceptions save and except the possibility of parliament being convened once a year and invited to act and seeing fit to revoke such orders.\nIndeed, I venture to think that such conceptions of law as within the realm of legislation assigned by the \"British North America Act\" to the Dominion have no existence.\nAs I understand the situation with which we in Canada are confronted by this war, there is no activity which the mental and physical energies of every member of the entire population come to mature years is capable of but should be made so far as possbile subservient to the success of our endeavours.\nThe several measures required to produce such results must be enacted by the Parliament of Canada in a due and lawful method according to our constitution and its entire powers thereunder cannot be by a single stroke of the pen surrendered or transferred to anybody.\nThe delegation of legislation in way of regulations may be very well resorted to in such a way as to be clearly understood as such, but a wholesale surrender of the will of the people to any autocratic power is exactly what we are fighting against.\nNot only as a matter of constitutional law, sanctified by all past history of our ancestors, and prevalent in the legislative enactments of he Mother Country, but as a matter of expediency I venture to submit such view should be our guide.\nThe \"Military Service Act, 1917,\" and section 6 of the \"War Measures Act\" are quite consistent if properly interpreted and construed as intended by parliament but are quite incompatible according to the argument presented and the last legislative expression of parliament from such point of view must govern else there is an end to parliamentary sanction.\nTest the matter of the question raised by supposing for a moment the quite conceivable case of a change of government having taken place after the \"Military Service Act\" had been passed, and the new government had desired to repeal it but possibly found the Senate bar the way, would the new men have dared to repeal it by an order-in-council under the \"War Measures Act\" of 1914? And suppose, further, they tried to do so and asked us by a reference for a judgment maintaining such an order-in-council what could we have said? I should in such a case answer just as I do now that the \"War Measures Act\" could not be so stretched nor our constitution stand such a strain as repeal of a single line of the \"Military Service Act\" by any such methods.\nI think the application should be granted.\nDuff J.\u2014The Governor-in-council shall have power\nto do and authorize such acts and things, and to make from time to time such orders and regulations, as he may by reason of the existence of real or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection, deem necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada.\nThese words constitute the first branch of the first subsection of section 6.\nThe words (I put aside for the moment any suggestion of qualifying context or substantive modifying enactment) are comprehensive enough to confer authority, for the duration of the war, to \"make orders and regulations\" concerning any subject falling within the legislative jurisdiction of parliament\u2014 subject only to the condition that the Governor-in- council shall deem such \"orders and regulations\" to be\nby reason of the existence of real or apprehended war, etc., advisable.\n\"Order\" is a proper term for describing an act of the Governor-in-council by which he exercises a lawmaking power, whether the power exist as part of the prerogative or devolve upon him by statute. (See 21 & 22 Vict., ch. 99, s. 2; Ruperts Land O. in C., 4 R.S.C. 57; B. C. O. in C., 4 R.S.C. 77 and 78; P.E.I. O. in C., 4 R.S.C. 87 and 88.)\n\"Regulation\" when used in such a collocation as found in the sentence excerpted above is broad enough to extend to any rule in relation to a particular subject matter laid down in exercise of such authority; and past all possible doubt is sufficient to embrace provisions of the kind ordained by the order-in-council of 20th April.\nIn Rex v. Halliday[12], it was held by the House of Lords that under a general power to\nissue regulations for securing the public safety and defence of the realm\na \"regulation\" could validly be \"issued\" authorizing the detention of persons without trial and without charge. The judgments of the Law Lords in Rex v. Halliday12, afford a conclusive refutation of the contention that a general authority to make \"orders and regulations\" for securing the public defence and safety and for like purposes is, as regards existing law resting on statute, limited to the functions of supplementing some legislative enactment or carrying it into effect and is not adequate for the purpose of supersession.\nThe authority conferred by the words quoted is a law-making authority, that is to say an authority (within the scope and subject to the conditions prescribed) to supersede the existing law whether resting on statute or otherwise; and since the enactment is always speaking, \"Interpretation Act,\" section 9, it is an authority to do so from time to time. It follows that unless the language of the first branch of section 6 is affected by a qualifying context or by subsequent statutory modification the order-in-council of the 20th April (the subject matter of which in the above expressed view is indisputably within the scope of the \"War Measures Act\") is authorized by it.\nThere is no qualifying context. There is in the second branch of the section an enumeration (an enumeration let it be said rather of groups of subjects which it appears to have been thought might possibly be regarded as. \"marginal instances\" as to which there might conceivably arise some controversy whether or not they fell within the first branch of the section) of particular subjects and a declaration that the powers thereby given to the Governor-in-council extended to these subjects, so enumerated; but there is also a declaration that this enumeration shall not have the effect of limiting the \"generality\" of the language of the first branch of the section\u2014the language quoted above. Thus the context, instead of qualifying the preceding language (the language quoted), emphasizes the comprehensive character of it and pointedly suggests the intention that the words are to be comprehensively interpreted and applied.\nIt is here convenient to note the argument so strongly pressed\u2014the argument of reductio ad absurdum \u2014that under this construction of section 6 the Governor-in-council acquired authority to repeal the \"Militia Act\" and pass by order-in-council provisions identical with the provisions of the \"Military Service Act,\" 1917. This, it is said, parliament could not conceivably have intended in August, 1914. The answer can be expressed in a sentence.\nIt is the function of a court of law to give effect to the enactments of the legislature according to the force of the language which the legislature has finally chosen for the purpose of expressing its intention. Speculation as to what may have been passing in the minds of the members of the legislature is out of place, for the simple reason that it is only the corporate intention so expressed with which the court is concerned. Besides that road\u2014the road of speculation\u2014 leads into a labyrinth where there is no guide.\nAmbiguous expressions may be interpreted in light of the general object of the enactment when that is known with certainty, and of the circumstances in which the enactment was passed, but subject to this the words of the statute must be construed in their natural sense.\nIt ought not, moreover, to be forgotten in passing upon this argument for a narrow construction, that this Act of Parliament supervened upon a decision which was the most significant, indeed the most revolutionary decision in the history of the country, namely \u2014that an Expeditionary Force of Canadian soldiers should take part in the war with Germany as actual combatants on the Continent of Europe; a decision which would entail, as everybody recognized, measures of great magnitude; requiring as a condition of swift and effective action, that extraordinary powers be possessed by the executive.\nIt is convenient also at this point to note the objection raised by Mr. Geoffrion, that accepting this construction of section 6 of the \"War Measures Act\" that enactment must be held to be ultra vires of the Dominion Parliament. It is a very extravagant description of this enactment to say that it professes (on any construction of it) to delegate to the Governor-in-council the whole legislative authority of parliament. The authority devolving upon the Governor-in-council is, as already observed, strictly conditioned in two respects: First \u2014It is exercisable during war only. Secondly\u2014The measures passed under it must be such as the Governor-in-council deems advisable by reason of war.\nThere is no attempt to substitute the executive for parliament in the sense of disturbing the existing balance of constitutional authority by aggrandizing the prerogative at the expense of the legislature. The powers granted could at any time be revoked and anything done under them nullified by parliament, which parliament did not, and for that matter could not, abandon any of its own legislative jurisdiction. The true view of the effect of this type of legislation is that the subordinate body in which the law-making authority is vested by it is intended to act as the agent or organ of the legislature and that the acts of the agent take effect by virtue of the antecedent legislative declaration (express or implied) that they shall have the force of law. Maitland's Constitutional History, pp. 1, 15 et seq.\nOur own Canadian constitutional history affords a striking instance of the \"delegation\" so called of legislative authority with which the devolution effected by the \"War Measures Act\" may usefully be contrasted. The North West Territories were, for many years, governed by a council exercising powers of legislation almost equal in extent to those enjoyed by the provinces.\nThe statute by which this was authorized, by which the machinery of responsible government, and what in substance was parliamentary government, was set up and maintained in that part of Canadian territory, was passed by the Parliament of Canada; and it was never doubted that this legislation was valid and effectual for these purposes under the authority conferred upon parliament by the Imperial Act of 1871\nto make provision for the administration, peace, order and good government in any territory not for the time being included in any province.\nThat, of course, involved a degree of devolution far beyond anything attempted by the \"War Measures Act.\" In the former case, while the legal authority remained unimpaired in parliament to legislate regarding the subjects over which jurisdiction had been granted, it was not intended that it should continue to be, and in fact it never was, exercised in the ordinary course; and the powers were conferred upon an elected body over which parliament was not intended to have, and never attempted to exercise, any sort of direct control. It was in a word strictly a grant (within limits) of local self government. In the case of the \"War Measures Act\" there was not only no abandonment of legal authority, but no indication of any intention to abandon control and no actual abandonment of control in fact, and the council on whom was to rest the responsibility for exercising the powers given was the Ministry responsible directly to Parliament and dependent upon the will of Parliament for the continuance of its official existence.\nThe point of constitutional incapacity seems indeed to be singularly destitute of substance.\nThe applicant does not point to any subsequent Act of Parliament by which the enactments of section 6 of the \"War Measures Act\" (in so far as they are now relevant) have been modified. A powerful argument might have been founded on the provisions of the \"Military Service Act\" of 1917, had it not been for sec. 13, sub-sec. 5 of that Act, by which it is provided that\nnothing in this Act contained shall be held to limit or affect * * * the powers of the Governor-in-council under the \"War Measures Act\" of 1914.\nHere Parliament appears to have anticipated and nullified in advance the contention now put forward that the provisions of the \"Military Service Act\" are exclusive as regards the subjects with which they deal and that the powers given by the \"War Measures Act\" in relation to these subjects were revoked in 1917.\nThe force of sub-section 5 as touching any controversy at present material, is not affected by anything to be found in sub-section 4. The last mentioned subsection deals with a particular subject matter only, the extent, namely, of the reinforcements to be provided under the \"Military Service Act.\" These, it is enacted by sub-section 4, shall not exceed one hundred thousand men\nunless further authorized by parliament.\nAssuming (without expressing any opinion upon the point) as Mr. Geoffrion contends, that the meaning of this sub-section is that the reinforcements to be provided under the Act shall not exceed the prescribed number in the absence of authority given by a new Act of Parliament; in other words, that as regards that particular subject matter the \"Military Service Act\" is not to be amended except by a new Act of Parliament to be passed for the purpose; assuming this, the provision is certainly an arresting one. It at once suggests that Parliament must have assumed the existence of some instrumentality for amending the Act it was passing other than a new Act of Parliament, this instrumentality being, of course, the authority created by the \"War Measures Act.\"\nSub-section 4 thus adds, if possible, to the force of the 5th sub-section, indicating as it does a conscious and deliberate acceptance by Parliament at the time (in 1917) of the view now put forward by the Crown concerning the scope of the powers granted by the \"War Measures Act.\"\nThis brief sketch is perhaps more than is strictly necessary to dispose of all the argument seriously advanced in support of the application.\nAnglin J.\u2014The applicant moved before me in chambers for a writ of Habeas Corpus ad subjiciendum under section 62 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\" He is in military custody awaiting sentence of a court martial for disobedience as a soldier to lawful orders of a superior officer. Such disobedience is declared to be an offence punishable by imprisonment for any term up to life by the \"Army Act\" (44 & 45 Vict., Imp., ch. 58, sec. 9; Manual of Military Law, 1914, pp. 370, 387) made part of the law of Canada by the \"Militia Act,\" R.S.C., ch. 41, sec. 62 and 74, and the \"Military Service Act, 1917,\" ch. 19, sec. 13. The \"commitment\" of the applicant is therefore \"in a criminal case\" under an Act of Parliament of Canada and is within section 62 of the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nBefore me in chambers and on the argument of yesterday before the full court, counsel for the applicant based their client's claim for discharge from military custody solely on the ground that he had been granted exemption under the \"Military Service Act, 1917,\" and that two orders-in-council of the 20th April, 1918 (Nos. 919 and 962) purporting to cancel or set aside exemptions so granted to men of Class A between the ages of 20 and 23 (which apply to him) are invalid. Counsel representing the Attorney-General frankly conceded that, if these impugned orders-in-council cannot be upheld, the applicant is entitled to his discharge. The issue is therefore clean cut and, while the circumstances of the two cases differ somewhat in points not material, is precisely that recently passed upon by the Supreme Court of Alberta in the case of Norman Earl Lewis. That court (Chief Justice Harvey dissenting) held the two orders-in-council to be ultra vires. As many thousands of young men throughout Canada, most of them already drafted and a considerable number of them already overseas or en route to Europe, are affected, the importance of the matter involved is obvious. It has occasioned much public excitement and unrest, and numerous applications for writs of habeas corpus are already pending in provincial courts. Under these circumstances it was obviously of great moment in the public interest that the question of the validity of these orders-in-council should be authoritatively determined by this court. I therefore readily acceded to the suggestion of Mr. Newcombe, in which Mr. Chrysler concurred, that I should follow the course taken by Mr. Justice Duff and approved of by the majority of this court in Re Richard[13], and subsequently sanctioned by Rule 72 of our Rules of Court, and, instead of myself dealing with the motion, should refer it to the court.\nThe doubt which exists as to the appealability of the order for discharge made by the Alberta court in the Lewis Case[14], the unavoidable delay that the taking of such an appeal (which solicitors for the respondent could scarcely be expected to expedite) might involve, the probability that if I should make a like order in the present case it would not be subject to appeal (sub-sec. 2 of sec. 62 gives a right of appeal to the court\nif the judge refuses the writ or remands the prisoner)\nand the fact that it could not be expected that a decision of a single judge of this court would be accepted as binding in the provincial courts seemed to me most cogent reasons for taking the course suggested, in view of Mr. Newcombe's assurance that it had been already arranged with the Chief Justice and the Acting Registrar that, should the reference be directed, a special session of the court to hear the motion would be called for an early date so that the applicant would not suffer the prejudice of any undue delay.\nAlthough some questions as to the case being within the section 62 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" and as to the right of the full court to deal with it were raised by two of my learned brothers during the course of the argument, for the reasons already stated I entertain no doubt upon either point.\nAgainst the validity of the orders-in-council it is urged (a) that Parliament cannot delegate its major legislative functions to any other body; (b) that it has not delegated to the Governor-in-council the right to legislate at all so as to repeal, alter or derogate from any statutory provision enacted by it; (c) that if such power has been conferred it can validly be exercised only when parliament is not in session.\n(a) The decision of the Judicial Committee in Powell v. Apollo Candle Co.[15], cited by Harvey C.J. in the Lewis Case[16], puts beyond doubt the sovereign character of colonial legislatures within the ambit of the legislative jurisdiction committed to them and the constitutionality of limited delegations of their legislative powers. Such delegations have been so frequent that it is almost a matter of surprise that their legality should now be considered open to question. A very common instance (sometimes regarded as conditional legislation) is the provision that a statute shall come into effect, if at all, in whole or in part on a day or days to be named by proclamation to be issued pursuant to an order-in-council. Here the limitation upon the extent of the powers delegated is found in the words of section 6 of the \"War Measures Act\" of 1914\nas he may by reason of the existence of real, or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection, deem necessary or advisable.\nTheir duration is expressly limited by section 3. A further limitation as to sanctions is imposed by section 11. As was said in the Apollo Case(1), at p. 291,\nthe legislature has not parted with its perfect control over the Governor and has the power, of course, at any moment, of withdrawing or altering the power which they have entrusted to him.\nIn Bank of Toronto v. Lambe[17], at p. 588, their Lordships of the Judicial Committee said\nThe Federal Act exhausts the whole range of legislative power.\nA complete abdication by Parliament of its legislative functions is something so inconceivable that the constitutionality of an attempt to do anything of the kind need not be considered. Short of such an abdication, any limited delegation would seem to be within the ambit of a legislative jurisdiction certainly as wide as that of which it has been said by incontrovertible authority that it is\nas plenary and as ample * * * as the Imperial Parliament in the plenitude of its powers possessed and could bestow.\nHodge v. the Queen[18];\nas large and of the same nature as those of the Imperial Parliament itself.\nThe Queen v. Barah[19]. I am of the opinion that it was within the legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada to delegate to the Governor-in-council the power to enact the impugned orders-in-council. To hold otherwise would be very materially to restrict the legislative powers of Parliament.\n(b) I am quite unable to appreciate the force of the argument based on the ejusdem generis rule. In opening, Mr. Chrysler rather disavowed invoking it. Mr. Geoffrion, however, appealed to it and in his brief reply Mr. Chrysler appeared to insist upon its application. If this rule of construction would otherwise have governed, its application to section 6 of the \"War Measures Act\" of 1914 is clearly excluded by the words which precede the enumeration of the specified subjects, namely\nfor greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms, it is hereby declared, etc.\nThe same language is found in section 91 of the \"B.N.A. Act\" and I have never heard it suggested that the residuary powers of Parliament under the general terms of that section\nto make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada\nare restricted to matters and things ejusdem generis with the subjects enumerated in its succeeding clauses, or, as Mr. Chrysler put his argument on this branch in opening, that the specified subjects should be regarded as illustrative of the classes of matters to which the application of the preceding general terms should be confined. Rather, I think, as put by Mr. Newcombe and Mr. Tilley, the specification should be deemed to be of cases in which there might be such doubt as to whether they fell within the ambit of the general terms\u2014wide as they are,\u2014that ex abundanti cautel\u00e2 it was safer to mention them specifically. Mr. Justice Beck in the Lewis Case[20] appears to have appreciated that this was the purpose of the words \"for greater certainty, etc,\" yet by some mental process that I am unable to follow, after saying:\nThe enumeration of the particular subjects of jurisdiction is obviously made in order to remove doubts which might possibly arise as to whether or not the particularized subjects would fall within the general statement of the subjects of jurisdiction,\nhe proceeds to add that\nSuch an enumeration of particular subjects * * * must necessarily be taken as interpretative and illustrative of the general words, which must consequently be interpreted as intended to comprise only such subjects, in addition to those particularly specified, as fall within a generic class of which the specified instances are illustrative and definitive of the general characteristics of the class,\nand he makes a strict application of the ejusdem generis rule, thereby excluding the making of orders for the enlistment of certain men exempt under the \"Military Service Act, 1917,\" as to which, whatever else may be said of them, there cannot be a shadow of doubt that they were made\nby reason of the existence of real * * * war,\nand because\ndeemed necessary or advisable for the security, defence and welfare of Canada.\nThe very purpose of inserting the words\nfor greater certainty, but not so as to restrict the generality of the foregoing terms\nwould appear to have been to insure the exclusion of the rule of construction under consideration.\nThe terms of section 6, the generality of which is not restricted, are\nto do and authorize such acts and things and to make from time to time such orders and regulations as he may by reason of the existence of real or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection deem necessary or advisable for the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada.\nMore comprehensive language it would be difficult to find. The corresponding terms of the \"B.N.A. Act,\" section 91, are to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada in relation, etc.\n\"Welfare\" is substituted for \"good government\" and \"security, defence\" are added in section 6 of the \"War Measures Act.\" In some constitutional Acts, for instance the \"New South Wales Constitution Act,\" we find the word \"welfare\" used with \"good government\" as a substitute for the word order. To introduce such a limitation as that suggested by Mr. Justice Beck and approved of by some of his colleagues would therefore appear to me to be to fly in the teeth of the very words of the Act of Parliament itself.\nParliament by express recital in the \"Military Service Act, 1917,\" declares that the Canadian Expeditionary Force is engaged in active service\nfor the defence and security of Canada,\nand that it is necessary to provide reinforcements to maintain and support it. The position taken by counsel for the Attorney-General, that the orders-in-council fall within the very terms of section 6 of the \"War Measures Act,\" as orders made for the security and defence of Canada, therefore has statutory sanction.\nNor does the use of the term \"orders and regulations\" present any serious difficulty. No doubt \"regulations\" is a term usually employed to describe provisions of an ancillary or subordinate nature which the executive, or a Minister, or some subordinate body is empowered to make to facilitate the carrying out of a statute. But, coupled with the word \"orders,\" (which, as used here, seems to me clearly to mean orders-in-council) and employed to connote provisions to be made\nfor the security, defence, peace, order and welfare of Canada,\nit has necessarily and obviously a more comprehensive signification, it was used no doubt because the Governor-in-council usually acts by making orders or regulations. \"Ordinances\" might have been a more apt expression; but the context leaves no room for doubt that it was intended to confer the power to pass legislative enactments such as should be deemed necessary or advisable by reason of\nreal or apprehended war, invasion or insurrection,\nwhich is declared by a definitive clause of the \"Militia Act\" to establish an \"emergency.\"\nNo doubt the amendment of a statute or the taking away of privileges enjoyed or acquired under the authority of a statute by order-in-council is an extreme exercise of the power of the Governor-in-council to make orders and regulations of a legislative character; but the very statute, the operation of which is affected by the orders now in question, contains a provision, not found we are told in the original draft and apparently inserted for the purpose of expressing the acquiescence of Parliament in such a use being made of the power which it had conferred on the Governor-in-council by the \"War Measures Act.\" By sub-sec. 5 of sec. 13 of the \"Military Service Act\" it is provided that\nnothing in this Act contained shall be held to limit or affect * * * the powers of the Governor-in-council under the \"War Measures Act\" of 1.914.\nThe very presence of this sub-section in the \"Military Service Act, 1917,\" imports that under the power conferred on the Governor-in-council by the \"War Measures Act,\" orders and regulations might be made with the validity of which, but for it, some provisions of the \"Military Service Act\" might be deemed to interfere. It carries confirmation of the view that the scope of the powers conferred by the \"War Measures Act\" was wide enough to embrace matters dealt with by the \"Military Service Act\" and it puts beyond question, in my opinion, the purpose of Parliament to enable the Governor-in-council, in cases of emergency, as defined, to exercise the powers granted by section 6 of the \"War Measures Act\" even to the extent of modifying or repealing, at least in part, the \"Military Service Act\" itself. The immediate juxtaposition of sub-sec. 4 to sub-sec. 5 of sec. 13, as was pointed out by Mr. Newcombe, serves to emphasize the significance of the latter and to make it certain that its purview and operation did not escape the notice of Parliament.\nThe provision of sub-sec. 2 of sec. 6 of the \"War Measures Act\" was also relied upon as affording an indication that Parliament did not mean to confer upon the Governor-in-council power to repeal statutes in whole or in part. Sub-section 2 is probably only declaratory of what would have been the law applicable had it not been so expressed. Parliament, however, thought it necessary to express such powers in regard to its control over its own statutes. (Sections 18 to 19 of the \"Interpretation Act,\" R.S.C., ch. 1.) I fail to find in the presence of this clause anything warranting a court in cutting down such clear and unambiguous language as is found in the first paragraph of section 6 of the \"War Measures Act.\"\nAgain, it is contended that should section 6 of the \"War Measures Act\" be construed as urged by counsel for the Crown, the powers conferred by it are so wide that they involve serious danger to our Parliamentary institutions. With such a matter of policy we are not concerned. The exercise of legislative functions such as those here in question by the Governor-in-council rather than by Parliament is no doubt something to be avoided as far as possible. But we are living in extra- ordinary times which necessitate the taking of extraordinary measures. At all events all we, as a court of justice, are concerned with is to satisfy ourselves what powers Parliament intended to confer and that it possessed the legislative jurisdiction requisite to confer them. Upon both these points, after giving to them such consideration as has been possible, I entertain no doubt, and, but for the respect which is due to the contrary opinion held by the majority of the learned judges of the Supreme Court of Alberta, I should add that there is, in my opinion, no room for doubt.\nIt has also been urged that such wide powers are open to abuse. This argument has often been presented and as often rejected by the courts as affording no sufficient reason for holding that powers, however wide, if conferred in language admitting of no doubt as to the purpose and intent of the legislature, should be restricted. In this connection reference may be made with advantage to the observations of their Lordships in delivering the judgment of the House of Lords in The King v. Halliday[21]. As Lord Dunedin there said:\nThe danger of abuse is theoretically present; practically, as things exist, it is, in my opinion, absent.\nAs Lord Atkinson observed:\nHowever precious the personal liberty of the subject may be, there is something for which it may well be, to some extent, sacrificed by legal enactment, namely, national success in the war, or escape from national plunder or enslavement. It is not contended in this case that the personal liberty of the subject can be invaded arbitrarily at the mere whim of the executive. What is contended is that the executive has been empowered during the war, for paramount objects of State, to invade by legislative enactment that liberty in certain states of fact.\n(c) It may be open to doubt whether Parliament had in mind when enacting the \"War Measures Act\" that legislative enactments such as those now under consideration should be passed by the Governor-in-council acting under it while Parliament itself should be actually in session. We can only determine the intention of Parliament, however, by the language in which it has been expressed. The terms of section 6 of the \"War Measures Act\" are certainly wide enough to cover orders-in-council made while Parliament is in session as well as when it stands prorogued. The fact that in the present case a resolution was adopted by both Houses of Parliament approving of the orders-in-council, while it does not add anything to their legal force as enactments, makes it abundantly clear that no attempt was made in this instance to take advantage of the powers conferred by section 6 of the \"War Measures Act\" to pass legislation without the concurrence and approval of parliament.\nFor the foregoing reasons I am of the opinion that the motion for habeas corpus must be refused. But, having regard to the fact that this has been made a test case and to its criminal character, there should, in my opinion, be no order as to costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Idington.\n[1] [1916] 1 K.B. 738; [1917] A.C. 260.\n[2] [1897] A.C. 238.\n[3] 15 App. Cas. 506.\n[4] 13 Alta.

Taschereau K.C. and Fabre Surveyer K.C. for the appellants.\nBelcourt K.C. and St. Laurent K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an action to set aside a will as fraudulent.\nThe testator, Edouard Voisard, was a farmer and a bachelor. He died on the 11th September, 1915, at the age of 76, shortly after meeting with a serious accident. He left an estate valued at about $40,000. At the time of his death, he had, living with him, his nephew, Narcisse Voisard, and two old women named Louise and Olivine Lescadre. These women, who were sisters, had kept house for him, and his father before him, for many years.\nIn answer to the inquiries of the relatives who attended the funeral, Louise Lescadre said that she knew of no will made by the deceased. But four days later she produced a holograph will dated 15th August, 1915, which she said she had found under the mattress of the deceased's bed. This will, which was proved on the 29th September, 1915, is the one now sought to be set aside.\nAt the trial documents admittedly in the handwriting of the testator and of Louise Lescadre respectively were put in for the purpose of comparison. Mr. Justice Drouin, by whom the case was tried, observes that the writings of the testator shew him to have been a man of education, capable of expressing himself correctly, whilst in the will we find:\u2014\nune ignare mani\u00e8re de dire, une orthographe pleine d'incorrections et une \u00e9criture bien inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la sienne.\nAnd, comparing the writing of Louise Lescadre with that of the will, he says:\u2014\nLa similitude est tellement frappante et probante qu'elle saute aux yeux des moins experts;\nand further:\u2014\nla physionomie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'\u00e9criture est aussi parfaitement la m\u00eame que diff\u00e9rente de celle des \u00e9crits prouv\u00e9s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 faits par Edouard Voisard.\nThe learned judge also says that as a witness Louise Lescadre shewed herself unworthy of credit, and he concludes that the will in its entirety was composed and written by her. The Court of King's Bench reversed the judgment, Cross and Carroll JJ. dissenting.\nMr. Justice Pelletier, who delivered the judgment of the majority of the court, admits, as every one necessarily must, that at first sight a comparison of the handwritings is most convincing in favour of the appellant's theory. But, he says:\u2014\nSi le proc\u00e9d\u00e9 de la comparaison des \u00e9critures n'est pas infaillible, y a-t-il au dossier, dans l'ensemble, la preuve suffisante pour maintenir l'action.\nIt must, indeed, be admitted that proof by comparison of handwriting is not infallible. But, where it is so certain, as the trial judge has found, it must have great weight. For, in many cases, what other evidence of forgery could be made? Evidence in support of or against it can, however, of course, be offered.\nCounsel for the respondent strenuously argued that \"under the law governing proof in the Province of Quebec, the testimony of experts in handwriting by comparison is not recognised or admitted.\" And in support of this general proposition, reference was made to Paige v. Ponton[1]; Desch\u00e9nes v. Langlois[2]; Banque Nationale v. Tremblay[3]. The same objection must exist to all opinion evidence, whether it be medical testimony or that of a chemist, engineer or other scientist, and the disastrous results that would necessarily follow from the adoption of such a principle must be obvious to all who are concerned with the administration of justice. This objection, cannot, in my opinion, be maintained in view of the provisions of articles 1204, 1205 and 1224 of the Civil Code. The language of article 1205 seems wide enough to include evidence of handwriting experts. True, it is merely opinion evidence, but if given by honest and competent persons, it must be of assistance to the court. And, in a case of this sort, it is difficult to see how the alleged forgery could be exposed except by experts and competent opinion evidence. The rule contended for by the respondent would, I repeat, frequently be a serious obstacle in the administration of justice, and, as was recently said:\u2014\nit would, if adopted, create unlimited opportunities for designing persons to forge the name of deceased persons to important documents and then swear it through.\nIf the cases relied upon at the argument are carefully examined, it will be seen that they afford no support for the respondent's somewhat startling proposition. The judges who sat in these cases merely say that the evidence of an expert will be given weight according to the reasons given in support of it. In Paige v. Ponton[4], Sanborn J. says, at p. 158:\u2014\nThere is, undoubtedly, great uncertainty in the proof of writing whether by general knowledge of handwriting or by experts; but, it is difficult to see why proof from comparison is less objectionable in principle than proof from having acquired a knowledge of a person's writing, by forming a standard in the mind from having frequently seen the person write.\nThis is not very illuminating. Then the learned judge concludes by saying:\u2014\nI find nothing in the expression of opinion by judges who have dissented from the rule of the old law indicating that a writing could be solely proved by comparison of a disputed writing with a genuine by experts. It has been urged merely that it might supplement weak proof of the writing by strictly legitimate means; I do not think that alone it is plenary.\nThe headnote of that case is:\u2014\nThe signature to writing which is forged cannot be proved solely by comparison of the disputed signature with other signatures which are admitted or proved to be genuine,\nand in Desch\u00e9nes v. Langlois,[5] Boss\u00e9 J. said (p. 390):\u2014 Les raisons que les hommes de l'art donnent pour soutenir leurs opinions peuvent \u00eatre d'un grand secours et aider puissamment l'avocat comme le juge \u00e0 remplir son minist\u00e8re; mais, il ne faudrait pas aller au-del\u00e0 et adopter une th\u00e9orie scientifique contrairement aux r\u00e8gles ordinaires de la raison.\nI am of the opinion that the learned trial judge was guided by this principle in the appreciation of the evidence in this case.\nIt is quite true that expert evidence under modern practice is rapidly becoming of little value for any judicial purpose, because even men of the highest character and integrity are apt to be prejudiced in favour of the party by whom they are employed, and that the better procedure is that prescribed by the ordinance of 1667 and still followed in France. The court should, whenever necessary, appoint upon application of either party or of its own motion disinterested experts, to be procured and paid in such a way as to secure their freedom from bias as in the case provided for in articles 392 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure. But those articles do not apply to a case like this; no such application was made, and here the evidence was taken without objection. I would add that the difference between the admittedly genuine signature of the deceased and the signature to the will is so obvious that any one at all familiar with handwriting could readily discover it, and we can make the comparison for ourselves.\nThe handwriting of the will, the language in which the testator's intentions are expressed, together with the suspicious circumstances connected with the production of the will by Louise Lescadre, lead me to the same conclusion as Mr. Justice Drouin. And, as he had the inestimable advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses, I have no hesitation in saying that we are practically bound to accept his finding. There seem to be two main reasons for the judgment now under appeal. First, the improbability of dishonesty in this old servant of the deceased; and second, the comparative smallness of the benefit which she takes under the will.\nAs to the first, it must be noted that it was not a question in any event of dishonesty towards her late master personally, whose wishes she might indeed have thought she was furthering if she did write the will. Towards his relatives other than his nephew and legatee, Narcisse Voisard, it is certain that she entertained no friendly feelings.\nAs regards the second reason, it must have been obvious to Louise Lescadre that to have appropriated the whole or great part of the property would have afforded grounds of suspicion against the will. The testator had years before brought his nephew, the respondent, from California to live with him, and the respondent was still residing with and helping him to work his farm at the time of his death. It may be well supposed that in view of their long service, the testator would have desired to make some provision for Louise Lescadre and her sister after his own death; but there was certainly no reason why he should do-more than make a reasonable provision, such indeed it might well be as is made by the will. It would have been highly improbable that he would have left to them the bulk of his estate to the exclusion of his nephew and other relatives, with all of whom he appears to have been on good if not intimate terms.\nI think, moreover, one requires to consider the point of view of such a person as Louise Lescadre, placed in the position in which she was. Obviously the case would be entirely different from that of the common criminal and professional forger. She would never have thought of or desired fortune. She is one of those of whom it is said: \"Their wants but few, their wishes all confined.\" Would she not have been most likely to put into the will what she had hoped her master would have done himself? She and her sister had lived thirty years in the house, and would wish to remain there with the succeeding member of the family to the end of their lives. She already had a little money of her own, and with the legacy of $1,200 probably she would have all she required. In giving the property to the member of the family best entitled to it, and in making such provision for herself and her sister as she doubtless considered herself entitled to, she might not unlikely persuade herself that she was merely giving effect to the testator's intentions. This, I think, is the most probable explanation of her action.\nJudge Pelletier states that he has given the case much time and attention, as is indeed apparent from the elaborate judgment in which he has set forth the reasons for the conclusion at which he has arrived. Certainly I have not come to an opposite conclusion without devoting to the matter most careful consideration, realising as I do its importance, not merely on account of the value of the property at stake, but because of the serious reflections on the respondent which my judgment necessarily involves.\nI would allow the appeal.\nDavies J. (dissenting)\u2014The question to be determined in this appeal is the validity or otherwise of the holographic will of the late Edouard Voisard, a farmer residing in the Province of Quebec, dated the 3rd day of August, 1915. The will was duly probated on the 29th September, 1915; and these facts which are important for our decision with regard to the deceased, namely, his relations towards Louise Lescadre, the alleged forger, his fortune, his relatives and his condition of life, etc., stated herein, are either admitted or not denied. His death took place on the 11th September, 1915. At the time of his death Voisard was 76 years old and a bachelor. Some short time before he had been gored by his bull, which, it is alleged, had seriously injured him and had probably hastened his death. He had been all his lifetime a farmer and lived on and cultivated the land devised in the will in question here. Louise Lescadre and Olivine Lescadre had been in his service and that of his father before him, one for thirty years and the other for forty years, receiving no salary beyond board, lodging and clothing. Narcisse Voisard, the respondent, universal legatee under the will in question, was testator's favourite nephew and had been brought back from California by the testator some six or seven years prior to his death to live with him and to look after the cultivation of the land, with the understanding that he was to be the testator's universal legatee. The testator had no relatives other than Narcisse Voisard except a number of nephews and nieces, all of whom lived in the United States or other distant places \"and with whom the testator had little or no communication and in whom he took little or no interest. The trial judge declared that the will in question was false in its entirety and consequently null; but on appeal to the Court of King's Bench this judgment was reversed and the action dismissed with costs.\nAt the conclusion of the argument before us, I confess I entertained grave doubts. That the testator made a will and made it upon blue paper just as that now produced before us as his genuine will, I have no doubt whatever. The evidence of Pageau and Fran\u00e7ois Beland satisfies me upon that point.\nThe former states that he went to testator's house some time before his death, in the evening, about eight o'clock, and found him at his table writing; and asking him what he was writing was told he was making his will.\nThe other witness, Beland, speaks of a conversation he had with the deceased on the 11th of August, which would be six days after the date of the will produced and three weeks before the testator's death, in which the deceased Voisard told him that he had made a will and shewed the witness a blue sheet of paper which he said contained his will. Upon being shewn the will in dispute he said that the paper which Voisard shewed him was a paper similar in colour to that on which the will now before us was written.\nThen again there is the evidence that some time before his death he went to his notary and asked him whether he could make or write his will himself and was told he could.\nThe fact that he was carrying about his will with him in his pocket supports the contention that he did not put it with his other papers in his box, presumably because he did not want others to read it or know its contents, and for the same reason that in his last sickness he placed it under one of the mattresses of his bed, where he knew it would be found and where Louise Lescadre, the alleged forger, says she found it when making up his bed after the death or funeral.\nThese facts, coupled with the admission on all sides that in the circumstances under which the deceased lived, he possessed of a fortune of about $40,000, his will was not an unreasonable or unnatural one in any respect, assist partly in convincing me that the document produced as his will and found, as she says, by Louise Lescadre under the mattress after the funeral is the genuine will of the testator and not a forged document, as contended. The majority of the Court of King's Bench, consisting of the Chief Justice and of Lavergne and Pelletier JJ. have so found; and in my present state of mind I do not feel justified in finding Louise Lescadre guilty of the crimes of forgery, perjury and destroying a genuine will.\nThe only benefit she takes under the will is the sum of $1,200; and it was not contended that that sum was excessive, or more than she reasonably might have expected him to leave her for the care she had taken of him in his lifetime and of his father before him. The only possible motive which counsel could suggest for the forgery charged was this bequest of $1,200 to Louise Lescadre, the alleged forger. In view of the value of testator's estate and of the services she had rendered him for a period of over thirty years, this legacy cannot be held to be unreasonable. It is, on the contrary, such a legacy as an honourable man possessing the estate he had at his death would, under the circumstances, make.\nI admit there are some strong arguments in favour of reaching the conclusion that the will was a forgery. The trial judge so found and Cross and Carroll JJ. dissented from the judgment of the majority of the Court of King's Bench and agreed with the conclusions of the trial judge.\nI was strongly impressed during the argument with the contention that the signature of the witness to the will produced was the geniune signature of Louise Lescadre and her statement that it was not and that her signature had been written there by the deceased, who told her that he was making his will and that he would put her name as a witness, was untrue. The photograph of the will, which the appellant produced, rather confirmed that contention; but an examination of the will itself convinces me that the photograph copy was greatly misleading and shewed a different colour in the ink used in the witness' name and that used in the deceased's own name, which difference was not apparent at all in the will itself, and was greatly calculated to mislead and did for a time mislead me.\nThe two expert witnesses called by the appellant gave what seemed to me plausible reasons for their conclusion that the signature to the will in dispute was not the same as the genuine signature produced on the documents produced in the evidence. I confess that at one time I shared their opinion; but it must be remembered that such expert evidence as was given at the trial was not evidence which, as a rule, should have very great weight attached to it and none at all if at variance with controlling facts proved. The admissibility of this evidence was challenged by Mr. Belcourt; but I do not consider it necessary to give any opinion on his objection and treat the evidence as properly admitted. It must be remembered, however, in weighing the opinions of these experts and the reasons for them, that Voisard, who at the time of the making of the disputed will was about 76 years of age, had a few weeks before been gored by his bull and had suffered in consequence somewhat in health. It was not unfairly urged that this would account for some slight want of firmness in the writing of the signature to the disputed will. The signatures to the genuine documents appear certainly more firm and in the formation of a few of the letters a difference appears between the genuine signatures and the disputed one; but making every proper allowance for these slight differences, after examining for myself the several admitted genuine signatures most carefully and comparing them with the disputed signature to the will, I find myself unable to conclude that this signature to the disputed will is not a genuine one.\nWeighing all the evidence most carefully, I am not satisfied that the findings of fact of the appeal court are wrong and am glad to find myself able to dismiss the appeal, and so amongst other things preserve to Narcisse Voisard, the absolutely innocent universal legatee, the just fruits of the property devised to him.\nIdington J.\u2014This appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored.\nI agree with the reasons he assigned therefor as well as in the main with those respectively assigned by the learned judges dissenting in the court of appeal. What seems to me above all else should be held as an insuperable barrier in the respondent's way of maintaining the judgment in appeal is her repeated denials of the existence of such a will when interrogated on the subject of the existence of any will after the death of the alleged testator when the circumstances confronting her constituted an imperative demand to assert the truth. If what she now says was the truth she could have no just reason for withholding it from somebody. She is not, like some persons who may accidentally have found a testator's will in a most unexpected place and thus discovered it for the first time.\nShe professes to have seen it written and signed and to have known all about it.\nThe learned trial judge was not impressed with her veracity at the trial. He had, in seeing her and hearing her story in the witness-box, an advantage over any appellate court and his judgment should not, I most respectfully submit, have been disturbed to give effect to such a marvellous and I submit an incredible tale.\nAnglin J.\u2014After full consideration of all the evidence and the most critical examination of the handwriting of the alleged will and the most careful comparison of it with the many admittedly genuine samples of the writing of the deceased in the record of which I am capable, I am very clearly of the opinion that the alleged will propounded is not in the handwriting of the late Edouard Voisard. The question is purely one of fact. To detail the grounds on which my conclusion rests would serve no good purpose.\nI may add, however, that I entertain no doubt as to the admissibility of the evidence of the witnesses called as experts in handwriting challenged by Mr. Belcourt.\nI would allow the appeal in this court and in the Court of King's Bench and would restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Nous avons \u00e0 d\u00e9cider dans cette cause si le testament d'Edouard Voisard est vrai ou faux. Afin de d\u00e9terminer ce point, il est bon de rappeler la situation des parties et les circonstances dans lesquelles ce testament aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait.\nEdouard Voisard, le testateur, \u00e9tait un riche cultivateur de la paroisse de la Rivi\u00e8re du Loup. Il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s \u00e2g\u00e9, ayant atteint pr\u00e8s de quatre-vingts ans. Vivaient avec lui depuis au-del\u00e0 de trente ans deux m\u00e9nag\u00e8res, deux s\u0153urs du nom de Lescadre. L'une appel\u00e9e Louise avait \u00e9t\u00e9 institutrice et avait par cons\u00e9quent une certaine \u00e9ducation. Elles \u00e9taient toutes les deux consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme membres de la famille, vu qu'elles ne recevaient aucun salaire. Edouard Voisard avait des neveux et des ni\u00e8ces; il ne para\u00eet pas avoir de s\u0153urs ni de fr\u00e8res vivants. Ces neveux et ces ni\u00e8ces \u00e9taienl assez indiff\u00e9rents \u00e0 son endroit. Par contre, il y avait un neveu du nom de Narcisse Voisard, le d\u00e9fendeur dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, qu'il paraissait affectionner puisqu'il l'a fait revenir de Californie pour rester avec lui et exploiter ses fermes. Narcisse Voisard est un homme assez \u00e2g\u00e9, d\u00e9passant la soixantaine, et para\u00eet \u00eatre un homme extr\u00eamement paisible et jouissant d'un excellent caract\u00e8re. La r\u00e9putation de Narcisse Voisard et des m\u00e9nag\u00e8res \u00e9tait excellente \u00e0 tous \u00e9gards.\nDans le cours de l'\u00e9t\u00e9 de 1915 Edouard Voisard eut un accident qui l'a emp\u00each\u00e9 de travailler pendant quelque temps. Cependant il continuait de sortir et de vaquer \u00e0 ses affaires. Mais apr\u00e8s quelques heures seulement de maladie grave il mourait le 11 septembre 1915.\nLes neveux et les ni\u00e8ces viennent \u00e0 ses fun\u00e9railles et le jour m\u00eame ils envoient l'un d'eux pour demander s'il y avait un testament. Il me para\u00eet \u00e9vident que Narcisse Voisard ne savait pas qu'il y e\u00fbt un testament, car on le voit lui-m\u00eame aller s'enqu\u00e9rir chez le notaire pour savoir si son oncle avait \u00e9crit ses derni\u00e8res volont\u00e9s.\nD'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, Louise Lescadre, l'une des m\u00e9nag\u00e8res, savait qu'il y avait un testament; cependant quand le repr\u00e9sentant de la famille est all\u00e9 lui demander s'il y en avait elle aurait r\u00e9pondu, d'apr\u00e8s son t\u00e9moignage, qu'il n'y avait pas de testament en sa faveur, \u00e0 elle.\nElle a \u00e9t\u00e9 un peu vex\u00e9e de voir que ces neveux et ces ni\u00e8ces, qui n'avaient jamais pris int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 leur oncle, qui ne le visitaient qu'\u00e0 de rares intervalles, s'empressent en foule quelques jours apr\u00e8s pour s'emparer des documents, pi\u00e8ces, etc., qui se trouvaient dans la maison; et elle explique que c'est cette conduite de leur part qui l'a incit\u00e9e \u00e0 ne pas leur dire de suite toute la verit\u00e9. A tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, elle pr\u00e9tend que le samedi suivant les fun\u00e9railles d'Edouard Voisard elle a trouv\u00e9 le testament produit en cette cause sous la paillasse du lit de la chambre du d\u00e9funt.\nPar ce testament, Edouard Voisard l\u00e9guait ses biens \u00e0 son neveu Narcisse Voisard et il donnait en m\u00eame temps une somme de douze cents piastres ($1,200) \u00e0 Louise Lescadre et exprimait le d\u00e9sir de la voir toujours rester avec son neveu. Il chargeait en m\u00eame temps son neveu de donner une bonne pension \u00e0 l'autre m\u00e9nag\u00e8re, Olivine, tant qu'elle vivrait, il faisait en outre un legs de deux cents piastres ($200) \u00e0 une ni\u00e8ce, Emma Lambert, donnait une maison \u00e0 Edouardina Voisard, une autre ni\u00e8ce, et d\u00e9clarait en outre dans le testament qu'il devait une somme \u00e0 Louise Lescadre qui \u00e9tait marqu\u00e9e dans son livre.\nLes dispositions de ce testament sont extr\u00eamement raisonnables et extr\u00eamement justes. Il n'est pas \u00e9tonnant que le testateur ait institu\u00e9 l\u00e9gataire universel de ses biens ce neveu qu'il affectionnait d'une mani\u00e8re tonte particuli\u00e8re et qu'il avait fait venir des Etats-Unis six ou sept ans auparavant pour vivre avec lui. Il n'est pas \u00e9tonnant non plus qu'il ait donn\u00e9 quelque-chose, et cependant c'est bien peu de chose, \u00e0 ses vieilles m\u00e9nag\u00e8res, qui avaient pass\u00e9 toute leur vie avec lui et qui l'avaient non-seulement servi lui-m\u00eame, mais m\u00eame son p\u00e8re. Il n'est pas \u00e9tonnant, non plus, qu'il n'ait pas pourvu particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 ses nombreux neveux et ni\u00e8ces, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le fait que ces derniers avaient paru \u00eatre assez indiff\u00e9rents \u00e0 son sort.\nEn m\u00eame temps, il faut dire aussi que la preuve me para\u00eet bien certaine qu'il y a eu un testament de fait. Dans le mois d'ao\u00fbt 1915, c'est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 ce testament a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit, un de ses grands amis, un voisin, \u00e9tant all\u00e9 le voir un soir, le trouva \u00e0 \u00e9crire quelque chose. Sa m\u00e9nag\u00e8re, Louise Lescadre, \u00e9tait alors \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de lui et Edouard Voisard de d\u00e9clarer qu'il \u00e9tait \u00e0 faire son testament. Cette preuve me para\u00eet irr\u00e9futable et a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e par une personne dont la respectabilit\u00e9 et l'honorabilit\u00e9 ne font pas de doute.\nMais il y a plus. Vers le m\u00eame temps, Voisard va au village, chez une connaissance, et cette derni\u00e8re de lui dire en badinant qu'elle esp\u00e9rait qu'il ne l'oublierait pas sur son testament: et alors l'autre aurait dit: \"Mon testament est fait\"; et il aurait sorti de sa poche un papier bleu\u00e2tre en lui disant: \"Le voici.\" La couleur de ce papier correspond absolument \u00e0 celle du papier sur lequel le testament en question est \u00e9crit. Il a dit la m\u00eame chose aussi \u00e0 Arthur Lacerte.\nIl n'y a donc pas de doute, suivant moi, qu'il y a eu un testament de fait. Maintenant, est-ce celui que nous avons devant nous?\nPlusieurs t\u00e9moins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus dans cette cause: et quelques-uns, qui connaissaient bien la signature d'Edouard Voisard, disent que ce testament n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par lui.\nEn m\u00eame temps, le demandeur a produit au dossier une lettre de Louise Lescadre et une lettre \u00e9crite par Edouard Voisard. Plusieurs re\u00e7us qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s par Edouard Voisard ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits \u00e9galement. Mais les documents les plus importants pour \u00e9tablir la comparaison des \u00e9critures sont certainement la lettre de Louise Lescadre et celle d'Edouard Voisard.\nLa pr\u00e9tention des demandeurs appelants, c'est que le testament est \u00e9crit enti\u00e8rement de la main de Louise Lescadre; et je suis port\u00e9 \u00e0 croire, apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 avec soin ces pi\u00e8ces et avoir lu la preuve avec une attention toute particuli\u00e8re, que leur pr\u00e9tention est bien fond\u00e9e.\nSur le testament le nom de Louise Lescadre appara\u00eet comme t\u00e9moin. Elle a pr\u00e9tendu que ce n'\u00e9tait pas sa signature cependant, mais que le testateur, Edouard Voisard, en finissant d'\u00e9crire son testament lui aurait demand\u00e9 si elle avait objection \u00e0 \u00eatre t\u00e9moin du testament et il aurait simplement mis son nom.\nPour moi, il n'y a pas de doute que la signature qu'il y a sur le testament et la signature qu'il y a sur la lettre de Louise Lescadre sont de la m\u00eame personne. Par cons\u00e9quent, ayant admis qu'elle avait sign\u00e9 cette lettre en question, elle n'aurait pas dit la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 quand elle a dit que ce n'\u00e9tait pas sa signature qui apparaissait sur le testament.\nPourquoi avoir cach\u00e9 \u00e0 Narcisse Voisard lui-m\u00eame l'existence de ce testament? Elle admet que le testament a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit en sa pr\u00e9sence environ un mois avant la mort d'Edouard Voisard. Il est des plus surprenant qu'elle n'ait pas dit \u00e0 Narcisse Voisard, avec qui elle paraissait \u00eatre en bonnes relations, qu'il y avait un testament qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Les h\u00e9ritiers la questionnent. Il est vrai qu'elle a pu \u00eatre vex\u00e9e de la mani\u00e8re dont ils se sont adress\u00e9s \u00e0 elle; mais enfin il n'y avait pas de mal pour elle de dire qu'il avait fait un testament et qu'elle en avait eu connaissance.\nLe juge qui a pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 au proc\u00e8s, qui a vu les t\u00e9moins, notamment Louise Lescadre, dans la bo\u00eete, d\u00e9clare formellement dans son jugement qu'elle a eu devant la cour une attitude qui d\u00e9notait un ind\u00e9niable manque de sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9. Alors en pr\u00e9sence d'une d\u00e9claration aussi formelle du juge, il me semble qu'il est bien difficile d'accepter le t\u00e9moignage de cette personne, d'autant plus que si l'on compare le testament avec une lettre \u00e9crite par Edouard Voisard on voit de suite qu'il y une diff\u00e9rence consid\u00e9rable dans l'\u00e9criture et que le testament ne para\u00eet pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit par celui qui a \u00e9crit la lettre sign\u00e9e \"Edouard Voisard;\" et il est incontestable que cette lettre a bien \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crite et sign\u00e9e par lui.\nLa demande a produit des experts en \u00e9criture pour exprimer leur opinion sur ces documents. Aucune objection n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 cette preuve. Au contraire, je retrouve dans le dossier, \u00e0 certains endroits, que les avocats de la d\u00e9fense se sont object\u00e9s \u00e0 ce que certains t\u00e9moins expriment une opinion sur les \u00e9critures parce qu'ils n'avaient pas d'abord d\u00e9clar\u00e9 s'ils \u00e9taient ou non des experts en \u00e9criture. Le t\u00e9moignage de ces experts, Cartier et Bellinge, a \u00e9t\u00e9 admis sans aucune objection de la part de la d\u00e9fense. Maintenant devant cette cour on pr\u00e9tend que ces t\u00e9moignages-l\u00e0 devraient \u00eatre rejet\u00e9s parce que notre code de proc\u00e9dure civile n'autorise pas l'admissibilit\u00e9 de telle preuve.\nL'ordonnance de 1667 avait une disposition formelle pour l'audition des experts en \u00e9criture. Cette disposition de l'ordonnance ne para\u00eet pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie avant le code de proc\u00e9dure civile.\nM. Belcourt pr\u00e9tend que le seul moyen de v\u00e9rifier les \u00e9critures est suivant les dispositions de l'article 392 du code de proc\u00e9dure civile.\nPar les dispositions de cet article le juge, s'il le trouve n\u00e9cessaire, peut nommer des experts pour l'\u00e9clairer sur certains points de la cause. Il n'y a pas de doute que dans le cas actuel le juge aurait eu parfaitement le droit de nommer des experts en \u00e9criture. Mais \u00e9tait-il oblig\u00e9 de le faire? Et la preuve d'experts qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 admise sans objection doit-elle \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e?\nIl a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 par cette cour dans une cause de Schwersenski v. Vineberg[6], que dans le cas o\u00f9 une preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 admise pour contredire un \u00e9crit, sans objection, cette preuve ne peut pas \u00eatre mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9 subs\u00e9quemment par les tribunaux d'appel.\nJe suis d'opinion, suivant la jurisprudence \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans la cause que je viens de mentionner, que dans le cas actuel si le d\u00e9fendeur voulait emp\u00eacher cette preuve il aurait d\u00fb s'y objecter formellement. Il ne l'a pas fait et je ne vois pas de raison pourquoi nous pourrions maintenant la mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9.\nComme je le disais tout \u00e0 l'heure, je suis convaincu qu'il y a eu un testament de fait. Maintenant qu'est-il devenu? Je ne le sais pas. A-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truit par Louise Lescadre et s'en est-elle servi pour \u00e9crire celui qui est maintenant devant nous? Je l'ignore \u00e9galement. Mais, \u00e0 tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement; je suis convaincu que celui que nous avons devant nous n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit par Voisard.\nSur le tout, j'en suis donc venu \u00e0 la conclusion que le testament qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit en cette cause n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit ni sign\u00e9 par Edouard Voisard et par cons\u00e9quent l'action des demandeurs doit \u00eatre maintenue. Leur appel devant cette cour doit donc \u00eatre maintenu avec d\u00e9pens de cette cour et de la cour d'appel et le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure r\u00e9tabli.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Tessier, Lacoursi\u00e8re & Fortier.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bureau & Bigu\u00e9.\n[1] 26 L.C.

Emerson Brantingham Implement Co., (1918) 57 S.C.R. 203\nDate: 1918-10-08\nCharles J. Schofield (Plaintiff) Appellant;\nand\nThe Emerson Brantingham Implement Company (Defendant) Respondent.\n1918: May 16, 17; 1918: October 8.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF SASKATCHEWAN.\nSale\u2014Principal and agent\u2014Written contract\u2014Modification by written consent of principal\u2014Representations by agent.\nThe appellant ordered from the respondent \"one of your Big Four 30 h.-p. Gas Traction Engines.\" The agreement provided that the order was \"made upon the express condition that\" it \"contains all the terms and conditions of the sale * * *\" and \"cannot in any manner be changed, altered or modified without the written consent of the officers\" of the company respondent. After one of of respondent's agents had concluded a trial of the engine, appellant was not satisfied with its performance; but the agent represented to him that \"the engine would get better with wear and that if it was not right, the company would make it right.\" Thereupon appellant paid $600 in cash, gave notes for the balance of the purchase price and signed a satisfaction paper certifying that the engine had been \"properly put in order.\"\nHeld that, upon the evidence, the engine supplied was not the engine ordered, as it could not develop its rated horse-power.\nPer Idington and Anglin JJ.\u2014According to the system adopted by the company respondent, such assurances by its agent were authorised notwithstanding the terms of the contract and were apparently confirmed by respondent which, without any demur, protest or reservation of rights, sent its employees to make extensive repairs to the engine.\nPer Davies J. dissenting.\u2014In the face of the express stipulations of the written contract, the respondent's agent had no power, by his representations to the appellant, to bind the respondent and alter the contract.\nJudgment of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan, 38 D.L.R. 528; [1918] 1 W.W.R. 306, reversed, Davies J. dissenting. APPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan en banc[1] reversing the judgment on the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe material facts are stated in the above head-note.\nC. E. Gregory K.C. for the appellant.\nGeo. F. Henderson K.C. and Fleming for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The appellant's order to the respondents was for\none of your Big Four 30 h.-p. Gas Traction Engines.\nThe jury found that the engine was not capable of developing its rated horse-power; that the appellant made known to the respondents the particular purpose for which he required the engine so as to shew them that he was relying on their skill and ability to furnish him with an engine suitable for his purpose; that the engine was not reasonably fit for that purpose, being defective by reason of its lack of horse-power. There was evidence on which the jury could make these findings.\nI do not myself understand how it can be maintained that the appellant was not ordering a 30 h.-p. engine. Mr. Justice Elwood thinks that if the order was not for \"a\" 30 h.-p. engine but for \"your\" 30 h.-p. engine, the latter did not need to be a 30 h.-p. engine; in fact that the respondents 30 h.-p. engines were not necessarily of 30 h.-p. This seems to me rather a strained meaning to put on so slight a difference of language and to be one that would not readily occur to ordinary persons dealing with the respondents.\nReading the order with the findings of the jury, I come to the conclusion that the respondents did not deliver such an engine as was called for by the order.\nThis really disposes of the case, for it eliminates the difficulties presented by the conditions of the contract which were what troubled the learned judge who rendered the judgment appealed from. Mr. Justice Elwood, after pointing out that it was only after receiving certain assurances and representations from the respondents' agent that the appellant consented to sign exhibits 1 and 2 and to pay $600 and sign the notes, says:\u2014\nThose representations were untrue. I am therefore of opinion that the appellant's acceptance is not binding upon him and it did not constitute him a purchaser of the engine.\nHaving found, however, that the engine was the one ordered, the learned Judge thinks that the agent had no authority to change the contract, as he would be doing, by making the representations he did because clause 8 of the contract provides that the order\ncontains all the terms and conditions of the sale and purchase of said engine and cannot, in any manner, be changed, altered or modified without the written consent of the officers of the said company.\nThe judge points out that under the authority of Wallis Son & Wells v. Pratt & Haynes[2], and many other authorities, the appellant would have been entitled to recover damages if what the respondents had delivered had been something different from what was ordered.\nI am entirely in agreement with the learned judge except that, as above stated, I am of opinion that the engine delivered was not such as was called for by the order.\nIt is a consequence of these differing premises that it follows that the conditions of sale have no application. I would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial.\nDavies J. (dissenting)\u2014In this case I have the misfortune to differ from my colleagues, being of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed and the judgment of the appeal court confirmed.\nI was satisfied at the conclusion of the argument that the whole case turned upon the question whether Winterhalt, the expert who was sent by the company to give the machine purchased by Schofield, the plaintiff, the actual trial provided for by the written contract of sale, had any authority to make a new contract, as it is alleged he did, or to in any way alter the original written one signed and made between the company and the plaintiff.\nA full study of that contract has satisfied me that he had no such power and that the statements he made to the plaintiff, and on which the latter says he relied, could in no wise alter or change that written contract. The contract, in fact, expressly provides for just such a case as the one before us of a subordinate officer or agent of the company altering or attempting to alter, in any way, the contract of sale made by the company.\nClause 8 states that the order and agreement\ncontains all the terms and conditions of the sale and purchase of the said engine, fixtures and equipment, and cannot, in any manner, be changed, altered or modified without the written consent of the officers of the company.\nIt is not contended that any such consent was obtained to the alleged changes made in the contract by Winterhalt, the expert sent to give the engine and machine the trial provided for by the contract, and I am unable to find how these representations can constitute a new contract or in any way bind the company. After Winterhalt had given the engine the trial which was accepted by all parties as the equivalent of the three days' trial stipulated for in the contract, the plaintiff signed the satisfaction paper certifying that the company's expert had\nproperly put in order, adjusted and started my model Big Four \"30\" Gas Traction Engine so that everything works satisfactorily to me.\nHe also paid the agent $600 and signed the notes for the balance of the purchase money, and relying as he said upon Winterhalt's statements, did not return the machine to the company within the time stipulated in the contract if it was found at the trial of the machine not to develop the horse-power or to do the work it was guaranteed to do.\nAt the time these documents were signed the evidence of the plaintiff was to the effect that the engine was not working properly in that it apparently did not develop sufficient horse-power to do the work it was supposed to do.\nPlaintiff, with full knowledge of these facts; signed the satisfaction certificate and the notes and paid the cash, $600, to Winterhalt, and when asked at the trial why he did so said:\nFrom the guarantee he told me that the company would stand behind the engine and make it right if it was not right, and that it would develop more power with use. \"Oh, yes,\" he said, \"it would develop more power with use, after it got smoothed up.\"\nIt seems to me, therefore, that his whole case rests upon these statements and promises of Winterhalt.\nIf, in the face of the express stipulations of the written contract, it could be successfully contended that Winterhalt had such power to bind the company and alter the contract made by them the plaintiff would have gone a long way to establish his case.\nIf he had no such power, and it seems to me clearly and beyond reasonable doubt that he had not, then plaintiff must fail.\nI am specially impressed with the reasons for judgment given by Mr. Justice Newlands with which I concur and would dismiss this appeal with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014It seems to me that this case presents a system of doing business which has been devised to deprive respondent's customers of all rights save such as it may graciously recognise.\nIt has framed an order for intending purchasers of any of its 30 horse-power engines to sign as the first step in purchasing.\nThe order is for a shipment of such engine to a point named for the purpose of trying it there for three days. Then an agent of the respondent is to meet there the intending purchaser and demonstrate on land selected by him the efficiency of the engine.\nThe experienced agent who fails to demonstrate the cardinal facts of the whole transaction\n(a) that the engine will develop its rated horse-power at the draw-bar\n(b) that the engine, if rated at 30 or more horse-power will furnish ample and steady power to drive any 36-inch cylinder threshing machine, complete with self-feeder, weigher and blower,\nfrom any cause whatsoever, must be possessed of such adroitness as to ingratiate himself with the customer and persuade him that such demonstrations have taken place and that he is satisfied and has no longer any excuse for delaying the handing over of the cash and notes stipulated for.\nIf he happen to have some doubts, the agent may represent to him\nthat the engine would bet getter with wear and that if it was not right the company would make it right,\nand thereby get, as the agent in question herein, by such representations got, $600 in cash and promissory notes to the amount of $3,150, and take his departure carrying with him also a certificate got by the same means.\nThe only thing then supposed to be left in the contract to which the purchaser can look is the following:\nSixth.\u2014It is mutually agreed that said engine, fixtures and equipment are purchased upon the following warranty only, viz.:\n(a) Should any parts (except electrical parts) prove defective within one year from the date of purchase of said engine on account of inferior material or workmanship, and such parts be returned to the Big Four Tractor Works, Winnipeg, Manitoba, transportation prepaid thereon, and be found by the company to be defective on account of inferior material or workmanship, said company will furnish new parts in lieu of some defective parts on board cars at Big Four Tractor Works, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n(b) Should any of the hardened cut steel bevel gears on said engine break or wear out within five years from the date of the purchase of said engine, said company, after satisfactory proof upon demand therefor, will replace them by delivering such parts on board cars at Big Four Tractor Works, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n(c) Should the engine frame break or wear out within five years from the date of said purchase, said company will, after satisfactory proof, upon demand therefor, replace said engine frame by delivering the same on board cars at Big Four Tractor Works, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\nIt is to be observed that none of these provisions cover any possible defect, involving the discovery of any original defect after settlement procured by the blandishment of the agent bringing it about.\nIn such event the respondent falls back upon the provisions of the eighth clause which is as follows:\u2014\nIt is further agreed that this order and agreement is given and accepted and the sale and purchase of said engine, fixtures and equipment are made upon the express condition that this order and agreement contains all the terms and conditions of the sale and purchase of said engines, fixtures and equipment and cannot, in any manner, be changed, altered or modified without the written consent of the officers of the said company, and that the sending of any person by the company to repair or operate said engine or the remaining of the person sent to start said engine, after the expiration of said three days' trial, shall in no manner waive, modify or annul any of the terms or conditions hereof. The company shall not be responsible for any delay in shipping said engine caused by accidents, strikes or other unavoidable circumstances, and that this order and agreement is not to be binding upon the company until approved by the said company by a duly authorised representative thereof signing the same.\nAnd when, as will presently appear, some engine may have failed to fulfil the expectations of the respondent, and the acceptance thereof induced by the assurances of the demonstrating agent is relied upon in an action as herein occurred, the respondent by virtue of said clause whenever it suits its purpose repudiates all liability and claims such agent had no authority to give such assurances.\nIt, therefore, becomes important in this case to know if such a claim of want of authority is in fact true.\nWe have the evidence of one Cole, examined under a commission on behalf of respondent, which seems entirely to destroy this pretension.\nHe tells of nineteen years' experience and that he had been in the employment of respondent since 1912, which antedates the representation relied upon by appellant as given by Winterhalt, another agent engaged by respondent.\nHe further speaks as follows:\u2014\nQ.\u2014State, Mr. Cole, your connection with the defendant company and your duties as such. A.\u2014I have to deliver new\u2014I deliver new outfits, go out and deliver and demonstrate them, and, well we are what are commonly called troubleshooters or experts. If a man has any trouble with his engine we are supposed to go and adjust it, repair them, etc.\nQ.\u2014Your time, then, is largely taken up in first demonstrating new engines and then going around and clearing up troubles that inexperienced operators may have with the engines? A.\u2014Yes, sir.\nQ.\u2014In doing so do you ever find that the trouble is caused from the engine itself, or is it always, in your opinion, with the inexperienced operators? A.\u2014It is not always with the inexperienced operators. You know, building the number of engines we do, one will occasionally get by the shop.\nQ.\u2014And that is the reason why they hire somebody to repair such engines so they will operate? A.\u2014Yes, sir. But I should judge that three-quarters of the trouble is from inexperienced operators.\n******\nQ.\u2014Mr. Cole, you were asked the question if you didn't state to the plaintiff after you had finished your repairs on his engine that if he got into any more trouble the company would take care of him, I wish you would state what authority you had, and what authority you had at that time from the company, in the nature of your employment, to make representations to people as to what the company would do for them, if you had any authority? A.\u2014Well, it is customary when a man goes out, if the purchaser has had trouble, and he goes out and he is a little sore, to tell them that the company will take care of them, because they always do, as in this case they sent Hill back. I was working on another job and they sent Hill.\nQ.\u2014I understand. If a man sends in a complaint, the company sends a man to take care of the trouble? A.\u2014Yes, sir.\nQ.\u2014It is the custom of the company to keep all their engines in working order? A.\u2014Yes, sir.\n******\nQ.\u2014In fact, you have got no authority from the company to tell a man that they will take care of him? A.\u2014Yes, we have that authority, to assure a man that he will be taken care of.\nQ.\u2014You know that that is the custom of the company to take care of them? A.\u2014Yes, sir.\nQ.\u2014And you just assumed that they would do so in this instance? A.\u2014Yes, sir.\nQ.\u2014And you were correct, so far as you know, in assuming that? A.\u2014Yes, sir.\nThe latter part of this examination was in re-examination and evidently intended to evoke a reply denying authority.\nIt requires considerable assurance to stoutly contend in face of this evidence that there was no authority from the respondent to Winterhalt, (who was engaged in exactly the same capacity as Cole had occupied for years), when he gave the assurances which induced the acceptance of the engine in question, after only a two days' instead of three days' trial, and the giving by appellant of the cash and notes in question herein. But there is further evidence in the case from which it would be the fair inference that such assurances were fully authorised, notwithstanding the terms written in the contract, for all the appellant had to do when the engine in question broke down a few days after the settlement with Winterhalt, and he had gone was to notify the local selling agents of the fact and as, of course, the head office at Winnipeg was informed and, without any demur on its part, sent this Mr. Cole to the appellant's place to see and remedy what was wrong, and he did so accordingly and sent a report to the head office of his having done so to appellant's satisfaction. And, again, something much more serious went wrong and the like course was pursued with the like results which cost hundreds of dollars. Yet there was not the slightest effort at repudiation or appearance of the respondent resting upon the contractual provisions now relied upon. Can there be a doubt that these ready responses were pursuant to the assurances given by Winterhalt, and later by Cole himself repeated, I think, and in part fulfilment thereof? What had to be rectified did not fall within the terms I have quoted above from the contract.\nOr is the form of contract supposed to prohibit not only agents from making some unwarranted contract, but also preclude the possibility of any later contractual relations between the parties thereto, unless reduced to writing?\nIf the latter alternative is relied upon it fails, for the two-fold reason that it is beyond the range of the meaning that ordinarily would be attached to the language used, and in the next place that the system adopted holds out to the public those experts as possessing the power of giving such assurances.\nAnother suggestion occurs to me, that it might be held fraudulent to devise such a trap for capturing the unwary.\nAs fraud has been rejected by the jury in the sense in which it was submitted I need not follow the suggestion.\nIts rejection, however, renders it all the more incumbent upon respondent to observe in an honourable manner the obligations resting upon one so holding out its agent to the public, and I do not think a contract made some months before, does preclude respondent from later on adopting another system than that contemplated thereby, or the other party from reaping the benefit and relying upon it.\nThe respondent, after observing the assurances given by responding to the calls I have already referred to, on a third occasion refused to do so, when it became imperatively necessary to stand behind its written and verbal contracts, and its engine in question when that collapsed as it were a short time later.\nThe appellant, having failed to get any proper result, consulted solicitors who, as such, wrote respondent and pointed out to it the history of failures, and a second time, on the 10th June, 1913, pointing out that fact and the failure of the last attempt of respondent's experts to make the engine serviceable and that it had never given satisfaction and had proven so unsatisfactory that they must demand its replacement by an engine properly fitted for the purpose.\nIn this they intimated that if not notified what was to be done their client would draw the engine to Webb and leave it there.\nRespondent replied from Winnipeg on the 24th June asking them to furnish proof that they were the duly authorised attorneys to act for Mr. Schofield. Until then they would not go into the matter in detail.\nAppellant wired confirmation of their authority and got in reply letter of 30th June written in an abusive and insolent tone, and threatening suit when his first note fell due. No answer was made to the suggestion of drawing the engine to Webb to leave it there as would be in accord with what the written agreement provided for.\nThe evidence of Mr. Harriston, an expert, who seems to have been well qualified for his task, and who is admitted on argument before us to have discovered what was wrong with the engine in the condition in which Mr. Cole had left it tells how he proceeded. It would seem, from Mr. Harriston's inspection, that he took the engine apart and found that a piston in use in one of the cylinders which Mr. Cole, on behalf of respondent, had substituted for the first one was far too tight to work at all usefully and that twenty-five per cent. of the supposed 30 horse-power was thereby to be deducted from what was intended.\nNeedless for me to go into further detail. It is only necessary to do so thus far to shew exactly the nature of the legal problems that have arisen as the result of the circuitous scheme of business which puts forward for use a rigorous form of contract designed on the one hand, if possible, on occasion to shelter the respondent from all risk of liability or responsibility for anything but the demonstration of the specified horse-power as above quoted, and on the other hand, securing approbation by instructing its agents to give the assurances of its standing behind the engine and maintaining its efficiency to do the work expected of it yet abandon customer, agent, and all else if too troublesome.\nCan such a scheme become successful in law with such findings of fact as the answers of the jury to the questions submitted to them furnish? And specially when read in light of the evidence I have referred to and quoted in part? I cannot think so. The questions submitted to the jury and their answers are as follows:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Did the defendant's agent, Luce, represent to the plaintiff (a) that this engine in question was a simple engine that any one could run after three days' experience? A.\u2014Yes. (b) That it would draw eight breaking ploughs on the plaintiff's land? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014If so, were either of these representations false, and if so, which? A.\u2014Yes (a).\nQ.\u2014If false, did Luce know they were false? Or were they made recklessly, careless whether they were true or not? A.\u2014No.\nQ.\u2014Was the plaintiff induced to enter into the contract by either of these representations? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Did the plaintiff accept the machine? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Was the engine capable of developing its rated horse-power? (a) As delivered? A.\u2014No. (b) After Cole repaired it. A.\u2014No.\nQ.\u2014Did Winterhalt represent to the plaintiff that the engine would get better with wear and that if it was not right the company would make it right? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014If so, were said representations or either of them made fraudulently? A.\u2014No.\nQ.\u2014Were the moneys paid and notes given as a result of these representations or were they given because the plaintiff was then satisfied with the engine with the exception that it did not pull as well on kerosene as gasoline? A.\u2014Because of representations made.\nQ.\u2014Did the plaintiff make known to the defendants the particular purpose for which he required the engine so as to shew that he was relying on their skill and ability to furnish him with an engine suitable for his purpose? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Was the engine reasonably fit for that purpose? (a) as delivered? A.\u2014No. (b) after being repaired by Cole? A.\u2014No.\nQ.\u2014If not, wherein was it defective? A.\u2014ack of horse-power.\nQ.\u2014If the engine was not reasonably fit for the purposes for which it was purchased, what damage did the plaintiff suffer thereby? A.\u2014 Recovery of notes as they stand.\nQ.\u2014Was the engine retained by the plaintiff as the engine delivered under the contract? A.\u2014Yes, kept by reason of the representations made.\nIt seems to me that despite all the attempts by the written contract to deprive appellant of any remedy, that the assurances of the agent were duly authorised, and were so acted upon, after getting the fruits thereof, by the respondent, in its subsequent dealings with the appellant in relation thereto, as to estop it from setting up the prior contract or anything restricting the appellant from asserting his right to rely upon said assurances.\nIt is not the mere collecting agent or expert demonstrator's authority which, doubtless, was what was had in view in making the provisions against agents variations now relied upon, that has to be passed upon, but the power of the head office in Canada to contract, save in writing, that is in question.\nI have no doubt as a result of a perusal of the evidence bearing thereon that it had ample power and was held out to the public as having ample power to do such acts as to rescind the written contract now relied upon, to accept at any time a return of the engine, the property in which had never passed out of respondent, and in short to do anything it pleased relative thereto without a single piece of writing being used.\nAssuming that the head office in and for Canada had such power to deal with the matter, there can be no doubt of the result; for it first directed its minor agents to give such assurances, acted upon them, led appellant to believe they were valid, and by virtue thereof presumed to make over, as it were, a good part of the engine which had been destroyed by the instructions of the respondent's agent having been followed.\nIn short the destruction of the machine resulted directly from the appellant's reliance upon the assurances given and his being induced thereby to trust respondent in its pretended and ineffective attempts at their fulfilment, without using adequate care and skill therein. Had he been bound and told to rely upon the letter of the writing, that destruction probably would have been averted by his calling in an expert such as Mr. Harrison when he would in all probability have got a more thorough examination of it, discovered the difficulty and had it rectified instead of having the engine so destroyed, as the result of trusting to the good faith of respondent.\nCorporations, as well as men, may so act that their conduct will contractually bind them in the ordinary course of business. The respondent's conduct has been such as to be a ratification of what it knew had been contracted for even if the agent had no prior authority.\nIn any event the written contract has never been observed by it in demonstrating, as its terms require, the existence of 30 horse-power when that was to have been done. And that stands good yet unless displaced by a settlement improperly obtained if one can give heed to such contention as set up. And the more especially is that the case where respondent is estopped for the reasons I have set forth in trying to take advantage of part of its contract, excluding all else.\nIn either of these views I take I need not dwell upon the questions which otherwise might arise under the \"Sale of Goods Act,\" or under the law apart therefrom, if different.\nI see no difficulty such as the learned trial judge found in giving relief in way of rescission of the contract and directing the return of the notes and money if that is a more appropriate remedy than what he applied.\nThe facts are stated, and the law that suits them will maintain the action and the alternative prayer for relief, other than damages, if found appropriate, will be open to the court.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs of the appellate court and here and direct judgment accordingly in such form as desired.\nAnglin J.\u2014The plaintiff sues for the return of cash and notes given by him as the purchase price of a traction engine from the defendant company\u2014necessarily, I take it, on the basis of rescission of the contract of sale\u2014and, in the alternative, for damages for breach of warranty as to the capacity and fitness of the engine. The defendant counterclaims for judgment on the notes.\nThe trial judge held the plaintiff not entitled to rescission, but, while he gave the defendant judgment on its counterclaim, presumably on the footing that the plaintiff should be held to have accepted the engine and was not entitled to rescission which, indeed, the learned judge says was not claimed, on the jury's findings he held the plaintiff entitled to damages in an amount equal to that represented by the notes and directed a set-off, presumably, though he does not so put it, as Mr. Justice Newlands says;\non the implied warranty of fitness.\nOn appeal the judgment for damages was reversed by the Supreme Court en banc which held, as I understand the opinions delivered by Elwood and Newlands JJ., that, although the plaintiff's giving of the cash and notes, after what was held to have been accepted by him as the three days' demonstration trial provided for by the contract, did not amount to a binding acceptance of the engine because induced (as found by the jury upon sufficient evidence) by a misrepresentation and an unfulfilled assurance of the agent who obtained them, his acceptance of the engine and its fulfilment of the requirements of the contract as to capacity were established as against him by his failure to return it under a provision of the contract making his retention of it for more than two days after the completion of the demonstration test\nproof conclusive that said engine and equipment fulfilled the warranty in every respect and shall constitute an acceptance and purchase, etc. On the ground that the contract in express terms precluded any implied warranty of fitness under the Saskatchewan \"Sales of Goods Act\" (R.S. 1909, c. 147 s. 16), and contained no express collateral warranty thereof, the court further held that an action would not lie for breach of warranty.\nRecovery on the ground of deceit, if otherwise open, was precluded by the jury's findings negativing fraud. Although this relief was not demanded in the statement of claim it would seem to have been treated as open to the plaintiff in the Appellate Division, had a case been made for it.\nThere is nothing to indicate anything in the nature of mistake or surprise on the part of the plaintiff in making the contract for the purchase of a \"30 h.-p.\" tractor engine from the defendant, or fraud or overreaching inducing his execution of it. It was, therefore, when executed, clearly binding upon him according to its terms.\nThe jury, having found upon more than a mere scintilla of evidence that the engine delivered by the defendants was not capable of developing 30 h.-p., and the Appellate Court having accepted that finding, the case must be disposed of on the assumption that it is correct. I am, with respect, unable to assent to the view expressed by the learned judges of the Appellate Division that it was nevertheless the engine ordered. Not only was \"30 h.-p.\" part of the description of the engine sold, but the contract expressly provided that the purchaser should not be bound to accept the engine unless after three days' trial in field work it should be demonstrated that it would develop 30 h.-p. at the draw-bar. Unless that condition of the sale was fulfilled the purchaser was entitled to reject the engine. Under such a contract I am unable to understand how it can be said that\nthe h.-p. the engine would develop was quite immaterial, so long as it was one of the defendants' \"engines\" known as \"their Big Four 30 h.-p. Gas Tractor Engines.\"\nWith respect it seems to me that undue weight has been given to the word \"your\" and the vital words of the description, \"30 h.-p.,\" emphasised by the express stipulation making it a condition of the sale that the engine should answer to them, have been denied the importance which the contracting parties so clearly attached to them. In my opinion the engine delivered was not that contracted for and on that ground alone the plaintiff would be entitled to succeed unless the peculiar provision of the contract, which made his retention of it for more than two days after the demonstration test \"proof conclusive\" that it answered the description and \"an acceptance and purchase of it,\" or undue delay in repudiating after he became or should have been aware that it did not fulfil the condition of sale as to horse-power, and that the company could not, or would not, make it do so, had terminated his right of rejection.\nWhen the defendants' agent, Winterhalt, concluded what appears to have been accepted as a three days' trial of the engine under the contract, according to the weight of the evidence the plaintiff was not satisfied with its performance. This is implied in the jury's answer to the 9th question. Winterhalt, however, represented that the engine would get better with wear and assured the plaintiff that if it was not right the company would make it right. The jury has found that this representation and this assurance induced the plaintiff to settle for the purchase price, although not satisfied with the demonstration of the engine's capacity, by paying the $600 in cash and giving notes for the balance of $3,150. The jury did not explicitly find that the representation was untrue and that the assurance had not been fulfilled, but both these facts are implied in their answers and are proper conclusions from the evidence.\nI agree with Elwood J. that, although the jury negatived fraud on the part of Winterhalt, having regard to the relations between the plaintiff and the defendant company the latter cannot take advantage of a settlement so procured without implementing its agent's assurance. But I cannot understand why the plaintiff's retention of the engine, beyond the two days after the completion of the demonstration test, and until he finally rejected it, undoubtedly induced by the same representation and assurance, should bind him and constitute an acceptance of it if the giving of the $600 and the notes did not. In my opinion both are on the same footing.\nThe defendants invoke a provision of the contract to negative Winterhalt's authority as an agent to make any representation or give any assurance which would involve a departure from its express terms. Apart from the statement of their own agent, Cole, that it was customary for the company's agents and that they were authorised to give assurances to purchasers that the company would look after the engine and make it run satisfactorily, we have the indisputable facts that, when notified by the plaintiff that the engine had broken down, the company, without any demur, protest or reservation of rights sent its employees, Cole and Hill, on two distinct occasions to make extensive repairs and replacements of parts. It acted as it might have been expected that it would act in recognition of the obligation which Winterhalt's assurance would entail and the plaintiff may well have understood in attempted fulfilment of it, although it is, of course, quite possible that in doing so the company did not intend thereby to admit any liability to the plaintiff or to take a position in any wise inconsistent with its right to recover from him the purchase price of the engine. What occurred, however, prevents his retention and user of the engine being invoked as evidence of acceptance. On the whole I think it is the safer conclusion on this branch of the case that there never was a binding acceptance of the engine by the plaintiff, that he was entitled to reject it and that he sufficiently manifested his election to do so.\nMoreover, although the contract treats the development of 30 h.-p. as a condition of the sale, it also speaks of this term as a warranty in clause 5, whereby retention of the engine for more than two days after the demonstration test is made\nproof conclusive that said engine and equipment fulfilled the warranty in every respect.\nThe only term of the contract which could be regarded as \"the warranty\" referred to is the stipulation.\n(a) that the engine will develop its rated horse-power at the draw bar.\n(b) That the engine, if rated at 30 or more horse-power will furnish ample and steady power to drive any 36-inch cylinder threshing machine, complete with self-feeder, weigher and blower.\nThe company, having in its own contract treated this term as a warranty as well as a condition, cannot complain if it be so dealt with now. As a warranty it was not fulfilled and the plaintiff would be entitled to the full measure of damages which its breach entailed. The judgment of the learned trial judge might be supported on this ground also.\nI find it unnecessary to consider a question much argued, viz., whether the terms of the contract exclude an implied warranty of fitness under the \"Sales of Goods Act\" arising from the fact found by the jury that the\nplaintiff made known to the defendants the particular purpose for which he required the engine so as to shew that he was relying on their skill and ability to furnish him with an engine suitable for this purpose.\nFor these reasons, though not without some hesitation due to the acknowledgments of satisfaction signed by the plaintiff and his stupid plasticity, I concur in the allowance of this appeal.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This is a case concerning the sale of a gasoline tractor engine for the sum of $3,750. The action was instituted by the purchaser for the reimbursement of the money which he had paid on account and for the recovery of some notes which he had given, claiming that the machinery in question was not suitable for the purpose for which it was purchased and had not the horse-power called for.\nThe order for the machinery was in writing and was addressed to the respondent company, asking for \"one of your Big Four 30 h.-p. Gas Tractor Engines.\" Much reliance is being put on the words \"one of your Big 4 Engines\" by the respondent company and by the judges of the Supreme Court en banc. They do not seem to attach much importance to the words \"thirty horse-power.\"\nIt seems to me, however, with due deference, as if the horse-power of the machine was of the greatest importance. This respondent company is manufacturing engines of different classes and different strength, and when they undertake to sell one of their engines which they call \"thirty horse-power,\" they are bound, as a condition of their contract, to deliver an engine capable of developing that quantity of horse- power. The word \"your\" in the description of the machinery does not alter that condition.\nThe company has sent on several occasions their experts or agents to try the machine and to develop that quantity of horse-power. They have never been able to reach the strength they had contracted for. However, after the trial had been made by one of their experts, it was found that the machine was not absolutely suitable; but it was represented to the purchaser that by and by the situation would improve and the machinery would develop the necessary power.\nThe purchaser, then, on the strength of those representations, agreed to give his note and to pay a certain sum of money. A few days after, during the same week, it was found that the machinery would not work.\nNew experts were sent by the company, but with no practical result. At last, the respondent had to give up the use of the machine, and is now suing for the recovery of his notes and of the money which he had paid.\nThe findings of the jury were all in favour of the appellant, and, in fact, the only ground that is relied upon by the company is that by a provision of the contract the company was not responsible for any representation which could be made by their agents.\nI fully realise that on some occasions those provisions may be essential in order to prevent fraud; but in this case no such suggestion appears from the evidence and from the action of the appellant. On the contrary, he seems to have taken almost in every instance the word of the company or its representative. He seems to have acted with the most honest intent and it is a pity to see that the company is now trying to take advantage of a provision in its contract which should have been in only to meet some other cases or circumstances.\nThe company knew the purpose for which Schofield required the engine and he has certainly relied on their skill and ability to furnish him with an engine suitable for that purpose. The engine not having developed the quantity of horse-power for which it was sold, the respondent company has certainly not fulfilled its contract.\nIt is true that there was a settlement made but that settlement was obtained by continuous representations that the machine would develop the horse-power they contracted for. This engine, it was claimed, would get better with wear, etc. As a question of fact, the company sent after that settlement some experts to try and make it right. They have never succeeded, and it seems to me that the machine, having never been fit for the purpose for which it was purchased, and the settlement having been obtained under certain representations which proved absolutely incorrect, the respondent cannot avail itself of that settlement and the plaintiff should succeed.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs of this court and of the court below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Seaborn, Taylor, Pope & Quirk.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Mackenzie, Brown, Thom, McMorran, MacDonald, Bastedo & Jackson.\n[1] 38 D.L.R. 528; [1918] 1 W.W.R. 306.\n[2] [1911] A.C. 394.\n"

They allege and establish by affidavits that special leave to appeal to the Privy Council has been applied for and refused and that the debts and costs acknowledged by the bonds to have been awarded to the plaintiffs remain unpaid. In opposing the application counsel for the defendants contends that it is incumbent upon the applicants to shew that they have exhausted their remedies against the defendants by execution before taking any step towards recovery upon the bonds. With that contention I am unable to agree. The condition upon which the obligation under the bonds was to be avoided has not been fulfilled. The default necessary to establish the liability of the surety, according to its terms, has been proved, subject, of course, to any other defences that may be open. Daniels Chan. Practice, 6 ed., p. 1931, 8 ed., p. 1624 and note (t). To require the judgment creditors to issue executions and obtain returns of nulla bona as a condition of permitting them to put the bonds in suit might involve the incurring of needless expense and entail prejudicial delay. Any possible interest of the surety can be fully protected by the exercise of the discretion of the court which may try any actions upon the bonds over the costs thereof. The motion should be granted and the costs of it, so far as I have power so to direct, should be costs in the actions which it is proposed to bring.\nMotion granted.\n"

The insurance companies refused payment, and litigation followed at the instance of the respondent on behalf of the creditors generally. The appellant, being called upon to value its securities, proved its claim in the hands of the respondent as an ordinary creditor, without mentioning its pretended preference under the insurance policies. Later on, the creditors succeeded in their action against the insurance companies, and the insurance money was paid to the respondent as assignee. Then the appellant claimed part of that money as a secured creditor.\nHeld, Duff J. dissenting, that the appellant could claim only as an ordinary creditor.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal, (39 D.L.R. 140; [1918] 1 W.W.R. 161,) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], affirming the judgment of Murphy J. at the trial[2], by which the plaintiff's action was dismissed.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nMason and Carter for the appellant.\nGriffin for the respondent. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The facts of this case are not doubtful or indeed disputed. They are sufficiently set out in the judgment of the courts below and only a brief statement of them is called for here.\nWhen the Westminister Woodworking Company assigned to the respondent for the benefit of its creditors, of whom the appellant company were one, this last\u2014named company held certain securities for its claim, the largest in amount arising out of a claim to certain insurance moneys under an agreement for insurance for a much larger amount, covering the whole of the Westminister Woodworking Company's works, made two days previous to the fire which destroyed that company's mill, but for which no policies had been issued or receipts given. The insurance companies refused payment and it was exceedingly doubtful if anything could be recovered under the agreement until as the result of legal proceedings they were held bound by it.\nThe appellant, called upon by the respondent to value its securities, after some hesitation put in a valuation of the securities it held other than its claim under the insurance in litigation of which it made no mention and proved for the balance of its claim as a creditor.\nWhen the insurance moneys had been recovered, the appellant asserted its original right in these as a secured creditor and its claim to be at liberty to do this was repudiated by the respondent on behalf of the other creditors.\nThe action is for a declaration that the respondent holds the sum of $9,000 part of the insurance moneys collected as trustee for the appellant.\nWhether the appellant considered that the claim against the insurance company was so doubtful as to be negligible or was desirous of holding off until it was seen how the lawsuit would turn out is perhaps im- material. The position it eventually attempted to take was that it had reserved the right to take after the event whichever course had been shewn to be for its advantage, either to abandon its security and assert its claim in full or to stand upon its security and prove for the balance of the claim reduced by the amount received in respect of the security. This I do not think it could do. The proof put in must, I think, be considered, under the circumstances, as having been a valuation of all the security claimed to be held. There can, of course, be no question of valuation now when the security has been realised.\nThe result of the appellant's contention would manifestly be unfair to the other creditors. The appellant would have had the suit fought at their expense though itself the party chiefly interested, besides having the advantage if it had failed of having its claim rank in full with those of the other creditors.\nThat the appellant was badly advised by its solicitor as suggested in its factum can be no ground for holding that it is not bound by its acts.\nThe case is concisely, but I think sufficiently, dealt with in the reasons of Chief Justice Macdonald for the judgment appealed from, and I do not think it necessary to add anything further to these with which I agree.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur with the reasons for judgment of Chief Justice Macdonald in the court appealed from and am of the opinion that either upon the ground of estoppel or of abandonment of its claim the plaintiff is not entitled to the preferential claim it seeks to have affirmed in its action.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. IDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant's factum says that:\u2014\nThis action was brought for a declaration that the plaintiff was entitled to the sum of $9,000 insurance received by the defendant from certain insurance companies and that the defendant holds the same as trustee for the plaintiff, and for an order directing payment of said amount to the plaintiff.\nThis is possibly in accord with the writ issued by appellant which claimed $9,000 out of moneys received by respondent from four companies named. But the statement of claim, departing therefrom, claims in respect of insurance contracts with five companies named.\nWhichever way it is put, the prayer in the statement of claim is for a declaration that defendant (now respondent) holds as trustee for plaintiff (now appellant) $9,000 and an order for its repayment to the plaintiff, or alternatively that plaintiff is entitled to the sum of $9,000 out of the proceeds of the said insurance policies, which must mean out of the five policies.\nThere is a further prayer for costs but no other specific alternative or, as usually happens, in way of a prayer for such further or other relief as the plaintiff might be found entitled to.\nI do not think the appellant at the trial made out by the evidence adduced any such claim as set forth, or, on such basis, right to relief as prayed for.\nThe claim as made is of a very ordinary character if the facts had supported it.\nIt is that of the ordinary mortgagee with a covenant assuring him that the mortgaged property will be insured for his benefit. He sometimes gets an assignment of the policy thus promised, and at other times gets a policy containing a clause reading\nloss, if any, payable to him as his interest may appear. The appellant and the insolvent company or the latter's founder began a course of dealing on that basis which, if adhered to, would have produced a very simple set of facts to deal with.\nTheir dealings, however, so grew in complications arising from the later form of insurance policy adopted and the conflicting interests of others entitled to claim under the several policies issued, and relied upon, that I am strongly inclined to think the legal situation of the several parties under the policies so issued was entirely different from what they imagined and present in the statement of claim.\nThe companies concerned had agreed on a basis of indemnity which distributed the total amount of any given policy over a number of different subject matters, which would result in the application or appropriation of the proceeds in the event of a loss in a manner entirely different from that originally agreed on, or that presented by appellant in its statement of claim.\nThe claim so made was attacked in the court below and here by respondent on the ground of illegality, as infringing the provisions of the Imperial \"Gambling Act\" re\u2014enacted in British Columbia.\nThat ground is fairly arguable, but upon what I conceive to be the true construction of the policies (which is that the terms used do not extend the insurances in favour of appellant to buildings) is not, in my opinion, tenable.\nThe claim, however, as made by appellant and founded upon an entirely different construction, is untenable. And whilst it had a tenable claim such as I conceive existed at one time, it failed by its statement of claim to put forward that and cannot do so now without amendment of its pleadings, which is not asked for and in any event at this stage should not be granted, under the peculiar circumstances of its devious course of conduct which has, beyond doubt, induced the respondent and those he represents to change his and their position.\nThe actual situation in law, of the appellant, on the true construction of the policies confining its rights to such claims according to its interests (which I take to mean insurable interests) as might appear would upon the application of the relevant facts reduce same to a mere fraction of what is now claimed.\nThat claim, perhaps legal at one time, is not now put forward and by its conduct the appellant is debarred from now setting it up. Quite true the counsel for appellant, at an early stage of the argument, in answer to my suggestions that the claim might be a fractional part, was good enough to say his client would accept that rather than nothing. An examination since, of the pleadings, leads me to the conclusion which I have already expressed.\nI am not to be taken as holding that an insurance upon property of a debtor in which a creditor has no interest may not, pursuant to an agreement therefor, be assigned as a security by the debtor to his creditor and the fruits thereof claimed by such assignee in event of loss. I merely hold that the ordinary phrase:\u2014\n\"Loss, if any, is payable to the party named as his interest may appear,\"\ndoes not extend his rights to cover more than his insurable interest unless and until something more express is made to appear, as the intention of the parties.\nIn the case of McPhillips v. London Mutual Fire Ins. Co.[3], relied upon by appellant, the late Mr. Justice Burton, whose opinion is entitled to great re- spect, evidently held the same view, for he says, after quoting the phrase in question:\nThis, though an appointment in favour of the mortgagee, was manifestly confined to his interest in the mortgaged premises.\nWhen the judgment for recovery therein was given for something more in respect of chattels, it was expressly rested upon a later assignment by the assured to the creditor. If that had been made, and in question herein, another case than pleaded would exist. Or if any verbal agreement existed to produce such an assignment the pleading falls far short of expressing any such case; as do also the particulars delivered to make the pleading clear.\nThe case of Castellain v. Preston[4], though not expressly in point, furnishes an exposition of the relevant principles of law. well worth bearing in mind, that an insurance contract is one of indemnity only, and surely prim\u00e2 facie is confined solely to property the assured had claimed to be interested in. There are many American authorities cited in May on Insurance, 4th ed., sections 347 and following, to end of chap. 22, giving illustrations of almost every shade of opinion as to the relative right of mortgagor and mortgagee, and what falls within the usual phrase,\n\"Loss, if any, payable to one named as his interest may appear.\"\nI suspect all these considerations were present to the mind of the solicitor for the appellant when he framed the last proof of its claim on the basis of discarding such a security as practically worthless.\nThe first proof of claim made by the appellant, immediately after the assignment to respondent, set forth its total claim of indebtedness, and said: That the said A.R. Williams Machinery Company of Vancouver, Limited, hold lien security for the said indebtedness.\nIt was only lien security that was thought of and it might be fairly inferred insurance thereof but not of something else.\nThe appellant's course of business had been, in making sales, to take receipts shewing that the property in the thing agreed to be sold did not pass to the intended vendee. And then it was agreed to insure such personal properties for the benefit of the appellant.\nThe schedule system was never intended to give any substantially different right but was supposed no doubt to be so proportionately adjusted as likely to work out approximately the same result.\nI do not think, in fact, that it did so work out. But certainly it never occurred to any one concerned to imagine that the insurance on the buildings which might, in event of loss, be satisfied by reinstatement, was to go to pay off the appellant or such like parties concerned in personal or chattel property only.\nWhen the parties concerned were confronted with the actual situation of the results of a fire, it turned out that application had been made two days before the fire for a total insurance, in a new set of companies, of $40,000\u2014an insurance of $5,000 beyond that theretofore existent and to be taken up or placed as old policies expired.\nThis was only an oral arrangement with insurance agents and its validity, or at all events enforceability, is of a dubious nature.\nNone of the companies concerned seemed inclined to respond to such a claim, and appellant failed to take any steps to enforce its alleged individual rights against any of such companies, though well aware of all the facts known to respondent. I was surprised to hear it suggested in argument that appellant could not sue and was entirely at the mercy of respondent in that regard. The common law right of action, no doubt, rested with the insolvent company and was passed on by virtue of the effect of sec. 2 of the \"Creditors' Trust Deeds Act\" to the respondent, who, in the view contended for by the appellant, became a mere trustee for it of the entire insurance of the $6,000 placed with and accepted by the Stuyvesant Company.\nThe clear right of the appellant under such circumstances, if any foundation for its contention, was, in the first place, exactly what the assignee of any chose in action had long been in the enjoyment of, namely, to bring an action in the name of the assignor thereof upon duly indemnifying him against costs or what practically amounted to the same thing, any form of suit which local procedure sanctions to enforce its alleged equitable right; and in the next place, under sec. 53 of the \"Creditors' Trust Deeds Act,\" to obtain an order from the judge entitling it to bring the action and receive the benefit thereof solely for itself.\nThe appellant, very prudently having regard to the untenable nature of its right to extend its claim into the region of illegality, if anything worth while is to be made of its claims, did none of these things, but being represented by its manager, as one of the inspectors of the estate, took an active part in promoting actions by the assignee for the joint benefit of all creditors against some of the insurance companies alleged to be liable on the oral agreement for insurance and formulating a scheme for the financing of such litigation.\nThis latter necessity was met by an assessment made upon the creditors; first of one per cent. of their respective claims, and again of another, and a third call till $750 had been collected.\nThe appellant first contributed $90 to this fund and, after the learned trial judge had decided in respondent's favour in the suit against the Stuyvesant Company, which case was tried as a test one, another $90 to fight the appeal in which the respondent was successful.\nThen appellant turned around and put forward the claim now presented that it was entitled to the whole $6,000 so secured as its own and to $3,000 beyond out of later recoveries.\nMeantime, some months after the action was brought and months before it was tried, the assignee, apparently advised to make clear and undoubted the actual position of the appellant, called upon it to value, in accordance with the \"Creditors' Trust Deeds Act,\" any securities it had and, in accordance with such request, it filed an amended claim whereby its secretary, on its behalf, conversant with the foregoing history of the litigation then pending and advised by counsel, well aware of all the facts then obtainable, after setting forth as previously its claim, declared as follows:\u2014\n3. That the said The A. R. Williams Machinery Company of Vancouver, Limited, holds security for the said indebtedness in the form of lien notes covering machinery and an insurance policy with Ceperley, Rounsefell & Company covering portion of insurance on the machinery, which security we value as $3,700.\nThis was done, not hastily or in error, but on the advice of a solicitor since deceased, who, no doubt, appreciated not only the difficulties of supporting any litigation in maintenance of the assignee's claim, but also the difficulties which I have already referred to, of appellant, in any aspect of the matter involved, getting more than a fractional part of its entire claim. The difference between what it might get standing alone, or jointly with other creditors of which its claim above represented, roughly speaking, would be a fourth part, was such that it could not be worth while raising any question about, and, alone, unaided running risk of litigation.\nThe statute under which such proof was made, provided, by sec. 31, sub-sec. (a) as follows:\u2014\nEvery creditor in his proof of claim shall state whether he holds any security for his claim, or any part thereof, and if such security is on the estate of the assignor or on the estate of a third party for whom such assignor is only secondarily liable, he shall put a specified value thereon; and the assignee, under the authority of the creditors, may either consent to the rights of the creditor to rank for the claim after deducting such valuation, or he may require from the creditor an assignment of the security at the specific value to be paid together with interest thereon at the legal rate from the date of filing the claim until payment out of the estate as soon as the assignee has realised such security, and in such case the difference between the value at which the security is retained and the amount of the gross claim of the creditor shall be the amount for which he shall rank and vote in respect of the estate. Before assigning such security such creditor shall be entitled to receive security from such assignee for the value of such security so to be assigned. In case of any dispute a Judge of the Supreme or County Court may settle the same on a summary application.\nIt was thus obligatory by the statute, as well as otherwise, upon the appellant to be honest in presenting its claim, and to name any security from which it hoped to reap anything exclusively for itself, such as now claimed, and to value it. The respondent assignee was advised by the creditors to accept and act upon this declaration and surrender the securities claimed, and did so, on faith thereof.\nWith that obligation by statute and all other moral obligations resting upon it requiring the observance of fidelity in dealing with its co-adventurers who had embarked with it in promoting risky litigation for their common advantage, it saw fit, after the victory sought was won, to turn round and claim as its own one-half of the entire sum recovered. This was a violation of the contract clearly inferable from the expressions and conduct of the parties. It was an improper attempt to evade or to abuse the provisions of the statute. Its conduct had estopped it from so claiming.\nWe are called upon to give effect to such a claim deliberately abandoned, if faith was to be put in its statutory declaration. It had clearly elected to take its chances in common with all its fellow-creditors, instead of bearing alone the burden of asserting in litigation a claim for which I can find no support in law, and if possible still less in equity, to the rules of which it pretends to appeal as against the respondent, claimed by it to have been throughout its trustee.\nI should be very sorry, indeed, if I had found our law such an impotent instrument for the administration of justice as to compel us to assent thereto.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J. (dissenting)\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Whether what the appellants did should be held to amount to an abandonment of their claim upon the insurance in question as security for the indebtedness to them of the Westminister Woodworking Company Limited, in liquidation, or merely to be conduct raising an estoppel in pais against their asserting a prior right to an integral part of such insurance as against the other creditors of the Woodworking Company and its assignee, for the reasons stated by the learned Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal, I am of the opinion that, having regard to all that has taken place, it would certainly be inequitable to permit such a right to be now insisted upon.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The question in this case is whether the appellant company, having failed to claim a security and to value it under the provisions of sec. 31 of the \"Creditors' Trust Deeds Act\" of British Columbia, is considered as having abandoned it or is estopped from exercising any right in connection with that security.\nThe appellant company had sold some machinery to the Westminister Woodworking Company, and it had been agreed between them that out of their total insurance on their mill and machinery the latter company would undertake to see that their liability to the Williams Company would be protected, and the policies provided that fire losses would be payable to the Williams Company as its interest may appear.\nSeveral of those insurance policies terminated on the 13th of February, 1914, and an insurance agent verbally agreed in the name of different companies which he represented to insure the plant and the machinery of the Woodworking Company for the amount asked for. There was no written receipt given.\nBefore any policies were issued a fire occurred and the mill and contents were destroyed.\nThat accident put the Woodworking Company in financial difficulties and they were forced to assign for creditors under the \"Creditors' Trust Deeds Act\" of the province to respondent, John Graham.\nIt was decided by the creditors to claim the payment of the insurance, and the creditors were called upon to fyle their claims.\nOn the 16th of March, 1914, the appellant filed with the respondent a sworn declaration stating that a sum of $13,267 was due them and claimed security by lien. Later on the assignee asked the appellant to give particulars of their securities and the value they placed on them. That letter of the assignee was referred to their solicitors, who discussed the question with the solicitor of the estate and he evidently came to the conclusion that the appellant company would be in a better position to rank as an ordinary creditor than to claim any preference under the verbal insurance policies which were under litigation.\nThey could have valued their securities but then would have lost a part of their claim if later on the litigation with the insurance company would prove to be unsuccessful.\nThey could also abandon their securities and prove their total claim as an unsecured creditor.\nThey adopted the latter course.\nLater on, however, the creditors succeeded in their action against the insurance companies and the insurance money was paid to the assignee. Now the Williams Company wants to claim part of that money as a secured creditor.\nI agree with the trial judge and the Court of Appeal that the appellants can claim only as ordinary creditors. They were, under the provisions of the Act, bound to prove their claims and to state if they had some securities and value them, or they could abandon their securities. They thought, when the matter was under litigation and their alleged securities were very uncertain, that their interests would be better served by abandoning their privileged claims on that insurance money. They have deliberately elected not to claim as privileged creditors and they have abandoned their rights in that respect.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Russell, Hancox, Wismer & Anderson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Martin Griffin & Co.\n[1] 39 D.L.R. 140; [1918] 1 W.W.R. 161.\n[2] [1917] 1 W.W.R. 803.\n[3] 23 Ont.

A final order for foreclosure and its registration, in proceedings taken under section 62 (a) of the \"Land Titles Act\" of Alberta, do not extinguish the mortgage debt so as to estop the mortgagee from proceeding on the mortgagor's covenant to pay or realising on any collateral securities he may have.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of Simmons J. at the trial[2], by which the plaintiff's action was dismissed.\nThis is an action brought by the respondent as beneficiary under a life insurance policy assuring the life of her husband in the sum of $5,000. One of the conditions contained in the policy was:\nBefore payment of this policy as a claim any loan or other indebtedness thereon, to the company by the assured, or by the beneficiary, and the balance of the year's premium, if any, will be deducted from the amount payable.\nThe respondent mortgaged to the appellant lots of land to secure an advance to her of $12,500, and she and the assured assigned the policy to the appellant as collateral security for the payment of the mortgage moneys. The mortgage having become in arrear, the appellant commenced foreclosure proceedings pursuant to the provisions of section 62a of the \"Land Titles Act;\" and after an abortive sale, a final order for foreclosure was made. The assured died a month after, and the appellant applied the net amount of the policy against the respondent's indebtedness. The respondent claimed that by reason of the final order of foreclosure, the mortgage debt became extinguished.\nA. H. Clarke K.C. and M. McLeod for the appellant.\nR. B. Bennett K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014Speaking generally, I see very little practical difference at the present time between the mortgage of the English law and the hypothec of the civil law; both are jura in re aliena, and the terms in which certain sections of the Alberta Act are couched suggest an intention on the part of its framers to adopt, in part at least, the principles of the civil law of hypothecs. Both the mortgage and the hypothec are rights in rem conferred by a debtor upon a creditor as a security for a right in personam. The mortgage debtor transfers the title to the res to his creditor, retaining usually the possession and a right of redemption. The hypothecary debtor retains the title and possession, but gives a right in rem. The mortgagee may by foreclosure bar the mortgagor's right of redemption and thus secure a title absolute to the res. The hypothecary creditor has the right on default to bring the land to sale by the sheriff, and the proceeds are applied to the discharge of encumbrances according to their priority; and the personal obligation is discharged only in so far as the amount realised out of those proceeds is sufficient to satisfy the hypothecary claim. It is now generally recognised under the English system, although old forms are still used, that the real owner of the land is the mortgagor; and the mortgage is a mere security for the debt or obligation. In courts of law the mortgage is recognised as conveying an estate, while equity merely creates a lien, and the \"Judicature Act\" provides that where there is any conflict between the rules of equity and the rules of common law, the rules of equity shall prevail.\nIn Chancery foreclosure was adopted as a proceeding by which the mortgagor's right of redemption of the premises was barred.\nUnless there is something very clear in the Alberta \"Land Act,\" I should hesitate to say that, notwithstanding all the safeguards with which the rights of the mortgagor are surrounded, the mortgagee is to be treated as a usurer and to be deprived of his right to recover in personam on the covenant, merely because he exercises his right to foreclose the mortgagor's right of redemption. I cannot see why, if the mortgage is a mere security for the debt, the right in personam should not continue to exist after the debtor, by foreclosure proceedings, has lost his right of redemption for ever.\nAssuming that the title to the land under the Alberta Act remains in the mortgagor, and the forms used would seem, as I have already said, to convey the impression that the intention of the framers of the Act was to adopt that principle of the civil law, while using the old terms of the English law, and that the foreclosure order does not vest the land in the mortgagee, but that the title passes under the statutory provision as in the civil law under the sheriff's title\u2014 and the vesting order coupled with it\u2014non constat that the personal obligation to pay has been satisfied.\nThe two things are distinct and separate, and in the absence of express language in the statute I decline to accept the suggestion that, if the lender of the money endeavours to realise on his security, he is assumed to have released the debtor from his obligation to pay under the covenant. It may be that the foreclosure order is granted under the Act for the purpose of realising the debt; but the fact is that the principal obligation to pay the debt is not satisfied even if the security is realised upon, unless the amount realised is sufficient to liquidate the obligation.\nThere is no evidence here of any intention, on the part of the mortgagee, to take the property in satisfaction of his debt.\nIt would seem to me, and I speak with great deference, that on the true construction of the Act the parties remain, as Mr. Justice Idington says, as they were under the old system. The mortgagee is entitled to sue on his covenant though, if he does, the mortgagor, on payment of the debt, in entitled to redeem his property; and the mortgagee must be in a position therefore to restore the property. Sections 62. and 63 (a) seem to provide for a twofold remedy, and for the postponement of the remedy upon the covenant until the foreclosure proceedings are exhausted.\nI have read the case in the Supreme Court of Australia of Fink v. Robertson[3], with great care, and with respect must say that the dissenting judgment of Mr. Justice Higgins, to the effect that foreclosure under the Australian Act does not involve the release of the debt, and that the right to recover under the personal covenant still continues to exist, has led me to the conclusion that, applying the same principles to the Alberta Act, this appeal must be allowed. DAVIES J.\u2014In this appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, to which I have given much consideration, I concur with the reasons stated by my brother Anglin in allowing the appeal and restoring the judgment of the trial judge.\nI would simply add that if the legislature intended to make such a radical change in the relations and obligations of the mortgagor and mortgagee towards each other as held by the Appellate Division, namely, that the obtaining of a final order for foreclosure and its registration ipso facto extinguished the debt due to the mortgagor and estopped him from proceeding on the mortgagee's covenant to pay or from realising on any collateral securities he may have taken to secure payment of his debt they would have said so clearly and distinctly.\nUnder the law of England such a foreclosure on a common law mortgage admittedly did not extinguish the debt or prejudice the right of the mortgagee to recover on his collateral securities. Of course, the mortgagee could not after foreclosure claim to hold the land and at the same time sue on a covenant for the debt or recover it under his collateral securities. He could not have both land and the money secured upon it. If he chose to foreclose and then sell the land or part of it, he would be taken to have elected to take the land for his debt.\nBut in a case such as the present, where the mortgagee, though he has foreclosed, stands ready to reopen the foreclosure and able on being paid his debt to restore the land to the mortgagor, it does seem to me the inference drawn by the court below that under the \"Land Titles Act\" the foreclosure operated to ex- tinguish the debt and so deprive the mortgagee of his other remedies was a forced and improper one.\nIf that inference was the proper one and established as the law, investors would be very shy of loaning their money on mortgage security. At any rate, it is not an inference which I would draw from the Act under consideration; and if the legislature intended such a result they would have used language expressive of their intention.\nThe foreclosure order, when registered, bars, it is true, all further right of redemption on the part of the mortgagor; but so did the order for foreclosure under the old common law mortgage. But why should it be inferred under the statutory mortgage that such a foreclosure also extinguishes the unpaid debt secured and destroys all right in the mortgagee to realise on his collaterals under circumstances such as those under consideration where the mortgagee avows itself ready to open the foreclosure, receive payment of its debt and restore the land to the mortgagor?\nI am not able to draw such an inference.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant, by its policy of insurance dated the 4th January, 1911, insured the life of D. F. Douglas in the sum of $5,000 subject to conditions printed or written on the succeeding pages thereof, which were made part of the contract.\nAmongst other alternatives of payment so undertaken was one to pay the said sum on his death to the respondent, who was his wife, if she survived him.\nAmongst the conditions so printed were the following:\u2014\nBefore payment of this policy as a claim, any loan or other indebtedness thereon to the company, by the assured or by the beneficiary, and the balance of the year's premium (if any), will be deducted from the amount payable. No action or proceedings against the company shall be brought or taken upon this policy unless commenced within one year from the date at which the policy becomes a claim, and in any such action or proceedings the policy shall in all respects be construed according to the laws of the Province of Ontario.\nOn the 10th January, 1911, she, in consideration of $12,500 lent by appellant to her, gave it a mortgage on land in Calgary and therein covenanted to pay said sum with interest at seven per cent. per annum, and further covenanted to pay all the premiums upon the policy aforesaid during its currency, and that upon default of payment of any of said premiums, the company might pay the same and add the amount thereof to the principal money thereby received, and such payments should bear interest at seven per cent. per annum, and for the better securing the payment thereof she mortgaged her estate and interest in said land to said company.\nThe husband joined in said mortgage, as a covenantor with the company that she would pay the mortgage money and interest and said premiums, and abide by and perform all the covenants, provisoes and conditions in the said mortgage.\nThe mortgage was registered on the 12th of January, 1911, in the land registration district at Calgary.\nThey both, on the 10th January, 1911, assigned the insurance policy and all benefits thereunder to the said company and thereby it was declared that the assignment was made as a collateral security for the repayment of the said $12,500 and interest and for any further advances.\nThey never paid anything either on account of principal or interest or premiums save the cash premium.\nThe appellant, on the 26th August, 1915, took proceedings under section 62 (a) of the \"Land Titles Act\" of Alberta for sale of said lands and, failing that, fore- closure, which proceedings terminated by a final order of foreclosure on the 20th November, 1916, made by the deputy registrar which, in the operative part, reads as follows:\u2014\nIt is ordered that the mortgagor and all persons claiming through or under him subsequently to said mortgage do stand absolutely debarred and foreclosed of and from all rights to redeem the mortgaged premises mentioned in the application herein.\nAnd then follows a description of the land.\nThe usual affidavit, required by the Act to procure registration of the appellant as owner, was made, and the usual form of certificate issued that the appellant was then the owner of said lands\nsubject to the encumbrances, liens and interests notified by memorandum underwritten or indorsed hereon, or which may hereafter be made in the register.\nThere does not appear to be any reference therein to any encumbrances; much less note of the mortgage in question.\nI may remark in passing that the argument founded upon the assumption that vendors or transferors under the Act were by virtue thereof bound to pay prior encumbrances and hence a mortgagee getting a final order of foreclosure must be presumed to have assumed the burden of his own mortgage so foreclosed does not seem to get much support from this certificate.\nThe respondent's husband died on the 1st February, 1917. On the 2nd of April, 1917, the appellant applied the net amount of $4,460.53, which, if nothing else had to be considered, would have been the amount payable by virtue of the policy upon the mortgage debt, claiming the right to do so by virtue of the assignment of the policy.\nThe respondent, on the 9th May, 1917, began this action to recover the amount accrued due under said policy and claimed to be entitled to recover same. Notwithstanding the assignment thereof, to the appellant, the declaration of the respondent proceeds as if no such assignment had ever existed, and in truth, without saying anything as to it, impliedly assumes, as if in fact duly established, the rather startling propositions of law that a final order of foreclosure and the mere registration thereof and issue of a certificate thereof obliterates all prior legal relations and obligations and the rights springing therefrom, as if they had never existed, so far as anything relative to the conduct and acts of the mortgagor and possible rights in favour of the mortgagee springing therefrom; but preserving sacredly everything possibly springing from the acts of any one else which might, by any possibility, enure to the benefit of the mortgagor. Nay more, it presumes all such latter rights to have been duly transferred, ipso facto, as it were, to the mortgagor without any formal conveyance of any kind such as would formerly have been required in law to enable the mortgagor to assert his right thereto in any legal proceedings.\nThe possible rights, duties and obligations of trustees or sureties and others which might, in manifold ways needless to dwell upon, have arisen meanwhile from some of the many complications of such inter-relations as our modern commercial activities often produce, are presumably swept away for the benefit of the defaulting mortgagor by what may have been a mere thoughtless act on the part of the mortgagee so long as he has not been involved in fraud in procuring such registration.\nAccident or mistake cannot be rectified, for in effect the court, by its ruling, has said the result (unless possibly tainted with fraud involving him who has become such registered owner) obliterates all else standing\u2014for the protection of no matter whom or what\u2014in the way of the defaulter whose name has been deleted from the record, and the mortgagee's name substituted therefor.\nSuch would seem to be some few of the results of upholding the judgment appealed from and the mode of thought directly or impliedly approved as that to be used in the interpretation and construction of an act designed to improve and simplify the mode of dealing with and determining the rights and obligations of men in what is part of the daily intercourse of some one or more of them.\nAnother very obvious result of the maintenance thereof would be the impossibility of opening a foreclosure to relieve from oppression, free men from injustice, and rectify that which, in such like cases, has often been found to be the result of some trivial accidental oversight on the part of someone.\nLet us test the validity of such reasoning as would lead to such results by adverting to the relevant law which governed the rights and obligations of mortgagor and mortgagee up to, and at the time when, the statute now relied upon for the production of such results was enacted, and see if that law has been repealed thereby, or in the least invaded.\nI need not dwell upon the introduction of the English law into the North-West Territories.\nI am spared that trouble by the reiteration of so much thereof as we are concerned with herein, by the re-enactment, so late as 1907, of the sections 10 and 11 of the \"Supreme Court Act,\" statutes of Alberta, 1907, ch. 3, reading as follows:\u2014\n10. For the purpose of removing doubts and ambiguity but not so as to restrict the generality of the next preceding section, it is declared and enacted that the court shall have the like jurisdiction and powers as by the laws of England were, on the 15th July in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy, possessed and exercised by the Court of Chancery in England in respect of the matters hereinafter enumerated or referred to, that is to say:\n* * * * * *\n(b) In all matters relating to trusts, executors and administrators, co-partnerships and accounts, mortgages and awards, or to infants, idiots or lunatics and their estates;\n* * * * * *\n(i) The administration of justice in all cases where there exists no adequate remedy at law.\n11. The rules of decision in the said matters in the last preceding section mentioned shall, except where otherwise provided, be the same as governed the Court of Chancery in England in like cases on the 15th July, one thousand eight hundred and seventy.\nIf there can be said to have been finally settled anything in regard to the jurisdiction and power of the Court of Chancery in England at the date named it was the power of reopening a foreclosure and further imposing upon him who had foreclosed and sought to enforce thereafter his common law right which was otherwise undoubted such terms of procedure as would have the effect of doing justice between those concerned.\nIt was settled that he, seeking to impose his common law right of suing upon a covenant for the debt, must be ready to reopen the foreclosure and ready to restore that property which had become his as absolutely as the English language could express it and further that if he had sold and conveyed away the property he had so acquired he should be restrained from proceeding to enforce that common law right whether by suing upon the covenant or in way of asserting a proprietory right over any property he had held by way of collateral security to his mortgage.\nThe long line of cases, from the times of Lord Hardwicke down to the year 1870, need not be dwelt upon. However unsatisfactorily some of the earlier cases may have been dealt with, or reported, the case of Lockhart v. Hardy[4], decided, in 1846, by an able judge, well conversant with equity jurisprudence, in a considered judgment, expresses the law as it existed and maintains what I have just stated.\nMerely to shew that such law continued as late as July, 1870, I may refer to the case of Kinnaird v. Trollope[5], wherein at p. 642 Mr. Justice Stirling reaffirms the law so laid down, citing also Palmer v. Hendrie[6], decided by Sir John Romilly in 1860, and presenting another aspect of the application of the principles involved and adopted. That was when the mortgagee and the mortgagor had united in disposing of the estate.\nSuch being the undoubted state of the law which the Supreme Court of Alberta was in 1907 required to observe, how can we find any substantive amendment altering the rights of the parties in that regard or a repeal thereof in the language of section 62 (a) of the \"Land Titles Act\" of Alberta?\nIt is certainly not so expressed therein. Nor does such result seem to have been in the faintest degree part of the purpose of the enactment. It seems to me clear that the sole purposes of the enactment were to simplify and thus improve the procedure in simple cases of foreclosure and cheapen the law, and as sub-section 15 seems to indicate, to safeguard the interest of mortgagors by requiring an attempt at sale before issuing an order of foreclosure.\nThe net result is stated in sub-section 16 as follows:\nEvery order of foreclosure under the hand of the registrar when entered in the register shall have the effect of vesting in the mortgagee or encumbrancee the land mentioned in such order free from all right and equity of redemption on the part of the owner, mortgagor or encumbrancer or any person claiming through or under him subsequently to the mortgage or encumbrance; and such mortgagee or encumbrancee shall, upon such entry being made, be deemed a transferee of the land and become the owner thereof and be entitled to receive a certificate of title for the same.\nThere is nothing in the legal result which I can see differentiating the result of a foreclosure under and by means of section 62 (a) from that by way of section 62 which stands effective\u2014same test must apply to foreclosure in either case.\nWhat is there in this language but an expression of just such results as flowed from a foreclosure in all past history in the obtaining of same in the Court of Chancery?\nThe effect of that always had been to vest the mortgaged estate or interest in the land if not already vested in the mortgagee as in some such cases it might not have been.\nIt was not always the effect, of a mortgage which came to be foreclosed, to have conveyed an estate in the land though frequently it so happened to be the case.\nA mortgage that fell short of doing so might, if the necessities of the case so demanded, or if the parties so desired have been created by them in some one of many ways, and even I suspect in the terms of the \"Land Titles Act,\" if such a method chosen, and if for the purpose of the enforcement thereof by way of foreclosure it fell within the necessities of the execution of justice between the parties to make a vesting order part of the foreclosure, I imagine the Court of Chancery would have been equal to the emergency a good many years before July, 1870.\nBut, after all, by the \"Land Titles Act\" it is not absolute ownership of the estate but only that subject to prior encumbrances and claims created by the mortgagor or his predecessors that is in truth vested; cleared, however, of all subsequent encumbrances or conveyances by or through the mortgagor.\nThen there is given as to that so vested nothing more than has been stated by so eminent an authority as Lord Selborne in the case of Pough v. Heath[7], as follows:\u2014\nThis being the position of the title, as long as the mortgage is redeemable, the effect of an order of foreclosure absolute is to vest the ownership of, and the beneficial title to the land, for the first time, in a person who previously was a mere encumbrancer. The equitable estate of the mortgagor is then forfeited and transferred to the mortgagee. It is transferred as effectually as if it had been conveyed or released. \"A foreclosure\" (said Lord Hardwicke) \"is considered as a new purchase of the land.\" \"The mortgage being foreclosed\" (said Sir William Grant) \"the estate becomes absolutely his.\" \"By the order made in the foreclosure suit\" (said Sir Lancelot Shadwell) \"he became the absolute owner.\" Casborne v. Scarfe[8]; Silberschildt v. Schiott[9]; Le Gros v. Cockered[10]. The title obtained by such \"new purchase\"' did not, before the \"Wills Act\" of 1838, pass by general words in a will, duly attested to pass real estate, made before the foreclosure and not afterwards republished; it did pass, if such will were republished after foreclosure, or if a new will in like general terms were then made.\nIt follows from this state of the law, that when the owner of land under an ordinary decree of foreclosure absolute takes proceedings to recover possession of that land, he seeks possession of that which, by a title newly accrued, has for the first time become his own property; and that it can make no difference whether the title which he previously had as a mere incumbrancer was, or was not, protected by a legal estate. The possession which he now claims, and the right by virtue of which he seeks to recover it, are substantially different from the possession which he might before have claimed, and from the right by virtue of which he might have claimed it. \"There car be no two things\" (said Lord Manners in Blake v. Foster)[11], \"more distinct or opposite than possession as mortgagee and possession as owner of the estate; nor can anything be more hazardous or inconvenient than the possession of a mortgagee, the manner in which he is called to account is most rigorous and severe. One consequence of the decision, that a mortgagee who obtains a foreclosure absolute is not safe against the Statute of Limitations under circumstances like those of the present case, would be to make it necessary for him (under such circumstances) to take possession while still mortgagee, or, it if were resisted, to bring ejectment for that purpose, on pain of forfeiting his title and of becoming liable, if a trustee (as the present plaintiffs are), for a loss by breach of trust of the whole value of the estate.\nThese are expressions by masters of the law and of the English language as to the effect of a final order of foreclosure.\nI do not think the Alberta legislature can have meant more in their language which I have just quoted.\nTo suggest that the court cannot interfere with the registrar seems, I respectfully submit, like playing upon words. All the court does is to operate upon the parties who must obey or be enjoined by the Supreme Court to do that which that statute above quoted enabled to be done.\nNo case I have seen goes so far as to carry such power as the Court of Chancery had into operation by vesting or divesting any estate. I am not assuming, however, that the court in a proper case is powerless to deal with the register. I am merely dealing with the only argument on this head that the respondent presents as derivable from the nature of the order and the language of the Act relative thereto. The necessities of this case do not involve more than a recognition of the power in the court to enjoin him seeking to assert a right to desist therefrom unless and until he retransfers, or is ready to do so, all that he got by his foreclosure.\nThere is another argument presented in which the doctrine of merger is made to do duty.\nThere is nothing in the common law doctrine of merger relative to the meeting of greater and lesser estates in the same person, or other common law mergers which can be found here to apply and support the argument; or that the contract of the parties, as a whole, merged in the order for foreclosure. Nor can I see how the doctrine of merger as founded upon intention of the parties can be made to operate, unless we discard all judicial opinion and assume that those who developed the law we are asked to apply to determine what is in question between the parties herein were too stupid to have seen the point till the present day.\nThe law invoked by appellant herein has been often applied under circumstances which, far more forcibly than anything in this simple case suggests, presented the probability of an intention to abide by the foreclosure and abandon all other rights, yet such was not the conclusion drawn by the many eminent judges who have had to solve the problem, and all the while the doctrines of merger were recognised as in force where properly applicable. I prefer abiding by the law they made. Because the machinery by which the law may have been administered has been changed that furnishes no reason for changing or presuming to change the substantial and well-known principles of the law; especially so when we find it emphasised by such recent enactment as I have quoted from the \"Supreme Court Act\", of Alberta, 1907, in section 11, where the duty to observe it is enjoined \"except where otherwise provided\" and no such otherwise provision is or can be referred to bearing upon the duty so prescribed for us to follow.\nThe case of Fink v. Robertson[12], relied upon below, does not bind us, and is not of any value save for the reasoning it may furnish. Having read it, I may say respectfully that I prefer the reasoning of Mr. Justice Higgins, the dissenting judge, to that of the Chief Justice. But there are many other considerations than those presented therein which enter into what binds us here, which may not have existed in Australia and bound that court; many others such as the legislation which assigns and defines the jurisdiction of the courts there should have to be entered into or brought forward to enable us to intelligently deal with the conclusion therein before we could make the decision applicable to the law governing the Alberta courts and us herein. The absence of many statutes, even of that country, from our reach, render it an impossibility to accept it as our guide unless we go it blind. I prefer trying to see where I am going. Hence I shall not labour with that decision. I cannot deprive appellant of its clear right unless upon an express legislative declaration of the law. And if I had to draw an inference of the intention I should want something much more clear and explicit than exists herein pointing the way to go.\nAbove all, in attributing to any one an election I cannot try to impose upon those concerned in any such relation the absolute renunciation of the law and language relative to what a foreclosure means in the minds of those accustomed thereto unless they have given them clear and explicit legislative declarations as a guide. Speculative inferences of what might be done under a new system are no ground for attributing to others the implication of an election or the duty to make it. The inference of fact I should draw is that nobody concerned on behalf of appellant ever paid the slightest attention to those remains of a wreckage. If they did they probably concluded the policy was worthless and would never be maintained.\nI incline to infer it was only part of the one scheme the parties had in question, namely, the loan and its security. Nothing was ever paid nor was, I suspect, likely to be paid, but the first cash premium.\nThe unexpected death of Mr. Douglas, after the foreclosure, suggested to someone the possibilities of that confusion of thought which sometimes succeeds, though in justice presenting no merits, for not only had the claim been assigned to appellant and was as much out of the respondent's power as if she had assigned it to someone else, but also by a condition written in the policy itself it had been made subject to any debt due appellant.\nI fail to see how she can recover unless and until she has redeemed her promise in that assignment and that suggests to me that the law of Ontario which was to have been, by the policy, the limit of the right to recover might well have been held as determining that right.\nNothing was made of that and I do not rely upon it for any purpose but to illustrate how many things remain untouched but yet might fall within the range of a judgment maintaining that appealed from.\nThe adoption by the framers of the \"Land Titles Act\" of a principle or form of mortgage drawn from the civil law yet grafting thereon rights defined by language using terms of foreclosure, etc., found in our equity jurisprudence, unknown to the development of that law elsewhere, suggests curious reflections and considerations; especially when reminded of how much of that jurisprudence has been drawn from the civil law.\nI can conceive of a case where the beneficiary had gone on paying premiums for years after the foreclosure and then entirely different considerations would arise and possibly in law an entirely different result might be reached. The appeal should be allowed with costs here and in the appellate court below, and the judgment of the trial judge be restored and, if desired, notwithstanding her renunciation of such right, provision be made for her redeeming within the usual time, after taking an account of what is the right sum due, the said lands upon the footing of the said insurance money being deducted from the sum found due on the mortgage.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The plaintiff sues to recover the proceeds of an insurance policy on the life of her deceased husband held by the defendant company as collateral security to a mortgage made by him to secure a loan from the company. This mortgage, given under the Alberta \"Land Titles Act,\" was foreclosed by an order of the registrar made under sub-section 16 of section 62 (a) of that statute. The company still holds the land foreclosed. It applied the proceeds of the policy on its mortgage debt, offering to allow the plaintiff, as her deceased husband's representative, to redeem on payment of the balance of its claim. The plaintiff, however, insists that the effect of the foreclosure under sub-section 16 of section 62 (a) was to release or extinguish the mortgage debt and to discharge all securities held as collateral therefor, because the mortgagee thereby became vested with an irredeemable title to the land and the courts, thereafter, could not compel it to open the foreclosure as a condition of attempting to realise the mortgage debt. This is the issue presented by the defendant's appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, which, reversing the trial judge (Simmons J.), upheld the plaintiff's contention[13].\nFor the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Higgins in his dissenting judgment in Fink v. Robertson[14], I incline to think I should have been of the opinion that, as the Alberta \"Land Titles Act\" stood after the introduction of section 62 (a) in 1915 (ch. 3, sec. 2), an order of foreclosure made by the registrar under that section had no effect upon the mortgagors' covenant for payment and the mortgagee's rights in respect thereof other than or different from that which a final order of foreclosure granted by the court under section 62 would have had. The operation and the consequences of an absolute order of foreclosure obtained under the ordinary jurisdiction of a court of equity\u2014those of an order made under section 62 must be the same\u2014as well as its history are stated in the Fink Case14. See, too. Campbell v. Holyland[15]; Platt v. Ashbridge [16]; Trinity College v. Hill[17].\nAs pointed out by Mr. Justice Higgins in dealing with section 130 of the Victoria \"Transfer of Land Act,\" 1890, which corresponds with sub-section 16 of section 62 (a) of the Alberta \"Land Titles Act,\" the term \"foreclosure\" used in each is a technical term, descriptive of a well-established equitable remedy to which well-known rights and incidents are attached. It may be somewhat inappropriate in a system under which a mortgage is merely a security and transfers no estate to the mortgagee. But there is nothing to warrant the assumption that the legislature meant that the \"foreclosure\" order which it empowered the registrar of titles to grant should have an effect upon the relations between the mortgagor and the mortgagee and their respective rights in regard to the mortgage debt and the securities held for it, including the foreclosed property, greater than and essentially different from that which courts of equity had for many years given to their foreclosure decrees. That its operation was intended to be similar is further indicated, if indeed not conclusively established, by the fact that the language in which its effect upon the title to the land and the mortgagor's interest therein is stated in the statute, viz., that the land shall be vested in the mortgagee or encumbrancee\nfree from all right and equity redemption on the part of the owner, mortgagor or encumbrancer, or any person claiming, through or under him, subsequently to the mortgagee or incumbrancee\nis, as Higgins J. points out at p. 885, substantially that of the foreclosure orders absolute issued by courts of equity (Seton on Decrees, 3rd ed., p. 1393). The provision for the vesting of the land and declaring that the mortgagee or incumbrancee obtaining the order shall be deemed a transferee and become the owner thereof were necessary, as that learned judge says, because a mortgage under the Act does not operate as a transfer but only as a security and is analogous to the direction inserted in an equity decree for the foreclosure of an equitable mortgage\u2014that the mortgagor shall execute a conveyance of the land.\nI do not find in the provisions that a mortgagee foreclosing under sub-section 16 is to be deemed a transferee of the land and that a transferee of land subject to a mortgage or encumbrance impliedly covenants to indemnify the transferor against the same (section 52) anything to warrant the conclusion sought to be drawn from them\u2014that it was intended that an order of foreclosure under section 62 (a) (16) should have the effect of releasing or extinguishing the mortgagor's covenant. In the first place the mortgagee does not become a transferee from the mortgagor\u2014the mortgagor is not his transferor. There is no\ninstrument transferring land subject to a mortgage or encumbrance, and it is only in such an instrument that section 52 imports the covenant of indemnity by the transferee. The land is vested in the mortgagee free from the mortgage or encumbrance. Section 52, in my opinion, has no application to the statutory transfer effected by a foreclosure order made under sub-section 16.\nI should require much more explicit language than anything found elsewhere in the Alberta \"Land Titles Act\" to justify the inference that \"foreclosure\" under section 62 (a) (16) was meant to be something so essentially different from any other foreclosure that it has the effect of extinguishing the mortgage debt, thus releasing all collateral securities, rendering it impossible for the mortgagee to proceed on his covenant and depriving the court of jurisdiction, however exceptional the circumstances (short of fraud), upon proper terms to relieve the mortgagor from the loss of his property.\nReference may also be made to The Premier Permanent Land & Investment Association, Ex parte Lyall[18], and Noble v. Campbell[19].\nOrser v. Colonial Investment and Loan Co.[20]; Bernard v. Faulkner[21]; and Richards v. Thomson[22], cited in argument do not really help much in the determination of the case at bar. As far as they go they assist the appellant. All three, however, were cases of proceedings for foreclosure taken in court. In the first the order of foreclosure itself contained a judgment for personal payment making it impossible to maintain successfully that the personal liability of the mortgagor was extinguished. In the second the court, on an application heard ex parte, allowed a reservation of the mortgagor's personal liability to be expressed in its foreclosure order. In the third the mortgagee had transferred the land to a bona fide purchaser for value and thereafter neither he nor the mortgagor could have had any right in equity to have the foreclosure opened.\nNor do the decisions in Williams v. Box[23], and Smith v. National Trust Co.[24], materially aid either party. The former rests on an amendment to section 126 of the Manitoba \"Real Property Act\" held to have restored to the court (if it was ever taken away) the jurisdiction over mortgages which it had before the \"Real Property Act\" was passed. A somewhat similar provision in section 10 of the Alberta \"Supreme Court Act\" of 1907, ch. 3, long antedates section 62 (a) of the Alberta \"Land Titles Act,\" whereas the amendment to section 126 of the Manitoba \"Real Property Act\" was passed subsequently to the enactment of sub-sections 113 and 114 of that statute under which the foreclosure in Williams v. Box 23 was bad. It must always be remembered, however, that a certificate of title is, under section 44 of the Alberta Act, as under section 71 of the Manitoba statute, conclusive evidence at law and in equity only \"so long as it remains in force.\" Mr. Justice Idington emphasises the fact in Williams v. Box, 23 at p. 12.\nAll that was decided in Smith v. National Trust Co. 24 was that in a mortgage of property under the Manitoba \"Real Property Act\" (R.S.M. 1907, ch. 148), an express power of sale, at all events if it do not explicitly otherwise provide, must be exercised under and in accordance with the requirements of the sections of that Act governing the exercise of the statutory-power of sale which it confers. (Sub-sections 109 et seq.) While Mr. Justice Duff, who wrote the Majority judgment, says of the mortgagee, at p. 641, that\nhis rights and powers must rest directly upon the provisions of the statute itself,\nhe significantly adds:\nThis view, of course, does not involve the consequence that the mortgagee's rights are those only which the statute expressly gives him. It is obvious that many things are left to implication; and where, in any particular case, it appears that the rules governing reciprocal rights of the mortgagor and mortgagee under the mortgage contract in relation to the mortgaged property are left to implication then it is a question to be determined upon an examination of the statute as a whole how far the rights of the parties are to be governed by the rules of law which, apart from the statute, are applicable as between mortgagor and mortgagee.\nMy learned brother had already said:\u2014\nThere is much in the Act to indicate an intention on the part of its authors that, under the statutory mortgage, the powers and rights of the mortgagee should, in substance, be economically equivalent to those possessed by a mortgagee under a common law mortgage\u2014\nan observation which applies with equal force to the Land Titles Act of Alberta.\nBut whatever might have been the effect of section 62 (a) as originally enacted, the adoption of the proviso to section 62 contained in section 4 of the \"Statute Law Amendment Act\" of 1916, ch. 3, in my opinion, leaves no room for doubt as to its proper construction. That proviso reads:\u2014\nProvided, however, that where proceedings in respect of any mortgage or incumbrance have already been, or hereafter shall have been, commenced under the provisions of the next following section, no proceedings under this section for the enforcement of the covenant for payment shall be commenced, or if commenced, shall be continued until the remedies provided by the next following section are exhausted.\nWhere proceedings have been begun under section 62 (a) this proviso expressly stays all curial proceedings to enforce payment until nothing more can be done under that section, i.e., until an order for foreclosure under sub-section 16 has been made and registered and a certificate of title issued to the mortgagee. Only then are the remedies provided by section 62 (a) \"exhausted.\" It would be difficult to conceive of a more distinct legislative recognition of the fact that the taking of any or all the remedies under section 62 (a) does not release the mortgage debt or extinguish the right of the mortgagee to proceed to enforce payment on his mortgagor's covenant. In the enactment that if the mortgagee has begun proceedings under section 62 (a) he cannot proceed upon his mortgagor's covenant until he has obtained the order of foreclosure\u2014the ultimate remedy for which sub-section 16 of that section provides\u2014the implication that he may then do so is irresistible.\nA somewhat similar provision for the case of foreclosure proceedings in court under section 62 was made at the same time by clause (b) of section 4 of the Act of 1916, ch. 3. In connection with this latter provision it may be observed in passing that where foreclosure has been obtained it may be a little difficult to determine\nthe amount of the judgment or mortgage debt remaining unsatisfied.\nBut with that difficulty we are not now concerned.\nI am for the foregoing reasons, with respect, of the opinion that the judgment of the learned trial judge was right and should be restored. The appellant should have its costs in this court and in the Appellate Division.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur in the result.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 13 Alta.

The issues of fact were tried by a jury. From the facts proved, the inference of negligence was drawn by the jury with the concurrence of the trial judge and, on appeal, the verdict was confirmed.\nThe respondents, plaintiffs below, are the mother and daughter of one Scarff, in his lifetime an employee of the railway company, who was killed in the course of that employment.\nThree questions are raised on this appeal: (1) From the facts proved might negligence be legitimately inferred by the jury against both defendants? (2) Was the deceased's death caused by his own fault? (3) Are both appellants, as joint authors of the wrong, jointly and severally liable for the whole damage, or, in other words, are both appellants jointly and severally liable for the consequences of an accident caused by independent acts of negligence committed by the servants of both on the same occasion, or in connection with the same occurrence, and contributing directly to that accident?\nIn my opinion, the first and third questions should be answered in the affirmative.\nTo dispose of the third question, which is purely one of law, I adopt the opinion expressed by a learned writer in the \"Revue Trimestrielle de Droit Civil,\" 4 (1905), p. 341, who puts the question and answer in these words:\u2014\nQuand y a-t-il solidarit\u00e9 entre les auteurs d'un d\u00e9lit civil?\nLa Cour de Cassation, dans son arr\u00eat du 3 juin 1902 (Pand. fr. 1905, 1. 104) s'est-elle \u00e9cart\u00e9e de sa jurisprudence ant\u00e9rieure quant aux conditions n\u00e9cessaires pour que la solidarit\u00e9 soit prononc\u00e9e entre les auteurs d'un quasi-d\u00e9lit? Il ne suffit pas, disait-elle, il y a peu d'ann\u00e9es (Cass. civ. 13 juin, 1895, D. 96, 1. 31), pour que la solidarit\u00e9 soit prononc\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re de responsabilit\u00e9 provenant d'un quasi-d\u00e9lit, que la faute declar\u00e9e soit commune \u00e0 un certain nombre de d\u00e9fendeurs; il faut de plus qu'il soit constat\u00e9 que cette faute est dans de telles conditions d'indivisibilit\u00e9 que toute r\u00e9partition est impossible entre ceux qui l'ont commise. (V. de m\u00eame Cass. 12 F\u00e9ve. 1899, D. 79, 1. 281).\nOr dans l'arr\u00eat de 1902, la Chambre civile, apr\u00e8s avoir constat\u00e9 que ce dommage est implicable \u00e0 la faute commune de plusieurs, ajoute \"que cette faute a concouru \u00e0 produire l'entier dommage subi par la partie l\u00e9s\u00e9e, que d\u00e8s lors la condamnation a pu \u00eatre mise solidairement \u00e0 leur charge.\" Il ne nous semble pas que cette diversit\u00e9 d'expression cache une id\u00e9e diff\u00e9rente; car si on a pu causer l'entier dommage, la faute a \u00e9t\u00e9 indivisible.\nThe jury having found on sufficient evidence that the accident resulted from the common negligence of the employees of the city and the railway, they are both in law jointly and severally liable for the damage\u2014 1106 C.C. Vide Piper v. Winnifrith[2].\nDealing now with the first question, I am satisfied that from the facts proved, and I have read the evidence with great care, the jury might legitimately draw the inference of negligence against both defendants.\nThe circumstances of the accident are not very fully given by the witnesses. Although referred to, no plan of the locality was filed at the trial, probably for the reason given by Mr. Lafleur at the argument here. The place was so well known to the jurors that each of them was presumed to have a photograph of it in his mind. The deceased, who was the chief actor, was not present to speak for his wife and children, and the jury was obliged to rely for the details of the occurrence almost exclusively on the version of those to whose fault the accident was attributed; interested as they were to exculpate themselves and their employers. All of which tends to give additional weight to the verdict.\nThe accident occurred at the intersection of the railway, at rail level, by the street formerly known as Ste. Elizabeth, now De Courcelles street, a very busy thoroughfare in the city of Montreal. When the crossing was made originally (1900) the city assumed the obligation to put up gates and keep a watchman constantly in attendance. By reason of the increased traffic, in 1911, the Railway Board ordered the city to put up modern gates. The railway had the right of way, and the municipality assumed the obligation to protect the traffic using the crossing.\nAt the time of the occurrence a number of empty passenger cars were being moved from the railway station to a place immediately beyond and westward of the DeCourcelles street crossing. The train consisting of 14 empty cars was moving reversely, the engine pushing the cars. Brunet, the company's foreman, was in charge, and it was his duty to direct the whole operation, having special regard to the protection of the public using the street crossing. To do this effectively, Brunet required to be in touch with the engine driver who controlled the motive power, and Scarff, who was at the end of the train as it approached the crossing. There was a curve in the line which made it necessary for Brunet to place himself in the middle of the train so as to be in communication with both ends. It was obviously necessary for him, before giving instructions to the engine driver, to know the conditions at the crossing.\nScarff's duties are thus defined in the company's plea:\nThe said late Charles J. Scarff, under special instruction from his foreman, was seat to the said DeCourcelles street crossing for the sole purpose of safeguarding public traffic over said crossing during the shunting operations upon which the crew in charge of said train was engaged at the time.\nThe traffic at DeCourcelles street crossing was controlled by the city, under the order of the Railway Board, by gates which were opened only when the man in charge, Racicot, saw that there was no train in the vicinity. His instructions were verbal and, when examined as a witness, he says:\u2014\nOn m'a dit que j'aurais \u00e0 \"watcher\" les trains et fermer les barri\u00e8res.\nHe had no time table or other means of knowing when the trains reached the crossing; he was dependent on his own judgment as to his action with respect to the gates.\nIn answer to a question from the bench, Mr. Lafleur admitted that the shunting operations continued until the cars were stowed away, i.e., had reached their destination west of DeCourcelles street.\nThe jury found that the accident was attributable to two distinct acts, both of which contributed directly to the death of Scarff. In the course of the shunting operations, it was necessary to pick up a car which was on a track alongside the main line on which the train was being moved from the station, and for that purpose the whole train was backed up till within 40 or 50 feet of the crossing and there brought to a standstill. The train was then broken in two, i.e., a certain number of the cars nearest the engine were detached and run on to the siding to pick up the car that was there, and all were then moved back to the main track where the other cars had been left. When all the cars were coupled, on a signal from the foreman Brunet, the train in the process of shunting was moved towards the crossing, and Brunet then left his post on the outside and stood on the steps of one of the cars, where he was no longer in touch with the engine driver or Scarff, as found by the jury. In the meantime, Racicot, seeing the cars nearest the crossing stopped, assumed that he might safely open the gate, which he did, thus permitting a large number of people to get on the track. Seeing the imminent danger in which these people were placed, as the train was approaching the crossing running reversely, and unable to signal the engineer through Brunet, who had left his post, Scarff rushed forward to reach the signal cock so as to notify the engine driver of the danger, and in the attempt lost his life. It is said that he was negligent in what he did. Scarff may have assumed very heavy risks and even acted imprudently, but it must be borne in mind that he was dealing with a state of things due to the defendants' negligence. And, having read the evidence, I am satisfied that the finding of the jury, that in the circumstances he was free from fault, is fully justified. In a most trying emergency, he did his best (Laurent 20, p. 520, No. 489), and the jury evidently did not believe Menard's story about the removal of the signal whistle. So that, on the whole, I am fully satisfied that the finding of the jury to the effect that the accident was attributable exclusively to the acts of both Brunet and Racicot is borne out by the evidence.\nSome questions were raised as to prescription and insufficiency of the notice. The acts of the employees of both the city and the company contributed to the death of Scarff, and the notice to the city was sufficient. The action was taken en temps utile against the company, and that was sufficient to interrupt prescription against the city (Laurent, vol. 17, Nos. 304 & 294; articles 1106 & 2231 C.C.).\nOn the whole, this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDavies J.\u2014I concur in dismissing these appeals; but I do so with much doubt: which, however, has not ripened into a conviction that the judgment appealed from was erroneous. My duty, as I conceive it, therefore, is to dismiss the appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014I am of opinion that the evidence herein was such that the learned trial judge was right in submitting it to the jury and that their findings of fact bind us to apply such relevant law thereto as may be applicable.\nIn all its essential features I agree with the lucid statement of the case as presented by the judgment of Mr. Justice Lane on behalf of the Court of Review in support of the judgment appealed from.\nI need not repeat, however, but may add what the argument here has suggested.\nA perusal of the entire evidence in the case, except part of Menard's, which calls for little attention, convinces me clearly of one thing. It is that the stories of Racicot and of Benoit are in absolute conflict, in regard to the essential facts which furnish a crucial test of the weight to be given Racicot's version relative to his opening and shutting the gates.\nHe tells of a rush as it were of 5 or 6 vehicles from each side, when he opened the gates and that they all disappeared before the accident in question except a waggon loaded with brick which had not quite reached but was approaching the track on which the accident took place.\nThat story of their complete disappearance as the result of successful crossing by so many vehicles at one opening of the gates, before Benoit had been able during same opening to travel the short space he did to get where he saw deceased gesticulating in despair, is quite untrue if Benoit's story is even only approximately correct.\nI can see no reason for disbelieving a word Benoit has said. He was not a stranger to the crossing nor an idler, but knew well he had at such an hour to be prompt in entering when the gate, for the raising of which he had waited and watched, should permit him doing so.\nThe suggestion of the appellants' counsel in answer to my questions for explanation of this feature of the case that Benoit had wasted time watching some leak in an auto does not seem warranted by anything in the evidence. If counsel at the trial had imagined that Benoit had loitered behind others, pushing onward, he certainly should, and doubtless would, have pressed him on the point in a way that is not apparent.\nAgain Benoit swears to a delivery waggon approaching as he did and thus unintentionally demonstrates that Racicot's story is incorrect.\nBut more marvellous than all is that neither the man who had the load of brick is forthcoming as a witness, nor a single other one of the ten to a dozen like witnesses seemingly available to corroborate Racicot by shewing that they had crossed as he says.\nThe accident was far too important for either appellant interested in demonstrating that it had discharged its duty to the public to say nothing of what is involved in this action, to accept such a remarkable conflict of evidence as not requiring further inquiry and production of the testimony if Racicot's story is true.\nThere was a coroner's inquest at which both these witnesses testified.\nThe jury herein evidently disbelieved Racicot and accepted Benoit's story.\nThere are a number of minor things in Racicot's story which I need not dwell upon but which doubtlessly helped the jury to reach the conclusion they did. I must not, however, pass thus what he tells of the number of times that these gates would be opened in the course of a day.\nPerhaps four or five hundred times a day was his reply when questioned there anent, adding he had never counted.\nThere were three men, as I understand him, each taking his turn on such duty in the course of the 24 hours.\nNo doubt the jury knew without being told that of the needed raising and lowering of gates thus spoken of by far the greater part would fall within a comparatively few hours. A man loaded with such a task at the noon hour with three gates to keep an eye upon and the possibilities of sixteen tracks to be watched without the aid of any system but his own eyes can hardly be charged with wilful false swearing if he happen to get confused and shrinking from blame for the life of another persuades himself that there was only one raising and lowering of the gates in question within a given time which he had no accurate means of measuring.\nI think the jury was quite right in accepting Benoit's story in preference to that given by a single witness under such circumstances, and especially so when the latter's story was left uncorroborated and could have been corroborated, if true, and a proper effort made to procure testimony from such a stream of travel as indicated.\nThis is not the defence of a poor helpless creature for whom a semblance of excuse might be found, but of a city armed with the necessary equipment for tracing and bringing forward these missing witnesses.\nEvidently Racicot confuses the occasions of his opening and shutting of gates and forgets the one testified to by Benoit and which is the one we have to deal with.\nThe case rests upon inferences to be drawn by the jury from established facts, and I cannot say that any single one of their findings must be held such as twelve or nine out of twelve reasonable men could not properly arrive at on the evidence presented.\nThe findings of fact are quite sufficient in law to maintain the judgment appealed from.\nThe city appellant claims that it has no responsibility for the failure to protect the public using the crossing and tries to get some support for such contention in the wording of the order made by the Board of Railway Commissioners. That order is not the sole basis of its responsibility and indeed has very little to do with it.\nThe agreement entered into between the two appellants must be looked at, as well as the order of the Board and back of both the law upon which they were founded.\nThat agreement was entered into on the 8th November, 1900. It sets forth that the crossing of the railway company's yards by an extension of Ste. Elizabeth street is to be permitted by the railway company, that the city will place crossing gates and watchmen to operate said gates, at its own expense, and then by clause 3 agrees as follows:\u2014\nThe said corporation further agree to hold the said company free and harmless from any expense in connection with such temporary arrangement and protect them from all claims, costs, proceedings and expense for accidents occurring during its continuance.\nThe law upon which this rested is the \"Railway Act\" of 1888, as amended and interpreted and construed by the judgments in several cases. This court, in The City of Toronto v. The Grand Trunk Railway Company[3], held that a municipality in which a highway crossed a railway was a person interested within the meaning of sections 187 and 188 of said Act, and that the Railway Committee of the Privy Council had jurisdiction to make the order it had made, and which was there in question imposing the obligation upon the municipality to bear a share of the expenses of guarding and protecting the crossings such as there in question.\nLeave to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was refused.\nThe story of the struggle between railway companies and municipalities, up to that time, relative to the possible responsibility of the municipality appears in the several cases cited in the report of the argument in said case.\nThe powers formally exercised by the Committee of the Privy Council in this regard became by the legislation creating the Board of Railway Commissioners vested in that Board. And the effect thereof was exemplified by an appeal to this court in the case of Ottawa Electric Railway Company v. The City of Ottawa and the Canada Atlantic Railway Company[4] to test the power of the Board in that regard. The power was maintained by the judgment of this court.\nThat establishes the principle of law upon which, by anticipation of its affirmation as it were, no doubt the parties concerned as appellants here had acted in entering into the agreement I have referred to and in which they, by a clause thereof, shew that the expedient of gates and watchmen was only temporary, for they evidently, as the agreement shews, expected a bridge over the railway as \u00e1 substitute therefor to be constructed at their joint expense some day. The city appellant is clearly liable by virtue of its agreement to indemnify the railway company.\nThe later order of the Board was, no doubt, made by reason of some one complaining of the inefficient protection given up to that time but it does not affect this case one way or another any more than if the order had been to paint the gates red or white.\nBut for the supervision of that Board, experience teaches that neither of such like parties will always maintain in a high state of efficiency such like expedients for accommodating and protecting the travelling public.\nThe city sets up that this action was barred as to it by the special Statute of Limitations in its charter. I do not think so. I hold they were jointly liable to respondent.\nThe appeal does not raise any question for us to decide as between them who ultimately may have to bear the burden of their neglect.\nWhatever might have been said at one time as to the right of a railway company to shift its own legitimate burden on to municipalities, there is none of that here in question. The creation of the crossing in question and its operation was a joint enterprise no matter how they divided the necessary labour attendant thereon and the results following therefrom and incidental thereto must be borne jointly, even though in part there is involved the duty by the company towards its servants, in that as well as in other respects. Each contributed more than its due share to the result that is before us. As between them and others the obligation was jointly within the meaning of the code.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014For the reasons stated by my Lord the Chief Justice and my brother Brodeur, I agree in their opinion that if both the defendants were responsible for the death of the plaintiff's husband, their liability is joint and several. It follows that the plea of prescription made by the city of Montreal fails.\nWe should also decline to disturb the ruling of the learned trial judge that the plaintiff's failure to give notice of her claim to the city corporation within 30 days after her husband was killed was excused by her ignorance of the fact that the city controlled the gates at the DeCourcelles street crossing. She believed, not unreasonably, that they were operated by the Grand Trunk Railway Company.\nWhile I might have taken another view as to the proper conclusion to be drawn from the evidence if dealing with it as a trial judge, I agree with Mr. Justice Lane, who delivered the judgment of the Court of Review, that the jury may not improperly have preferred to rely upon Benoit's evidence rather than on that of Racicot, and may not unreasonably have drawn the inference that the latter had carelessly opened the crossing gates after the Grand Trunk train had started to move towards the crossing. This inference would negative any neglect of duty on the part of the deceased Scarff in giving the signal on which that train moved, which, of course, should not be presumed.\nI have not been convinced that the jury was not warranted in holding that Scarff's attempt to stop the train by opening the angle-cock under the foremost car coming towards him\u2014which undoubtedly cost him his life\u2014did not amount to fault or contributory negligence. Unless he was responsible for the air whistle not being in place and available for use, he was not to blame for the existence of a situation which left him no other means of attempting to save the lives put in jeopardy by Racicot's negligent opening of the gates. In an emergency, he imperilled his life in an effort to save others, praiseworthy not merely because of its heroism, but also because it evidenced zeal in the discharge of duty and in safeguarding the interests of his employers. An act done upon such an impulse, although under other circumstances inexcusably rash, may well be held not to have been a fault.\nThe jury evidently did not believe Menard, the chief witness whose testimony would establish that Scarff was himself responsible for the air whistle not having been in its place, and it is impossible to say that in doing so they were clearly influenced by any improper motive or were manifestly wrong. Yet I cannot help thinking that, even rejecting this testimony, had the jury found that Scarff had failed to place or to keep the air whistle where it should have been and could have been used by him without danger, such an inference from the proven facts would have been warranted and could not have been disturbed. Indeed, I am not entirely satisfied that it is not the most reasonable inference from the rest of the evidence, omitting entirely that given by Menard. But the jury has found otherwise and I am not prepared to say that their finding is so clearly against all the evidence that it should be set aside.\nUpon the argument I also entertained grave doubt whether the action of Brunet in entering the train where he was unable to see Scarff after transmitting his signal to start, instead of remaining on the platform about 10 feet from the side of the train, where he could have seen Scarff in order to take any further signals that the latter might find it necessary to give, imputed by the jury as a fault attributable to the railway company, should properly be so regarded. I understand, however, that a majority of my learned brothers are of the opinion that it should. Although further consideration of the evidence has not dispelled my doubt, since it has not ripened into a clear conviction of error on the part of the Court of Review as well as the jury, it does not justify a dissent.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Il s'agit d'un accident de chemin de fer o\u00f9 le mari de la demanderesse intim\u00e9e a perdu la vie. La compagnie du Grand Tronc poss\u00e8de dans les limites de la ville de St. Henri une cour spacieuse o\u00f9 les trains \u00e0 passagers, apr\u00e8s leur course ordinaire, sont lav\u00e9s et nettoy\u00e9s. Cette cour est travers\u00e9e \u00e0 niveau par la rue DeCourcelles sur une longueur d'environ 300 pieds. Comme il y a beaucoup de trafic \u00e0 cet endroit et vu le grand nombre de trains qui sont constamment en mouvement, la Commission des Chemins de fer a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en 1911 que des barri\u00e8res modernes seraient install\u00e9es et qu'elles seraient maintenues, entretenues et op\u00e9r\u00e9es par la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la Compagnie du Grand Tronc e\u00fbt \u00e9lev\u00e9 sa voie.\nLe jour de l'accident, le 21 ao\u00fbt 1915, un train compos\u00e9 de quatorze chars \u00e9tait pouss\u00e9 dans cette cour par une locomotive. Le char qui se trouvait \u00e0 l'avant \u00e9tait un char \u00e0 bagages. Trois personnes, outre l'ing\u00e9nieur et le chauffeur, \u00e9taient en charge de ce train: savoir, Brunet, le contremaitre; Scarff la victime; et un nomm\u00e9 Marcotte.\nArriv\u00e9 pr\u00e8s de la rue DeCourcelles, sur la voie No. 4, le train fut arr\u00eat\u00e9 pour que la locomotive p\u00fbt aller chercher un char qui se trouvait sur une voie voisine. Scarff re\u00e7ut instructions de son contrema\u00eetre Brunet, de se mettre \u00e0 la traverse de la rue DeCourcelles pour voir \u00e0 ce qu'il n'y e\u00fbt aucun accident pendant qu'on proc\u00e8derait \u00e0 former le train et pour donner les signaux n\u00e9cessaires quand la rue serait libre. A cette fin, Scarff se tenait sur le trottoir \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 du char \u00e0 bagages; et quand le train a \u00e9t\u00e9 reform\u00e9, il a donn\u00e9 un signal \u00e0 Brunet que le train pouvait partir et traverser la rue et, \u00e0 son tour, l'ing\u00e9nieur sur le signal de Brunet mit le train en mouvement.\nD\u00e8s l'instant que le train partit, Scarff a d\u00fb s'apercevoir qu'il y avait danger pour certaines voitures ou pi\u00e9tons qui traversaient sur la rue et alors il a d\u00fb donner le signal d'arr\u00eater; mais Brunet qui, dans l'intervalle, \u00e9tait mont\u00e9 sur le char, vers le milieu du train, n'a pas vu ce signal; et alors Scarff, dans un moment de d\u00e9vouement qui est tout \u00e0 sa gloire, s'est lanc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re du train pour l'arr\u00eater au moyen du robinet d'angle.\nC'\u00e9tait une d\u00e9marche extr\u00eamement dangereuse que celle qu'il faisait l\u00e0; mais il a cru, je suppose, devoir y recourir dans l'espoir qu'il pourrait sauver la vie de ceux qui allait \u00eatre frapp\u00e9s sur la rue et comptant probablement aussi sur sa propre agilit\u00e9; mais malheureusement il a \u00e9t\u00e9 entra\u00eene en dessous du char et fut \u00e9cras\u00e9.\nL'action \u00e9tait dirig\u00e9e originairement contre la compagnie du Grand Tronc; mais au cours du proc\u00e8s on a d\u00e9couvert que la barri\u00e8re qui se trouvait \u00e0 cette rue \u00e9tait sous la garde d'un employ\u00e9 de la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al; et alors, plus d'un an apr\u00e8s l'accident, la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al fut poursuivie et mise en cause pour \u00eatre tenue conjointement et solidairement responsable avec la compagnie du Grand Tronc de cet accident.\nLa compagnie du Grand Tronc et la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al ont plaid\u00e9 que l'accident n'\u00e9tait pas d\u00fb \u00e0 leur faute mais \u00e0 la faute de la victime elle-m\u00eame. La cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al a, en outre, plaid\u00e9 prescription d'un an, invoquant les dispositions de l'article 2262 C.C. La proc\u00e8s a eu lieu devant un jury qui a trouv\u00e9 coupable de n\u00e9gligence la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al ainsi que la compagnie du Grand Tronc. Ils ont exon\u00e9r\u00e9 de tout bl\u00e2me Scarff. La compagnie du Grand Tronc a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9e coupable parce que le contrema\u00eetre n'\u00e9tait pas en position de pouvoir recevoir le signal qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 d'arr\u00eater le train et la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9e en faute d'avoir par l'entremise de son employ\u00e9 lev\u00e9 les barri\u00e8res lorsque le train \u00e9tait en mouvement.\nCe verdict a \u00e9t\u00e9 unanimement confirm\u00e9 par la Cour de Revision.\nLa question qui se pr\u00e9sente est de savoir s'il y avait une preuve suffisante pour pouvoir justifier ce verdict. Les appelants pr\u00e9tendent qu'aucune preuve de n\u00e9gligence de leur part n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. La preuve est tr\u00e8s longue et volumineuse et d\u00e9montre le soin qu'on a eu de mettre devant le jury tous les faits qui pouvaient affecter la responsabilit\u00e9 des appelantes.\nLa faute trouv\u00e9e contre la compagnie du Grand Tronc m'a paru d'abord, je l'admets, peu fond\u00e9e et la preuve ne me paraissait pas la justifier. Mais apr\u00e8s avoir lu et relu avec beaucoup d'attention cette preuve, je vois que, de fait, le jury pouvait avoir raison de condamner la compagnie.\nLa compagnie a essay\u00e9 d'amener un certain t\u00e9moin pour \u00e9tablir que Scarff \u00e9tait en faute, vu qu'il avait \u00e0 sa disposition un sifflet \u00e0 air qui aurait pu lui permettre d'arr\u00eater le train et qu'il avait laiss\u00e9 ce sifflet sur le trottoir.\nNous n'avons pas eu occasion de voir ce t\u00e9moin; mais, si j'en juge par les r\u00e9ponses qu'il a donn\u00e9es, il n'est pas \u00e9tonnant que le jury ne l'ait pas cru; et la Cour de Revision en est venu \u00e0 la m\u00eame conclusion.\nIl me semble que le contrema\u00eetre Brunet (et c'est la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle le jury para\u00eet en \u00eatre arriv\u00e9) aurait d\u00fb voir \u00e0 rester dans une position de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 recevoir tout signal qui pourrait lui \u00eatre donn\u00e9 par Scarff. Scarff \u00e9tait bien rest\u00e9 sur le trottoir, \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 du train; pourquoi ne serait-il pas lui-m\u00eame rest\u00e9 l\u00e0? Ce train pouvait \u00eatre suivi au pas d'un homme, vu qu'il n'y avait que quelques pieds pour atteindre sa destination; et alors Brunet me para\u00eet avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 coupable de n\u00e9gligence en montant sur le train et en perdant de vue Scarff qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 pour donner les signaux n\u00e9cessaires.\nIl est vrai que Scarff avait donn\u00e9 le signal du d\u00e9part; mais vu la largeur consid\u00e9rable de la cour il pouvait arriver \u00e0 tout instant qu'un signal d'arr\u00eat e\u00fbt pu \u00eatre donn\u00e9 par Scarff; et alors Brunet aurait d\u00fb rester dans une position de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 recevoir ces signaux. Malheureusement il ne l'a pas fait; et lorsque le danger est devenu tr\u00e8s imminent, Scarff a \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9, vu que ses signaux ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre re\u00e7us, d'aller se mettre \u00e0 l'avant du train pour essayer de l'arr\u00eater autrement et \u00e9viter les accidents mortels qui allaient in\u00e9vitablement se produire. Brunet, qui \u00e9tait mont\u00e9 sur un char vers le milieu du train, a vu tout \u00e0 coup les signaux de d\u00e9tresse de la part d'un homme qui \u00e9tait sur la rue et il a alors fait arr\u00eater le train; mais malheureusement il \u00e9tait trop tard; ce pauvre Scarff \u00e9tait \u00e9cras\u00e9.\nQuant \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, le jury a trouv\u00e9 que Racicot, qui \u00e9tait en charge des barri\u00e8res, a d\u00fb les lever apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9part du train. Il jure le contraire; mais il est contredit sous ce rapport par les circonstances qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9es dans la cause. Je crois donc que le jury \u00e9tait justifiable de ne pas accepter sa version.\nJe trouve donc que le verdict du jury tant contre la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al que contre la compagnie du Grand Tronc est bien fond\u00e9 et qu'il n'y a pas lieu de le mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9.\nReste la question de prescription soulev\u00e9e par la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al. La question est de savoir s'il y a eu solidarit\u00e9 entre la compagnie du Grand Tronc et la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al et s'il y a eu interruption de prescription par l'action prise contre la compagnie du Grand Tronc avant que la prescription f\u00fbt acquise.\nLes actions se prescrivent par un an pour injures corporelles, dit l'article 2262 C.C Dans le cas actuel, il y avait eu interruption de prescription en tant que la compagnie du Grand Tronc est concern\u00e9e parce qu'une action avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise contre elle avant l'expiration de L'ann\u00e9e qui avait suivi l'accident (Art. 2224 C.C). L'article 2231 C.C nous dit que\ntout acte qui interrompt la prescription contre l'un des d\u00e9biteurs solidaires l'interrompt contre tous.\nOr, l'article 1106 C.C d\u00e9clare que l'obligation r\u00e9sultant d'un d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit commis par deux personnes ou plus est solidaire.\nLa cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al nous dit qu'il n'y a pas de solidarit\u00e9 dans le cas actuel parce que le d\u00e9lit dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9e coupable par le jury n'est pas le m\u00eame que celui qui est imput\u00e9 \u00e0 la compagnie du Grand Tronc. Il y aurait eu, suivant elle, deux d\u00e9lits; et, en cons\u00e9quence, la solidarit\u00e9 ne devait pas exister.; et elle cite \u00e0 ce sujet la cause de Jeannotte v. Couillard[5], o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 ce qui suit:\nAlthough under article 1106 C.C. there may be solidarity in the responsibility established under article 1053 C.C., yet such solidarity only exists from the same act and not from an independent act on the part of each defendant.\nDans cette cause de Jeannotte v. Couillard5, il s'agissait d'une poursuite contre un m\u00e9decin et un pharmacien; le premier pour avoir fait une erreur en \u00e9crivant une prescription pour un malade et le second pour ne pas avoir rempli la prescription telle qu'on l'avait \u00e9crite. Les deux fautes reproch\u00e9es au pharmacien et au m\u00e9decin \u00e9taient bien distinctes. Il est vrai qu'elles ont concouru toutes deux \u00e0 la mort de la personne qui a pris ces rem\u00e8des; mais la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour d'Appel n'ont pas jug\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de prononcer la solidarit\u00e9.\nLes faits sont diff\u00e9rents dans la pr\u00e9sente cause. D'abord, les d\u00e9lits se sont produits en m\u00eame temps. En principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, les co-auteurs d'un d\u00e9lit ou quasi-d\u00e9lit sont solidairement responsables du dommage caus\u00e9 \u00e0 la victime de ce d\u00e9lit; et quand on se propose de r\u00e9gler l'\u00e9tendue de la responsabilit\u00e9 des co-auteurs d'un d\u00e9lit, on doit consid\u00e9rer uniquement l'influence que les fautes des divers agents ont pu avoir sur ce quasi-d\u00e9lit; si elle est appr\u00e9ciable, chacun est astreint \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration du pr\u00e9judice dans la proportion o\u00f9 il y a coop\u00e9r\u00e9; et si elle ne l'est pas, on est autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer chaque faute comme ayant engendr\u00e9 le dommage tout entier et par suite, sans se pr\u00e9occuper de l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 ou de l'in\u00e9galit\u00e9 des imprudences ou n\u00e9gligences commises de part et d'autre, on inflige aux divers co-auteurs une condamnation totale.\nCette question s'est soulev\u00e9e en France, et je trouve une d\u00e9cision de la Cour de Cassation rapport\u00e9e dans Dalloz, 1894-1-561, o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la r\u00e9paration d'un fait dommageable, imputable \u00e0 deux ou plusieurs personnes, doit \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9e pour le tout contre chacune au profit de la partie l\u00e9s\u00e9e, lorsqu'il y a entre chaque faute et la totalit\u00e9 du dommage une relation directe et n\u00e9cessaire. Il y aurait donc, suivant cette d\u00e9cision, solidarit\u00e9 m\u00eame dans le cas o\u00f9 chaque coauteur se serait rendu coupable de n\u00e9ligence par un fait distinct. La Cour de Cassation dans une cause rapport\u00e9e dans Sirey, 1827-1-236, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 aussi qu'il y avait lieu de condamner solidairement \u00e0 la r\u00e9paration du dommage caus\u00e9 \u00e0 un propri\u00e9taire voisin divers propri\u00e9taires d'\u00e9tablissements industriels, sans qu'il f\u00fbt possible de d\u00e9terminer la part pour laquelle chaque \u00e9tablissement y avait contribu\u00e9.

At the end of three and one-half years the company sold some of its machinery and was negotiating with a junk dealer for sale of the rest when the town distrained for rent claimed as due under the agreement, and the contents of the company\u2019s factory were seized and sold. In an action claiming damages for illegal distress\nHeld, that as the option to purchase had not been relinquished no rent was due and the distress was illegal.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario reversing the judgment at the trial by which the action was dismissed.\nThe facts are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nF.M. Field K.C. for the appellant.\nLoftus for the respondent.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant as a municipal corporation entered into an agreement with respondent giving it an option for a term of five years to purchase certain property and meantime to lease the property.\nThe questions raised herein must be determined by the construction to be placed upon two clauses of said agreement which are as follows:\u2014\nThe corporation offers to sell to the company the building and lands surrounding the same heretofore used as the Model School on the north side of University avenue in the Town of Cobourg comprising two acres of land be the same more or less for three thousand five hundred dollars at any time within five years from the day of the date hereof on the company tendering to the Mayor of the corporation within said period of five years a deed for execution by the corporation in accordance with the \u201cShort Form of Conveyances Act:\u201d\nAnd the corporation offers to lease to the company the said premises until the completion of the sale thereof to the company according to the terms of the offer hereinabove set forth at an annual rental of two hundred dollars, to be paid by the company to the corporation at the expiration of the said period of five years, in the event of the company not completing the purchase within the said period, and at the same rate for any less period than five years, in the event of the company relinquishing this option prior to the withdrawal from the said premises of the plant and machinery of the company.\nThe respondent entered into possession of said premises and after holding same for three years and a half and about a year and a half before the expiration of said five years, without making any election or expressly declaring its intention to relinquish the option of purchase given by the agreement, its goods were distrained by the appellant for an alleged claim of $700 for rent under the said second clause.\nThe respondent, six months later, brought this action, alleging the seizure was illegal and claiming damages therefor.\nAppellant attempted to justify its seizure by evidence of the removal by respondent of a great part of its machinery and stock in trade thereby tending to demonstrate that it had relinquished its option and hence become liable to pay rent for the time it had been in possession. I cannot see how the option to purchase can, under any fair or reasonable construction of the instrument, be determined in any such way. It was quite competent for the respondent to have removed every bit of its machinery and other personal property and awaited till the last day of the term of five years and then to pay the price named and the rental specified and take a conveyance.\nSuppose there had been a rapid rise in value of real estate, and this property had become worth double by the end of the term what it was at the making of the agreement, could the option be held to have been relinquished by reason of any such evidence as adduced herein?\nThere was not a line in the agreement stipulating for occupation of the premises, much less imposing as a term thereof that it should bring goods and machinery to be used by it therein.\nThe only provisions made binding respondent in relation to the property were to keep it in repair, not to assign without leave, to insure and to pay school taxes on an assessment of $3,500.\nIt is not what conceivably may have been the understanding between the parties but what the writing expresses that we have to do with herein.\nIf appellant made an improvident agreement we cannot help it. If there was, outside of that, material for another case it should have been fought out otherwise than by distress.\nI should not, even if I could get over the impassable barrier I have suggested arising from the construction of the instrument contemplating a five years\u2019 option to purchase, be able, as a matter of course, to put the construction on the leasing clause standing alone that appellant contends for. There is no time named for the payment of rent except at the expiration of the said period of five years. The matter is left so indefinite in that regard that I doubt if any well-founded right to distrain could be held to have arisen at an earlier date than the end of the five year term. I need not, however, decide that in my view of the plain, obvious meaning of the instrument otherwise.\nThe real issue in law had, I fear, got beclouded by reason of giving heed to collateral issues and considerations that never could have, in themselves, laid a foundation for the right to distrain, otherwise I imagine this litigation would have terminated long ago.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014After hearing an able and exhaustive argument of this appeal, I am, with deference, utterly at a loss to appreciate the considerations which led the Appellate Division to regard this case as a fit subject for special leave to appeal. The unanimous judgment of that court (the personnel being somewhat different), reversing that of Britton J., who had dismissed the action, held that the defendant had made an illegal distress, awarded the plaintiff $23.50 actual, and $5 nominal, damages, declared certain of the distrained goods which the defendant had \u201cbought in,\u201d at the bailiff\u2019s sale, at prices aggregating $905.35, to be still the property of the plaintiff, and gave it the costs of the action and appeal on the Supreme Court scale.\nThe defendant now concedes that its purchases at the sale held under its own distress warrant would have been indefensible had the distress itself been unimpeachable. The matter in controversy on this appeal, therefore, apart from costs, is confined to a judgment for $28.50 and the sole question to be determined is whether there was or was not any rent due from the plaintiff to the defendant. The plaintiff was lessee of premises owned by the defendant, a municipal corporation, with an option to purchase the same at any time within five years for $3,500. The rental ($200 a year) was payable on the expiry of the five years should the plaintiff not complete the purchase within that period and at the same rate for any less period should the plaintiff relinquish its option to purchase, payment in that event to be made\nprior to the withdrawal from the said premises of the plant and machinery of the company.\nThe circumstances in evidence, in my opinion, fully sustain these findings of the learned trial judge:\nThe plaintiff company went into possession pursuant to the agreement but the business carried on was of small character and as if there were not very much in it in Cobourg.\nPrior to the 22nd of June, the plaintiff set about removing what was in the building, and on the 22nd of June the defendant issued a landlord\u2019s warrant to distrain the chattels under a claim for rent to the amount of $700. The bailiff seized and sold part of the chattels so seized and bought in the residue.\nI find that the company did form the intention of not purchasing the property and that it intended to remove the goods and chattels from the premises without paying any rent.\nThe defendant had reasonable ground for believing that the company did not intend to purchase the property or pay rent and upon that belief directed the seizure to be made.\nIt is true, as alleged by the defendant, that the plaintiff had to a great extent discontinued their business at Cobourg, The plaintiff company had been disposing of such of their manufactured goods as they had on hand, and had been stripping the premises of machinery and had been negotiating with a junk dealer for about a month prior to the 22nd of June, 1916, for the sale to him of such of the stock, machinery and plant as was left for $800.00 and at the very time of the seizure were concluding a sale thereof to the junk dealer for $625,00 with a view to abandonment of the property.\nAll that the defendant did was in good faith, and in the honest belief that the plaintiff company intended to resort to whatever might be necessary to avoid paying rent.\nBut does all this warrant the conclusion that the plaintiff had, at or prior to the 22nd of June\u2014the date of the distress\u2014relinquished its option to purchase? That it had determined not to take advantage of it seems abundantly clear.\nThe defendant\u2019s Mayor wrote to the plaintiff on the 15th of June inquiring whether it intended to vacate the premises and, if so, what were its intentions regarding the option? The plaintiff\u2019s manager replied on the 20th June explaining that it was removing and disposing of surplus machinery, intending to apply the proceeds on a bank overdraft:\nThis will enable the company in all probability to meet the difficulties caused by the war. I will be glad to keep you informed as to the progress the company is making at any time you request.\nHowever evasive or disingenuous this reply, it is not susceptible of being construed as a relinquishment of the option, which was certainly still in force on the 15th June as the Mayor\u2019s letter shews. There was no further communication between the parties prior to the distress.\nUnder the agreement, during the currency of the five years\u2019 period only actual relinquishment of the option to purchase would make the pro r\u00e2ta rent for the elapsed portion of that period due and payable. An intention to relinquish, however definite and clearly established, would not suffice. Had a tender by the plaintiff on the 22nd of June of a conveyance of the property for execution accompanied by $3,500 been refused, the defendant, in my opinion, would have had no defence to an action for specific performance. With Mr. Justice Lennox, who delivered the judgment of the Appellate Division,\nI am of the opinion that there is no evidence whatever to shew a relinquishment, in fact, but, on the contrary, the letter from the Mayor to an officer of the plaintiff company of the 15th June, shews quite clearly that upon the 15th June, at all events, there was no relinquishment, and there certainly is nothing to suggest that the parties came together in any way or did anything that would constitute a relinquishment of the option after that date. It is not necessary to determine a priori what documents or circumstances would be necessary to constitute a relinquishment as a matter of law of the right of the company to exercise the option within the five-year period limited by the agreement. It is sufficient to say that no fact or circumstance has been shewn which could be called a relinquishment or from which a relinquishment could be properly inferred.\nThe appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The object of the contract which we have to construe in this case was to assist the respondent company which intended to start an industrial establishment in the Town of Cobourg. It was represented to the civic authorities that a certain number of men would be employed and that the town then would profit in the establishment of that new industry.\nWith that end in view the Town of Cobourg agreed to give a lease of a building which they had at a rent of $200 per year and with the right of option on the part of the company to purchase the property within five years. No rent would be paid, however, during those five years, unless the company relinquished its option to purchase. The machinery and plant, however, of the company could not be removed prior to the rent being paid. That agreement was made on the 11th November, 1912, and the option then would have to be exercised on or before the 11th November, 1917.\nThe business of the company, however, was not prosperous. At the beginning they employed a certain number of men, but there was a decrease in number from time to time until, about the beginning of the year 1916, the number was reduced to one. The company failed to make a return of its affairs as required by the provisions of the provincial statute during the years 1914-1915 and 1916. No price lists were issued after the year 1913. In 1915 it gave to the bank a chattel mortgage covering all operating machinery on the premises. It is in evidence that only 1,110 lbs. of fence wire were brought during the year 1916. Then, in the months of April, May and June, they started to ship machinery and they negotiated with a junk dealer for sale of the balance of the machinery.\nIt is in evidence also that the total cost of power supplied from the 13th January, 1913, to the 26th of June, 1916, was $29.96.\nThe company was evidently not in a position to continue the business, and it was found by the trial judge that it had formed the intention of not purchasing the property, and it intended to remove the goods and chattels from the premises without paying any rent.\nThe trial judge found also that\nthe defendants had reasonable ground for believing that the company did not intend to purchase the property or pay rent and upon that belief directed the seizure to be made.\nThe Appellate Division reluctantly reversed his decision.\nEverything pointed to the fact that the company was in a hopeless condition and could not purchase the property. But can the company be held as having relinquished its option to purchase? I am sorry to have to come to the conclusion that the evidence does not disclose such relinquishment. It is more than possible that the company would not be in such a financial condition that it could exercise its option; but, then, we cannot say that some rent was due when the writ for distress was issued.\nThe Town of Cobourg seems, however, to have acted all through in a straightforward way and I could not see the same line of conduct followed by the respondent company. I have come to the conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nFALCONBRIDGE J.\u2014I agree with the judgment of Mr.Justice Anglin.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Frank M. Field.\nSolicitor for the respondents: John T. Loftus.\n"

L. Scott for the appellant.\nA. E. Honeywell, for the respondent. THE CHIEF JUSTICE:\u2014It is contended by the appellant that there is no question of waiver in this case; that any liability of the appellant could only arise from the creation of a new liability. I do not think that is so. A similar condition has been before the court in many cases but the exact wording of the condition varies considerably in different cases. In many of them the policy is conditioned to be absolutely void on subsequent insurance without notice. Such is not the case here where it is only provided that the company shall not be liable if any subsequent insurance is effected unless and until the company assent thereto. It is a good defence to an action on the contract so long as the company has not assented but the contract continues and if the company at any time assents the insured can recover under it.\nIn Kerr on Insurance it is correctly said that\nif after knowledge of any default for which it might terminate the contract, or if after all right to recover on the contract has to the knowledge of the insurer become barred by the very terms of the contract itself because of the failure of the insured to perform some condition precedent to his right of recovery, the insurer does any act or enters into any negotiations with the insured, which recognizes the continuing validity of its obligation, or treats it as still in force and effect, the default or forfeiture is waived.\nForfeiture is not favoured either in law or equity, and the provision for it in a contract will be strictly construed, and courts will find a waiver of it upon slight evidence when the justice and equity of the claim is, under the contract, in favour of the insured.\nThere can be no doubt that if the company is responsible for the acts of its agents in this case these were abundantly sufficient to constitute a waiver of the forfeiture.\nThe fact that there was subsequent insurance came to the knowledge of the agents the day after the fire, that is, on the 2nd January, 1916. The matter was placed in the hands of the adjusters on behalf of the companies, proofs of loss were duly made and accepted; many interviews and correspondence ensued, the matter being complicated by the fact that the city by-laws would not permit of the re-instatement of the premises. On the 31st March, 1916, the adjuster, who had been handling the case since the middle of February, when he was substituted for the first one appointed, wrote to the respondent offering a definite sum which he said:\nI am authorized to offer you in full settlement of the claim.\nThe appellant is an English company. The head office is in England and its general agents in British Columbia are Messrs. Rutherford & Co.; Mr. Charles Rutherford was their attorney for British Columbia under the \"Companies Act.\" The trial judge said:\nI consider that where a foreign company is doing business in the province, that the actions of its general agents should be binding upon the company. It is essential to the proper carrying on of insurance business at a distant point from the head office that they should have such general authority, not only to effect insurance, but also to adjust and pay losses.\nMr. Justice Martin says that Mr. Rutherford must be deemed to be for the purposes of this case in the same position as the head office. I am not sure that it is necessary to go quite so far as this; but I certainly think there is much weight in the opinion and that we should consider the authority of agents in such a position to be as extensive as possible.\nThe knowledge of the company's agents was the knowledge of the company; not that it is necessary to invoke for this any technical rule of law; but, as I have said, the agents had knowledge of the subsequent insurance on the 2nd of January and, of course, the company could have been and presumably was informed of it months before it decided to repudiate liability. Yet, in the interval, so far as appears by this record, it not only gave no instructions to this effect to its agents but permitted them to go on taking action which could only be consistent with an intention to accept liability on the policy.\nThe fact that the company was carrying on business at such a distance from its head office that it might reasonably be expected to give to its agents here a large measure of authority to act on its behalf, coupled with the fact that there was ample time for all necessary correspondence with its agents must, I think, preclude the appellant from repudiating the acts of its agents by which accordingly I hold that they were bound.\nIt is satisfactory to be able to conclude that the appellant has effectually waived any forfeiture under the insurance contract. Were it not so, the insured would have been unfairly prejudiced by the appellants' course of action. As it is, the respondent has been forced, in order to obtain her rights, to bring this second action, which the company has endeavoured to defeat on doubtful technical grounds, though itself profiting by the subsequent insurance.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. Judgment for $1,310 which is the amount of the loss incurred by the respondent.\nDAVIES J.\u2014This action is one brought on a policy of insurance taken out by the respondent in the appellant company against loss or damage by fire on the plaintiff's houses and buildings on a specified property in Vancouver, B.C., and any loss under the policy was made payable to Carrie M. Jamieson, the mortgagee thereof, as her interest might appear.\nSubsequent insurance was placed by the respondent upon the premises in the North Empire Fire Insurance Company for the sum of $3,500 and knowledge of this latter insurance only came to the general agent of the appellant for British Columbia on the morning after the fire which partially destroyed the insured premises.\nThe policy of insurance had the usual statutory conditions, namely\nThe company is not liable for loss * * * if any subsequent insurance is effected in any other company unless and until the company assents thereto.\nThe appellant company was an English company with its head office in London, England.\nIts general agents in and for British Columbia were Rutherford & Co. Policies in blank signed by the managing director and the fire and accident manager of the company in London were sent to their general agent with a provision that they were not valid until countersigned by their general agents in British Columbia.\nIt was agreed at the trial by both parties that the value of the building at the time of the fire was $3,750 and that the loss due to the fire was $1,600 and that the building by-law of Vancouver prohibited the reconstruction or repair of the building to a greater extent than 20% of the original value, with the result that the building could not be repaired.\nImmediately after the fire adjustment of the loss was placed by both companies in the hands of one McKenzie; but subsequently the adjustment was taken from him and placed in the hands of one Shallcross, another adjuster, who took from respondent a \"nonwaiver\" agreement providing that any action taken by the company appellant in investigating the cause of the fire or the amount of the loss and damage to the property should not waive or invalidate any of the conditions of the policy. The trial judge found that the company was protected by the non-waiver agreement while Shallcross was acting as adjuster and settling the amount of the loss.\nIt clearly appeared in evidence, however, that outside of his duties as adjuster he was authorized by the general agent, Rutherford, after the latter had full knowledge of the subsequent insurance, to settle with the respondent amicably if possible the amount which they should pay under the policy. After prolonged negotiations and with Rutherford's full knowledge and authority he offered respondent on behalf of both companies to pay her\nin full settlement of her claim the National Benefit's proportion of the sum of $1,500.\nApart from the amount payable the question therefore is reduced down to this, whether Rutherford, as general agent for this company in British Columbia, with power to issue, adjust and settle losses in that province on policies issued by him had also power to give the company's assent to the subsequent insurance effected by the respondent?\nI have had the question of the extent of the powers of a general agent in Canada of a foreign company under consideration in several cases which have been before this court and have expressed myself as being of the opinion that such general agent must of necessity be held for certain purposes connected with the issuing of the policy, adjustment, proofs and settlement of loss and matters akin thereto to be the company itself.\nI do not see how otherwise the business of the company could be carried on if the general agent could not give such an assent to subsequent insurance in another company as the condition in this case calls for. Such assent is not required by the condition to be in writing. Cases calling for it must constantly arise. If they have necessarily to be referred to the head office in London for the formal assent of the company, then much valuable time would be lost. It is a question peculiarly for the general agent whose knowledge must govern in any such case to say whether assent should be given or not. As general agent he has policies placed in his hands already signed by the company's officers in London and good only when countersigned by him.\nAbsolute reliance is and must be placed on his judgment as to the taking of the risk insured. If further insurance in his own company was asked he would have authority to take it and either issue a new policy for the increased amount and cancel the old one or by memorandum on the one already issued increase the amount insured. Surely then a general agent entrusted with such unlimited powers may give the \"assent\" called for by the condition to a subsequent insurance in another company not required even to be in writing. Of course the company can limit his powers but there is nothing in this case to shew any such limitation was ever made. The inference I draw from the admitted powers he possesses as general agent is that they extend to and embrace the case of giving assent to subsequent insurance effected in any other company.\nThe condition in question in case of prior insurance requires that the company's assent to it must appear in the policy or be indorsed thereon.\nThat clearly contemplates to my mind that such indorsement might be made by the general agent when he issues the policy. It further requires that if written notice of an intention or desire to effect subsequent insurance is given and the company does not dissent in writing within two weeks after receiving such notice the company should be held not to have dissented. Surely the written notice so required may be given the general agent and if so and he does not dissent the company would be held not to have dissented. The two weeks time within which the company must dissent would not allow time for the company in London to be advised of the notice and to send their dissent in writing. It would seem to me that in all the cases dealt with in this condition the general agent must be held to stand for the company.\nThe mere appointment of an adjuster to adjust the loss under the policy might not be sufficient to indicate any assent to subsequent insurance but in this case the evidence shewed specific authority given to Shallcross, the adjuster, by Rutherford, the general agent, to pay plaintiff in full settlement of her claim the company's proportion of the sum of $1,500.\nThis specific authority was given after full knowledge of the subsequent insurance by the general agent and beyond doubt amounted to an assent to such insurance by the general agent if he had the power to give it.\nI assume it will not be denied that the principal officers of the company at the head office conducting its affairs there would be held to have authority to waive the conditions invoked without having special authority from the directors and so I hold in like manner the general agent for the company residing and conducting its affairs in British Columbia had such authority.\nThe case of Western Assurance Company v. Doull[1], was strongly relied upon by Mr. Scott for the company as a binding authority in this case. It would appear to me from the facts as stated in the judgments of the, court in that case that the agent there, Greer, was a local agent merely and not a general agent for the province. He is referred to by several of the judges in their judgments as a local agent and his powers were very limited. In that case the condition of the policy required that in cases of subsequent insurance notice in writing must at once be given to the company and such subsequent insurance indorsed upon the policy. No such written notice or indorsement was required in the present case but simply the \"assent\" of the company to the subsequent insurance. In the Doull Case[2], Mr. Justice Strong said, at p. 455, that:\nIt does not appear very clearly whether he (the adjuster Corey) was instructed directly from the principal officer of the appellants or through Greer. The latter in his evidence said he \"had a telegram from defendant company authorizing me to request Corey to adjust the loss and I requested him to do so.\" In cross\u2014examination he says: \"After a loss I notify the head office and I get instructions from them what to do.\"\nManifestly, therefore, Greer's authority was a limited one and not a general one. He was simply authorized to investigate and adjust the loss. In the case now before us there is no suggestion that the general agent's authority was a limited one. On the contrary, he appeared to have all the powers necessary for the issue of policies and in case of loss, for its adjustment and settlement. In the Doull Case[3], the plaintiff relied alone upon the adjuster's action in adjusting the loss as amounting to a waiver by the company.\nBut in the present case the plaintiff relies not upon the mere adjustment of the loss but upon the special authority given to him by the general agent, Rutherford, to settle it if he could and the offer to pay her the company's proportion of the sum of $1,500.\nMr. Scott strenuously contended that under the condition where subsequent insurance was effected without the company's approval its liability under the policy ceased and that no agent could create a new liability. But I do not think that is the proper construction of the condition. It says that the company shall not be liable if any subsequent insurance is effected unless the company assents. But if it does assent that assent makes the non-liability provision inapplicable. The liability is one depending on the \"assent\" and once that is given no question of any new liability arises.\nI therefore would dismiss the appeal and as to the amount, while I confess I am not without doubt on this point, I will not dissent from the amount determined on by a majority of the Court of Appeal and of this court, viz., $1,300.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant is an English insurance company which carried on business in British Columbia and insured the respondent's property in Vancouver for the sum of $2,000 for one year from the 14th of April, 1915, subject to the stipulations and conditions indorsed on the policy. One of the said conditions so indorsed was as follows:\nThe company is not liable for loss if there is any prior insurance in any other company, unless the company's assent thereto appears herein or is indorsed hereon, nor if any subsequent insurance is effected in any other company unless and until the company assents thereto, or unless the company does not dissent in writing within two weeks after receiving written notice of the intention or desire to effect the subsequent insurance, or does not dissent in writing after that time and before the subsequent insurance is effected.\nThe only question raised herein is whether under the said condition and the circumstances I am about to relate the appellant has been relieved from liability.\nThe respondent shortly after obtaining said policy of insurance assigned same to her mortgagee. A condition indorsed upon it provided that in the event of the property being assigned without a written permission indorsed thereon\nby an agent of the company duly authorized for such purpose\nthe policy should thereby become void.\nThe person to whom she applied in that event was the same agent who had signed the policy and issued it to her. He duly signed same without raising any question of his authority.\nOn the heading of the policy is printed in large type the name of the appellant and under same is printed in large type also the words \"Head Office, London, England,\" and under those the words \"Agency No. Vancouver, B.C.\"\nAnd the policy at the foot thereof after the attesting clause has the following:\nThis policy shall not be valid until countersigned by the duly authorized agents of the company at Vancouver, B.C., and then besides being executed by the managing director and the fire and accident manager is countersigned by Rutherford & Company, general agents.\nWe are informed by the record that Chalmers Rutherford was in fact the general agent.\nIt may be necessary to observe all those details in considering the weight to be given the acts of this agent and of those authorized by him upon which respondent relies, and to which I am about to refer, because counsel for appellant contends no authority is shewn for such acts.\nThe respondent on the 19th July, 1915, obtained by virtue of the policy of insurance of that date, issued to her by the North Empire Fire Insurance Company at Vancouver further insurance for the sum of $3,500 for one year from said date.\nThat policy provided as follows:\u2014\"Further concurrent insurance permitted.\"\nUnfortunately notice had not been given to the appellant of this insurance as required by the above quoted condition.\nThe dwelling house thus insured was partly destroyed by fire on the first of January, 1916.\nThe said general agent of the appellant says he learned of the last mentioned insurance the morning after the fire.\nHe, nevertheless, instead of repudiating on behalf of his company all liability to respondent by reason of her failure to give notice of the subsequent insurance, suggested and procured, through his chosen adjuster, proof to be made by her of the loss and when presented to him by the respondent accepted the said proof without objection. Indeed he had previously, unsolicited, as if no question of liability existed, appointed Mr. McKenzie to act as adjuster on behalf of appellant along with the adjuster for the other company.\nHe acted, doubtless, under the authority of the general agent in meeting respondent and making the many proposals he seems to have made to her for a settlement of her claim under the policy.\nHe never pretended to claim for a single instant that her rights had been lost by the failure to give notice of the subsequent insurance, but evidently assumed throughout that there was no doubt of her right to claim under the policy. The only question in dispute was the amount she might be entitled to under the very peculiar circumstances to which I will advert presently and certainly raising a question of much difficulty. These negotiations extended over six weeks and involved some fifteen to twenty meetings she swears. It was in the course of these negotiations that he told respondent she should have proof of loss made out and took her to a solicitor to have same pre- pared when they were prepared accordingly pursuant to the suggestion of Mr. McKenzie who never made any objection in any way to her actual right to claim.\nHe offered her $1,150 to be expended by the company in repairs.\nIf all that done under the authority of the general agent does not constitute an assent to the subsequent insurance I am puzzled to know what would unless an express declaration in writing, which is not required by the terms of the condition now invoked. All that is required thereby is an assent to the subsequent policy which under the circumstances was a very fortunate thing for the appellant by reason of the other company becoming liable to bear a share of the loss which by reason of the amount of its contract constituted it the bearer of the larger part thereof.\nThese negotiations having failed the general agent says he appointed, in substitution for Mr. McKenzie, Mr. Shallcross who had been appointed as adjuster for the other company.\nRutherford, the general agent of the appellant, was examined for discovery herein on the 22nd Nov., 1916, and explains how and why that came about and relative to what was done thereunder as follows:\u2014\nQ.\u2014And Mr. Wilson asked you to employ the same adjuster?\nA.\u2014Yes, if I recollect, it was placed first in the hands of Hector McKenzie, and then we took it out of his hands, the reason being our policy was a smaller policy, and where a company has a large interest to decide on a course of action, it is a matter of insurance courtesy to follow the company having the larger interest. It is not obligatory\u2014 it is a custom.\nQ.\u2014And the actual negotiations towards the adjustment were carried on by Shallcross as your adjuster?\nA.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014You have authority, I suppose, to appoint, or employ an adjuster?\nA.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014You do not know personally, I presume, the negotiations that were carried out by Shallcross?\nA.\u2014More or less acquainted with them. Q.\u2014Did you keep in touch with him?\nA.\u2014Yes, more or less, but things like that are generally left in the hands of the adjuster, and we interfere as little as possible.\n* * *\nQ.\u2014The proof of loss as handed to you apparently was made out to the Mutual Benefit instead of the National Benefit?\nA.\u2014Yes.\nQ\u2014But you accepted it as a sufficient compliance with the policy?\nA.\u2014Yes.\nShallcross following a usual practice of his obtained a non\u2014waiver agreement from the respondent which was signed also by him\non behalf of the above named companies.\nThat provides\nthat any action taken by said parties of the second part in investigating the cause of fire or investigating and ascertaining the amount of loss and damage to the property of the party of the first part caused by fire alleged to have occurred on January 1st, 1916, shall not waive or invalidate any of the conditions of the policies of the parties of the second part, held by the party of the first part, and shall not waive or invalidate any rights whatever of either of the parties to this agreement.\nThat ordinary form used by an adjuster may prevent any inference of waiver, if any further needed, relative to rights under the conditions in question, derivable from the actions taken so far as limited thereby, but does not extend to the fair inference from the act of the manager in making the appointment or to what I am about to refer to, as happening beyond the scope thereof, and. of the investigating duties of an adjuster as such. But Mr. Shallcross by and with the authority of the appellant's general agent went far beyond that. He repeated the offer of doing work to the extent of $1,150 in repair of the buildings.\nHe wrote her on the 24th July, 1916, a letter pointing out that the premises were being neglected and damage therefrom had arisen which could not form a claim against the insurance companies and that loss was being incurred by their exposure to the weather and that these further losses could not form a claim against the company, and notified her of the earnest effort made by the companies through him to agree as to total damages and that responsibility must rest with her for failure to meet such agreement that day. Not a word is said of any doubt as to the validity of her claims to damages for loss.\nOn the 16th March, 1916, he wrote her solicitor as follows:\u2014\nHaving failed to arrive at any reasonable settlement with your client as to her claim for loss under Policy No. 39483 in the National Benefit Company and Policy No. 400096 in the North Empire Company, I now on behalf of the two companies interested notify you that they will in accordance with the conditions of the policies proceed to repair the property damaged by fire and that the companies have for that purpose obtained the necessity permit from the Building Inspector of the City of Vancouver.\nHe went further and got a permit, from the proper city authority, to make the repairs to the amount to which the city by-laws limited repairs.\nAnd here I may observe that the real difficulty in adjusting the loss was that the city by-laws had prohibited repairs beyond 20% of the loss, yet the insurance companies were bound to make good the loss thereby incurred by the proprietor as one of the results of the fire. It would seem that the companies did not take that view, and hence the resort to litigation which decided that point against them. It is not now contended that the view so taken by the courts is erroneous.\nThe appellant was quite willing to bear the loss on that basis contended for by it and then offered to carry out repairs to that extent of its liability.\nOn the 23rd March, 1916, the general manager wrote respondent's solicitor as follows:\u2014\nI have to-day received proof of loss dated March 18th, made out. to Mutual Benefit which I assume is intended for National Benefit and so understand the proof. I cannot accept the valuation or claim sworn to therein. I have requested Mr. P. G. Shallcross to deal with the case.\nOn the 24th March, 1916, Shallcross wrote the respondent as follows:\u2014\nDamage by fire January 1st, 1916, to house situate 639 Alexander Street.\nPlease note that under the condition of Policy No. 39483 the National Benefit Fire and Property Assurance Company may, should it appear that they are liable under such policy, notify the insured of their intention to repair within fifteen (1'5) days after' the filing of proof of loss. I wish therefore to advise you that failing arriving at a reasonable settlement with you that the company will formally notify you of this intention to repair within the time allowed them for giving such notice.\nAnd again on the 31st March, 1916, he wrote her as follows:\u2014\nRe House, 639 Alexander Street, damaged byfire January 1, 1916.\npolicy No. 39483 issued by the National Benefit Fire & Property Assurance Company for $2,000. Referring to my letter to you dated March 24th, 1916. Subject to the terms and conditions of the policy, including the application of insurance policy issued by the North Empire Fire Insurance Company, I am authorized to offer you in full settlement of the claim the National Benefit Company's proportion of the sum of fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500.00). Failing your immediate acceptance, then on behalf of the National Benefit Company, 1 give you notice of their intention to repair the above described house to the extent permitted by the by-laws and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the policy.\nAn action was brought by the respondent against the North Empire Life Insurance Company on its policy which was tried before Mr. Justice Murphy, who in May, 1916, decided in respondent's favour, assessed the damages at $3,750, less some salvage which he fixed at $150, and in light of the foregoing facts, and absence of any repudiation by appellant or pretension such as now set up, gave judgment for the proportionate amount of $3,600 for which that company would be liable after taking into account the concurrent insurance which is now in question. Such is the net result of the policy of absolute silence on the part of the appellant under so many and divers circumstances requiring it or its officers to be honest and straightforward instead of lulling at every step respondent into feeling assured that whatever might come the condition now relied upon would not be invoked.\nI am of opinion that its entire course of conduct including the appointment of Shallcross and his letters as well as what had preceded same as outlined above was evidence of that assent which is all that ever was necessary to put beyond peradventure any doubt as to its continued liability and that it is thereby estopped from denying such assent.\nI am reminded by the very peculiar circumstances in question herein, and the unworthy attempt to escape from liability on such ground as set up, of the case of Tattersall v. The People's Life Insurance Company[4], which was tried before me in Toronto in 1904, wherein the company sued upon a life insurance policy for which the last premium had not been paid, but by the terms of which it might be paid within thirty days after the death. It was not paid within that time. The circumstances which led to this result are detailed in the report of the case.\nThe parties concerned in making inquiry in order to decide upon the payment of the premiums in default had perhaps no legal right to insist upon making a tender of payment.\nThe officers of the company who failed to make answer to such inquiries were perhaps as destitute of authority to answer as counsel would wish us to hold the general agent herein was for what he did and permitted and directed, yet the judgment directed at the trial, proceeding upon estoppel, was upheld in the Divisional Cour as above cited; in the Court of Appeal for Ontario[5]; and in this court[6].\nI need not dwell upon the many peculiar facts in that case for they are fully reported in the first citation I have given, but , I cannot help thinking that there was much more to be said for the company in that case than there exists on the facts in this case for appellant.\nSee also the cases of Royal Guardians v. Clarke[7]; The Canadian Railway Accident Ins. Co. v. Haines [8]; Evangeline Fruit Co. v. Provincial Fire Ins. Co. [9]; Mahomed v. Anchor Fire & Marine Ins. Co. [10].\nIt is suggested that the condition herein having been broken the policy was at an end before the fire. The general manager of the company did not think so, for in his examination for discovery he was asked and answered as follows:\u2014\nQ.\u2014And the policy was in force on the 1st January 1916?\nA.\u2014Yes.\nThere was an insuperable barrier to anything else being said, for by the terms of the assignment to the mortgagee assented to by the general manager of the appellant it was rendered impossible of invalidation as to the mortgagee by reason of any such condition and hence cannot be said to have become null as suggested.\nAnd had the mortgagee sued upon it appellant could have had no effective answer. And I venture to think that had the appellant in such case under such circumstances as exist in question herein sought after all that transpired up to and including the trial and judgment for only a proportionate part of the loss to pay the other part of such assessment and to be subrogated to the mortgagee and enforce the mortgage on its behalf as against the respondent it would have failed. That apportionment of damages was clearly induced by the conduct of the appellant leading all concerned to assume that appellant was making no other contention than in common with the concurrent insurers as to the extent of damages.\nAgain, whilst in one breath denying that the policy existed after default, in the next it is urged that all that is now relied upon by the respondent answering, by way of estoppel, or as I suggest evidence of assent, was done in relation to the mortgagee's rights. As there never was in all the dealings of the general manager or the adjuster or either of them the slightest attention paid to the mortgagee and indeed her existence or rights were ignored throughout, such a suggestion seems hardly worthy of consideration.\nIt is because of the misleading dealings with the respondent and her alone that the result was reached of only a proportionate part of the whole loss being allowed by the learned judge that they form an impassable barrier in the appellant's way if justice is to be done.\nAgain, it is said there is no evidence of authority in the general manager to do or authorise to be done these things which respondent relies upon.\nThe circumstances I have already adverted to as well as the presumption arising from his admitted position as the general agent of the appellant for British Columbia not only by virtue of the facts in evidence but also the requirements of the British Columbia statute put him in the same legal category as those whom this court has in several cases held agents entitled to bind their respective principals.\nI may refer to the Royal Guardians, [11] Evangeline Fruit Co. [12], and the Mahomed Cases [13], above cited, and the general law of the subject as set forth in May on Insurance, paragraph 126; Bunyon on Fire Insurance, 233 et seq.; Cameron on Insurance, pages 231, 390, 412, and the several cases cited therein respectively. The case of Mutchmor v. Waterloo Mutual Fire Insurance Co.[14], in appeal contains a judgment by Mr. Justice Osler in which I agree. He expressly lays down therein that assent before or after the liability has accrued is sufficient. This is not the case of a condition where the policy is declared void. In such case, the consequences might be entirely different. See also the case of Richard v. Springfield Fire and Marine Ins. Co. [15]. I think the problem of solving the authority of an agent is well put as follows:\u2014\nThe authority of an agent must be determined by the nature of his business, and is prim\u00e2 facie co-extensive with its requirements (1 May on Insurance, 4th ed., sec. 126, p. 231).\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J. (dissenting):\u2014I understand that on the question of the liability of the defendant company the other members of the court are in favour of upholding the judgment against it. I am, with respect, inclined to take the contrary view for the reasons assigned by Macdonald, C.J.A., and Galliher, J.A.\nThe existence of co-insurance unassented to when the loss occurred afforded the defendant company an absolute defence to the plaintiff's claim. It would probably be necessary to the conduct of the business of a foreign insurance company like the defendant that it should have an agent in British Columbia empowered to assent to co-insurance before loss. Were such assent not readily given the assured might discontinue the policy, claim a refund of a proportion of his premium and insure with another company prepared to assent to co-insurance. The continuation of the risk, mutually advantageous, would afford sufficient consideration to warrant the giving of the assent. But after loss the position is entirely changed. An assent then given would amount to a relinquishment of an unanswerable defence to the claim of the insured and would be tantamount to an assumption of liability which would be purely gratuitous. In my opinion the giving of an assent entailing such consequences would not be within the apparent scope of the authority of any mere agent however general his representation of the company. Nothing short of an express provision conferring such authority could be relied upon to support it. The burden of proving its existence was upon the plaintiff. That burden she did not discharge. I do not find in the evidence enough to warrant a finding of acquiescence on the part of the company itself in what its agent had done.\nIn Mutchmor v. Waterloo Ins. Co.[16], relied on by the respondent, there was a finding, warranted by the evidence, that the company itself had express knowledge of the co-insurance when its general manager authorized steps similar to those authorized by the defendant company's agent in this case. Western Assurance Co. v. Doull [17], seems to me to be more closely in point. But I am apparently alone in holding these views and therefore confine myself to the mere statement of them to which I conceive the appellant is entitled.\nThere remains for consideration the question of the amount which the plaintiff is entitled to recover. The company's liability rests upon the assumption of an assent binding upon it having been given to the coinsurance. Under the 9th statutory condition, indorsed upon the defendant's policy, when co-insurance has been assented to the company is liable only for \"a ratable proportion of such loss or damage,\" i.e., of the loss or damage insured against. That, according to the terms of the policy, is\nall direct loss or damage by fire, except as hereinafter provided.\nRe-instatement of the plaintiff's premises in the condition in which they were before the fire admittedly could have been effected for $1,600. That was the amount of \"the direct loss or damage by fire.\" Owing to a municipal by-law, however, re-instatement of the premises as they were before the fire was impossible. Re-building in conformity with the by-law would have cost $3,600. While that may be in one sense the plaintiff's \"loss,\" it is a \"loss\" due to the fire plus the effect of a municipal by-law. The greater part of it is not \"direct loss and damage occasioned by fire,\" and is loss against liability for which the defendant company expressly stipulated.\nBy the 18th statutory condition the defendant company instead of making payment under its policy was entitled to repair, rebuild or replace the property damaged or lost. It gave notice of its intention to do so. But the municipal by-law prevented re-instatement. A variation of this condition, properly held to be reasonable in itself and duly endorsed on the policy, provided that:\u2014 If in consequence of any local or other laws, the company shall in any case be unable to repair or reinstate the property as it was it shall only be liable to pay such sum as would have sufficied to repair or reinstate the same.\nThe company, therefore, never became liable in respect of a rebuilding on a $3,600 basis. The effect of the variation was, in my opinion, notwithstanding the notice which had been given, clearly to limit liability to the $1,600 which it would have cost to effect reinstatement had the by-law not prevented it. The effect of reinstatement being rendered impossible by the by-law was to deprive the company of that alternative method of satisfying its liability. It remained liable under the policy itself to pay the amount of \"the direct loss or damage by fire\"\u2014$1,600. I cannot perceive any good reason why it is not entitled to the benefit of the co-insurance condition in respect of that sum. There was concurrent insurance to this extent, but to this extent only.\nMy attention has been drawn to two Ontario decisions\u2014The Trustees of the First Unitarian Congregation of Toronto v. The Western Assurance Co.[18], and McCausland v. Quebec Fire Ins. Co.[19], the latter based upon the former. I think the former is clearly distinguishable from that now before us. Both policies dealt with in that case covered the entire risk. The apportionment provided for by the condition there under consideration was to be made in the proportion which\nthe amount hereby assured shall bear to the whole amount assured on the said property,\ni.e., in the opinion of the court, on any part of the property which the policy covered. In the case at bar the provision is for payment of a ratable proportion of the loss, i.e., of the loss for which the defendant com\u2014 pany should be liable and for which there should be co-insurance assented to. The McCausland Case, [20] except on the question of costs, was the decision of the late Mr. Justice Rose alone. I am, with respect, unable to accept his view that the 9th statutory condition therein dealt with does not differ from the language upon which the decision in the Unitarian Congregation Case [21] was based. The condition under which the question of apportionment arises in the case at bar differs essentially in my opinion from those presented in either of the Ontario authorities to which reference has been made. I allude to them merely to indicate that they have not been overlooked.\nIt may have been\u2014it probably was\u2014unfortunate for the plaintiff, as the learned trial judge points out, that this action was not tried at the same time as the plaintiff's action against the other insurance company. The latter might, in that event, have been required to pay all of the $3,600 for which the present defendant should not be held liable. But for that this defendant is not responsible. It had no control over the other action. It took no part in the trial of it and I find nothing in the record to support the contention that by reason of what then took place it is estopped from claiming the full benefit of the 9th statutory condition. It was for the plaintiff, if she desired to do so, to have taken proper steps to secure the trial of both actions at the same time.\nI agree with Mr. Justice McPhillips that the defendant, if liable at all, is entitled to have the plaintiff's recovery limited to its ratable proportion of the sum of $1,600, i.e., $581.80, as found by the learned trial judge, whose judgment should therefore be restored. BRODEUR. J.\u2014The most important question in this appeal is whether the subsequent insurance taken by the respondent is a bar to her claim. By the statutory conditions of the Province of British Columbia, it is provided that an insurance company is not liable for loss\nif any subsequent insurance is effected in any other company, unless and until the company assents thereto.\nIt is claimed by the respondent that the company has given, through its attorney and representative in British Columbia, Mr. Rutherford, the necessary assent. The appellant company, which is a company having its head office in London, England, was bound, under the \"Companies Act\" of British Columbia, to appoint an agent or attorney in that province. We have not before us the deed appointing Mr. Rutherford; but in complying with the provincial statute a company is expected to give all the necessary powers to exercise their rights and obligations with regard to the business they intend to carry on in that province.\nIn this case, the appellant company or its agent became aware of the existence of a subsequent insurance only the day after the fire took place. However, the attorney, Rutherford, appointed adjusters with authority to settle the loss. Negotiations were carried on for several months without the company, at any time, denying liability or intimating to the respondent that the condition above quoted had put an end to its liability.\nThere was a clause in the policy that if in consequence of any local loss the company should, in any case, be unable to repair or reinstate the property as it was, then the company should only be liable to pay such sum as would have sufficed to repair it.\nUnder the provisions of that agreement, the com- pany, through its adjusters and agent, offered to rebuild.\nIt seems to me that all those circumstances shew that the company, through its attorney, elected to consider the policy in force and to be bound by it, though subsequent insurance had been taken.\nIt is suggested, however, that the negotiations were carried on by the agents because they had in mind the company's liability to the mortgagee, which, under the mortgage clause of the policy, would not be affected by the default of the mortgagor in giving to the appellant notice of the subsequent insurance.\nIf these negotiations had taken place with that end in view, it seems to me that a reference to that mortgage would have been made during those negotiations or they would have negotiated with the mortgagee. But all negotiations were carried on with the respondent; all offers were made to her and no reference has ever been made to the mortgagee.\nIt seems to me, in reading over the evidence, that the difference, during all those negotiations, was as to the amount which was to be paid for the loss. Respondent was claiming $6,000.00.\nA reference was made to the case decided by this court of Western Assurance Company v. Doull[22]. It is to be borne in mind that this case of Doull was a different one. In that case, it was provided that the assent had to be indorsed upon the policy. This was not required in the present case. Besides, when the insurance company in the Doull Case[23] gave instruction to its inspector to adjust the loss, it had no notice of the subsequent insurance.\nI would rely on the case decided by the Court of Appeal of Ontario of Mutchmor v. Waterloo Mutual Fire Ins. Co.[24], where it was held that the assent to the subsequent insurance is sufficiently shewn by the insurance company joining in the adjustment of the loss.\nThe appellant company contended before this court that it should be condemned to pay only $581.80 and not $1,390.00 as decided by the Court of Appeal. The total loss suffered by the plaintiff was $3,600; and she was insured for $5,500, of which $2,000 was in the appellant company and $3,500 in the North Empire Company. If the two insurance companies had the same risk, the proportion could be determined without any difficulty. In such a case the appellant company would be liable for 20-55ths of the sum of $3,600 and the other company 35-55ths of the same sum. In other words, the appellant company would have to pay $1,309.10, and the North Empire $2,290, a total of $3,600.\nBut the appellant says: I was not liable for the total loss of $3,600. I had a protective clause in my policy which restricted my liability in this case only to $1,600. Then my ratable proportion of the loss should be 20-55ths of $1,600, viz., $581.80, and all the rest of the loss should be supported by the North Empire Company.\nThat was the amount granted by the trial judge, but the Court of Appeal decided, on the contrary, that the ratable proportion to be paid by the appellant should be 20-55ths of $3,600, viz., $1,309.10.\nIt seems to me that the proper method of ascertaining the relative amount payable by the companies when the risks are different is to add the amount of all policies together, without reference to the division of the risks and that each company is liable for its relative proportion to the whole amount insured.

The proceedings in this case were commenced by originating notice of motion on behalf of the respondents, executors of the will of Mary Helen Orr, for the opinion and direction of the court on certain questions respecting the construction of said will and administration of the estate. The will was in the following terms:\nThis is the last Will and Testament of me, Miss Mary H. Orr, presently residing at Bobcaygeon, Victoria County, Ontario, I hereby revoking all former Wills at any time made by me, and being desirous of settling my affairs in the event of my decease and having full confidence in the persons after-named as Trustees and Executors, do hereby give, grant, assign, dispose, convey and make over to, and in favour of Mr. George Silas Haddock, 9 Crawford St., Roxbury, Christian Science Practitioner, Mr. Alfred Farlow, 609 Berkley Building, Boston, Mass., Christian Science Practitioner, Mr. William C. Moore, Bobcaygeon, Ontario, Manufacturer, and the survivor of them, as Trustees and in trust for the purposes aftermentioned the whole estate and effects, heritable and movable, real and personal, presently belonging to me and that shall belong to me at the time of my decease, together with the whole Writs and Vouchers thereof; and I nominate and appoint the said Mr. George Silas Haddock, Mr. Alfred Farlow, Mr. William C Moore and the survivor of them as they may appoint to be my sole Executors and Trustees of this my Will, but declaring that these Presents are granted in trust always for the purpose aftermentioned, viz.: (First) I direct my Executors and Trustees to first pay my just debts, personal and testamentary expenses.\n(Second) I give, devise and bequeath unto:\u2014The Mother Church, Boston, ten thousand dollars to be used in spreading the truth. Ten thousand dollars towards encouraging those building C.S. Churches to be distributed in smaller or larger sums as may be wise, from $100 to $300 to each Church. Ten thousand to be placed to the interest of Bobcaygeon to be used only for such purposes as will elevate the community spiritually. Ten thousand for the benefit of those who are endeavoring to uplift the needy in Chicago such as Miss Jane Addams, United Charities and whatever may seem to require assistance. Five thousand to be used for any necessary or uplifting purpose among Father\u2019s Kin. Five thousand to be used for any necessary or uplifting purpose among Mother\u2019s Kin. Fifty thousand will be held as a fund towards helping to supply such institutions as may in the near future be demonstrated to shew that God\u2019s people are willing to help others to see the Light that is so real, near and universal for all who will receive. These institutions may take the place of what at present are called Hospitals, Poor Houses, Gaols and Penitentiaries or any place that is maintained for the uplifting of humanity. Ten thousand as a fund to be used in lending to deserving people, men or women, to buy small homes or farms. This money can be lent at 6 per cent. or whatever is lawful on good security. The profits accruing can be utilized as said before in such work as is helpful to men and women who are willing to know and experience the truth as revealed in the Bible and which has been unlocked through the Revelation as given in Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures by Mary Baker Eddy. The whole of my estate must be used for God only.\nAnd I reserve my life-rent, and full power to alter, innovate or revoke these presents in whole or in part. And I dispense with the delivery hereof. And I consent to registration hereof for preservation.\nThe appellant is the next of kin of the testatrix. The respondents are the Church of Christ, Scientist, the executors of the will and the Attorney-General of Ontario.\nAt the original hearing on the motion Mr. Justice Sutherland held that the two last bequests were void and that no disposition had been made of the residue of the estate. The Appellate Division affirmed his judgment as to the last bequest of $10,000, but reversed it as to the preceding one of $50,000, and held that the words\nall my estate must be used for God only\nconstituted a valid devise of the residue. The next of kin appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.\nMcLaughlin K.C. and Stinson for the appellant. The devise of $50,000 cannot be construed as being for a \u201ccharitable purpose\u201d as that expression is defined in the cases. See Morice v. Bishop of Durham[2]; Kendall v. Granger[3]; Dunne v. Byrne[4].\nThe words\nthe whole of my estate must be used for God only\nwere not meant to be operative nor intended to be a bequest. If they were they cannot be held to be a devise of the residue. Powerscourt v. Powerscourt[5]; Hunter v. Attorney-General[6]. Hellmuth K.C. for the respondents, The Church of Christ and the executors. As to the residue the testator intended that the whole estate should be used for religious purposes and the words used constitute a valid devise. See In re White[7]; In re Pardoe[8], at p. 192.\nAs to the bequest of $50,000 see Townsend v. Carus[9]; Houston v. Burns[10].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The late Mary Helen Orr, who was possessed of large means, left a will, a printed form filled in in writing, of which the individual respondents are the executors. They found it necessary to apply to the court for an opinion as to the meaning and validity of the provisions of the will and certainly there was necessity for so doing.\nThe will is as following:\u2014\nThis is the last Will and Testament of me, Miss Mary H. Orr, presently residing at Bobcaygeon, Victoria County, Ontario, I hereby revoking all former Wills at any time made by me, and being desirous of settling my affairs in the event of my decease and having full confidence in the persons after-named as Trustees and Executors, do hereby give, grant, assign, dispose, convey and make over to, and in favour of Mr. George Silas Haddock, 9 Crawford St., Roxbury, Christian Science Practitioner, Mr. Alfred Farlow, 609 Berkley Building, Boston, Mass. Christian Science Practitioner, Mr. William C. Moore, Bobcaygeon, Ontario, Manufacturer, and the survivor of them, as Trustees and in trust for the purposes aftermentioned the whole estate and effects, heritable and movable, real and personal, presently belonging to me and that shall belong to me at the time of my decease, together with the whole Writs and Vouchers thereof, and I nominate and appoint the said Mr. George Silas Haddock, Mr. Alfred Farlow, Mr. William C. Moore and the survivor of them as they may appoint to be my sole Executors and Trustees of this my Will, but declaring that these Presents are granted in trust always for the purpose aftermentioned, viz.:\n(First) I direct my Executors and Trustees to first pay my just debts, personal and testamentary expenses.\n(Second) I give, devise and bequeath unto:\u2014The Mother Church, Boston, ten thousand dollars to be used in spreading the truth.

The whole of my estate must be used for God only.\nAnd I reserve my life-rent, and full power to alter, innovate or revoke these presents in whole or in part. And I dispense with the delivery hereof. And I consent to registration hereof for preservation.\nIn witness whereof I have subscribed these presents written (in so far as not printed) by myself at Bobcaygeon this twenty-ninth day of August, nineteen hundred and twelve.\nMary Helen Orr.\nSigned, published and declared by the above named testatrix as and for her last Will and Testament in the presence of us both present at the same time, who at her request and in her presence have hereunto subscribed our names as witnesses.\n(Witnesses)\nName, \u201cMrs. Georgenna McKay,\u201d (C.S. Practitioner),\nAddress, 2 College St., Toronto.\nName, \u201cLouise Lewis,\u201d Chiropodist,\nAddress, No. 2 College Street.\nThe present appeal is confined to the disposition by the judgment a quo of the $50,000 for supplying institutions described in vague and general terms and the decision that the concluding sentence in the paragraph containing the bequests made,\nthe whole of my estate must be used for God only, is a good and charitable bequest of the residue of the estate.\nAs to the specific bequest of $50,000 the trial judge found that\nthe language in which the legacy is couched is so vague, visionary, chimerical and impracticable, and the objects intended to be benefitted, and the time when the benefit is to accrue, are so uncertain, that no reasonable or intelligible construction or effect can be given to the clause and the legacy must therefore be held to be void.\nThe Court of Appeal, varying the judgment, declared that\nthe words contained in the will constitute a good and valid charitable bequest and that the intention of the will is that the sum of $50,000 shall be devoted by the executors to the dissemination and teaching of the principles and purposes of the Church of Christ, Scientist, commonly known as Christian Science.\nI should have thought it impossible to say that by providing for the establishment of a fund towards helping to supply institutions for the uplifting of humanity the testarix intended that the capital sum should be devoted by her executors to the dissemination and teaching of the principles and purposes of the Church of Christ, Scientist, commonly known as Christian Science. I should have thought this impossible even if the will had not in the first two bequests made provision for this same purpose of dissemination and teaching of Christian Science.\nThe Chief Justice of Ontario, in his judgment, referring to this bequest, says:\u2014\nThe intention in favour of charity is for the reasons I shall mention when I come to deal with the 9th gift (the residue) found in the provisions that the whole of the estate of the testatrix \u201cmust be used for God only,\u201d aided to some extent perhaps by the other provisions of the Will.\nLater on, however, when he comes to deal with the residue, he says:\u2014\nIt may be suggested that all that the testatrix meant by the provision in question was that the preceding bequests should be \u201cused for God only,\u201d but that view cannot, I think, be supported. The words, \u201cthe whole of my estate\u201d are inconsistent with it as is also the fact that the testatrix had already carefully directed the purposes to which the money she had bequeathed should be applied, and it is highly improbable that having done that she would have thought of restricting the use to which these benefactions should be put by the much looser expression that they \u201cmust be used for God only.\u201d\nI think his latter view is the correct one and that the will itself, in which the purposes of the specific bequests are set out, contradicts any suggestion that they are to be governed by the words,\nThe whole of my estate must be used for God only.\nThe key-note of the purpose of the bequests is, I should say, the uplifting of humanity. We find the word itself used not only in the bequest under consideration, but in three others, and the bequest for loans may be said to be a fifth bequest given for this purpose out of the eight bequests. On the other hand, the $10,000 for Bobcaygeon is expressly restricted\nto be used only for such purposes as will elevate the community spiritually.\nThe uplifting of humanity is a benevolent but not a charitable purpose; James v. Allen[11].\nIt is suggested that\nthis gift may be supported as a charitable bequest coming under the 4th head mentioned in section 2 (s.) of the \u201cMortmain and Charitable Uses Act\u201d (R.S.O. 1914, c. 103,\nthe opinion being expressed that the courts of Ontario are warranted in looking to it as the courts in England look to the Statute of Elizabeth for the purpose of determining what in law is a charitable gift in the case of personalty.\nThe law relating to charitable bequests in this province is not the English law, though no doubt like most of our law derived from English law. This law having existed in the province from the beginning I do not think so great a change could be effected by the jurisprudence of the courts. It would require legislation and there is nothing in the \u201cMortmain and Charitable Uses Act\u201d even to suggest that by this Act, dealing solely with land, there was any intention of indirectly altering the established law relating to charitable bequests.\nI am of opinion that there is no ground for the interpretation which the Appellate Division has put upon this bequest and I think that the trust is so vague and uncertain that the trial judge was right in declaring that the bequest was void and falls into the residue.\nComing to the question of the disposal of the residue, I can find no ground for holding that the words,\nThe whole of my estate must be used for God only,\nconstitute a charitable bequest disposing of the whole residue of the estate.\nI do not think the words constitute a bequest at all. They occur at the end of the specific bequests in the space left for these in the printed form, and may perhaps be merely a statement of what the testatrix considers is the effect of the bequests. There seems to be some reason for supposing that she thought she had disposed of the whole of her property by the specific bequests and I think a very natural meaning to put upon the expression in the position in which we find it, is that she intended it as an apology or explanation of her leaving no individual or strictly private bequests. I cannot believe that in making use of these words she had the least idea of giving any property.\nChief Justice Meredith says that he has numbered the bequests for convenience of reference, but he has given an unfair gloss to the words in the last sentence by putting this in a separate paragraph and numbering and speaking of it as gift number 9. There is nothing to justify this. In the will it follows straight on after the disposition made by the specific bequests. But even if the words be held to pass the residue the question still remains whether it is a valid bequest.\nI suppose it may be said that every use of property is, or at any rate ought to be, for God. In the case of In re Darling[12], Mr. Justice Stirling did indeed hold that a gift by will\nto the poor and the service of God\nwas a good charitable gift thinking that\nwhen the service of God is spoken of as it is in this will no one so construing the expression would hesitate to say that service in a religious sense was intended.\nThe learned judge was careful to restrict his construction to the service of God spoken of as it was in the will before him, and in this he adopted the same reserve as many other learned judges in similar cases. Each case must be considered upon it own special circumstances, and here the words are of the widest.\nIn Dunne v. Byrne[13], it was held that a residuary bequest\nto the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane and his successors to be used and expended wholly or in part as such Archbishop may judge conducive to the good of religion in this diocese\nis not a good charitable bequest and is void. It seems clear that a use of property that is conducive to the good of religion must be said to be used for God, and the present case would seem to fall clearly within this decision.\nAgain, whilst in In re White[14], it was held that in accordance with the authorities a bequest for religious purposes must be considered as a good charitable gift, the cases all treat these purposes as necessarily of a public nature as was shewn by the Vice-Chancellor Wickens in Cocks v. Manners[15]; there may well be religious purposes which are not of such a nature and consequently not charitable. No one could deny that a use of property for private devotion or edification was a use for God, and the words in this will must, therefore, be wider than any in which they have been held to make a good charitable gift. The language of the bequest is open to such latitude of construction as to raise no trust which a court of equity could carry into execution: Baker v. Sutton[16].\nPerhaps, moreover, it may be said that Christian Science is rather a theory of all things in Heaven and earth evolved by the foundress of the Scientist Church, than a religion as commonly understood. The testatrix conceivably did not intend her property to be devoted to religious purposes according to the commonly accepted meaning of these words.\nThere is, I think, a difference between the present and the Darling Case[17] and the other similar cases which have been referred to. In all of these there was no doubt about the meaning of the testator in speaking of \u201cGod\u201d or\nMy Lord and Master and I trust Redeemer,\nor in similar expressions. In the appellant\u2019s factum it is said that the testatrix was pantheistic in her religious views. I am far from accepting that statement as correct, but on the other hand I am not prepared to agree with the Chief Justice of Ontario. He sets out the religious tenets of Christian Science as found in their authoritative manuals and adds the brief comment that\nthere is nothing in all this which conflicts with the beliefs of the most orthodox Christian.\nIn this, I think, he goes further than the facts warrant.\nIf the testatrix did not accept the Christian religion, which is assumed in all the cases to which reference has been made, I do not know how the court is to say what were her intentions, or that the bequest was for religious purposes as ordinarily understood, still less how it is to formulate a trust for giving them effect cy pr\u00e8s.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the bequest of $50,000 is void and the money falls into the residue of the estate; and that the residuary estate is not disposed of by the will but passes to the next of kin of the testatrix. The judgment of the Appellate Division should be varied accordingly.\nCosts of all parties should come out of the estate.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014A number of questions were submitted to the Supreme Court of Ontario for advice and direction of that court respecting the construction of the last will and testament of Mary Helen Orr, a Christian Scientist, and respecting the administration of her estate.\nAll but three of these have been so disposed of that they need not concern us now save for purposes relative to these three.\nIf the judgment of the Appellate Division is right, in regard to the last of these, we need not trouble ourselves with any other.\nThe will written by the testatrix using, it is said, a printed form, begins by giving to three persons named as trustees and executors in trust for the purposes after mentioned, the whole estate and effects heritable and movable, real and personal, presently belonging to me and that shall belong to me at the time of my decease,\nand repeating the purport of this, proceeds in effect as follows:\u2014\nFirst, a direction to pay debts and testamentary expenses.\nSecondly,\nI give, devise and bequeath unto,\nand then follows under that heading a continuous, consecutive stream, as it were, of giving of eight legacies, of which the last is thus expressed:\nTen thousand as a fund to be used in lending to deserving people, men or women, to buy small homes or farms. This money can be lent at 6 per cent. or whatever is lawful on good security. The profits accruing can be utilized as said before in such work as is helpful to men and women who are willing to know and experience the truth as revealed in the Bible and which has been unlocked through the revelation as given in Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures by Mary Baker Eddy. The whole of my estate must be used for God only.\nThe last sentence,\nThe whole of my estate must be used for God only,\nforms part of the continuous text and to all appearance is a part of the definition of purpose attendant on this last gift.\nBut for the holding of the court below that this must be taken as a residuary bequest, I should have said that it was nothing more than a pious ejaculation, or possible admonition relative to the spirit in which \u201cthe profits accruing\u201d referred to in the next preceding sentence were to be utilised.\nAnd if I felt clear that it must be read as an intentional disposition of the residue of her estate, I should read it as clearly intending that the said preceding sentence, dealing with part of the residue falling into the hands of the trust, and in no other way disposed of, was comprised within its scope, and both sentences be read together in order to grasp the meaning of the testatrix.\nThe residuary bequest would then read:\u2014\nThe profits accruing can be utilized as said before in such work as is helpful to men and women who are willing to know and experience the truth as revealed in the Bible and which has been unlocked through the revelation as given in Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures by Mary Baker Eddy. The whole of my estate must be used for God only.\nI submit that such a construction as may be given these two sentences read together, as they were written, much more truly represents the thought that was in the mind of the testatrix, than does the result embodied in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the formal judgment appealed from, which is intended to be worked out within the lines of the Ontario \u201cMortmain and Charitable Uses Act,\u201d as construed by the Master at Lindsay subject to the corrective power of the court.\nThe said paragraph 8 of the said judgment declares the words I have quoted (omitting the last sentence) do not constitute a valid bequest, and that despite one of the obvious purposes of the trust to produce an income designed to promote religion as the testatrix understood it.\nThe mode of investment of the fund is only a small part of the trust, and could not help many people, but the fund would produce or was intended to produce, six hundred dollars a year to promote in the way expressed the religion the testatrix held dear.\nNot only have we thus, by reason of its immediate context, an expression which sheds light on the meaning of the testatrix\u2019s words\nthe whole of my estate must be used for God only,\nbut also by the whole preceding bequests in the will.\nIt is not the residue, but the whole of her estate which is to\nbe used for God only. Some of these bequests have no very obvious relation to any such restricted charitable uses, as the court below has confined, by its direction, the application of the residue.\nI most respectfully submit that the judgment in so wresting the sentence from its context and giving it such interpretation, and directing such an administration of the residue of the estate, is in effect making a will for the testatrix and giving effect to something she failed to express.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Sutherland that there was no residuary bequest.\nIndeed the originating notice of motion does not seem to have been launched with the conception that there was any actual residuary bequest, and merely wanted to know what was to be done with property given in trust yet no definite trust expressed relative thereto.\nI also agree that if the words referred to are to be treated as independent of their immediate context and read only in connection with the words at the beginning of the will expressing an intention to create a trust, they are far too indefinite to be given any effect to.\nThe learned Chief Justice seems to rely upon In re Darling[18], the judgment of a single judge, and Powerscourt v. Powerscourt[19], which finds approval from the same learned judge, but seems to have been followed no place else, and I submit has in effect been overruled by the Privy Council in the case of Dunne v. Byrne[20], where the expression used and in question was much more definite than anything in either of said cases, yet in law held inoperative. Moreover, the court, deciding the Powerscourt Case19, did not think it needed to form a scheme for execution of the trust. Indeed, in regard to any one of these three cases, I should have supposed there was much more to be said in favour of upholding the bequest than can be said in this case if regard is to be had at all to the mind and circumstances of the testatrix and her expressed views as interpreting her meaning.\nThe most recent case, of which the report has only come to hand since the judgment below was delivered, is that of Houston v. Burns[21], in which interpretation is given the expression\npublic, benevolent or charitable purposes\nand holding such expression cannot be maintained as establishing a definite trust.\nIf the testatrix had been asked to define her meaning of the words now in question I have not the slightest doubt she would have given a like definition. Her whole trend of thought, as exemplified in the language of her will, convinces me such was what she thought and meant to be a giving\nfor the use of God.\nIt is her understanding and intention we must have regard to in the first place, as the courts did that passed upon the wills respectively in question in the Darling Case[22], and Powerscourt Case[23], and even there in light of the judgments in the Houston Case21, just cited, clearly holding public and benevolent purposes mean nothing in such a connection.\nIt has been repeatedly held by the highest authority that the mere expression of any trust as for public or benevolent or philanthropic purposes, unless expressly defined by indicating some specific object within the meaning of such words, cannot create a trust which the law will recognise. Yet in many of these cases so deciding the subject-matter and the object might have fallen within the scope of the words \u201cuse of God\u201d had the court felt such a wide range of purpose as within the law enabling courts to maintain such a trust.\nIf, I submit most respectfully, the court deciding the Houston Case21, I refer to, or Blair v. Duncan[24], had been as astute to find a charitable purpose as the court below, they could, and no doubt would have discarded all but the word \u201ccharitable\u201d and given effect to the trust.\nMy only difficulties in this appeal have been, and are, the questions: First, as to the $50,000 which is to be\nheld as a fund towards helping to supply such institutions as may in the near future be demonstrated to shew that God\u2019s people are willing to help others to see the Light that is so real, near and universal for all who will receive. These institutions may take the place of what are at present called Hospitals, Poor Houses, Gaols and Penitentiaries or any place that is maintained for the uplifting of humanity,\nand next, as to that raised by what I first set forth and quoted above, and is dealt with by paragraph 8 of the formal judgment.\nAs to the former, with some very grave doubts, I would let it stand as adjudged, but in doing so I cannot see why the equally obvious intention of the other should not be allowed to stand. I imagine it has not been so treated because of a misconception of the whole clause, in assuming that lending money to worthy people was the purpose thereof instead of that being an incident in the mode of carrying out a main purpose which I have already explained, or something like it.\nI would therefore amend, in order to be consistent, the said eighth paragraph of the judgment, and declare the bequest valid and the profits from such investments to be devoted to the like purposes as defined in paragraph seven of said judgment. Since writing the immediately foregoing hesitating expression of opinion, I learn that the majority of the court have come to the conclusion that both these bequests are invalid, and I agree, content with my expressions of doubt.\nIn my opinion, the appeal should be allowed; the so-called residuary clause declared invalid, and the formal judgment be rectified in paragraphs 7 and 8 accordingly.\nANGLIN J.\u2014After such careful consideration as I have been able to give to the judgments of the learned judges of the Appellate Division, and to the factums and oral arguments of counsel, I am, with respect, of the opinion that upon the two questions involved in this appeal the judgment of the learned judge of first instance was right and should be restored.\nAssuming that the clause,\nThe whole of my estate must be used for God only,\nshould be treated as a residuary bequest\u2014which, I think, open to the gravest doubt\u2014I cannot regard the phrase\nfor God only\nas equivalent to\nfor the service of God\u2014\nwords which have been held to import\nservice in a religious sense\u2014service similar to such service as is referred to when * * * service in the church is spoken of.\nIn re Darling[25]. The use of money \u201cfor God only\u201d may include many things not religious or charitable within the sense in which English law restricts \u201ccharitable bequests\u201d\u2014just as a bequest of money to be used and expended as the donee may judge conducive to the good of religion within a defined area, may include purposes not strictly religious and therefore not necessarily charitable in the eyes of the law. Dunne v. Byrne[26]. Moreover, the testatrix has by her specific gifts\u2014at least two of which have been held not valid as charitable bequests\u2014in my opinion, clearly indicated that, as used by her, the words\nto be used for God only\n(which she has made applicable in explicit terms to every bequest in her will) were not intended to restrict the use of her money to purely religious purposes or even to purposes charitable in the eyes of the law. I am therefore unable to regard the clause under consideration as a valid residuary charitable bequest.\nNor in the view which I take of their true import do the words,\nto be used for God only,\naid the respondents in the consideration of the $50,000 legacy, the other subject of appeal. Some of the purposes indicated by the testatrix as objects of her bounty in that bequest are clearly not \u201ccharitable\u201d in the legal sense; others may or may not be so. Moreover, I have utterly failed in my endeavour to find an intelligible meaning in the words,\nsuch institutions as may in the future be demonstrated to shew that God\u2019s people are willing to help others to see the Light that is so real, near and universal for all who will receive.\nI agree with Sutherland J. when he says of this bequest:\nAfter repeated perusal and consideration of this clause of the will I have come to the conclusion that the language in which the legacy is couched is so vague, visionary, chimerical and impracticable and the objects intended to be benefitted and the time when the benefit is to accrue, are so uncertain that no reasonable or intelligible construction or effect can be given to the clause and the legacy must therefore be held to be void. I, of course, confine myself to the questions raised on the appeal, and to the grounds necessary for the disposition of them. I desire to guard, however, against being understood as holding that the impugned bequests may not be assailed on grounds broader and more far\u2011reaching.\nI would allow the appeal and would restore the judgment of the learned judge of first instance to the extent sought by the appellant. Having regard to all the circumstances, costs of all parties should be paid out of the estate.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The first question submitted to this court is whether the $50,000 bequest is a charitable one. The court of first instance decided that it was not a charitable bequest. The Appellate Division came to a different conclusion.\nThe will appointed trustees and provided for certain specific bequests, and the testatrix said that\n$50,000 will be held as a fund towards helping to supply such institutions as may in the near future be demonstrated to shew that God\u2019s people are willing to help others to see the Light that is so real, near and universal for all who will receive. These institutions may take the place of what are at present called Hospitals, Poor Houses, Gaols and Penitentiaries or any place that is maintained for the uplifting of humanity.\nMiss Orr, the testatrix, was a Christian Scientist; and it is contended that the bequest was for religious purposes. She had, however, made legacies to her Mother Church and to encourage the construction of Christain Science churches; but the language of the bequest of $50,000 would be open to such latitude of construction, is so vague, and so indefinite, and I would add with Mr. Justice Sutherland,\nso visionary, chimerical and impracticable as to raise no trust which a court of justice could carry into execution. (Baker v. Sutton[27]).\nThe Privy Council, in 1912, decided in the case of Dunne v. Byrne[28], that a residuary bequest to be used and expended by a trustee, a Roman Catholic Archbishop, in the way most conducive to the good of religion in his diocese, is not a good charitable bequest and is void.\nI would rely also on the decision of the Privy Council in Attorney-General of New Zealand v. Brown[29].\nThe other question raised in this appeal is with regard to the residue of the estate.\nThe testatrix, after having mentioned specific bequests, adds:\nThe whole of my estate must be used for God only.\nIt was decided in first instance by Mr. Justice Sutherland that such an expression is too broad, indefinite and controversial to be capable of being carried out and that there is no residuary clause in the will. The Appellate Division came to the conclusion that such a clause constituted a good and valid charitable bequest and covered the residue of the estate.\nI am unable to agree with the opinion of the Appellate Division. Those words:\nthe whole of my estate must be used for God only,\ndo not constitute a good residuary bequest. They should be considered as an advice to all those who receive any portion of her estate to spend their share in such a manner that will be agreeable to God.\nIt may be that the testatrix had a general charitable intention but she has not expressed it in words; and the court cannot give effect to an unexpressed intention. Hunter v. Attorney-General[30].\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment of Mr. Justice Sutherland restored, the costs of all parties in this court and in the courts below to be paid out of the residuary estate of the deceased.\nCASSELS J.\u2014The appeal in this case is limited in this court to two points.\nThe appeal is from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario in respect to their finding as to the proper construction to be placed upon the clauses in the will of the late Helen Orr.\nThese clauses are numbered in the very able reasons of the Chief Justice of Ontario seven and nine. There is no numbering in the will, but it is convenient to adopt the method followed by the learned Chief Justice.\nThe clauses of the will in question read as follows:\u2014\n7. Fifty thousand will be held as a fund towards helping to supply such institutions as may in the near future be demonstrated to shew that God\u2019s people are willing to help others to see the Light that is so real, near and universal for all who will receive. These institutions may take the place of what at present are called Hospitals, Poor Houses, Gaols and Penitentiaries or any place that is maintained for the uplifting of humanity.\n9. The whole of my estate must be used for God only.\nAfter the best consideration I can give to the case and with great respect for the opinion arrived at by the learned judges of the Appellate Division, I cannot bring my mind to the conclusions arrived at by them.\nI think the learned trial judge arrived at the proper conclusion. Some propositions laid down in the various reasons are beyond doubt correct. If possible, a construction which should avoid an intestacy should be given to the will.\nOn the other hand, if such a construction be given to the will as would permit the executors and trustees to give the trust funds to purposes other than charitable bequests as to which the cy pr\u00e8s doctrine should be invoked, then the bequests are void for uncertainty. Houston v. Burns[31]; Blair v. Duncan[32]; Hunter v. Attorney-General[33], at page 314.\nConsider the bequest referred to in provision 7. It cannot be contended that \u201cgaols and penitentiaries\u201d are in any sense charities of such a character, so that the cy pr\u00e8s doctrine could be invoked to save the bequest. It is difficult to place any meaning on this seventh bequest (so numbered). It is too uncertain to be given effect to. If not void for uncertainty the trustees might devote the $50,000 for Godly purposes other than charitable purposes.\nThen as to clause nine as numbered:\u2014\nThe whole of my estate must be used for God only.\nIf the testatrix intended by this bequest to include all the previous legacies as well as the residue of the estate then the court must add to her will the words\nfor Godly purposes,\nwhich might harmonise with the previous bequests.\nIf, on the other hand, this bequest merely applies to the residue of the estate undisposed of, I fail to see how the court can interpolate into the will the words, for the service of God only.\nThe cases cited by the learned Chief Justice where the words used are for the service of God to my mind are not applicable. In the case of Dunne v. Byrne[34], decided by the Privy Council it was held\nthat a residuary bequest to the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane and his successors to be used and expended wholly or in part as such Archbishop may judge conducive to the good of religion in this diocese\nis not a good charitable bequest and is void.\nIn delivering the judgment of the Board, Lord Macnaghten, at page 411, uses the following language:\nIn the present case their Lordships think that they are not bound to treat the expression used by the testator as identical with the expression \u201cfor religious purposes,\u201d and therefore, not without reluctance, they are compelled to concur in the conclusion at which the High Court arrived.\nTo my mind there is great similarity between this case last referred to, Dunne v. Byrne[35], and the present case. I think the appeal should be allowed and the court should declare the bequests seven and nine void for uncertainty and that there was an intestacy as to the $50,000 and as to the residue.\nAs to costs: This case is a peculiar one. Having regard to the rule laid down by the House of Lords and the Privy Council, there being a considerable divergence of judicial opinion, and the litigation having been occasioned by the unfortunate warding of the will of the testatrix, the costs of all parties to this appeal as between solicitor and client should be paid out of the residuary estate.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McLaughlin, Fulton, Stinson & Anderson.\nSolicitors for the respondent, The Church of Christ: Hellmuth, Cattanach & Meredith\nSolicitors for the respondents, executors: Stewart & Scott.\n[1] 40 Ont.

Hicks[3]; Hunter v. Attorney-General[4].\nHellmuth K.C. and Neil Sinclair for the respondents referred to Follett v. Pettman[5]; In re Smith[6]. THE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The case, I think, comes before the court with insufficient information to enable it to be satisfactorily dealt with. By his will the testator recited:\u2014\nI have certain life insurance upon my life, some payable to my estate some payable to my wife, some payable to my wife and children, and it is my wish, purpose and desire that the conditions of payment in all policies of insurance be carried out and that my wife and children and estate may receive and benefit in the proportions and manner as set forth in all and each of said policies.\nWith the exception of a specific bequest to his wife of his household goods and effects the testator bequeathed to trustees upon the trusts mentioned all of his property which, of course, would include insurance moneys coming to his estate.\nThe codicil to the will provided:\nAnd further I say, and irrevocably will and determine that my wife E.F. Spink, shall have one-quarter or one-fourth of my life insurance. I intend it to cover my policies in the Standard Life, now over $8,000, I think No. 80076 W. and United Workmen, I think certificate No. 3491, and I think Provident Saving Life No. 177,764, and Independent Order of Foresters, Certificate No. I think Nos. 31236 and 242662.\nAlthough much argument has been made upon the amounts of the insurance moneys as they would go under the provisions of the will or codicil, there is no information concerning them in the record beyond a statement by certain of the parties that under the will the widow would receive of the life insurance about $9,000, and under the codicil about $4,000 or $5,000 less. This statement, of course, depends upon what is the understanding of the parties as to the effect of the will and codicil, an understanding that is possibly, if not probably, erroneous.\nNot only have we no information concerning the policies and the amounts which, under their terms, would go to the widow and children and the estate of the testator respectively, but we do not know whether in the codicil the testator, in the insurance of which he makes mention, was dealing only with those belonging to his estate, or whether he was assuming to dispose of the whole of the insurance on his life.\nChief Justice Meredith has accepted the parties\u2019 figures and ignored any difficulties to which they give rise, though his remarks that the insurance money amounted to about $20,000, that the half share of the widow under the will would have amounted to $9,000, and her quarter share under the codicil to about $4,000, seem to involve calculations difficult to reconcile with the immutable laws of arithmetic.\nI do not, however, think it is necessary to refer the matter back on account of this imperfect evidence, because, in my opinion, the judgment appealed from cannot in any event be maintained.\nThe important words of the codicil which are in question read:\u2014\nOne-quarter of these policies go direct to my wife but all my other property now goes with my last son dead, to my three daughters under the terms of my said last will.\nI suppose it must be admitted that, taken by themselves alone, the meaning of these words does not admit of much doubt. Omitting the words\nunder the terms of my said last will,\nit does not admit of any doubt.\nThe testator drew both will and codicil himself, and the latter document when he was in extremis. May he not well have supposed that some of the terms of the will would still be applicable to his bequest, the equal division between the children; the taking by survivorship; grandchildren inheriting their parents\u2019 share, etc.? Is not this more likely than supposing that he had forgotten that by his will he had left his children nothing but a reversionary interest in one-half share of his residuary estate.?\nIn the reasons for judgment appealed from it is said:\u2014\nThese considerations (of intention) are no doubt relevant only if the meaning of the provision of the codicil which is in question is doubtful, for if, on the true construction of it, there is a clear gift of the whole of the residue to the three daughters they are irrelevant and the codicil must be given effect to according to its terms.\nThe first ground on which the decision is put is the rule of law that an erroneous recital by a testator in a codicil that he has by his will given a legacy to A.B. when he has not done so, creates no legacy at all. This, of course, admits of no doubt but does not seem to be in point here. It has application in such cases as Mackenzie v. Bradbury[7], quoted by Meredith C.J.O., where the codicil erroneously stated:\u2014\nWhereas, by my will, I have bequeathed to Francis, the son of my husband\u2019s niece, the sum of \u00a31,000, now I hereby declare that the said legacy shall not be payable until, etc.,\nand the claim of Francis to be entitled by implication to a legacy of \u00a31,000 was held to be unfounded. Such a case as this has no bearing on the present unless we assume that the testator was not, by his codicil, making a bequest but merely a purposeless and erroneous recital of so important a matter as the disposition made by his will of the whole of his property.\nThe second ground put forward is that, as held by the House of Lords in Hearle v. Hicks[8], where there is a clear and manifest intention to devise it is incumbent on a party alleging a revocation by a codicil to prove that the intention to revoke was equally clear and manifest. To enable this rule to have any application it is necessary to assume the point in dispute, namely, that the codicil gave no bequest to the daughters, for obviously there must be a necessary revocation of a devise made by a will if the same property is left by the codicil to a different devisee. The argument, therefore, seems to amount to this that there was no bequest by the codicil because there was no revocation of the will and there was no revocation because there was no bequest by the codicil. This does not prove the proposition.\nIn the absence of any ambiguity the court cannot consider what may have been the intentions of the testator, but if it were possible in the present case to inquire into these, I do not think the probabilities would be such as the Chief Justice of Ontario suggests. The main ground on which he rests his views is that the testator must have intended in his codicil to have preserved to his widow the same proportion of his estate as he had left her in his will. Why should he wish to do so? I can imagine no reason, but, on the contrary, think the presumption, so far as there is any, should be the other way. The ordinary man, I apprehend, desires to leave his widow a suitable income proportionable to his means for the rest of her life, or until her remarriage, a dower in fact, following the provision made for her by the common law. If he should have an estate of $50,000 he might leave his widow one-half or $25,000, but if subsequently to the making of his will he became possessed of $500,000, it is most unlikely that he would wish to leave her half of this. He might increase her legacy to $50,000, or one\u2011tenth of his estate, but the rest he would leave to his married children.\nWhat are the facts assumed in this case, for as I have said, we do not know with certainty what they really are? The estate, excluding life insurance, was sworn at $26,500, but this included the moiety of the son\u2019s insurance which, as appears from the affidavit of the latter\u2019s executor, was upwards of $11,000. Consequently the estate, excluding insurance, of which the testator was disposing at the date of his will, was not much over $20,000. Of this he left half, or $10,000, to his widow, and the other half, subject to a life interest to her, to his children. Adopting the figures of the executor, the respondent, J.R. Brodie, the widow would have taken $9,000 of the insurance money, a total of $19,000. Now the son died, and his mother took one moiety of his insurance money, and by the codicil in question, the other moiety, $11,000 and upwards; then the testator, again according to the figures of the executor, reduced her share of his insurance moneys from $9,000 to $5,000, and gave all the residue to his children, leaving her with $16,000 actual cash, instead of an uncertain $19,000, for he could not have known what the share which she would get under the will would amount to, and the life interest in half the residue. This, of course, was a reduction in the benefits given to the widow, but not an extravagant one, especially in view of the fact that the testator did undoubtedly intend to make some reduction of them.\nWe cannot speculate as to the motives of the testator. It is suggested in the appellants\u2019 factum that\nthe son, unmarried, being dead and all the daughters being married, the necessity of the widow looking after and caring for the unmarried son had also ended.\nIt may be so, we cannot go into the family circumstances. It is said in the affidavit of the respondent, Ruby J. Middleton, that\nto the last there never was any change whatever in the tender relations and most affectionate regard which existed between my father and my mother. It would indeed be unfortunate if the courts undertook to vary testamentary dispositions on such considerations. Where, owing to family circumstances, a testator finds it desirable to alter the previous appropriation of his property he would often have the best of reasons for not wishing to make public the cause of his doing so. The present case itself affords an illustration and I give it only as such. The testator may have had reason to foresee that, as in fact has happened, his widow would leave all her property to two of her daughters, disinheriting the third, contrary to his own wish. Yet how impossible it would have been for him to set down in his codicil the reason for revoking the bequest to his widow and making a different provision for her by the codicil.\nIn my own view a natural interpretation would be that in making his will the testator knew that his wife would employ her property largely for the benefit of his only son, but the death of the latter entirely changed the condition of affairs. The codicil was undoubtedly made owing to this occurrence; it was then only necessary to make a suitable provision for his widow, which was done, and the testator said\nbut all my other property now goes with my last son dead to my three daughters.\nIf, as I should think, these were his wishes, the terms used seem natural and apt enough to carry them into effect.\nIt is, I suppose, possible that the construction contended for by the appellants would involve the revocation of the specific bequest to the widow of the household goods and effects, and this can hardly have been the intention of the testator. Even if it were so, this would only be an unfortunate accident due to his want of skill or incapacity at the time, and cannot affect the construction of the provision in the codicil. In my opinion, however, it is not necessary to attribute any such effect to the provision. The testator is dealing only with his residuary estate, money and valuables, all of his property other than goods and chattels which form the subject of the specific bequest to the widow. Except in so far as the appropriation of his residuary estate is concerned, the will is in all other respects expressly confirmed.\nThe case is unlike that of In re Smith, in the Ontario courts[9], affirmed by the Privy Council[10], to which reference is made by Meredith C.J.O. That case was so wholly special and the decision so entirely dependent on the particular circumstances and the terms of the testamentary documents in question that it is of no general value as an authority, which doubtless is the reason that it was not reported in the law reports.\nIf I am correct in the views above set forth it will be seen that the testator secured to his widow his household goods and effects and a sum of $16,000 cash. It, moreover, appears from the will that she already had some property of her own. This seems to have been a very reasonable provision for the testator to make for his widow, a woman of advanced age with no one dependent upon her, considering the amount of his estate and that his three children were all married and they and his grandchildren and their needs were the objects, as they naturally would be, of his careful consideration for their welfare.\nFor these reasons I am of opinion that the appeal should be allowed and the judgment on the trial restored with the variation that the declaration should only be as to the residue of the property of the deceas- ed after giving effect to the specific bequests contained in both the will and codicil.\nIt is a proper case in which the costs of all parties should be paid out of the residuary estate.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The testator, by his last will, made on the 23rd December, 1913, after some specific dispositions, referred to his life insurance as consisting of some payable to his estate, some payable to his wife, some payable to his wife and children, and declared it to be his wish that the conditions of payments in all policies of insurance on his life should be carried out.\nThen he directed the residue of his estate, real and personal, to be divided into two equal parts of which one was given the wife absolutely and the other to his executors and executrix upon trusts which he declared at some length.\nThe income of the trust was to be paid the wife during her life and at her death the principal to be divided equally between his son and three daughters.\nHe provided for the children of his son and each of his daughters taking the parent\u2019s share in case of death and even anticipated the possibility of grandchildren\u2019s rights in case of any of his children dying leaving such.\nHe further provided against loans to wife or child being enforced as he declared them cancelled.\nThe son died suddenly under painful circumstances within a week after the testator had made his will.\nThe son left life insurance amounting to $11,000, which came by his will in equal shares to the testator and his wife.\nThe only other apparent alteration in the circumstances of the testator created by the death of the son arose from the fact that the son had been named an executor of the will.\nThe testator, on the 3rd February, 1914, made a codicil to his will, by which it is made clear to my mind that for some reason or other he had conceived another plan or scheme for the disposition of the greater part of his estate.\nThe death of his last son evidently was to him a disturbing factor of more far-reaching consequences than involved in the possible need, suggested by acquisitions derived from the son\u2019s bequests of his life insurance, for a slight readjustment of amounts he, as testator, had bequeathed. That could easily have been provided for by a few words clearly expressing such purpose, instead of the complex plan the codicil presents, which suggests much that is entirely overlooked in the elaborate computation in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice of Ontario, the correctness of which was challenged in argument.\nDid the father not feel that, with the last son gone, there was some reason to fear the happening of that which has in fact taken place, by the mother preferring two out of three daughters?\nHad he been possessed of unbounded confidence that an equal distribution would ultimately prevail, there would certainly have been little use in his making a codicil.\nThis codicil was made when the testator was very ill and suffering much on his death-bed, and he died ten days later.\nInasmuch as we do not know more than is presented, which does not even tell us all that was involved in the original distribution of insurance, I lay no great stress upon the facts just referred to but merely allude thereto by way of pointing out that the results of the construction put upon said codicil by Mr. Justice Masten, as contrasted with what the wife might have got had there been no change in circumstances, may have been, as I respectfully submit, pressed too far by the judgment appealed from. It may be that the statements in affidavits filed as to what the wife would have got under the distribution which each of the policies of insurance provided, furnishes a possible key to the whole; but it by no means is necessarily to be implied that it accurately does so, or can disclose all relative to the original schemes of distribution in said several policies of insurance, which we should know if the train of thought, adopted by the use of such a key, is to be accepted as a leading factor in reaching our decision.\nThe codicil deals with the subject matter of the insurance in an entirely different manner from that adopted in the will by giving only one-fourth of the insurance on the testator\u2019s life to the wife.\nThat entire insurance money amounted to $20,000 and he gave the wife all that might have come to her or him under the son\u2019s will.\nThen, after specifying the life insurance on his own life, he proceeds first by repeating that bequest, and comprehensively as follows:\u2014\nOne-quarter of these policies go direct to my wife but all my other property now goes with my last son dead to my three daughters under the terms of my said last will.\nThe neat point to be determined in this case is the effect of this single sentence.\nI think we must have regard to the law requiring the express language used to be given its plain ordinary meaning, and if possible give effect to every word of it.\nThen there is a principle deducible from numerous cases of which Hearle v. Hicks[11], is one usually relied on, which requires the language of a codicil to be clear and manifest before it can be maintained in revocation of a clear and manifest devise or bequest in a will.\nThat principle was involved in the case of In re Stoodley[12], and presumably was what induced Mr. Justice Eve to place the construction he did on the will in question therein. The report does not make clear exactly what he relied upon, but the course of argument and reasoning in the judgments in appeal suggest strongly such was the case.\nUpon appeal therefrom the Court of Appeal reversed his construction and rested the judgment doing so upon the case of Earl of Hardwicke v. Douglas[13].\nThat involved in each of those two cases, as in that at bar, what had been given by a residuary bequest in each of the respective wills.\nThe language used in each codicil in question in the cases cited was, as the conflicting opinions shew, capable of more than one construction, but I venture to think is neither more comprehensive, forcible and expressive of the real intention of the testator, having regard to the circumstances surrounding each of the respective testators, than that I have just quoted from the codicil now before us.\nI therefore conclude, so far as concerns the residuary bequest to the wife, that it was, in my opinion, partially revoked by this codicil, but the will in all other respects stands unrevoked save as to the insurance money of which there is no question.\nI observe such a difference between the expressions of the strong, clear-headed man, writing his will, and the same man writing his codicil, under most painful circumstances, that I cannot help feeling how he would in health and strength have put the possibility of this lawsuit beyond peradventure.\nYet I cannot doubt his intention was that, seeing his last son dead and his wife provided for, as far as she was concerned, there was no contingency to be anticipated but what affection would meet, and that the daughters, so far as he was concerned, should be treated equally.\nSuch would be my reading of this will and codicil apart from authority save the doubt that must ever exist of whether or not he did not suppose that he was giving his wife the income of the entire residue for life.\nThe expression,\nto my three daughters under the terms of my said last will,\nindicates such a restricted intention. Any way one may try there is a difficulty just there, but clearly the predominant purpose was an equal distribution amongst and between his three daughters.\nOut of respect to the court below I have fully considered all the cases cited, but am of the opinion that the three cases I have cited above contain the whole relevant law which should govern us.\nThe appeal should, I think, therefore, be allowed, and the judgment below be modified accordingly, and that the costs of all parties should be paid out of the estate.\nANGLIN J. (dissenting)\u2014Mr. McLaughlin\u2019s very able argument on behalf of the appellants failed to convince me that the judgment appealed from is erroneous. On the contrary, I think it correct and feel that I cannot usefully add anything to the reasons stated by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario in support of it.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs. BRODEUR J.\u2014The question we have to decide in this case is whether by his codicil of the 3rd February, 1914, John Lawrence Spink has revoked the bequest given to his wife by which she was to have one-half of his property.\nBy his will made on the 23rd December, 1913, Mr. Spink devised all his real and personal property into two equal shares and gave one share absolutely to his wife and the other was to be divided among his three daughters and his son, and he declared that his wife and children should receive the amounts set forth in each of his insurance policies.\nThe evidence shews that $9,000 of that insurance money would have gone to his wife, and $11,000 to his children, the testator having his life insured for $20,000.\nA few days after his will was made, his only son died and left an estate of $11,000, half of it going to his father and half to his mother.\nThe testator himself became seriously ill and on the 3rd February, 1914, he made a codicil, and he died a few days later, on the 13th February, 1914. The reason for making the codicil is stated by the testator himself to be owing to the fact of the death of his son. In that codicil he provided that the insurance money, instead of being divided as it was stated on the policies, would go one-fourth to the mother, and three-fourths to the three surviving children, his three daughters. He gave also by the codicil the amount of money which he had received from his son to his wife, and he added that everything that might have come to him or to her under the will of his son would belong to his wife. After having described the policies of insurance and included their numbers, he said:\u2014 One-quarter of these policies go direct to my wife but all my other property now goes with my last son dead, to my three daughters under the terms of my said last will.\nIt is contended by the appellant that the provisions of that codicil revoke the bequest which the testator had made by his will of one-half of his estate to his wife.\nOn the other hand, it is claimed that this provision of the will has not been disturbed by the codicil.\nMr. Justice Masten decided that the contention of the appellant should be sustained, and he even declared that the life estate which had been given to the wife by the will had been revoked.\nI must say here that the appellants do not insist upon the construction of the will as to the life estate.\nThe Appellate Division decided in favour of the respondents that the bequest of the half of the estate was not disturbed by the codicil.\nIt is strongly claimed on the part of the respondents that the sole reason for which this codicil was made was to dispose of the share of the son.\nIf the words:\nall my other property\nwere ambiguous, the construction put by the respondents on the codicil might perhaps be sustained in view of the relations existing between Mr. Spink and his wife. But those words seem to me so clear that I think we should construe them in their ordinary meaning.\nAccording to my opinion, then, he has disposed of all his other property in favour of his three children. As to the income during the life-time of the wife, I consider that, contrary to the view expressed by Mr. Justice Masten, this was one of the terms under which the bequest to his children was given, namely, that the life estate would remain in his wife and as he has said in his codicil that all his other property would go to his daughters under the terms of the will, I consider that the residuary was disposed of on the condition that the life estate would remain in the wife.\nFor these reasons, the judgment a quo should be reversed and the appeal should be maintained with costs to be paid out of the estate and the trial judgment should be restored with the modification that the wife was entitled, during her life-time, to the income of the property of the husband.\nCASSELS J. (dissenting)\u2014After a careful consideration of the able argument of Mr. McLaughlin, and the authorities cited by him, I have arrived at the conclusion that the judgment pronounced by the Appellate Division is correct and should not be disturbed.\nThe Chief Justice of Ontario has fully discussed the questions argued. I agree with his reasons and conclusions.\nIt would be merely repetition to again discuss the facts.\nThe appeal should be dismissed, and I think the appellants should pay the costs of the appeal.\nThe costs of the other proceedings have been allowed out of the residuary estate, but I think the appellants took a further appeal to the Supreme Court at the risk of costs.\nAppeal allowed.\nSolicitors for the appellants: McLaughlin, Johnston, Moorhead & Macaulay.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Watson, Smoke, Smith & Sinclair.\n[1] 41 Ont.

S.C.R. 41,) followed.\nMOTION to quash for want of jurisdiction an appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side,[1] reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, and maintaining the respondents' intervention.\nThe grounds urged on the motion are fully stated in the judgment now reported.\nBelcourt K.C. for the motion.\nThomas Walsh K.C. and Clark contra.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nBrodeur J.\u2014This is a motion to quash for want of jurisdiction. An action had been instituted several years ago by the appellant Pulos, against the defendants Lazanis, for a sum of $1,807.56. Judgment was rendered in 1912 for that sum with interest.\nIn 1916, a writ of saisie-arr\u00eat after judgment was issued in the ordinary way to recover money in the hands of the firm of Sperdakos & Lerikos. The tierssaisis declared in substance that the defendant, Denis Lazanis, was a member of their firm and that they owed him money.\nThe wife of Denis Lazanis then fyled an intervention and claimed that it be declared that the defendant Lazanis, her husband, had no share in the partnership of Sperdakos & Lerikos, but that she herself be declared the sole proprietor of one-third share in that partnership.\nThat intervention was contested by the plaintiff, Pulos. The Superior Court dismissed the intervention but that judgment was reversed on appeal.\nThen the real controversy on that intervention was whether their share in the firm belonged to the defendant or to his wife.\nThe respondent contends that the jurisdiction of this court should be determined by the amount originally claimed on the main action, and relies on Champoux v. Lapierre[2]; Kinghorn v. Larue[3]; and Gendron v. McDougall[4].\nOn the other hand, the appellant claims that the value of the share in dispute should determine our jurisdiction.\nIt is now the well-settled jurisprudence of this court that an intervention is a \"judicial\" proceeding within the meaning of section 46 of the \"Supreme Court Act;\" and where the appeal depends upon the amount in controversy there is an appeal to this court if the amount in controversy upon the intervention amounts to the value of $2,000. King v. Dupuis[5]; C\u00f4t\u00e9 v. Richardson Co.[6].\nThe intervening party, the respondent, stands in the same position as a plaintiff, and her proceeding is to all intents and purposes an action in revendication of her rights in the partnership.\nThe amount of money she claims to have put in the partnership is $2,000. In the Court of Appeal, the so much regretted late Chief Justice (Sir Horace Archambeault) stated in his reasons of judgment that her partners offered her husband $5,500 for her share and that the husband asked for $7,000. The affidavits fyled proved beyond doubt that the value of that share exceeds $2,000.\nIn those circumstances, we have jurisdiction and this motion to quash should be dismissed with costs.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\n[1] 24 R.L.N.S. 482.\n[2] Coutlee's Digest 56.\n[3] 22 Can.

Ryan K.G. contra.\nThe judgment of the majority of the court was pronounced by\nDuff J.\u2014The appeal is from the Court of Review, and consequently the question of jurisdiction is governed by section 40 of \"the Supreme Court Act,\" together with articles 68 and 69 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\nNow, the action was an action brought by eleven persons who allege themselves to be injured by one and the same libel published by the newspaper \"L'Autorit\u00e9.\" It is quite obvious that this action must be treated as a joinder of several causes of action vested in the persons who were plaintiffs. Up to a certain point it is true that the facts constituting the cause of action of each of them are identical. There is, for example, the same publication, but beyond that it is impossible to say that the facts are identical. The facts relating, for example, to the extent of the temporal damages suffered by each of the plaintiffs and consequently the amount of damages recoverable by each of them, may be, and it is said, are different. In addition to that it is alleged and not disputed that separate independent and entirely different defences were set up as regards the different plaintiffs.\nThe action must, therefore, be considered as a joinder of several actions and when we come to apply section 40 the question must be with regard to any one of these plaintiffs, whether or not the amount in dispute as determined by the amount claimed, brings the case within article 68 of the Code of Civil Procedure\u2014 in other words, whether or not the amount is over $5,000. The amount claimed in each of the cases is $2,000. It follows that the appeal should be quashed.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Il s'agit d'une question de juridiction. Les intim\u00e9s, qui sont au nombre de onze, ont poursuivi en dommages l'appelante pour une somme de $22,000; et, par leur d\u00e9claration, ils ont demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce qu'elle soit condamn\u00e9e \u00e0 payer $2,000 \u00e0 chacun d'eux. Le jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 en faveur des demandeurs intim\u00e9s et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9 par la Cour de Revision. La d\u00e9fenderesse appelante porte cette cause maintenant devant nous.\nAvons-nous juridiction? Cette action qui, pour chaque demandeur, repr\u00e9sente une somme de moins de $5,000, quoique la totalit\u00e9 de la somme demand\u00e9e exc\u00e8de ce montant, peut-elle faire l'objet d'un appel devant cette Cour?\nCette question n'est pas nouvelle et a fait le sujet de plusieurs d\u00e9cisions; La derni\u00e8re par ordre de date est celle de Glen Falls Insurance Company v. Adams[1]. Dans cette cause, qui venait d'Ontario, jugement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu contre chacun des d\u00e9fendeurs pour un montant moindre de $1,000, montant pour lequel nous avons juridiction dans les causes de cette province, quoique le montant total de la condamnation exc\u00e9d\u00e2t cette somme. La Cour a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les d\u00e9fendeurs \u00e9taient dans la m\u00eame position que si des actions distinctes avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 prises contre eux; et comme chacun d'eux \u00e9tait condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 payer une somme insuffisante pour nous donner juridiction, l'appel devrait \u00eatre refus\u00e9. La m\u00eame d\u00e9cision, je crois, doit \u00eatre rendue dans le cas o\u00f9 il s'agit de poursuites prises par plusieurs personnes qui demandent une somme particuli\u00e8re pour chacun d'eux.\nIl peut y avoir du doute de savoir si, par une seule et m\u00eame action, plusieurs personnes peuvent poursuivre et r\u00e9clamer des dommages qui pour chacun d'eux peuvent \u00eatre plus ou moins \u00e9l\u00e9v\u00e9s.

Dans le cas o\u00f9 l'un des demandeurs viendrait \u00e0 succomber et que le montant qu'il aurait r\u00e9clam\u00e9 pour lui serait insuffisant pour lui permettre de venir devant cette cour, il ne pourrait interjeter appel ici. Il en serait de m\u00eame pour le d\u00e9fendeur; son droit d'appel sera d\u00e9termin\u00e9 par le montant que chaque demandeur aura exig\u00e9 de lui.\nLe montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9 par chacun des demandeurs \u00e9tait dans le cas actuel moindre de $5,000, vu qu'il s'agit d'un jugement de la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure confirm\u00e9 par la Cour de Revision (arts. 68 & 69 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile, art. 40 Acte de la Cour Supr\u00eame); il en r\u00e9sulte que nous n'avons pas juridiction.

Under the heading of \"warranty,\" the plaintiff warranted\nthe said tractor to be well made of good material and if properly operated will develop its rated brake horse-power.\nIt was also provided that\nthe purchaser shall not be entitled to rely upon any breach of above warranty, unless notice of the defect complained of, whether such defect be in workmanship or material, containing a description of the same and setting out the time at which the same was discovered is given to the vendor * * *\nThe plaintiff claimed the balance of the purchase price of the engine and the defendant fyled a counterclaim. The trial judge gave judgment for the plaintiff on its claim and judgment for the defendant for the amount equivalent to the purchase price for breach of warranty.\nBastedo for the appellant.\nGregory K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This action was one brought by plaintiff to recover the balance of the purchase price of an engine sold by it to defendant under an agreement in writing made between the parties in April, 1913.\nChief Justice Haultain, who tried the case, held, I think, properly, that the defence of misrepresentation had not been proved, but he also found that the engine\nwas sent to the defendant in a very bad shape\nand that\nthe evidence that it practically never did satisfactorily work was overwhelming.\nHe also held that the plaintiff company had waived the conditions in the clauses of the contract requiring notices to be sent to the company with respect to the engine in case it was found defective and did not comply with the warranty given. He found as a result that the evidence as a whole\nestablished the fact that the engine did not comply with the warranty and failed to do work to any reasonable amount,\nand awarded defendant as damages an amount equal to the price agreed to be paid for it and a return to defendant of the $500 paid by him on account of the purchase money.\nAn appeal to the Appeal Court of Saskatchewan was dismissed. Mr. Justice Newlands held that defendant was entitled to recover damages on his counterclaim by virtue of the breach of the warranty that the engine would develop its rated brake horse-power and that the clause in the contract that the purchaser should not be entitled to rely on any breach of the above warranty unless certain notices were given applied only to the warranty that the engine was well made and of good material and not to the warranty that it would develop a stipulated horse-power. Mr. Justice Lamont agreed with Chief Justice Haultain that the plaintiff company had in the letter of defendant of 9th August received and answered by it got the necessary notices called for by the contract and had failed to remedy the defect. In the result the judgment of Chief Justice Haultain was confirmed.\nWith regard to the questions raised by counsel for the plaintiff company that the pleadings did not warrant the judgment appealed from, I am of the opinion that the controversy between the parties alike as to the right of the plaintiff to recover for the price of the engine and the right of the defendant to damages for non-compliance with the warranty as to the development of its rated horse-power was fully thrashed out at the trial between the parties and that under these circumstances any necessary amendments to these pleadings can and should be made even now.\nAs to the meaning of the warranty clause requiring certain notices to be given the company in case of defects in\nworkmanship or material containing a description of the same,\nI agree with Mr. Justice Newlands that the provisions in clause 9 of the contract prohibiting the purchaser from relying upon any breach of warranty therein given unless these notices were given does not apply to the warranty that the engine would develop certain horsepower but only to the warranty that the engine was well made and of good material.\nThe nature and particulars required to be given in these notices convince me that they do not cover the case of any engine failing to develop the warranted horse-power from some cause not known to the purchaser and which he was unable to specify.\nThe construction that if defects of material or workmanship were complained of, notices should be given as the contract required or the defendant precluded from afterwards setting up breach of warranty may be held to be not unreasonable. These defects were capable of being known and the vendors informed of them so that they might have the opportunity of remedying them; not so if there were no apparent defects in workmanship or material, but nevertheless the engine failed to develop the rated horse-power contracted for. To construe the contract as applying to such a case would be unjust and unreasonable.\nHaving reached these conclusions on the construction of the notice clauses of the warranty in question and on the findings of fact of the trial judge of the failure of the engine to develop its rated horse-power, I am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs and that in this court we should not interfere with the amount of damages awarded by the trial judge and confirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014It may be possible in law to so frame a contract that the vendor may be enabled thereby to acquire the right to use the courts to get all he desires from the vendee and retain same yet give him nothing, and at the same time so bind him that he cannot complain aloud or attempt to secure that he bargained for unless and, so far only, as graciously permitted by the vendor; and also forever debar his vendee from acquiring by mutual contract between them any relief or right thereto.\nIt would be well in such attempts for the vendor to steadfastly ignore any and all importunities of the deluded vendee, looking for rectification of the wrong done him, lest by listening thereto a new contract based on conduct may be inferred by some court applied to for the purpose of enforcing the original contract.\nAt all events the vendor framing (as appellant did that in question), such a contract of sale designed to accomplish such a comprehensive purpose, should make its meaning so clear and its purpose so beyond doubt and dispute, that the vendee can have no rights thereunder and that he alone is under any obligation arising therefrom.\nThe contract in question herein falls far short of accomplishing such purpose. Indeed, having given its ambiguous nature much consideration, I am of the opinion that Mr. Justice Newlands' construction thereof is correct. Though the failure of the machine to develop its rated horse-power does fall within the covenant and is thereby expressly provided for, yet a breach of that part does not seem to fit into and fall within the verbal subsidiary provisions which are relied upon by appellant to nullify its operation and should, if read as applicable to such a breach as failure to develop rated brake horse-power, render it an absurdity, unless and until demonstrated that the failure is in fact attributable to defect of material or workmanship. That has not been done. I agree that want of a specific rate of horse-power may exist with first-class material and workmanship. It may have been so designed.\nThe alternative view of the learned Chief Justice who tried the case, that the appellant waived these provisions, is also, I think, tenable, though to my mind more difficult.\nThe finding he makes of the overwhelming character of the evidence relative to the worthlessness of the machine seems well founded.\nThe argument of appellant's counsel that a test of the actual horse-power it was capable of developing, could only be determined by a scientific test, might have been well taken if only a narrow margin of the measure of power had been in question. No such doubtful question can exist on the evidence, and such machines are only of value to a farmer if, by use thereof, he can economise in way of horse or man power he has to employ in ploughing or other operations on the farm.\nWhen representations as to its capacity fall so far short of realising the reasonable expectations of such a purchaser as this one seems to have done, there is not much need for further test.\nThe representations made in the first attempted contract beyond doubt operated as intended on the mind of the respondent as an inducement to purchase the machine in question and he was entitled to rely thereupon, though not in the sense of misrepresentation presented to the mind of the learned trial judge.\nMuch was said in the argument by the counsel for appellant as to the pleadings and the effect thereof, which might have been effective if it had not chosen to fight the case out on the lines on which it was fought and decided.\nThis is one of the many cases in which we should regard what the parties in fact have tried out regardless of the form of pleading.\nIt becomes too late after such a trial, and appeal therefrom, to fall back here upon the form of pleading.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J.\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs. Anglin J.\u2014The material facts of this case sufficiently appear in the judgments of the learned Appellate Judges[2]. The evidence, in my opinion, abundantly warranted the conclusion of the learned Chief Justice who tried the action that the tractor delivered to the defendant did not fulfil the warranty in the contract of sale, that it\nwill develop its rated (60) brake horse-power.\nI agree with Mr. Justice Newlands that the provision for notice in clause 9 does not apply to this warranty but is confined to\ndefects in workmanship and material.\nIt is, in my opinion, likewise the proper construction of clause 11 to restrict its application to \"defects\" within clause 9.\nIt may be that the plaintiff was rightly held not entitled to rescission because of his user of the engine with knowledge of its incapability to develop the rated horse-power. But I find nothing which debars him either on the ground of estoppel or on that of abandonment from setting up the breach of warranty relied upon as the basis of a claim for damages.\nAs to the alleged insufficiency of the pleadings, so much relied upon by counsel for the appellant, I agree with, the view expressed by Mr. Justice Lamont, to which I would merely add that evidence on the issue of breach of warranty was fully gone into at the trial and the observations of the Chief Justice and of counsel during the course of it make it clear that it was well understood that this issue was one with which the court intended to deal. There was no surprise of which the appellant can complain. While it would probably have been better had the pleadings been formally amended at the trial, any amendment necessary to make them fit the issues actually tried and disposed of may be made even now. \"Supreme Court Act,\" section 54.\nHaving found upon evidence warranting that conclusion, that the engine was\nuseless to the defendant\nby reason of its failure to fulfil the warranty as to horse-power, the Chief Justice was justified in assessing the damages for breach of that warranty at the price agreed to be paid. With that assessment, affirmed by the provincial Appellate Court, we should not interfere.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The appellant contends that no issue has been raised as to breach of warranty and that the damages awarded by the trial judge to the respondent as a result of that breach could not be granted.\nThe allegations in the defence and counterclaim are sufficient to support a claim for damages for breach of warranty. This is a question of practice and procedure on which the courts below have passed judgment, and that decision should not be interfered with by this court, whatever the view which we might have taken, had we had to deal originally with it on the merits. I am of opinion that the judgment below is well founded. The facts of this case and the provisions of the contract are much less favourable than those in issue in the case decided this term of Schofield v. Emerson Co.[3].\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Mackenzie, Thom, McMorran, Bastedo & Jackson.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Seaborn, Pope & Gregory.\n[1] 11 Sask.

Chase-Casgrain K.C. for the appellant.\nAtwater K.C. and Jarry K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The substantial question in this appeal is what were the rights of the appellant in the land expropriated and for which it had a claim to be indemnified.\nThe lots in question were within the homologated street lines shewn on a plan prepared by the city and confirmed by the court in 1887 as being included in land required for an extension of Sherbrooke street.\nThe proprietor of land expropriated is entitled to be compensated by payment of the value of the land taken and section 421 of the city charter provides, inter alia:\u2014\nIndemnity, in case of expropriation, shall include the actual value of the immovable, part of immovable or servitude expropriated and the damages resulting from the expropriation; but, when fixing the indemnity to be paid, the commissioners may take into consideration the increased value of the immovables from which is to be detached the portion to be expropriated and offset the same by the inconvenience, loss or damages resulting from the expropriation.\nSection 418, however, provides:\u2014\n418. The city shall not be liable for any indemnity or damages claimed with respect to any building constructed, or improvements, leases or contracts made by any person whatever, upon any land or property, after the confirmation of any plan or map, or of any modification or alteration of, or addition thereto.\nThe question is what is the effect of section 418? Mr. Justice Cross, in his reasons for the judgment appealed from, says:\u2014 The respondent (now appellant) is in error in its pretension that it should have been awarded what would have been the real value of the land in question if it had been marketable land. It is said for the respondent (appellant) that the city is not to be permitted to depreciate land by putting it on a plan and then take the land at the depreciated value made so by its own act. To that it can be said that the city plan is given certain effect by statute. That effect causes depreciation but it is the law.\nI must dissent altogether from this interpretation of section 418.\nIt is a well-recognised canon of construction not to interpret an Act of the legislature in such a way as to take away property without compensation unless such intention is clearly expressed or is to be inferred by plain implication.\nIn the recent case in the English Court of Appeal of the Cannon Brewery Company v. The Central Control Board (Liquor Traffic) reported in the Times of the 17th of May 1918, the Master of the Rolls in his judgment said:\nNo intention could he attributed to Parliament of taking away from individuals their property without paying them for it unless such intention was expressed in clear and unequivocal language.\nSee Gibb.v. The King also[2]\nNow I can see nothing in section 418 to warrant the view that it is intended to have the effect of a partial and indeed almost total confiscation of the property of an owner of land. The intention of the legislature, I think, was this: Where a city improvement is proposed, the carrying out of which may necessarily take some time, parties whose land will need to be expropriated for the purpose are not to be allowed to aggravate the indemnity which they will be entitled to claim by carrying out improvements in the interval.\nThis does not seem to me to involve any intention on the part of the legislature to deprive the landowner of the full value of his land which he is entitled to be paid.\nThe power given to the city is a very exceptional one and one that, no doubt, may easily lead to considerable hardship. Under it, the city can, owing to want of security, practically prevent a landowner making any use of his property for an indefinite time without being under any obligation to take the land at all or to pay any damages occasioned. That is sufficiently unfavourable to the landowner without an unnecessary finding in the statute of an intention to allow the owner even eventually nothing but the value of what would be scarcely more than a bare legal title, of which, indeed, the respondent's expert witness, Beausoleil, says:\u2014\nla valeur n'est que nominale et ne d\u00e9passe pas $1, pour tout le terrain.\nThe second clause in the third paragraph of section 421, that, namely, providing for an offset in consideration of increased value of the immovables from which is to be detached the portion to be expropriated is not, I think, effective here because at the date of the expropriation the appellant had no other lands than those expropriated. It had already disposed of its other immovables which benefited by the increased value. If it had sold them subsequently to the expropriation the increase in their value would have had to be set against the compensation for the land expropriated. At the time of the sale, however, the extension of Sherbrooke street had not been made and might never have been made. No doubt there was a probability that it would be made and the purchasers were willing to accept the possibility, still I do not see how this can affect the legal rights as between the appellant and the respondent. I think that from the record two facts are established: (1) that the value of land in the locality was more than that allowed in the award; and (2) that the majority of the commissioners took into consideration the homologated plan as depreciating the value of the land expropriated.\nThese are substantially the findings of Mr. Justice Cross, who says:\u2014\nIt can be said that the proof establishes that the real value of marketable land in the locality was 60c. per foot. The award is only 25c. per foot. That great disparity is suggestive of the view that the majority of the commissioners subjected themselves to some error not merely of estimate of value but to some error in principle.\nAnd again he says:\u2014\nThe fact is that the majority of the commissioners did take into consideration the effect of the homologated plan and they would have been wrong if they had not done so.\nIt would be difficult to say how the commissioners arrived at their award. They seem to have been agreed at first in saying that they took into account the servitude of the road although later inclining to the contrary opinion. The principles on which they should have proceeded as above indicated are, however, so simple that I think it is clear they were not guided by these. No adequate explanation is forthcoming of the difference between the allowance for these and other lands taken; whilst one of the majority of the commissioners says that if he had taken the servitude into account he would have allowed only 15c. instead of 25c. per foot, A difference of only 10c. between the full value of lands and their value burdened with a servitude which, as the respondent's witnesses say, renders them absolutely valueless is inexplicable.\nI do not wish to be understood as expressing now any opinion upon the amount of the compensation which the appellant is entitled to recover. The amount awarded may for reasons which I have not considered work out as a fair and proper compensation, but if so it has worked out right rather by chance and the appellant is entitled to have a more satisfactory consideration and regular determination of its claim.\nThe appeal should, therefore, in my opinion, be allowed and the matter referred back to the commissioners to establish the actual value of the land expropriated the amount of which is to be awarded as indemnity to the appellant, but in view of the finding below and out of respect for the opinion of the majority here I do not enter a formal dissent.\nDavies J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, Province of Quebec, reversing a judgment of the Superior Court judge which declared certain expropriation proceedings in connection with the plaintiff's property and the award of the majority of the commissioners to be null and void.\nThe Court of King's Bench reversed that decision and dismissed the plaintiff's action and against this judgment the present appeal was taken.\nI agree fully with the Court of King's Bench that the alleged illegalities in the antecedent proceedings of the city and the commissioners cannot be invoked in this case on the grounds stated in the court below. The conduct and action of the present appellants in appointing their commissioners and prosecuting their claim before the Board effectually estopped them after the award was made from attacking it on the ground of these alleged irregularities, anterior to the notice of expropriation.\nThe statute makes the award of the commissioners, in such cases as the present, final and without appeal. In order to give grounds for attacking it, either highly improper conduct on the commissioners' part, or fraud, or the proceeding by the commissioners in making the award upon an improper principle, must be clearly shewn.\nThe latter was the ground relied upon in this case.\nThe Court of King's Bench held that the award attacked should not be interfered with and I think they were right in their conclusions.\nThe owner of land expropriated is undoubtedly entitled to be paid its actual value at the time of its expropriation; but it is the actual value of the land to him subject to any statutory charges upon it, and not the value to the person, corporation or company taking it that is to be awarded.\nThe City of Montreal had, in the year 1887, laid down on a plan the lines of a proposed extension of Sherbrooke street, one of the principal streets of Montreal, which extension ran through the property in question, and had the plan confirmed by a judge of the Superior Court.\nThe law provided that after the homologation of these lines by the confirmation of the plan of the same, the city was freed from liability or damages\nwith respect to any building constructed or improvement, leases \/?\/or contracts made by any person whatever upon any land or property after the confirmation.\nAn amendment, 7 Ed. VII. ch. 63, sec. 30, speaks of portions of vacant lots between homologated lines as being reserved for \"public or municipal purposes.\"\nIn 1908 the Sheppard estate, of which the plaintiff is trustee, made a plan of subdivision of its land in the locality of the locus in question and made its plan to conform to the city plan so far as concerns the site of Sherbrooke street. Afterwards, in 1912, lots on the north-east side were sold to Larivi\u00e8re and Messier by the now appellant and these lots are described in the deed as being bounded by Sherbrooke street.\nWhen the commissioners made their award, upon what principle should they have proceeded? Clearly, in my opinion, they should have awarded the actual value of the land to its owner and in finding that actual value they were bound to take into consideration the fact of the proposed extension of Sherbrooke street and the homologation, and confirmation of the lines of that street through the plaintiff's lands as shewn on the plan of the same. In my judgment, the plaintiff had not a marketable title at the time of the expropriation. Such title as he had was one subject to the effect of the proposed extension of Sherbrooke street and the confirmation of the plans thereof, in other words, subject to a statutory charge. The commissioners were obliged, in my judgment, to consider this in making their award. This statutory charge or \"reservation for municipal purposes,\" or servitude, or whatever name you choose to give it was something which affected the value of the land and diminished its marketable value. It is true it may have raised, probably greatly raised, when adopted by the Sheppard estate in making their plan of the land in 1908, the value of the lands fronting on that proposed street, but with that we have nothing to do. The owners of these adjoining lands, in this instance the plaintiff itself, got the benefit of that increase and no one complains or has a right to complain of that. But when they sold these adjoining lands at 60c. a foot, and then claimed to have allowed them the same price for the lands of the proposed street, the opening of which gave them the increased price they got for the adjoining lands, and contend that this was the principle on which the arbitrators should have acted they are going too far and advancing as a principle something I cannot for a moment accept. They claim properly all the increased price caused by the opening of the street to the adjoining lands and then contended that this increased price was that which should have guided the arbitrators in fixing the compensation for the street itself. As Mr. Justice Cross says:\u2014\nIt is simply resorting to the too common project of land speculators to get paid twice for the same thing.\nTheir title to the lands within the street boundaries was subject to the statutory charge or reservation I have referred to. It was not a marketable title such as that to the lands fronting on the street. It had to be valued as it stood at the time of the expropriation subject to the charge and if that had been done by the arbitrators, I would have held it was rightly done. Mr. Justice Cross holds that the majority of the commissioners did take into consideration the effect of the homologated plan, the Sheppard estate sudivision plan and the description of the Larivi\u00e8re and Messier lots as bounded on the street, which consideration would, of course, tend to decrease the actual value of the street land.\nIf they did, from my point of view they were right, and there is no ground for the contention that they acted upon a wrong principle.\nIf they did not, they omitted doing what they should have done in that respect; but the appellants have no ground of complaint on that score, as the omission would be in their favour.\nI am unable to find that the arbitrators acted upon any wrong principle, and I would, therefore, agreeing, as I do, with the reasons for his judgment given by Mr. Justice Cross and with the conclusions of the Court of King's Bench, dismiss the appeal with costs. Idington J.\u2014I think this appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014I agree with the learned judges of the Court of King's Bench that the award of the expropriation commissioners cannot be successfully attacked upon the grounds of alleged irregularities in the antecedent proceedings preferred by the appellants. Whether the provisions of the charter of the City of Montreal (62 V., ch. 58, and amendments) required or justified the commissioners in fixing the amount of compensation for the land expropriated to make a deduction from its actual value on account of rights or easements in favour of the municipality and the public to which it was subjected by the confirmation, in 1887, of a plan for the extension of Sherbrooke street, and whether they have in fact made such a deduction are, in my opinion, the only debatable questions. Both of them\u2014the one a question of law, the other of fact\u2014require careful consideration.\nThe principle of natural law which underlies Art. 407 of the Civil Code:\u2014\nNo one can be compelled to give up his property, except for public utility and in consideration of a just indemnity previously paid,\nis likewise the foundation of the well-established rule of statutory construction thus stated by Farwell J. in Earl of Lonsdale v. Lowther[3]:\u2014\nIt is a sound rule of construction not to construe an Act of Parliament as interfering with or injuring persons' rights without compensation, unless one is obliged so to construe it: see per Lord Esher in Attorney-General v. Horner[4].\nThe city charter declares that streets and highways indicated and projected upon a plan or map duly confirmed by the Superior Court shall be deemed to be highways (section 411). Although the city is not bound to carry into effect any projected street opening, widening, or extension so confirmed (section 417), the owner is disentitled to indemnity, should the city subsequently expropriate the land, for any buildings or improvements constructed or made upon it subsequently to such confirmation (section 418). \"Nor,\" says section 417:\u2014\nshall the city hereafter be liable for any indemnity or damages whatever by reason merely of the confirmation of such plan or any alteration or modification thereof or addition thereto.\nThe only offset to the very serious interference with and deprivation of his rights thus authorised is that the property owner has by recent legislation (section 419 (a), enacted by 7 Ed. VII., ch. 63, sec. 30) been relieved from liability for taxes, but only if the expropriated land be vacant, and that he may make such use of his land as is practicable without building upon or otherwise improving it except at the risk of losing his expenditure and subject to the rights of the public in it as a highway. It is obvious that so burdened the interest of the owner in the land would be of little, if any, value and that if his indemnity on its ultimate exporpriation should be confined to the value of an interest so depreciated he will, in effect, have been deprived of his property without compensation. That such a result was intended by the legislature is most improbable.\nThe interval between the homologation of a plan shewing a projected highway or highway extension, and the expropriation of the land required for it, may be prolonged for many years. During that period the owner undoubtedly must submit to the hardship of the burden placed upon him by the statute as the result of confirmation of the plan without compensation because the legislature has expressly negatived his right to\nany indemnity or damages whatever by reason merely (simplement) of the confirmation of the plan.\nBut the opening, widening or extension of a street cannot be actually made without expropriation under the provisions of the charter (section 419), and when that takes place the case is no longer one merely (simplement) of confirmation of a plan. The land itself must then be acquired and the statute says that the owner's indemnity\nshall include the actual value (la valeur r\u00e9elle) of the immovable, part of immovable or servitude expropriated and the damages resulting from the expropriation (s. 421).\nApplying to the two provisions which I have quoted from sections 417 and 421 the rule of interpretation above indicated and harmonizing their construction as far as their language permits with art. 407 of the Civil Code, I think section 417 should be read as suspending the right of the owner to compensation for the loss, temporary or permanent, of the rights of which he is deprived on confirmation of the plan. The loss may be temporary only, because the city is not bound to proceed with the projected opening, etc.; it may, by altering or modifying the homologated plan with the sanction of the court (section 415), abandon the project without incurring liability for indemnity (section 417). The loss may be permanent if the city proceeds with the project, necessitating the expropriation of the land. Thereupon, as already stated, the case ceases to be merely one of confirmation of the plan of a projected improvement and the owner becomes entitled to indemnity not by reason of such confirmation, but because his land is taken from him and the statute says that his indemnity shall include its actual value. The suspension under section 417 is then terminated. That confirmation of the plan should produce only a suspension of the owner's claim for indemnity in the event of ultimate expropriation seems very clearly to be the purpose of the word \"merely\" (simplement) in section 417, and\u2014I say it with all becoming respect\u2014I cannot but believe that the significance of this word has escaped the attention of those who have taken the contrary view.\nI am, therefore, of the opinion that the commissioners in fixing the owner's compensation were not entitled to make any deduction from the actual value of the land taken in respect of the burden imposed upon it by the confirmation of the plan in 1887\u2014that it was the actual value of the land for which they were to award compensation and not merely the value of the owner's interest therein subject to the rights of the municipality and the public acquired under the homologation.\nNeither can I subscribe to the contention that by selling adjacent lands as fronting on Sherbrooke street, then a projected highway, and under the statute to \"be deemed to be a public highway,\" the owner necessarily subjected the part of his property afterwards expropriated for that street to a servitude in favour of the purchasers and their assigns in respect of which the commissioners were required or entitled to make a deduction from its actual value in ascertaining the amount of the indemnity payable to the owner on expropriation.\nDid the commissioners in fact make any such deduction? Mr. Justice Cross says:\u2014\nThe fact is that the majority of the commissioners did take into consideration the effect of the \"homologated\" plan, the making of the Sheppard estate subdivision plan and the description of the Larivi\u00e8re and Messier lots as being bounded by Sherbrooke street; and they would have been wrong if they had not done so.\nHe reaches this conclusion apparently because of what he regards as the otherwise unexplained and inexplicable disparity between the 25c. a square foot allowed to the appellants as compensation and the 60c. a square foot which he says the proof establishes was the real value of marketable land in the locality.\nOn the other hand, the late Chief Justice of the Court of King's Bench (Sir Horace Archambeault) and Mr. Justice Carroll accepted the testimony given by each of the three commissioners who constituted the majority of the board that they had made no deduction on account of what they term \"the servitude\"[5]. Recorder Geoffrion, Chairman of the Board, deposed that in taking this course the majority of the commissioners acted on the opinion of a judge of the Superior Court obtained and communicated to them by him; and the two other commisssioners confirmed this statement. Mr. Justice Trenholme, the remaining member of the court, delivered no written opinion, but the formal judgment would seem to indicate that on this point he agreed with the learned Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Carroll rather than with Mr. Justice Cross. It is erroneously stated in the official report that Mr. Justice Pelletier sat as a member of the court.\nAfter careful consideration of the entire record, notwithstanding some discrepancies, and the obviously fidgetty scrupulosity of Recorder Geoffrion, I have not found sufficient reason for disbelieving the commissioners' testimony or doubting its accuracy, corroborated as it is by that of Mr. Senecal, the secretary of the board. Still less am I prepared to hold that upon this question of fact the Court of King's Bench clearly erred in its appreciation of the evidence. The mere disparity referred to by Mr. Justice Cross does not warrant such a conclusion. Moreover, I am not satisfied that the actual value of lands in the locality,\nexcluding any advantage due to the carrying out of the scheme for which the property (was) compulsorily acquired, (Fraser v. Fraserville)[6],\nwas 60c. a square foot. Mr. Findlay valued the land in question at 40c. a square foot free from all servitudes and 20c. subject to the servitudes discussed, and there is no evidence how much less than the figures put upon it by the several expert witnesses it would be worth if the extension of Sherbrooke street were merely a possibility and not a realized possibility. Cedars Rapids Manufacturing Co. v. Lacoste[7]. So far as appears none of the witnesses who deposed to values ranging from 40c. to 75c. a square foot were examined on this footing. One of them, Mr. Beausoleil, said that, subject to the \"servitude,\" he would value the whole lot at $1. Moreover, other properties in the locality, some of them not shewn to have been so wholly different from that of the appellants as to preclude comparison, were valued by the commissioners at the same figure, 25c. a square foot, and there are the circumstances that the property in question had been the location of a city dump, was very low, and was comparatively close to abattoirs, which the commissioners regarded as having a tendency to depreciate its value.\nThere is no appeal from an award such as this. The statute expressly excludes it (section 429)\u2014(4 Ed. VII., ch. 49, section 18). Without entertaining an appeal an award may not be set aside solely because the court is of opinion that it is too high or too low\u2014 even very considerably so\u2014unless the disparity be so great that it is clear that the award must have been fraudulently made or that the arbitrators must have been influenced by improper or illegal considerations. The Court of King's Bench has held that neither of these grounds of invalidity has been established, and the clear case necessary to justify a reversal of its judgment, in my opinion, has not been made out.\nI would merely add that if I thought it necessary to pass in detail upon the considerations that should affect the commissioners in arriving at the amount of the indemnity to which an expropriated owner is entitled under section 421 of the Montreal city charter, I am not at all certain that where, at the time of the homologation of the plan shewing the projected improvement, he owns adjacent lands, from which the expropriated property is thereby detached, and parts with those lands in the interval before expropriation, he should not, for the purposes of the off-set of increased value of such adjacent lands provided for by that section, be in the same position as if he still held them. Why should the amount which the city has to pay for the expropriated land be increased because the owner has parted with his adjacent property since the homologation of the plan of the projected work? It would seem to be contrary to the purpose of the statute providing for homologation and its consequences with the apparent object of preventing changes in the condition of the property affected which would increase the burden of the expropriating municipality that it should. But on this aspect of the case it is not necessary now to express a definite opinion. Solely on the ground that the evidence does not clearly establish that the award of 25c. a square foot was such a gross undervaluation of the appellants' property as would warrant a finding that the commissioners in making it must have been influenced by improper considerations, and a fortiori, that it has not been so plainly demonstrated that the Court of Bang's Bench erred in reaching that conclusion that a reversal of its judgment would be justified (Demers v. Montreal Steam Laundry Co.[8], I would dismiss this appeal.\nBrodeur J.\u2014La principale question qui se pr\u00e9sente dans cette cause est de savoir si les commissaires en expropriation en fixant le montant de l'indemnit\u00e9 se sont bas\u00e9s sur un principe erron\u00e9.\nLa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 expropri\u00e9e faisait partie autrefois d'un lot vacant; et en 1887 la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al en vertu de sa charte a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de prolonger la rue Sherbrooke \u00e0 travers ce lot. Elle a indiqu\u00e9 cette prolongation sur la plan officiel et l'a fait confirmer par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure. Par ces proc\u00e9dures la rue projet\u00e9e est devenue voie publique (art. 411 de la charte).\nUne autre disposition de la charte d\u00e9clare cependant que la cit\u00e9 n'est pas tenue, \u00e0 raison de la confirmation du plan, d'ouvrir la rue; et elle n'est pas tenue non plus de payer une indemnit\u00e9 ou des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 raison de la confirmation de ce plan (art. 417).\nCette disposition est certainement contraire aux principes ordinaires du droit. En effet, le Code Civil, art. 407, d\u00e9clare que nul ne peut \u00eatre contraint de c\u00e9der sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9 qu'en \u00e9tant pay\u00e9 au pr\u00e9alable d'une juste indemnit\u00e9. Or, voici un propri\u00e9taire dans la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al qui voit tracer une rue sur son terrain. Il ne pourra plus le vendre sans d\u00e9noncer l'alignement dont il est frapp\u00e9 (M\u00e9nard v. Rambeau[9]; Sirey 1871-1-48). Il ne pourra pas, non plus, exiger d'indemnit\u00e9 ou des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour les b\u00e2timents qu'il y construira.\nLa cit\u00e9 cependant ne pourra pas exiger de taxe pour le terrain couvert par cette ligne homologu\u00e9e (art. 419a de la charte). Le propri\u00e9taire, du moment qu'une ligne est trac\u00e9e comme cela, demeure bien le propri\u00e9taire du terrain qui sert d'assiette de la rue; mais il ne peut plus y faire de construction, \u00e0 moins de s'exposer \u00e0 les enlever sans compensation quand l'indemnit\u00e9 sera fix\u00e9e pour le terrain lui-m\u00eame. Son droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 se trouve donc gravement restreint; et, de plus, ce terrain devient une voie publique, ainsi que le d\u00e9clare l'article 411 de la charte.\nIl est bien vrai que ce propri\u00e9taire a la perspective de voir une rue traverser sa propri\u00e9t\u00e9; et alors, \u00e0 raison de cela, les lots que bordent la rue projet\u00e9e augmentent en valeur et l'indemnisent. C'est probablement cette plus-value qui a induit la l\u00e9gislature \u00e0 adopter cette l\u00e9gislation apparemment contraire au principe qui veut qu'il n'y ait pas d'expropriation sans indemnit\u00e9.\nMais, d'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, si la cit\u00e9 jugeait \u00e0 propos de ne pas donner suite \u00e0 son projet d'ouvrir une rue \u00e0 l'endroit en question, cela pourrait cr\u00e9er de graves injustices. Mais c'est l\u00e0 une question pour le l\u00e9gislateur et non pour les tribunaux.\nDans le cas actuel, la rue fut trac\u00e9e sur le plan en 1887, comme je l'ai dit plus haut; et ce n'est qu'en 1913 que la cit\u00e9 a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'acqu\u00e9rir la rue et de faire fixer l'indemnit\u00e9 qui devait \u00eatre pay\u00e9e au propri\u00e9taire.\nLes commissaires en expropriation ont proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 entendre les parties et leurs t\u00e9moins et la majorit\u00e9 a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'accorder 25 cents du pied au propri\u00e9taire. Ce dernier n'est pas satisfait de cette d\u00e9cision et demande qu'elle soit annul\u00e9e et mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9.\nLa principale question soulev\u00e9e est de savoir si les commissaires devaient accorder pour cette rue la m\u00eame valeur que pour les lots riverains. Il est en preuve que ces lots riverains se vendaient environ 60 cents du pied. Alors l'appellante pr\u00e9tend qu'elle devrait avoir pour la rue le m\u00eame prix.\nIl est incontestable que du moment qu'une ligne est trac\u00e9e \u00e0 travers un lot vacant pour une rue que le droit du propri\u00e9taire est n\u00e9cessairement restreint. Une servitude de droit de passage y est cr\u00e9\u00e9e, puisque par l'article 411 de la charte la rue trac\u00e9e sur le plan devient une voie publique. Il demeure bien le propri\u00e9taire du fonds. Mais son droit n'est pas absolu, comme il l'\u00e9tait. Alors, que nous consid\u00e9rions cette charge comme une servitude ou comme une restriction du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9, il n'en reste pas moins que ce terrain n'avait pas, lorsque les commissaires ont d\u00e9termin\u00e9 l'indemnit\u00e9, la m\u00eame valeur que les terrains riverains sur lesquels il n'existe aucune telle charge. Les commissaires \u00e9taient donc tenus, suivant moi, de prendre en consid\u00e9ration cette charge et ce droit de passage.\nIl y a un certain doute dans la preuve de savoir s'ils l'ont prise en consid\u00e9ration ou non. Cependant, si nous prenons le montant qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l'indemnitaire, 25 cents du pied, et la valeur, qui para\u00eet admise, des terrains riverains, 60 cents du pied, il me para\u00eet \u00e9vident qu'ils ont d\u00fb prendre en consid\u00e9ration, comme c'\u00e9tait leur devoir, l'existence de cette servitude.\nJe concours, par cons\u00e9quent, dans l'opinion exprim\u00e9e \u00e0 ce sujet par le juge Cross. Car si j'\u00e9tais certain qu'ils n'auraient pas tenu compte de cette servitude, je serais alors d'opinion que la sentence arbitrale devrait \u00eatre nulle, et que la cause devrait \u00eate\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9r devant les arbitres pour qu'on y proc\u00e8de de nouveau. Mais alors ces nouvelles proc\u00e9dures seraient probablement au d\u00e9triment de l'appelante, vu que la sentence arbitrale accorderait peut-\u00eatre une somme moindre que celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e.\nL'appelante pr\u00e9tend, en outre, que la sentence arbitrale devrait \u00eatre mise de c\u00f4t\u00e9 parce que certaines proc\u00e9dures initiales ne sont pas tout \u00e0 fait r\u00e9guli\u00e8res. Elle all\u00e8gue, par exemple, que le rapport pr\u00e9alable qui devait \u00eatre fait par le contr\u00f4leur avant que le conseil municipal d\u00e9cide de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 faire fixer l'indemnit\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9gulier et que la r\u00e9solution du conseil lui-m\u00eame n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par la majorit\u00e9 des membres du conseil, tel que voulu par la loi.\nIl me semble que cette pr\u00e9tendue informalit\u00e9 aurait due \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e ab initio. D'ailleurs, il est \u00e0 pr\u00e9sumer que l'appelante avait tout int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 ce que l'indemnit\u00e9 soit fix\u00e9e; car elle avait sur les bras un terrain qui ne lui rapportait rien et, par cons\u00e9quent, elle devait \u00eatre anxieuse que la compensation en fut d\u00e9termin\u00e9e le plus t\u00f4t possible. Il est trop tard pour elle, maintenant que la sentence arbitrale est rendue, de se plaindre de proc\u00e9dures auxquelles elle a acquiesc\u00e9 en proc\u00e9dant elle-m\u00eame et en acceptant leur juridiction.\nSi la r\u00e9solution du conseil \u00e9tait ill\u00e9gale, rien ne lui \u00e9tait plus facile alors que de prendre les proc\u00e9dures n\u00e9cessaires pour la faire mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9. Mais non: je suis convaincu que l'appelante devait voir avec satisfaction que la cit\u00e9, apr\u00e8s plusieurs ann\u00e9es d'attente, allait la payer pour son terrain; et il est trop tard aujourd'hui pour se plaindre de cela.\nPour ces raisons, l'appel doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens et le dispositif du jugement de la cour d'appel doit \u00eate\u00e9 confirm\u00e9.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Casgrain, Mitchell, McDougall & Creelman.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Laurendeau, Archambault, Damphousse, Jarry, Butler & St Pierre.\n[1] Q.R. 26 K.B. 557.\n[2] [1918] A.C. 915, 42 D.L.R. 336; 52 Can.

The annuity was paid, in cash and promissory notes, for four years when the uncle gave F. a note for $1,000, payable five years after date with interest and asked her to consider it \u201cfor the present\u201d a settlement of all claims. F. was with her uncle in his last illness when he told her that he had left her $2,000 by his will, but a few days before his death he revoked a will containing a bequest to her and made another in which she was not mentioned. Shortly after his death A., who inherited all his estate, was informed by F. of her claim and the promises, verbal and written, on which it was based and some months later he wrote offering to pay her $3,000 as a settlement in full. F. accepted the offer but it was afterwards repudiated by A.\nHeld, Anglin J. dissenting, that F\u2019s forbearance to press her claim against the estate was a good consideration for the agreement by A. to pay her $3,000.\nHeld, per Davies and Brodeur JJ. and Falconbridge C.J., Idington J. expressing no opinion and Anglin J. contra, that the relinquishment by F. of the project of taking lodgers was a valid consideration for the agreement by her uncle to provide her with a life annuity and she was entitled to recover from his estate the $2,000 promised by her uncle to be given her in his will and the amount due on his notes which she held.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (43 Ont. L.R. 479) reversed. APPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1] reversing the judgment at the trial in favour of the appellant.\nThe action was brought against the respondent, Norman M. Allan, personally to recover the sum of $3,000 which he had agreed to pay appellant in settlement of a claim made against the estate of Henry W. Allan, and also against the executors of that estate for the amount of said claim. The questions raised for adjudication are stated in the above head-note.\nLamport for the appellant.\nR.S. Robertson for the respondents.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I am of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored as to the amount adjudged by him as due the plaintiff, but that it should be entered against the defendants, Allan and Smith, as executors of the last will and testament of the late Henry W. Allan and not as against Norman M. Allan in his personal capacity only.\nIn one respect I differ from the trial judge, who held that the original understanding or agreement between the plaintiff, appellant, and the late Henry W. Allan, her uncle, that if she would abandon her project or intention of making a living for herself and her mother by opening and keeping a boarding-house, he would allow her a certain sum of money for her own and her mother\u2019s support\nfell far short of amounting to an agreement legally enforceable by plaintiff.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s mother was a sister of the late Henry W. Allan, and in my judgment his arrangement with his sister\u2019s daughter, the plaintiff, that if she would abandon her boarding\u2011house project and devote herself to looking after and keeping her mother he would provide for her as long as she lived and would pay her $50 every four months during her and his lifetime, and would make provision out of his estate to produce the same income during her lifetime, was an agreement enforceable in law.\nMy brother Idington does not make any specific finding upon this point. In all other respects than these I have mentioned I concur in the reasons he has stated for allowing the appeal.\nThe judgment of the court will be, therefore, to allow the appeal; to restore the judgment in amount of the trial judge and to award it as against the defendants as executors and not as against Allan personally.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014Once more there is raised herein the oft mooted question of what may be interpreted such a forbearance on the part of one claiming it to have been given and duly accepted as a consideration for a contract, such as to satisfy the peculiar requirement of our English law.\nThe learned trial judge held that the appellant had adduced sufficient evidence from which it might fairly be inferred that she had agreed to forbear and that her cousin, the respondent Norman M. Allan, after long and serious consideration of the facts which she had submitted to him in response to his request therefor, had decided to accede to her demands, in part, and promised her accordingly that he or the representative of the ample estate he enjoys as recipient of the testator\u2019s bounty, should and would pay three thousand dollars to cover all her claims.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario held the learned trial judge had erred and reversed his judgment.\nIn doing so it laid stress upon the moderate and conciliatory language used by appellant in presenting her claims and pressing them upon the attention of respondent Norman M. Allan, and her equally inoffensive use of the word \u201callow\u201d in accepting his solemn undertaking to pay what she now claims herein as of right.\nIt is not necessary in order to establish that one presenting a possibly legal claim, and who actually believed in ultimate success in a court of law as possible, should assert it in offensive language, or even expressly intimate that unless acceded to an action at law would be taken. Nor for the purpose of making the forbearance from such a mode of asserting a claim a valuable consideration, is it absolutely necessary to have everything believed by either party actually expressed in words.\nIt is, I admit, the plain obvious inference which he, resisting and then yielding, may have drawn from the presentation to him in regard to any honest, or probably honest, belief on the part of him pressing his right of claim thereto, which may become a cause of litigation, and the likelihood of such party being driven to try conclusions at law, that may constitute a perfectly good and valuable consideration for his so yielding and a basis for such obligation, as he, drawing such inference, may have entered into.\nLong ago, in the common law courts, there prevailed an impression that unless proceedings had been taken there could not be said to have been a compromise in that forbearance which constitutes the valuable consideration.\nTherefore in Cook v. Wright[2], this view seems to have been put an end to by the court holding that the mere threat of legal proceedings, though in law and in fact there was no valid claim, was sufficient and therefore a promissory note given as result held good.\nIndeed it is hard to conceive how any one could have supposed in that case that there was any claim in law, yet the recognition of it and the lapse of time secured thereby to the party who was liable in law, and that to the possible detriment of the party accepting the note, it was held that it must be taken there was valuable consideration.\nThat case was followed by the case of Callisher v. Bischoffsheim[3], decided upon the pleadings when Cockburn C.J. made some remarks as did also his colleague Blackburn J. which would go far to support the appellant herein.\nThese utterances, of Cockburn C.J. especially, were criticised in the later case of Ex parte Banner[4], by Brett L.J., who seems to doubt the authority of that Callisher Case3.\nThat in turn evoked, in the case of Miles v. New Zealand Alford Estate Co.[5], the opinions of the members of a strong appellate court in approval of what had been said and was so criticized.\nIt is quite evident that the vews expressed thus, strongly approved of the views expressed in the Callisher Case3.\nAnd of these views one was the expression of Blackburn J.\nthat the real consideration depends upon the reality of the claim made and the bona fides of the compromise\nwhich he quoted from his own judgment on behalf of the court in Cook v. Wright[6].\nIt is only as giving something shewing the growth of the law as it were, that the Miles Case[7] is of any value herein, for the decision turns upon the finding by a majority that there had not in fact been a compromise though Bowen L.J. dissented.\nThis opinion contains the following passage worth quoting for its definition of the requirements of the law:\u2014\nIt seems to me that if an intending litigant bon\u00e2 fide forbears a right to litigate a question of law or fact which it is not vexatious or frivolous to litigate, he does give up something of value. It is a mistake to suppose it is not an advantage, which a suitor is capable of appreciating, to be able to litigate his claim, even if he turns out to be wrong. It seems to me it is equally a mistake to suppose that it is not sometimes a disadvantage to a man to have to defend an action even if in the end he succeeds in his defence; and I think, therefore, that the reality of the claim which is given up must be measured, not by the state of the law as it is ultimately discovered to be, but by the state of the knowledge of the person who at the time has to judge and make the concession.\nNow let us see what the appellant claimed from respondent, Norman M. Allan.\nThe testator was her uncle, a brother of her mother, and had been very kind to both.\nHe went so far as to dissuade the appellant from taking boarders or roomers and to avert it promised them what was equivalent to an annuity for life which he varied later. He, however, on 1st October, 1912, after continuing the payments, so varied, for some four years, made a promissory note for $1,000 payable to appellant five years after date, with interest at six per cent. to be paid half-yearly on the 1st of April and 1st October, which he enclosed in a letter to her.\nIn that letter he explained that his state of health was such that he could not stand additional worry, complained of his sons being a burden instead of assistance and then proceeded as follows:\u2014\nI am writing you in this way in order that you may see that I am compelled to make some temporary settlement at least that will help to relieve my mind of the claims that I feel from past promises you have on me. I am sending you a note for $1,000 upon which I will pay you the interest at six per cent, half yearly for five years. I will pay you the interest on the notes you have and this for the present you will kindly regard as a settlement of all claims.\nNow Helen, if things brighten up, I will do the best I can. In the meantime this note for $1,000 outright is absolutely good and as I do not intend to risk what I have it is just as safe as any security you could have and in the event of your death this $1,000 you can do what you like with. Should I die before the note is due, I will instruct my executors to pay in one year from the date of my death.\nIt is to be observed that he had made a will just four months previously in which he had bequeathed to her $1,500.\nThat will stood good and unrevoked till six days before his death, which took place in a hospital at Gravenhurst on the 10th of March, 1913, and no mention was made of the appellant in said will, though in most of its features the bequests are chiefly to the same parties as in the earlier will.\nHaving regard to the expression in the quotation I make from the letter enclosing the note that it was \u201cfor the present,\u201d this omission is very singular.\nThe appellant saw him and waited on him at the hospital, next day after this last will was made.\nShe swears her uncle told her, after his voluntarily going over the subject of what notes he had given her, that he had made a new will and had left her in that $2,000 and that she would have altogether something over $3,000 from him.\nShe describes him as a man of unimpeachable character whose word was always as good as his bond, and consequently she felt much surprised when she learned, after his death, that she was not even named in the will which seems to have been drawn in a hurried sort of emergency at the request of a doctor in charge of deceased, made to another patient, a barrister by profession, in the same hospital after 10 o\u2019clock at night. The barrister in question was a stranger to the testator and when so called asked if the matter could not stand until morning, but was told not. The will, as finally drawn, was executed between two and three o\u2019clock next morning.\nSome mistake, or mistakes, in first draft resulted in its being rewritten.\nThe friends had been phoned to, and as a result of the call appellant hastened to the dying man\u2019s aid. She found him apparently able to talk but so weak that he failed to sign cheques, which she had written out for him at his request to pay some accounts he mentioned.\nAll this led to a correspondence with the respondent, Norman M. Allan, which is in the case and constitutes all there is to inform us of the claims made, the nature thereof, and the resultant undertaking to pay appellant three thousand dollars, and her acceptance thereof with thanks. It is to be observed that this was not done in a hurry, but after months of due consideration of a long statement by appellant of what claims she had, based on correspondence she had had with deceased, of which full extracts were enclosed and her statement of what he had told her, relative to the bequest of $2,000 in his will, that he wrote the letter from Glasgow on the 24th November, 1913, in which he says he had read over very carefully her\nletters and copies of extracts from father\u2019s letters\nand intimates his father had given him when at home to understand that he intended to give about $1,500 in all and yet he can very easily conceive that he probably increased this in his mind before his death, and he ends that part of the letter by saying\nTherefore you can take it as settled and I undertake that you shall receive $3,000 inclusive of the promissory notes he gave you. I should attach much more importance to the words \u201csettled\u201d and \u201cundertake,\u201d and hold them as much more significant of what was present to the mind of respondent in writing thus than it is possible to find in her expression \u201callow.\u201d\nIt is not, however, on such like criticism and analysis of the language used that I should care to rely, but upon the broad features of the case as presented.\nDid the case which her brief laid before him present to his mind the possibility of litigation ensuing unless he made some settlement; and hence was it to avert such result, no matter how confident he might be of winning out, that he signed the undertaking? If so, then he is bound. And can there be a doubt that he was solely moved by such considerations.?\nTo assume in face of such a retraction of such promise, fourteen months later, that he had been only moved by moral considerations, seems to me quite absurd.\nThe possessor of such an ample estate, so easily acquired making such a retraction, and inflicting thereby such a blow of disappointment upon his cousin, who had doubtless for fourteen long months assumed that all her troubles had been so happily ended, was not the man to be moved by any moral or sentimental notions.\nI, therefore, have no doubt as to his attitude of mind as having relation only to, and being governed solely by, the possibilities of litigation ensuing unless he settled.\nIf proof were needed of this the fact that the $1,000 note his father gave and coupled its giving with an assurance that his executors would be instructed to pay it within one year after his death, yet remains unpaid, supplies ample proof. The fact that this assurance, forgotten in the making of the will, was brought to the respondent\u2019s mind is clear from his own letter, yet he has not been moved to regard that engagement of his father.\nAnd the omission of all reference thereto in the will doubtless furnished another disturbing proof to him that such a will might not be quite unimpeachable under the distressing circumstances in which it was made.\nConvinced as I am by these considerations that respondent was moved solely by one purpose, and that to avert litigation, I ask myself whether he who knew appellant intimately and acted solely on the chances of her entering upon litigation, if he refused to yield, was not more likely to be right in his judgment in that regard than any judge can be when depending only on the written record and rejecting all inferences to be drawn therefrom or other palpable facts.\nI have no difficulty in concluding that appellant had present to her mind her own belief in the law being likely to furnish a remedy for what she evidently thought had been a grave mistake in the framing of the will.\nThe question of whether or not in fact she could have succeeded is immaterial for our present purpose. But after the lapse of two years her difficulties would be much greater and hence his boldness and courage correspondingly enhanced.\nAny one of long experience at the bar knows well that cases much more hopeless of success than what she presents, as her basis of possible action in regard to this will and the state of mind of the testator, are often tried.\nAgain, the fact that proposed litigation was in fact not mentioned in the correspondence goes for little if we accept the fact that it discloses no intention to bring this action, yet we have it.\nThe following cases where expected forbearance was the only consideration, and yet not a word of threat or otherwise used relative to proposed litigation, unless a solicitor\u2019s conducting the business in one instance or other people\u2019s litigation be so taken, are instructive in this connection.\nSee Alliance Bank v. Broom[8]; Wilby v. Elgee[9]; Ockford v. Barelli[10]; Oldershaw v. King[11]; Attwood v.[12]; Lucy\u2019s Case[13].\nFor these and other considerations presented in the judgment of the learned trial judge I conclude he was right and this appeal should be allowed with costs and his judgment restored.\nANGLIN J. (dissenting)\u2014I would dismiss this appeal for the reasons given by the learned Chief Justice of Ontario.\nTo whatever sympathy the plaintiff may be entitled and whatever should be thought, if regarded from an ethical point of view, of the conduct of the defendant, Norman M. Allan, in repudiating his promise to her, I cannot find that that promise had either been made or accepted as the compromise of a claim preferred by her as enforceable at law. On the contrary, the sole consideration for it was of a moral character\u2014Norman Allan\u2019s belief that his father may have entertained intentions in favour of the plaintiff unfortunately for her not expressed in a form legally binding. There is nothing to shew that either the plaintiff or Norman Allan ever thought that she had, or could have, a legal claim against the late H.W. Allan\u2019s estate. I agree with the learned trial judge and the Appellate Division that, apart from Norman Allan\u2019s promise, the plaintiff had no enforceable claim against his father\u2019s estate.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014Mr. Henry W. Allan was a man of means, having left an estate of nearly $100,000. He had a sister, Mrs. Francis, who was not in very comfortable circumstances and as she was rather advanced in years she was looked after by her daughter, Miss Helen Francis, the appellant in this case. Mr. Allan was very kind to them and contributed with some other relations to their support.\nAt one time, however, Mrs. and Miss Francis contemplated keeping roomers and so informed Mr. H.W. Allan, since, on the 7th January, 1909, he wrote to his niece, the appellant, that his sister, Mrs. Francis, had worked hard enough all her life without taking lodgers and he was sure satisfactory arrangements would be made for the mother and the daughter. He entered into an arrangement with the appellant whereby he promised to provide a sum of $200 a year during her lifetime and to make provision out of his estate to produce the same income.\nThe relations of those three persons were of the best, and it is no wonder that Mr. Allan, who was occupying a high social standing and had been in public life, would have prevented his sister from taking roomers and would have provided for her and her daughter. He had no daughters himself and was not having, perhaps, from his sons all the consolations which his old age might expect. When he died he would have been alone if the appellant, his niece, had not been at his bedside; his son, the respondent, had left the country and was in Scotland. The payments agreed upon were duly made from 1909 to 1912, when Mr. H.W. Allan became rather short of funds and gave two notes of $100 and $50 respectively in payment payable at two years from date but with interest. In May, 1912, he made a will with a legacy of $1,500 to the appellant.\nIn October of the same year, he gave the appellant another note of $1,000 payable in five years also with interest to be paid half yearly.\nA few days before his death he said to his niece that he had left her $2,000 in his will and that sum, with the notes, would give her a little more than $3,000, and she would then get about the same income as he had been providing for her mother and herself during the last four years.\nWhen he was very ill and on the point of death, Mr. Allan made another will and no mention is made therein of his niece, the appellant. He was then so weak that the doctor, who requested Mr. Bruce to draft the will, said it had to be made right away during that night for fear the testator could not see the next day.\nAfter his arrival in Canada the respondent, Norman Allan, who was one of the executors, wrote to his cousin, the appellant, that he understood she had a claim against his father in notes and otherwise, and asked for information.\nShe then told him of the notes she had and the declaration he made to her as to the contents of his will, and she gave him extracts of the letters of Mr. H.W. Allan stating the circumstances under which his obligation had been contracted and the consideration for which he had undertaken to provide for her.\nThe respondent, after several months, answered that in those circumstances he was willing, though no provision was made for her in the will, to pay her $3,000 in satisfaction of her claim. But in January, 1915, he repudiated his obligation and the present action is to recover that amount of $3,000. He says in his plea that there was no consideration for the agreements alleged in the statement of claim, neither on his part nor on the part of his father.\nThe action was maintained against him personally by the trial judge on the ground that the obligation of the respondent was based on a compromise for a settlement of plaintiff\u2019s claims. That judgment was reversed in appeal, but judgment was given against the estate for the two notes then due and for interest.\nI am of opinion that the trial judgment should be restored. There is no doubt that the appellant had valid claims for the notes which she had in her hands, namely, $1,150, since the respondents accept the judgment which condemned them to pay the note due and the interest on the other. As to the legacy of $2,000 she had every reason to believe that she had a legitimate claim.\nThere might be a question, besides, whether the will made in March, 1913, was valid or not. It is rather extraordinary that, willing as he was to provide for a permanent income to his niece of about $200 per year, the testator should have said to the solicitor who prepared the will and who was an absolute stranger to him, and who did not know anything about his affairs, that he had already provided for her by way of notes, when the notes she had would give her only about $60 a year. His mind then was not clear enough to make a valid will, or he was confused as to the amount of his obligation resulting from those notes.\nIt is no wonder that the son, being appraised of all those circumstances, would be willing to make a settle- ment and to agree to pay the total sum of $3,000, which was a little less than the amount which was supposed to be in the will and the amount of the notes.\nA compromise of a disputed claim which is honestly made constitutes valuable consideration, even if the claim ultimately turns out to be unfounded. Halsbury, vol. 7, p. 387.\nThe appellant had an undisputed claim for a part of the sum which the respondent undertook to pay and she was in perfect good faith when she was claiming an additional sum of $2,000 under the will; and the facts as then disclosed and known might perhaps have created some difficulty as to the validity of the will. It is no wonder that the respondent, as a son respectful of the wishes of his father, would, in such a case, have agreed to compromise and settle for $3,000; and, as the compromise was made with the evident consent of the two executors, the estate should be held liable.\nThe judgment a quo should be reversed with costs of this court and of the court below and judgment should be rendered against the estate for the sum of $3,000 with costs of this court and of the courts below.\nFALCONBRIDGE C.J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mr. Justice Davies.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Lamport, Ferguson & McCallum.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Fasken, Robertson, Chadwick & Sedgewick.\n[1] 43 Ont.

Co., with a capital of one million dollars. The company was incorporated with the name of Port Arthur Wagon Co., the capital being $750,000. S. was allotted his shares, elected a director and executed a power of attorney giving authority to sign his name to the prospectus of the company, which, on the hearing, he swore he had done on being told that paid-up shares had been transferred to him for services rendered. The company having been placed in liquidation, S. was settled on the list of contributories for the price of the shares subscribed for, but the order placing him on said list was set aside by a judge, confirmed by the Appellate Division.\nHeld, Anglin J. dissenting, that S. was properly placed on the list; that his conduct evinced an intention to become a shareholder, and that the reduction in the capital stock and the change in the name of the company did not warrant a rescission of his contract.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario affirming, by an equal division of opinion, the judgment of Mr. Justice Britton, who had ordered the name of Smyth to be struck off the list of contributories of the Port Arthur Wagon Co., where it had been placed by order of the Master-in-Ordinary.\nThe material facts are stated in the above head-note.\nBain K.C. and M.L. Gordon for the appellant.\nStrachan Johnston for the respondent. DAVIES J.\u2014There has been much conflict of judicial opinion upon this application to settle the name of W.R. Smyth upon the list of contributories of the insolvent company being wound up.\nThe Master-in-Ordinary settled his name on the list of contributories.\nOn appeal to a justice of the High Court, Britton J. allowed the appeal and struck off Smyth\u2019s name.\nOn further appeal to the Appellate Division the judgment of Mr. Justice Britton was affirmed on an equal division of the learned judges of that court, whereupon the present appeal to this court was taken.\nI have given the facts of the case much consideration and have reached the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the judgment of the Master\u2011in\u2011Ordinary restored for the reasons stated by him, and those stated by Chief Justice Meredith and Riddell J. in the Second Appellate Division.\nI think the power of attorney executed by Smyth to the Port Arthur Wagon Company, Limited, to sign the prospectus of that company, dated the 23rd September, 1910, and which was duly filed with the Provincial Secretary together with the prospectus, as required by the provincial law, signed by Smyth and the other directors, conclusive as against Smyth, and that his attempted explanation as to why he signed was unsatisfactory.\nI cannot think it reasonable or possible that after such a solemn and deliberate act, he can now be heard to say that he never was a shareholder or a director in the company.\nWhatever might be said as to other branches of the case, this fact of the signing of the power of attorney to put his name as a shareholder and director to such an important official document as the prospectus of the company, intended to be and which was duly filed as by law required with the Provincial Secretary, is conclusive to my mind\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The numerous excuses given by, or on behalf of, respondent for relieving him from the position that the report of the learned Master-in-Ordinary had placed him in as a contributory, have been so well met and disposed of by the Master-in-Ordinary and the learned Chief Justice of the Common Pleas (with each of whom in all essential parts of their respective reasons for judgment I agree) that it seems needless for me to reiterate same here.\nI also agree with the greater part of the reasons assigned by Mr. Justice Riddell, but cannot feel so charitably disposed as he seems, and hence inclined to accept at its face value, as he does, the respondent\u2019s story of how and why he felt qualified to act in discharge of a most grave and serious part of a director\u2019s duties when only qualified to do so by reason of something that did not take place for four months after his joining in such discharge of a director\u2019s duty.\nI am afraid respondent has deceived himself. An argument is made that the appellant did not call the other alleged actor in such a comedy to contradict him.\nOne of those had, as shewn by the quotation Mr. Justice Rose gives, to all intents and purposes already sworn to what was quite inconsistent with the story in the sense in which it is now put forward.\nThe marvel is that the other, if present in court as alleged, was not called to corroborate respondent if he could be got to do so.\nIt is not necessary to assume that respondent manufactured the whole story. Having regard to his failure to respond to the demands made upon him for payment of calls made, upon the stock allotted to him, it was quite natural he should, when asked to act as director, make some such remark as he swears to, and equally well might Lindsay, hearing it, recall the fact that he was to give him some stock got for nothing and make the response alleged.\nThat any one concerned in such idle talk could have taken it seriously as the basis for qualifying a director to act, and yet the implementing of such a basis be delayed for four months, I cannot accept.\nMuch less can I understand why he should, for the many months thereafter, continue to submit, as previously, without response, to be dunned so persistently, if in fact he intended to repudiate acceptance of the allotment. That was a time for him to speak or forever afterwards be silent.\nThe case, as I view it, is that of a man who, having agreed to take stock, might have withdrawn from the consequences of that act at least up to the time when interpreted by those concerned as a proposal still on foot and valid, and when they assented thereto, by the allotment they duly made, and by his election as director, and possibly including the time of his failure to repudiate either, but when all that is followed by an act as a director which involved possible serious consequences to himself and others, he was thereby inviting to join him and rely upon his representations, he should not be permitted, years afterwards, successfully to say that what he did rested, not upon the written record, but upon, and only attributable to, some idle persiflage.\nIt is idle to dwell upon the frame of the contract as it originally stood as being only between him and Cameron. Neither that sort of document, nor even articles of association, can be said to be in themselves, when standing alone, a contract with the company which is created later.\nWhen the company has come into existence the subscription may be given vitality, or possibly be nullified by those becoming empowered under its charter to act in relation thereto.\nThe conduct of the parties concerned must ever remain as the true test of what measure of responsibility there may attach to any one claimed to have become legally liable to be placed on the list of contributories.\nIndeed, as said long ago by Lord St. Leonards, in the case of Spackman v. Evans[1], at page 208:\u2014\nA man may become a contributory to a company by his acts although he has not made himself legally a member of it.\nI think possibly Leeke\u2019s Case[2], of all the many cases I have looked at, bears the most instructive resemblance, in its leading features, to this, in the way of supporting the line of thought I have adverted to.\nThe contributory there in question had never signed any application for shares, but had taken some little part in the initiatory steps towards the creation of the new company in which he was allotted shares, and his acceptance of the office of director, though evidenced only by a simple act of very minor importance, was held sufficient to bind him also in way of an acceptance of what had been allotted.\nAnd curiously enough, in that case, there was also a discarded side-light story, as to the possibility of the shares having been paid up.\nThe case of Robert v. Montreal Trust[3], decided what some of us thought of men who subscribe and pay no heed to the consequences of their acts. I do not feel called upon to express any opinion upon the validity or invalidity of the liquidator\u2019s transaction with Wiley. The proper time to have raised any contention, if ever founded, as to the status of the liquidator, was before or immediately after these proceedings had begun.\nI think this appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the report of the learned Master-in-Ordinary be restored and confirmed.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The question raised on this appeal is the liability of the respondent to be placed on the list of contributories of the Port Arthur Wagon Company, which is being wound up, in respect of 50 shares of preferred stock. The Master held the respondent liable. On appeal a judge of the High Court Division reversed this holding and removed his name from the list of contributories. This judgment was affirmed by an equally divided court of the Appellate Division.\nThe liquidator asserts the liability of the respondent on two grounds: (a) a subscription by him for the 50 shares duly accepted by allotment; (b) conduct estopping him from denying that he is the holder of these 50 shares.\n(a) Mr. Justice Britton, Mr. Justice Riddell, Mr. Justice Lennox and Mr. Justice Rose all agree that there was no subscription by the respondent for the shares allotted to him. The document relied on as a subscription is an agreement made in September, 1909, with Mr. (now Sir) Donald C. Cameron and other prospective subscribers, to take 50 shares in a projected company\u2014\nthe Port Arthur Manufacturing Company * * * with a capital of $1,000,000, divided into 10,000 shares of $100 each.\nThe subscribers covenanted and agreed with each other to become incorporated. No other subscriptions to this agreement were obtained. It was not proceeded with. Another company, the Port Arthur Wagon Company, was incorporated in January, 1910, with a capital of $750,000. The respondent had nothing whatever to do with this incorporation. Long before it took place\u2014indeed, very shortly after he had signed the September agreement\u2014he learned that a representation made to him by the promoter, Lindsay, when his signature was obtained, that the Town of Port Arthur had passed a by-law giving a cash bonus of $100,000 to the projected company, was untrue and he at once notified Lindsay, who had secured his subscription, that he withdrew it on account of the misrepresentation and Lindsay acquiesced in his doing so. There was nobody else whom he could notify at that time. Lindsay had also told him that he had practically all the $1,000,000 capital, subscribed, which was likewise an untrue statement.\nThe company incorporated decided to issue part of its stock as preference shares, and it is for 50 of these preferred shares that it is sought to hold the respondent as a contributory. As Mr. Justice Riddell says:\u2014\nIn my view it cannot be successfully contended that a subscriber for shares in a proposed company with $1,000,000 can be compelled to take shares in a company with only $750,000, nor can a subscriber for shares be compelled to take \u201cpreferred shares\u201d\u2014and unless his conduct subsequent to the allotment bound him the respondent must be cleared of liability.\n(b) The estoppel which is invoked against the respondent is rested on two grounds: (1) his neglect to answer numerous letters notifying him of the allotment of shares to him, demanding payment of calls, advising of meetings, etc. (2) The execution of a power of attorney authorising the appending of his name as a director to a prospectus of the company now in liquidation. (1) If the respondent had ever subscribed for the shares which it is sought to fasten upon him, a great deal might be made of his failure to answer letters of the company\u2019s secretary addressed to him, or to take other steps to repudiate liability. But I know of no ground on which a person who has never subscribed can be made liable in respect of shares, which a company has purported to allot to him, merely by inaction\u2014by refusing or neglecting to reply to letters notifying him of calls, etc., or failing to take steps to have his name removed from the books of the company as a shareholder. No authority for such a proposition was cited and I venture to think none can be found.\n(2) The matter of the power of attorney is not so easily disposed of. If the only shares in respect of which the respondent could have qualified as a director had been the 50 shares here in question, his signature to the power of attorney and action upon it which ensued might be taken to estop him from denying his liability as a contributory. But he makes this explanation about the signing of the power of attorney: He had been elected a director of the company without his knowledge or assent. The company\u2019s secretary had written him stating that the company was obliged to issue a prospectus and that it was necessary that all the directors should sign it and assent to retain office. In answer to this letter he went to Mr. Lindsay\u2019s office and tells this story of what happened there.\nQ.\u2014Then do you recollect sending this power of attorney? A.\u2014I do.\nQ.\u2014Was that signed in Mr. Lindsay\u2019s presence? A.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014Tell His Honour what took place then? A.\u2014Mr. Lindsay\u2014Mr. Fox, I believe the gentleman who was here had written me regarding calling at his office that he wanted to see me particularly, and I think I wrote him to say that I would be in the city some day and would perhaps call on him. I don\u2019t remember exactly the circumstances, what I said in the letter. However, I called at the office. Mr. Lindsay and Mr. Fox were both there, and I told Mr. Lindsay there, and Mr. Fox as well, that I couldn\u2019t sign no prospectus, that I had no stock, had subscribed for no stock in this company; didn\u2019t understand why they should ask me to sign any prospectus. The reasons they gave me for asking me to sign a prospectus were that they had put my name in as a director\u2014which was absolutely without my authority\u2014that they put my name as a director for this company, and they were stuck regarding the prospectus because my name had been put in as a director, and asked me if I would sign this power of attorney, and I said, \u201cNo, I will not sign it because I am not a shareholder.\u201d Then Mr. Lindsay said: \u201cYou are a shareholder of the company because I have given you some of my stock\u201d for services that I had done for him in connection with introducing Mr. Price and Mr. Clair to Mr. Lindsay some time the previous winter, and he said that he placed to my credit, in my name, a certain number of shares fully paid up. I says: \u201cUnder those circumstances I will sign the prospectus on the condition\u2014taking your word for it\u2014that you have placed to my name 25 shares of stock in the company that you are asking me to sign the prospectus for.\u201d\nQ.\u2014Did you ever attend a directors\u2019 meeting, Mr. Smyth? A.\u2014Never.\nQ.\u2014Some time later you got a certificate shewing that you were the holder of 25 shares of stock? A.\u2014I did.\nQ.\u2014Do you know who sent that? A.\u2014Mr. Lindsay sent me that. Certificate marked exhibit No. 12.\nQ.\u2014Did you see this prospectus that was signed Mr. Smyth. A.\u2014No.\nNeither Mr. Lindsay nor Mr. Fox was called to contradict this story, although both were in court and heard it sworn to by Mr. Smyth. Mr. Fox gave other evidence in rebuttal. The stock certificate produced corroborated Mr. Smyth\u2019s statement as to the 25 shares given him by Lindsay. He was not discredited as a witness by the Master who heard his evidence. His statement is accepted by Riddell J. as well as by Britton, Lennox and Rose JJ. There is nothing to shew that he did anything whatever in respect of the 50 shares. His signature to the power of attorney, and the use of his name as a director, which he permitted, is fully explained by his understanding that he was the holder of the 25 shares given him by Lindsay. The fact that the certificate issued to him for 25 shares bears a date subsequent to that of the prospectus has no special significance. He acted on the assumption that Lindsay had transferred, or would transfer, the shares to him. Smyth did no act which he thought, or which anybody else who knew of the arrangement in regard to the 25 shares could reasonably think, was based upon his being also the holder of 50 shares of preferred stock. There was, therefore, as Mr. Justice Rose points out, nothing done by the respondent which amounted to a representation that he was the holder of 50 shares of the stock of the Port Arthur Wagon Company\u2014nothing which he knew, or should have known, was calculated to create that impression. The foundation for an estoppel is, therefore, lacking.\nMorrisburg and Ottawa Electric Railway Co. v. O\u2019Connor[4], cited by Mr. Justice Riddell, was not, as is that at bar, a case of no subscription by the allottee\u2014it was a case of a voidable subscription not repudiated with reasonable promptitude, in that respect not unlike a a case recently dealt with in this court; Robert v. Montreal Trust Co.[5]\nFor these reasons and those stated by Mr. Justice Rose, I would dismiss this appeal.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014We are called upon to decide whether the respondent, W.R. Smyth, should be placed on the list of contributories of the appellant company in liquidation.\nThere is a great divergence of opinion in the court below as to the liability of the respondent. The Master-in-Ordinary, who heard the evidence and whose findings are, therefore, entitled to a great deal of weight, and two judges of the Appellate Division have declared that he was liable, while the other three judges who dealt with the case stated that he was not.\nThe defence of Smyth was that he never subscribed nor applied for shares in the appellant company, and that any subscription which might have been obtained from him was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation. But the latter ground seems to have been abandoned, since there is no mention of it in his notice of appeal from the report of the Master-in-Ordinary.\nSome other objections have been raised before this court and the Appellate Division, viz., the one concerning the validity of the sale of the assets to Wiley, but as the facts on which these grounds might be based have not been fully inquired into, it would be rather dangerous to pronounce upon them. I prefer to confine myself to the pleadings and to the facts which have been tried.\nOn the 24th September, 1909, Sir Douglas Cameron and the respondent Smyth signed the following document:\u2014\nWe, the undersigned, do hereby severally covenant and agree each with the other to become incorporated as a company under the provisions of the first part of the \u201cCompanies Act\u201d under the name of The Port Arthur Manufacturing Company, Limited, or such other name as the Secretary of State may give to the company, with a capital of one million dollars, divided into ten thousand shares of one hundred dollars each.\nAnd we do hereby severally, and not one for the other, subscribe for and agree to take the respective amounts of the capital stock of the said company set opposite our respective names as hereunder and hereafter written, and to become shareholders in such company to the said amounts.\nIn witness whereof we have signed.\nD.C. Cameron(s) 1 Sept. 24th, Toronto, Winnipeg, Man.\nW.J. Lindsay as Vice-President.\nW.R. Smyth(s) 50 Sept. 24th, Rydal Bank, W.J. Lindsay.\nAs far as the signature of Smyth was concerned, it was obtained on the solicitations of a company promoter by the name of W.J. Lindsay, whose name appears on the above document as having witnessed the signatures of the subscribers.\nIn the month of November, 1909, at the request of Lindsay an application was made to the Secretary of of State by the firm of solicitors Starr, Spence & Cameron, and two of their students, for the incorporation of the company under the name of Port Arthur Wagon Company. The application stated that the amount of capital stock of the company would be $750,000. The application was granted and letters patent were issued on the 11th January, 1910.\nThe organization of the company was then proceeded with and a by-law was passed declaring that 3,000 shares of the capital stock of the company be issued as preferential shares of $100 each with cumulative dividend of 7% and priority over all the other shares of the capital stock of the company.\nOn the 22nd March, 1910, at a meeting of the directors of the company, the allotment of preferred shares was made to different persons, namely, to Sir Douglas Cameron for one share and to W.R. Smyth for 50 shares, and Smyth was elected as one of the directors. A notice of allotment was given to the respondent. He was at the same time also informed of his election as director and was given notice of different meetings of directors which were called later on; but he does not seem to have ever attended any of these meetings.\nHe was called upon also several times to pay calls upon his stock.\nAt first he did not answer, but on the 19th October, 1911, he wrote stating:\u2014\nIt is impossible for me to accept your draft for reasons which I have several times explained to the company at their office, while I was in Toronto. I also explained my position to the Honourable Mr. Cameron of your city, who was then, I believe, president. As to what those reasons were, the evidence is rather conflicting. The secretary of the company said that Smyth had never repudiated his subscription, and he added that Sir Douglas Cameron had reported at a meeting that he had met Smyth and that he was unable to take up drafts on account of losses he had got in a fire. On the other hand, Smyth states in his evidence that he told to his co-shareholders that his subscription had been obtained by fraud and misrepresentation and that he should not be considered as a shareholder.\nOn the 29th August, 1910, he, however, as a director, gave to the secretary of the company a power of attorney to sign the prospectus of the company.\nNow he says that when he was asked by Lindsay and the secretary of the company to give that power of attorney, he objected, stating that he was not a shareholder; but Lindsay answered that he had put some of his own shares in his name.\nThat story does not agree with what has been said by the secretary of the company, who claims that, to his knowledge, Mr. Smyth never repudiated his contract to take shares in the company.\nIn those circumstances should he be held liable for the 50 shares which he subscribed for on the 24th September, 1909?\nHe complains that the company incorporated is known as Port Arthur Wagon Company, and that his subscription was for a company called Port Arthur Manufacturing Company. It is true that the latter name was mentioned in the document which he signed, but it is stated also in that document that his subscription could cover any other name that the Secretary of State might give. It is no wonder that the name Port Arthur Manufacturing Company would not be accepted by the Secretary of State, because it was too general; and it is no wonder, therefore, that the application, in order to meet that objection which would certainly be made to the name of the company, would have described it the Port Arthur Wagon Company. Besides, in his evidence, Mr. Smyth admits himself that it would not be an objection which would have prevented him from carrying out his obligation.\nIt is likewise argued that the capital of the company is not $1,000,000, as stated in the subscription, but only $750,000. He could not, in my opinion, complain of that fact. If there were evidence to prove that with a capital of less than $1,000,000 the company could not carry out its work, that might be a very serious objection. But there is no such evidence.\nHe further says:\u2014\nI have subscribed for common shares and not for preferential shares, as were allotted to me.\nI do not see how he can complain of that, because the preferential cumulative shares were far more advantageous than the ordinary shares.\nHe says that he had notified Lindsay that he could not carry out his contract. Well, Lindsay was not the company, and I think his duty was, when he received notice of his allotment, to formally notify the company that his subscription would not cover the allotment which had been made.\nHe accepted the position of director; he signed the prospectus; and it seems to me now that he is estopped from stating that he is not liable for the agreement which he signed.\nFor those reasons, I think that he has been properly put on the list of contributories and that the decision of the Master-in-Ordinary should be restored with costs of this court and of the courts below. Appeal allowed.\nFALCONBRIDGE C.J.\u2014For the reasons given in the court below by the Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and Mr. Justice Riddell, I would allow this appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Bain, Bicknell, Macdonnell & Gordon.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Thomson, Tilley & Johnston.\n[1] L.R. 3 H.L. 171.\n[2] 6 Ch.

The trial judge held that there was an existing contract and awarded the plaintiff the damages claimed but his judgment was varied by the Appellate Division which set aside the assessment of damages and directed a reference therefor.\nHeld, per Davies and Anglin JJ. and Falconbridge C.J. that, though an appeal lies from the judgment of a judge at the trial on questions of fact as well as of law, on the former an appellate court should not interfere with such decision of the judge who has seen and heard the witnesses unless there is some good and special reason for doubting its soundness. In this case there was no such reason and the judgment at the trial should stand.\nHeld also, that as the damages were assessed by the trial judge on the principle laid down in Roth v. Taysen (12 Times L.R. 211) and the evidence justified the assessment the judgment should not have been varied.\nBrodeur J. also held that the judgment on the trial should be restored. Idington J. dissented on the ground that the evidence did not prove the existence of any contract between the parties.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (41 Ont. L.R. 58; 39 D.L.R. 463) reversed in part.\nAPPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], varying the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiffs (respondents).

(dissenting)\u2014The appellant\u2019s place of business was Toronto, where he carried it on under the name of Morrow Cereal Company. The respondent\u2019s was in Montreal. One Weeks, a sales\u2019 agent so called of the latter, and appellant travelled on a train from Montreal to Toronto and being engaged in the like business of dealing in flour had naturally a conversation relative to prices of a certain brand of flour which went so far as the appellant naming a price he was likely to agree to for sale to respondent of a large quantity thereof for future delivery.\nThey parted at Toronto on the morning of the 13th Oct., 1916; appellant stopping there and Weeks going on to London.\nOn the afternoon and evening of same day they had phone conversations which led to the appellant sending Weeks the following telegrams:\u2014\nToronto, Ont., Oct. 13\/16\n140 rn bn 30 rush\nJ.E.

Ltd.\nMontreal, Que.\nYour acceptance of flour received this morning twelve days after our offer sorry too late heavily oversold.\nMORROW CEREAL CO.\nTo this respondent same day replied as follows:\u2014\nMontreal, Que., Oct. 24, 1916.\nMorrow Cereal Co.,\nToronto, Ont.\nWhat does your telegram of even date mean? We do not understand it.\nThe OGILVIE FLOUR MILLS.\nThe respondent brought this action on the 7th November, 1916, founded upon part or whole of the foregoing if applicable. The respondent contends that the appellant\u2019s messages from Toronto to Weeks form the contract, when read in light of the conversations had between him and Weeks.\nObviously it would have some difficulty in making thereout alone a contract complying with the Statute of Frauds and it falls back upon the confirmation of the contract sent by appellant directly to the respondent at Montreal. If there were nothing more in the case, as the courts below evidently have held, there might not be much difficulty in respondent\u2019s way. But there are a number of things in the conversations leading up thereto in regard to which the appellant and Weeks differ.\nI shall not dwell thereon for I cannot, in my view of the whole case, get rid of the opinion I have formed that the letter of the respondent and the enclosures therein which are specificially referred to as\nour confirmation of our recent purchase of flour from you\nwere intended to form part of the contract from respondent\u2019s point of view as originally conceived.\nIt was clearly the result of the well understood mode of doing business between them that each party should so express its understanding in writing otherwise no such communications would have been resorted to or have existed.\nBut for some such system the obvious result would be, that he, sending a telegram or letter merely as result of a prior oral bargain, would be bound in law, whilst the other would not.\nIt is idle to argue that such contracts are possible and that such a one-sided method of bargaining often does occur.\nIt is not a method, I imagine, of very extensive use. It is too absurd for business men dealing in commodities of daily fluctuating value to act upon as a rule.\nHowever all that may be with others, I am clearly of the opinion that such loose methods of business formed no part of the daily method followed by those litigants.\nThe appellant, in compliance with the sane and safe way, did not treat his telegram to Weeks as ending the business, but sent the confirmatory and explicit statement of the contract to the respondent\u2019s head office in Montreal, and its replies thereto set forth in the enclosures of 13th and 14th October respectively were doubtless framed on the days they bear date for the purpose of being despatched to the appellant but by some oversight were delayed until Weeks had returned to Montreal and happened to observe the omission when attending to another proposal which takes up a great part of his letter but has no bearing on that in question herein.\nBy that time it was too late, but none the less it was so begotten of their common understanding or system adopted to express a part of an intended contract that they were sent forward as a matter of course.\nIt is stoutly argued that they neither formed a part of the contract now in question nor even were so intended.\nI cannot agree therewith; or rather, I should say, they ought to have formed part thereof if properly framed and sent in due time.\nIt is not pretended that the respondent can insist on the maintenance of such contracts if their confirmations such as I indicate were respectively a necessary part thereof. The fluctuating market did not permit of any such suspense or delay. Moreover, there is a clear departure from the express terms of the appellant\u2019s confirmatory expression of the contract as he understood it.\nThese points I need not elaborate. They are self-evident to any one closely analyzing each party\u2019s confirmations and comparing same.\nThe result is, in my view, there never was a contract and many other points made and argued at length need not be considered.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The evidence of the two witnesses who gave oral testimony about the contracts sued upon is so contradictory that, unless the documents in the record are decisive, the truth of one story or the other must be determined by their respective inherent probabilities or by the comparative credibility of the witnesses. The defendant\u2019s witness\u2014he is in fact the defendant\u2014asks us to believe that two writings, each headed \u201cconfirmation of sale\u201d and otherwise in the form of a sale note, were merely offers and were sent pursuant to an understanding with the plaintiff\u2019s witness that they should be so treated by the plaintiff. This ex facie improbable story is denied by the plaintiff\u2019s witness, who, in turn, asks us to accept his statement that two other writings, which he calls in his letter\nour confirmations of recent purchase,\nand on their face purport to be such\u2014giving the full particulars of bought notes\u2014were sent not to complete the contracts which they evidence but merely to give the defendant the number by which those contracts would be designated in the plaintiff\u2019s records\u2014a story perhaps not quite so improbable as that of the defendant\u2019s witness, but undoubtedly not free from difficulty. On the whole, with Mr. Justice Riddell, I cannot say that the trial judge was wrong in accepting the plaintiff\u2019s version that two contracts had been concluded between Weeks and Morrow as a result of conversations on the train and by telephone and telegrams, of which the documents above referred to were, as they purport to be, merely confirmations.\nI think the trial judge must have thought Weeks\u2019 testimony more credible than Morrow\u2019s. One or two incidents in the course of the trial indicate that Morrow\u2019s manner of giving evidence and the unsatisfactory character of his answers impressed the learned judge unfavourably.\nI think it might well be regarded as \u201ca rash proceeding\u201d on our part, under the circumstances of this case, to reverse the finding of the judge who tried it and saw the witnesses who are in conflict in the witness-box, affirmed as it is by the majority of the judges of the appellate court. Nocton v. Ashburton[2]. While I fully appreciate the right of appeal from the finding of a trial judge on fact as well as law so much insisted upon by Meredith C.J.C.P. in his dissenting judgment, his views seem scarcely in accord with very recent statements by their Lordships of the Judicial Committee of the duties of an appellate court in dealing with such an appeal. In Ruddy v. Toronto Eastern Ry. Co[3], speaking of the judgment of a trial judge their Lordships say:\u2014\nFrom such a judgment an appeal is always open, both upon fact and law. But upon questions of fact an appeal court will not interfere with the decision of the judge who has seen the witnesses and has been able, with the impression thus formed fresh in his mind, to decide between their contending evidence, unless there is some good and special reason to throw doubt upon the soundness of his conclusions.\nIn Wood v. Haines[4], their Lordships said at page 586:\u2014 It must be an extraordinary case in which the appellate tribunal can accept the responsibility of differing as to the credibility of witnesses from the trial judge who has seen and watched them whereas the appellate judge has no such advantage.\nThere remains to be considered the cross-appeal by which the plaintiffs seek a restoration of the assessment of damages made by the learned trial judge which was set aside by the Appellate Division. The learned appellate judges hold that the sum allowed was excessive but do not state the error in which the trial judge, in their opinion, fell and advisedly refrain from indicating the measure of damages to be applied on the reference which they direct. I am, with respect, of the opinion that the award of damages by the trial judge should not have been disturbed and I cannot but think it unwise, to say the least, and calculated unduly to prolong litigation, to leave a referee without any guide as to the proper basis on which to assess the damages when, as here, an appellate court holds that the trial judge was in error as to the principle upon which they should be assessed and that principle is so clear as the learned judges of the Appellate Division apparently thought it.\nThe trial judge allowed the plaintiffs the difference between what it actually cost them to procure flour to replace what the defendants had failed to deliver and what it would have cost at the contract prices. The latter was $7.05 per barrel for 6,000 bags to be delivered before the 1st of November, and for 4,000 bags, $7.05, and for 10,000 bags, $7 per barrel, to be delivered before the 1st of December. The defendants repudiated their contracts on the 24th of October. The first evidence of any election by the plaintiffs to accept this repudiation and put an end to the contracts is furnished by the commencement of this action on the 7th of November.\nI agree with the statement made by counsel for the defendants in their factum that the correct rule as to the measure of damages under these circumstances is stated, by Lord Esher M.R. in Roth & Co. v. Taysen[5], in these terms:\u2014\nWhen there was a repudiation of a contract for the purchase and sale of goods treated as a breach the difference between the contract price and the market price of the goods on the date of the breach was the measure of damages, subject to this, that if the date of the breach was not the day of delivery another rule applied. In this latter case repudiation when accepted was treated as a breach of the contract before the day of delivery, and the damages would not be the difference between the contract price and market price on the day of breach, but must be assessed by the jury having regard to the future day of delivery. But this latter rule was qualified by this, that the plaintiff who had treated the repudiation as a breach was bound to do what was reasonable to decrease the damages.\nSee also Mayne on Damages, 7th ed., p. 212.\nThe plaintiffs bought 7,000 bags of flour at $8.10 and 13,000 bags at $8.40 per barrel to replace the flour which the defendants had refused to deliver. As to the 6,000 bags deliverable before the 1st of November, the defendants themselves say in their factum that the Toronto price of flour of the quality contracted for in bags was $8 per barrel at the end of October, to which must be added 15 or 16 cents a barrel for freight to Montreal. They, therefore, can have no cause of complaint as to the purchase made to cover the 6,000 bags then due at $8.10 a barrel.\nBut they complain of the $8.40 paid for the remaining 13,000 bags. The only evidence of market prices at the end of November is given by John Kennedy and Alex. McLeod. Kennedy says the Toronto Board of Trade quotation at the end of November was $7.65-$7.75 a barrel, to which he would add 15 cents for freight to Montreal. His last transaction, however, was on the 28th of November when he paid $7.90 in Montreal. But McLeod tells us that the prevailing price at the end of November was $8.45 a barrel and, giving reasons for the statement, he says that the Toronto Board of Trade quotations are not a fair indication of current prices of flour. The learned trial judge may have preferred to be guided by Mr. McLeod rather than by Mr. Kennedy. If so, it is impossible to say that this was an error on his part. There is nothing to indicate that Mr. McLeod is not a trustworthy and reliable witness. The learned judge saw and heard both witnesses and was in the best position to determine upon which of them he could most safely rely. If, therefore, the damages in respect of the 14,000 bags then deliverable should be fixed as of the 30th of November, the $8.40 a barrel paid for the 13,000 bags now under consideration was five cents less than the market price. In respect of the other 1,000 bags the defendants have the benefit of the earlier purchase of 7,000 bags at $8.10.\nThere is no evidence that the plaintiffs could have obtained a contract in the interval between the 7th and the 30th of November on any better terms. The burden was upon the defendants to shew that they could, if that were possible. The plaintiffs had all the inconvenience of having to find flour to replace what the defendants failed to deliver, and it is by no means clear that during that period 20,000 bags of flour could be easily picked up on the market. At all events, I know of no principle on which the plaintiffs could have been required to take the risk of purchasing before the 30th of November at a price higher than those named in the contracts thus exposing themselves to loss should the price decline between the dates of such replacing purchases and the 30th of November.\nApplying the rule laid down in Roth v. Taysen[6], I think the trial judge, under these circumstances, did right in taking as the measure of the damages sustained by the plaintiffs the amount by which the cost of the flour procured by them exceeded what would have been the cost to them of the like quantity of flour of same quality if delivered by the defendants pursuant to their contracts.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the main appeal and allow the cross-appeal, both with costs, and would restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The question is whether the appellant undertook to supply the respondent with 20,000 bags of flour. The negotiations were carried out by the appellant himself and Weeks, the sales\u2019 agent of the respondent. They met together on a train going from Montreal to Toronto. After a great deal of talk, it was stated by Weeks that his company would purchase 20,000 bags of flour, 10,000 at $7.05 and the balance at $7, and that with such a quantity they would stay out of the market for a while. Morrow is a large flour merchant in Toronto, and the respondents are likely the most important dealers in that commodity in the country.\nThe appellant and the respondent are therefore serious competitors and the idea of seeing the Ogilvie company out of the market, and the price of $7.05, were very attractive to the appellant, and he was ready to close at $7.05 for the 10,000 bags, but as the contract had to be made for the whole quantity of 20,000 he would consider the matter and would communicate during the day with Weeks who was going to London, Ontario.\nThere is some divergence between those two men as to what was their conversation, and if the case had to be decided on the oral evidence of those two witnesses the respondent company, being plaintiff and having the onus, must fail. But the trial judge, who saw them both in the box, evidently accepted the statements made by Weeks in preference to those of Morrow. Besides, the written evidence we have shews conclusively that Weeks\u2019 story should be accepted.\nDuring the day, on the 13th of October, 1916, Morrow called Weeks on the telephone and said that he was ready to contract for the 10,000 bags at $7.05, but could not give a definite answer as to the other 10,000 bags. He was asked to put that in writing and sent the following telegram:\u2014\nToronto, Ont., Oct. 13\/16.\nJ.E. Weeks, Esq.,\nTecumseh House, London, Ont.\nWe confirm sale six thousand bags October shipment four thousand November seven five bulk Montreal also your giving us until to-night on ten thousand more at seven dollars Montreal thanks.\nMORROW CEREAL CO.\n4.05 p.m.\nand the same day he sent a confirmation note of the sale of 10,000 bags to the respondent company itself at Montreal:\u2014\nConfirmation of Sale.\nMorrow Cereal Company.\nToronto, Oct. 13, 1916.\nTo Ogilvie Flour Mills, Ltd.\nAddress: Montreal, Que., via date wanted.\nSubject to our terms and conditions\u2014see below:\u2014\nQuantity Description Price per bbl.\n10,000 98\u2019s 90% Patent $7.05\nOntario Winter Wheat\nFlour.\nBulk Basis Montreal.\nDate of shipment.\n6,000 bags October.\n4,000 bags November\n10,000 bags.\nMORROW CEREAL COMPANY.\nPer Morrow. In the evening of the same day, Morrow sent to Weeks another telegram closing the sale for the other 10,000 bags in the following words:\u2014\nToronto, Ont., Oct. 13th, 1916.\nJ.E. Weeks,\nTecumseh House, London, Ont.\nBook ten thousand bags seven dollars bulk Montreal October November shipment our option.\nMORROW CEREAL CO.\n8.17 p.m.\nand the next day he sent to the respondent company a confirmation note for that last sale. There again the document is called \u201cconfirmation of sale.\u201d Now the defendant, appellant, claims that those sales were made with the condition that the respondents would stay out of the market.\nWe. do not find that condition in his telegrams and in his confirmation notes. The offer, I understand, made by Weeks to purchase those 20,000 bags of flour was made with that condition and, as a matter of fact, he has stated that they were willing to stay out of the market.\nHowever, the condition, as far as the respondents are concerned, has been fulfilled and there is no necessity for laying any stress upon it. It seems to me, with the evidence we have before us, and especially with the telegrams sent by Morrow and his confirmation notes, that there is no doubt about a contract having been entered into by which Morrow, doing business under the name of Morrow Cereal Company, undertook to ship during October and November 20,000 bags of flour, of which 10,000 was to be at $7 and 10,000 at $7.05.\nI understand that it is a custom of trade with those dealers that when they make verbal contracts or agreements by telephone or by telegrams, to exchange confirmation notes. But those confirmation notes do not prevent the contract from being made from the time and date at which the agreement has been entered into. They are simply evidence of the contract but do not constitute the agreement itself.\nThe appellant claimed at first that the contract was at an end because the confirmation note on the part of the Ogilvie Flour Mills Company reached him only the week after. If, of course, those confirmation notes constituted the contract itself, the appellant might be right because on account of the market being so fluctuating an acceptance should be made without unreasonable delay. But then it would have been his duty to state in his telegram or confirmation notes the period during which the acceptance should take place. But no such time limit is to be found in the telegram or in the notes.\nNow he says that the acceptance of his alleged offer was not made because the confirmation note of the respondent company instructed to ship to Ogilvie\u2019s City Mill Siding, Montreal, and because the word delivery instead of shipment was used with regard to the months in which it should take place.\nThere is evidence that with regard to the words delivery and shipment they should be considered as synonomous in the trade; and besides I see that no objection was taken to them when the notes of the respondent company reached Morrow, In fact, the only reason he gave in the telegram of the 24th of October was\nYour acceptance of flour received this morning, twelve days after our offer sorry too late heavily oversold.\nNo objection then as to the word delivery having a different meaning from the word shipment. I am sure that this point is the result of an afterthought.\nAs to the instructions to ship to the Ogilvie\u2019s City Mill Siding, of course that would be a very serious objection if it would incur on the part of the appellant heavier responsibility. But it appears by the evidence that in shipping to that siding it would not cost him one cent more. That should be treated then simply as instructions as to delivery which would not affect the nature of the obligation of the vendor and would not increase his work.\nThe trial judge maintained the action and gave judgment for a fixed sum of money. His judgment was confirmed by the Appellate Division, but a reference was ordered to ascertain the amount of damages suffered by the plaintiff. In that regard there is a cross-appeal by the respondents. I would be of opinion to maintain this cross-appeal for the reasons given by my brother Anglin.\nThe appeal is dismissed with costs and the cross-appeal maintained with costs and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nFalconbridge C.J. concurs with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nAppeal dismissed with costs;\ncross-appeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Miller, Ferguson & Hunter.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Thomson, Tilley & Johnston.\n[1] 41 Ont.

Clute for the appellants.\nMcKay K.C. for the respondents.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I think we are all agreed that the defence set up by the primary debtor, W.W. Ferguson, in this case of misrepresentation on the part of the bank which discharged him from payment of the debt was properly held invalid by the trial judge and the Appellate Division.\nThe only ground, therefore, upon which the judg- ment below affirming the dismissal of the action as against the defendant guarantor, John Ferguson, can be upheld is that he was a guarantor of a debt due and payable at a fixed time and was discharged from his liability by an extension of that time to the primary debtor without his knowledge or consent.\nThe guarantee is evidenced by a telegram from John Ferguson, the guarantor, to the bank and a letter confirming the telegram.\nThe former reads:\u2014\nI hereby guarantee advances to my son up to $10,000\nJOHN FERGUSON.\nAnd the letter reads:\u2014\nI beg to confirm my guarantee to you to the extent of $10,000 if necessary as per your wire to me.\nJOHN FERGUSON.\nIn order to fully understand and construe this guarantee it is necessary to know the chief facts and circumstances under which it was given.\nOlmstead, the vice-president of the bank, states in his evidence that W.W. Ferguson, the son and primary debtor, had told him that his father, the defendant John Ferguson, had a contract to buy horses and would be willing to guarantee such sums as the bank would advance to him, W.W. Ferguson, and that he, Olmstead, told him in reply he had looked up his father\u2019s financial ability and found it good and that he would submit the matter of an advance to the bank committee and that he did so and the advance was agreed to be made. This was some time in October, 1914.\nOn the 21st November following, the defendant, John Ferguson, telegraphed the bank as follows:\u2014\nAll acceptable stock purchased by my son and Robert Smith will be paid for immediately on inspection. I will personally stand behind them in transaction.\nTo which the bank wired him a reply as follows: Referring your telegram Saturday must have guarantee from you for any sum advanced your son up to $10,000 regardless of stock being acceptable.\nWhereupon John Ferguson sent the telegram in reply:\u2014\nI hereby guarantee advances to my son up to $10,000.\nAn advance of $3,000 was accordingly made on the 24th December and a short term note of 30 days, with interest at 7 per cent., taken for it by the bank.\nOlmstead further states that on the day they made the advance the plaintiff bank telegraphed the defendant, John Ferguson, as follows:\u2014\nWe loaned your son $3,000 to-day. Wish you would send us a letter confirming your telegram wherein you agreed to pay the advances paid to your son. Do you want Smith\u2019s name on the notes?\nOn the next day, he sent the plaintiff bank the following telegram:\u2014\nI appreciate your telegram. Wrote you as requested. I expect my son\u2019s associates to join in liability to the proportionate extent of their interest in transaction with him. You may be wired regarding their ability to fill contract which I am negotiating on 25 per cent. profit.\nThe contract John Ferguson here refers to and for the carrying out of which the advances were being made related to the purchase of horses for the French Government. The exact relations between the son, W.W. Ferguson, and his associate, Smith, in the purchase of these horses does not appear. Whether they were simply agents of John Ferguson receiving a commission or other remuneration, or partners with him is not disclosed.\nReading the guarantee in question in the light of the disclosed facts, I have no hesitation in reaching the conclusion that it was an absolute and a continuing one and covered any advances which might be made from time to time by the bank to Ferguson and Smith up to $10,000. No reference was made to the time at which the advances were to be repaid. That was a matter with other details left by John Ferguson to the bank and primary debtors.\nIt was arranged by the bank and primary debtors in accordance with bank usage and custom that a thirty-day note should be given which afterwards was renewed for another thirty days.\nNow it does appear to me clear that if the defendant\u2019s contention is right, the taking of the thirty-day note in the first instance operated as a discharge of the surety equally with its subsequent extension. The advance in the absence of any time for its repayment being agreed to would become payable at once. Surely no one looking to the facts of the case could put a construction upon the transaction determining that the advance became payable next day after it was made and if extended a day beyond that without guarantor\u2019s knowledge and consent would discharge him. The renewing of the thirty-day note had no greater legal effect on the guarantor\u2019s liability than the taking of the thirty-day note by the bank in the first instance. In my judgment, the guarantee being an absolute and continuing one guaranteeing whatever advances might be made from time to time under it up to $10,000, and leaving all details with respect to the taking and renewing of notes in accordance with bank custom and usage to the parties giving and taking the advances, was binding on the guarantor notwithstanding the taking of the thirty-day note or its extension.\nThere was nothing in the guarantee or the evidence anywhere shewing that any definite time for repayment of the advances was contemplated, and in my judgment the extension of the thirty-day note and taking of a new one had no greater or other effect upon the guaran- tor\u2019s liability under the continuing guarantee than the taking up of the thirty-day note in the first instance. Both were matters of detail which John Ferguson left to be settled between the bank and his son. The defendants knew from the telegram sent to him by the bank at the time the advances were being made that notes were to be taken for them, and he was asked whether he wanted Smith\u2019s name also on the notes, to which he replied that he expected his\nson\u2019s associates to join in liability to the proportionate extent of their interest.\nHe said nothing about the time the notes were to be taken for, evidently leaving that detail for the decision of the bank and his son and the latter\u2019s associate. They settled upon a thirty-day note, and subsequently agreed that it should be renewed for another thirty days.\nIt may fairly be argued that this renewal should be treated as a fresh advance by the bank within the guarantee. I prefer, however, to rest my judgment upon the facts as I have stated them and my construction of the guarantee as a continuing one, and the fact that the guarantor left all questions of detail as to the time when the advances should be repaid to the bank and his son.\nUnder these circumstances and for these reasons I would allow the appeal and enter judgment against the defendant, respondent, for the amount claimed with costs in all the courts.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The appellant advanced to W.W. Ferguson, son of respondent John Ferguson, and one Robert Smith, three thousand dollars and got their promissory note for that amount with interest at seven per cent. per annum dated 24th November, 1914, payable thirty days after date.\nThe money was intended to have been used in buying horses which they expected to dispose of in filling orders got for the French army through respondent, John Ferguson.\nHe, in anticipation of such purchases by his son, had wired from New York to appellant, carrying on business in Portland, Oregon, on 28th October, 1914, as follows:\u2014\nWill accept and pay all my son\u2019s drafts on me.\nOn the 21st November, 1914, he again wired the appellant to same address as follows:\u2014\nAll acceptable stock purchased by my son and Robert Smith will be paid for immediately on inspection. I will personally stand behind them in transaction.\nThe following reply thereto was sent by the appellant to respondent:\u2014\nReferring your telegram Saturday must have guarantee from you for any sum advanced your son up to ten thousand dollars regardless of stock being acceptable.\nTo this he responded as follows:\u2014\nNorthwestern National Bank.\nPortland, Ore.,\nI hereby guarantee advances to my son up to ten thousand dollars.\nJOHN FERGUSON.\nIn answer to that appellant sent night message as follows:\u2014\nJohn Ferguson,\nc-o Imperial Hotel, New York, N.Y.\nWe loaned your son three thousand dollars to-day. Wish you would send us a letter confirming your telegram wherein you guarantee to pay the advances made to your son. Do you want Smith\u2019s name on the notes?\nNORTHWESTERN NATIONAL BANK.\nThe respondent sent also the following letter and lettergram:\u2014 Hotel Imperial,\nNew York, Nov. 25th, 1914.\nThe Northwestern National Bank,\nGentlemen\u2014Re W.W. Ferguson Loan.\nI beg to confirm my guarantee to you to the extent of ten thousand dollars (if necessary) as per your wire to me.\nYours truly,\nJOHN FERGUSON.\nNorthwestern National Bank,\nPortland, Ore.\nI appreciate your telegram. Wrote as you requested. I expect my son\u2019s associates to join in liability to the proportionate extent of their interest in transaction with him. You may be wired regarding their ability to fill contract which I am negotiating on basis of twenty-five per cent. profit.\nJOHN FERGUSON.\nThere seems to have been no further business of buying horses carried on by Ferguson and Smith, and no further application to the appellant for advances falling within the meaning of the said guarantee than covered by the note mentioned above (if even that), yet on the 24th of December, 1914, the appellant accepted in renewal of the said promissory note, without the consent of respondent, or indeed any reference to him as to his wishes, the promissory note of W.W. Ferguson and Robert Smith for $3,000 at thirty days with interest at seven per cent. per annum.\nThere was no reservation of any recourse against the surety or anything else done to preserve such rights as may have existed up to that date against respondent.\nThe appellant sued upon the last-mentioned promissory note W.W. Ferguson as the maker thereof and the respondent as guarantor, claiming he was such by virtue of the foregoing telegrams and letters.\nThe learned trial judge directed judgment against W.W. Ferguson as maker, but dismissed the action as against respondent on the ground that he had been discharged by the giving of time to the makers without his consent.\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario has maintained such dismissal.\nI should have supposed, but for the contrary demonstrated before us by ingenious suggestions of able counsel, that an appeal therefrom was hardly arguable.\nIt was suggested, notwithstanding the fact that this transaction stood and stands quite isolated, that the guarantee must be considered as a continuing one because a ten thousand dollar limit happened to be named.\nIf there had been further advances and the business carried on, it is conceivable that the conduct of the parties and such complications as might have ensued might have given rise to some such aspect and room for such an argument.\nBut at the very outset it is evident that the parties all anticipated that the rapid turnover of horses bought and sold could avert any such like condition.\nAnd again it was suggested that the appellant might have made a fresh advance of an equal amount and used the money to take up the first note.\nThat certainly was not made apparent as within the terms stated in the correspondence I have quoted which is all that passed between appellant and respondent, and would have been a breach of that good faith a surety is entitled to claim.\nIn short there is nothing in that correspondence to authorise such a mode of treatment of the guarantee.\nAnd all the ingenious suggestions of what might have happened if the parties concerned had done something else than they did, must, in my opinion, go for nothing.\nThe case submitted must be decided by the actual facts and the relevant law governing the rights and liabilities of surety in such circumstances.\nThe following submission, which I quote from appellant\u2019s factum, represents fairly well the nature of the appellant\u2019s contention:\u2014\nThe note of November 24th, 1914, was payable at the expiration of 30 days after its date and at maturity was renewed for a further period of 30 days. This renewal may be regarded as a fresh advance by the bank which it was then entitled to make. It was within the limit as to amount fixed by the father and the latter\u2019s liability was in no way increased beyond the terms of the guarantee given by him. It is submitted that under the circumstances above mentioned John Ferguson\u2019s liability on the guarantee is not affected by the time or times when said advances were made or were to be repaid or by the manner in which said advances were evidenced or secured; and is a continuing guarantee effective and binding until all advances up to $10,000 were actually repaid.\nHence unless and until the appellant chose to make advances up to $10,000 it could do as it pleased and call on respondent to implement his guarantee when it pleased.\nI need not try to deal with such contentions. I merely submit the contract.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Consideration of the evidence has satisfied me that the conclusions of the learned trial judge, that\nthe defendants have (not) made out any case of misrepresentation or concealment which would constitute a defence to the note in question,\nand that it was contemplated that the advances to be guaranteed by the defendant, John Ferguson, should be made precisely as they were on the joint liability of Smith and W.W. Ferguson, are so well supported that they cannot be disturbed. There is really no evidence of misrepresentation. I fully concur in the learned judge\u2019s appreciation of the testimony of W.W. Ferguson. Nor was there any concealment such as would afford a defence. Hamilton v. Watson[1]; London General Omnibus Co. v. Holloway[2]; Royal Bank of Scotland v. Greenshields[3]. John Ferguson\u2019s letter puts it beyond doubt that he was apprised of Smith\u2019s interest with his son and that the joint liability of both for the advances to be made by the bank was what he desired.\nThe only question at all arguable, in my opinion, is whether the plaintiff bank, by taking a renewal of the Smith-Ferguson note of $3,000 for 30 days, discharged John Ferguson as a guarantor. I think, with respect, that it did not. The question resolves itself into an inquiry whether the terms of the guarantee and the circumstances under which it was made warrant the inference that the parties to it contemplated that any short date note taken to evidence the advance of a part of the $10,000 should be renewable at all events until the whole $10,000 had been advanced (if not afterwards, Merle v. Wells[4]), or until what would be a reasonable period of credit, having regard to the nature of the transactions which it was proposed to finance, should expire. I think they do.\nI fully appreciate the inflexibility of the rule that any material alteration in the terms of a guaranteed. contract made by the principals without the guarantor\u2019s assent will discharge him and that a binding agreement for extension of time without reservation of rights will always be deemed such a variation because it disables the guarantor, should he be minded to discharge the principal debtor\u2019s obligation and seek recoupment from him or to compel him to do so himself, from immediately proceeding against him. The right of the surety to be subrogated to all the means of the creditor is, as it has been said, one of the highest equity, and any act by which it is curtailed will to the extent of the injury inflicted be a defence. Wilson v. Brown[5].\nIt has been the law of the court for many years that a surety is entitled to come into equity to compel the principal debtor to pay what is due from him, to the intent that the surety may be relieved. Ascherson v. Tredegar Dry Dock and Wharf Co.[6]\nBut that right accrues only upon the maturity of the debt.\nThe guarantor\u2019s assent to an extension need be neither contemporaneous with it nor explicit. It may be implied in his own original contract assuming the liability. It may be involved in the arrangement or understanding between the principals which he has undertaken to guarantee\u2014perhaps without sufficient inquiry. It must always be a question of the intention of the parties either expressed or, if not, to be inferred from the terms in which they have couched their agreement, construed, if they be \u201cat all ambiguous,\u201d in the light of their relative positions and of the surrounding circumstances; Coles v. Pack[7]; Wood v. Priestner[8]; whether an extension without reservation of rights, relied upon as having worked the discharge of the guarantor, was or was not within the purview of the guarantee. To assume that it was not, if the terms are susceptible of the contrary construction, merely because it is not expressly provided for, however strong the grounds of inference that it must have been understood, is certainly unwarranted.\nIf the word \u201cadvances\u201d used by the guarantor does not imply advances from time to time and an extended period of credit, it is at least susceptible of that construction and therefore open to explanation by proof of surrounding circumstances. However strict and well defined the rights of a guarantor once the nature and extent of the guaranteed liability are ascertained, the contract of guarantee is not to be construed in his favour but rather in that of the creditor (De Colyar on Guarantees, 3rd ed., 199 et seq.). The contract guaranteed in this instance was for \u201cadvances\u201d up to the sum of $10,000. It is silent as to the time when such advances should be made and the period or periods of credit, and there is nothing to shew that any definite time for repayment was contemplated. The nature of the customer\u2019s business\u2014the purchase of horses suitable for army purposes where and as they could be found\u2014makes it clear that the advances were to be made from time to time, as the guarantor says,\nto the extent of $10,000, if necessary.\nThere is no room for doubt that the guarantee was \u201ccontinuing\u201d in the sense that it was intended to cover a series of transactions. 15 Hals. Laws of England 440; National Bank v. Thomas[9]; Newcomb v. Kloeblen[10]; and cases collected in De Colyar on Guarantees, 3rd ed., pp. 242 et seq. The taking of a short date note (30 days) was purely for the bankers\u2019 convenience and according to what is well known to be a usual custom, even where a longer period of credit is intended and understood. It was obtained merely to evidence the debt and Smith\u2019s joint liability. It was not meant thereby to fix 30 days as the period of credit or to render the money exigible by the bank on their expiry. The obligation of the makers had not then matured either in the sense that the bank would have been justified in taking immediate action to compel repayment, or that the guarantor would have been entitled to force the principal debtor to liquidate the liability or secure his discharge. On the contrary, having regard to the nature of the Fergusons\u2019 undertaking and all the circumstances, I think the inference is irresistible that the bank intended to give, and the Fergusons well understood when the $3,000 was advanced that they were obtaining, a more prolonged period of credit and that the 30 days\u2019 note would merely evidence the advance and might just as well have been drawn payable on demand, or at 60 days or three months. Any other view of what occurred would seem to me\u2014I say it with respect\u2014highly unreasonable. Thirty days after the advance of the $3,000 the purchasing of horses, so far as appears, was still in progress and the banker might within the terms of the guarantee have allowed the note to remain overdue and unpaid. On the other hand, if entitled then to collect it, had he done so he might immediately have made a fresh advance of $3,000 or of a larger sum for one month or for a longer period and it would have been clearly within the terms of the guarantee.\nIt is such a well-known custom of bankers to keep their paper \u201ccurrent\u201d by taking renewals of short date notes that business men dealing with them may properly be assumed to have contracted with reference to it. The nature of the customer\u2019s business and the other circumstances in evidence in the case at bar indicating that the parties contemplated a comparatively long period of credit during which advances should be made from time to time \u201cif necessary,\u201d and the custom of bankers to takes notes for advances at short dates, and to keep them \u201ccurrent\u201d making it reasonably clear that the parties must have contemplated renewals at least of any such notes taken to evidence the earlier advances, it is not surprising to find that the renewal in question was given at the bank\u2019s instance,\nbecause it was a time note and the time had elapsed. The renewal would seem to have been treated as a matter of course\u2014something which was asked for and given pursuant to the understanding of the parties as to the terms on which the advance had been made. Moreover a renewal is usually dealt with by bankers as a fresh discount, the customer\u2019s account being debited with the amount of the old and credited with the proceeds of the discount of the new note\u2014a process slightly more advantageous to the bank than it would be to charge interest on the original obligation, and, in effect, tantamount to a fresh advance which, as already stated, would have been clearly within the terms of the guarantee.\nI think there is more than room for doubt whether the guarantor would have been entitled under the circumstances of the case at bar, had there been no renewal, either to assert a right to come in at any time after the first thirty days had expired\u2014at all events without some reasonable notice\u2014and pay off the bank and demand subrogation, or to compel the makers of the note to pay it. On the contrary, I rather incline to the view that these rights would accrue only when the bank on the expiry of a reasonable period of credit, having regard to the nature of the Fergusons\u2019 undertaking and all the circumstances, would have been entitled to call in the guaranteed loans. In this aspect of the case the renewal of the note did not interfere with or affect any right of the guarantor. But I prefer to rest my judgment upon the view that there was in reality no extension of the guaranteed loan, or that, having regard to the nature of the contract guaranteed, the renewal taken was within its terms in the sense that it was contemplated as one of the things which the creditor might do without affecting his rights against the surety. Grahame v. Grahame[11]; First National Bank v. Wunderlich[12]: Tyson v. Reinecke[13]; National Bank v. Thomas[14].\nI agree with the plaintiff\u2019s contention that upon the true interpretation of the guarantee John Ferguson assumed liability to pay any sum or sums advanced by the plaintiff bank to his son within the limit prescribed, should he make default in paying it at such time as the bank should be entitled to and see fit to demand it. It is satisfactory to reach a conclusion which, if it should prevail, will frustrate a plain attempt to evade and defeat what is certainly a moral\u2014I think it is also a legal\u2014obligation.\nIn the Appellate Division the case was disposed of at the close of the argument, the Chief Justice merely stating that the appellant had failed to shew that the judgment at the trial was erroneous. With great respect, the four Canadian cases cited by the learned trial judge at the conclusion of his judgment, presumably in support of it, seem scarcely relevant. In Thompson v. McDonald[15], it was merely held that the plea was insufficient because it did not allege a binding extension of time. In Wilson v. Brown[16], it was not contended, and there was no ground for the contention, that the suretyship was continuing. Moreover, the matter set up as a defence was not a binding extension of time or other alteration of the contract, but a mere forbearance to take steps to recover. Devanney v. Brownlee[17], was a case of a single promissory note made by two persons jointly, one of whom, to the knowledge of the holder, was a surety for the other. The note was renewed by such other maker without the knowledge or consent of him held to be a surety. There was no suggestion of a continuing guarantee. Fleming v. MacLeod[18], was reversed on appeal to this court[19]. Again there was no question in this case of a continuing guarantee. The agreement relied upon and found to be established in the New Brunswick court\u2014this court held otherwise\u2014was for an extension of the time for payment of a single note (the entire transaction) to a fixed date without the knowledge or consent of an indorser.\nI am, for the foregoing reasons, with deference, of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed and that judgment should be entered for the appellants with costs throughout.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Davies.\nFALCONBRIDGE C.J.\u2014This is an action by a creditor against a primary debtor and a guarantor. Judgment was given against the primary debtor but the action was dismissed as against the guarantor. The plaintiff unsuccessfully appealed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario, and now appeals to this court.\nThe defence of misrepresentation was properly held invalid by the trial judge and the Appellate Division, and the only defence requiring serious consideration is that the guarantor was released by the giving of time by the creditor to the primary debtor without the consent of the guarantor.\nAs appears by the indorsement on the writ of summons, the action was brought upon a promissory note made by the primary debtor in favour of the plaintiff dated 24th November, 1914, for $3,000 and interest payable in thirty days. There is no dispute that the advance represented by this note was covered by the guaranty. The note above mentioned was, however, renewed on the 24th December, 1914, for the same amount. The renewal note was taken without the consent or knowledge of the guarantor. It is, of course, elementary law that a creditor who takes a promissory note or bill from a debtor who is in default impliedly gives him time since he cannot sue the debtor until maturity of the bill or note.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s counsel were apparently not able to find any case which would make this principle inapplicable to the liability in respect to the original note. It was argued, however, that the guaranty in question was a continuing one, and that it covered the liability upon the renewal note which is to be regarded as representing a second advance within the terms of the guaranty. At least this is the way it seems to me the plaintiff must put its case in its endeavour to avoid the consequences of its having released the guarantor as regards the liability on the original note.\nThe plaintiff strongly relied on Grahame v. Grahame[20]. The guaranty there was in the following terms:\u2014\n7th February, 1879.\nI hereby undertake to guarantee to the National Bank any advances made to my son Charles James Grahame of the London Stock Exchange, to the extent of \u00a31,000\nGEORGE GRAHAME.\nThe promissory note of C.J. Grahame for \u00a3450 of the 11th February, 1879, at six months was renewed several successive times for different amounts. The action was on a note for \u00a3440, dated 20th August, 1880, payable six months after date. When the last preceding note came due, 20th August, 1880, the amount (\u00a3375) was debited to his account and the amount of the latest note (\u00a3440) credited to his account. The Vice-Chancellor considered that there was a new advance of \u00a3440. The guaranty was admitted to be a continuing one and therefore covered the last advance.\nThe Vice-Chancellor says, at page 259:\u2014\nThe promisory note of C.J. Grahame of the 11th February, 1879, was more than once renewed, and if this claim rested on the original note, the bank might have difficulty in meeting this contention (as to giving time).\nIt is clear that this case does not help the plaintiff as far as the original note in the present case is concerned, and as I have already mentioned, the indorsement on the writ refers only to the original note. The statement of claim, it is true, refers to both notes, and perhaps on that account the present action might be regarded as an action on the second note. In the view which I take of the case, it is unnecessary to decide this because, in order to bring himself within Grahame v. Grahame20, the plaintiff must also shew that the second note represented a real advance. In Grahame v. Grahame20, the fact that the amount of the indebtedness fluctuated from time to time and that the amount of the different notes varied, lends some continuance to the view adopted by the learned Vice-Chancellor (I am not saying anything about my opinion as to the correctness of that view), that there was an advance on the occasion of the taking of each note. In the present case, there was simply a renewal and there was no circumstance to support the view that the renewal represented a new advance.\nA continuing guaranty ordinarily means one intended to cover successive advances or credits up to a certain amount, and the continuing character may be implied from the circumstances. The appellant was, however, driven to argue that the guaranty in the present case was a continuing one in a very special sense, namely, a guaranty intended to cover the various vicissitudes and renewals of one advance so as to make it unnecessary to get the guarantor\u2019s consent to such dealings with the debtor, but there is nothing in the terms of this guaranty or in the circumstances to shew that this was the intention.\nThe guaranty here is as follows:\u2014\nI hereby guarantee advances to my son up to $10,000.\nJOHN FERGUSON.\nAnd letter:\u2014\nI beg to confirm my guaranty to you to the extent of $10,000, if necessary, as per your wire to me.\nYours truly,\nJOHN FERGUSON.\nAnother case relied upon by the appellant was the First National Bank of Antigo v. Wunderlich[21], a decision of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin. The effective part of the guaranty was as follows:\u2014\nWe, the undersigned, hereby guarantee the payment of all future sums of money advanced by you to J.N.S., and guarantee the payment of all notes executed by him to said First National Bank, for loans or sums advanced to him in any amount not to exceed the sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).\nThis guaranty was clearly continuing and expressly covered successive notes, and it was accordingly held that the guaranty covered the renewal notes which were sued on, independently of any question as to extension of time on the earlier notes.\nI am of opinion that the judgment appealed from is right and that the appeal must be dismissed.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Gould & McDonald.\nSolicitors for the respondents: McGaughey & McGaughey.\n[1] 12 Cl. & F. 109, 119.\n[2] [1912] 2 K.B. 72, 83.\n[3] [1913-14] Sess.

The auxiliary truck was not connected with the braking apparatus of the car under which it was placed whereby the braking efficiency was diminished by one-half or more. On approaching Fairville the train had to be taken apart and one of the engines backed five cars, including the one next it with the auxiliary truck, on a siding where said engine was detached without the air-brakes being first released and the hand-brakes applied as required by a rule of the company. The engine then went on the main line but the cars, though the brakes on the foremost were applied, ran down and struck the cab causing the engineer's death. In an action by his widow for damages at common law and under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\":\u2014\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Appeal Division (45 N.B. Rep. 452; 40 D.L.R. 437) Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that the use of an auxiliary truck is not evidence of a defective system and there was no other evidence thereof; that the accident was due to placing the car with said truck next the engine thus diminishing the braking efficiency and in detaching the engine on the siding without first attending to the brakes both of which are forbidden by the rules, and that these were acts of employees, fellow servants of the deceased, and could not be imputed to the company; the liability of the company, therefore, was limited to the damages that could be recovered under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act.\"\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick[1], maintaining the verdict awarding the plaintiff $12,000 damages at the trial.\nThe facts are stated in the above head-note.\nTilley K.C. for the appellant.\nDaniel Mullin K.C. for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I concur with my brother Mignault.\nIdington J. (dissenting)\u2014There was evidence adduced which amply supported the finding of the jury that the equipment of the car in question was, having regard to the operation of the shunting of cars which led to the accident in question, so defective as to have been likely to, and did, produce the result complained of.\nIt was neither self-evident nor established that the said result was due to the negligence of any fellow employee or workman, and expressly found by the jury that it was not.\nIf the appellant was entitled to be relieved under the doctrine of common employment, it devolved upon it under such circumstances to demonstrate such defence by evidence, and in that it failed.\nSuch attempts to do so as were made either failed of proof, or were directed to matters that did not reach so far as to cover the actual cause of the defective equipment, by reason of want of an efficient handbrake, and trace its non-existence to the neglect of any fellow servant.\nThe duty of inspection of brakes seems to have been confined to the air-brakes, and no one seems to have had the duty of seeing that the hand-brakes were efficient for such an emergency as was occasioned by the need for the shunting operation in question and therewith the case of a car with a truck upon which it could not operate effectively. Who was to blame for that? If there was neglect on the part of any such person it was not proven.\nI think, therefore, the only defence set up resting upon the doctrine of common employment fails.\nPrim\u00e2 facie the defective condition of the car in question rendered the appellant responsible.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014I am, with great respect, unable to perceive in this case any evidence of breach of statutory duty, defective system or operation, or failure to furnish and maintain proper equipment such as would render the defendants liable at common law. On the other hand, negligence and breach of rules on the part of the defendant's servants are so patent that the findings of the jury negativing them can only be adequately characterized as clearly perverse. These findings must be entirely disregarded.\nAssuming that the collision happened not owing to failure to back the cars placed on the Fairville siding clear of the main track, as Mr. Tilley suggested, but, as the plaintiff contends and the jury must have found, owing to their having moved down towards the main track after the engines were detached, there can be no doubt that the primary cause of the collision or \"side swipe,\" which resulted in the death of the plaintiff's husband, was the neglect of the train crew to obey the company's air brakes rule No. 7:\n* * * If cars are to be detached from a train or engine the air-brakes must be released and hand-brakes immediately applied on train before same are detached.\nNotwithstanding the equivocal use of the word \"train\" in the last line of this sentence, the meaning of the rule is reasonably clear, at all events in the case\u2014such as this was\u2014of cars to be detached from an engine. It is on the cars so to be detached that the hand-brakes must be applied before the engine is removed.\nThe brakes were not applied before the engines were detached, with the result that the cars, which were left on the siding with a slight incline, moved down towards the main track so rapidly that the corner of the foremost car caught the side of the cab in which the plaintiff's husband was as his engine moved back along the main line.\nAs the cars started to move down the siding towards the main track the brakesman in charge applied the hand-brakes on the foremost car, which had been next to the engine before it was detached and was proceeding, as was proper, also to apply them on the second car of the \"train\" when the accident occurred. The brakes on the first car were insufficient to stop the train. There is evidence that had they been of full efficiency they would have sufficed. Their efficiency at the most was 50% and there is some evidence that it was even less. The jury has found that this defective equipment was a cause of the accident, and I am not disposed to quarrel with the view, which has prevailed in the provincial courts, that, taking their verdict as a whole, it implies a finding that its presence on the train next to the engine amounted to negligence. For the plaintiff it is maintained that this negligence was of such a character that it must be imputed to the defendant itself and that as to it the defence of common employment is not open.\nSo far as appears the car in question was in good condition when it was started on its journey to St. John laden with frozen meat intended for transatlantic shipment from that port. It seems reasonably clear that it was necessary to have this freight reach St. John with all possible expedition. En route the rear truck of the car became unfit for further service and if the car was to proceed it was necessary to replace it. It was replaced with what is known as an auxiliary truck which cannot be connected with the braking system of the car. The brakes, however, can be, and, according to the evidence, they were in fact so arranged as to operate on the wheels of the remaining front truck. Hence their partial efficiency.\nThe change of trucks was made at Greenville in the State of Maine, through which the car was proceeding in bond. At that point only an auxiliary truck could be provided, and the evidence is that transhipment there of the freight to another car would have entailed three days' delay owing to the necessity of obtaining authority from Washington, D.C., to break the bonding seals. The train afterwards passed Brownville, also in the State of Maine, where there are shops and an ordinary truck with brakes attached might have been substituted for the auxiliary truck, but a delay of thirty-six hours would be involved in this operation. The same thing might have been done at McAdam Junction in the Province of New Brunswick after the train had crossed the international boundary, or the load could there have been transhipped to another car which would involve a delay of six hours. The responsible officials, however, thought that even this delay would have been unjustifiable and allowed the train to proceed with the auxiliary truck. Allowing for the car in question and two others with defective brakes, the braking capacity of the train was stil over the 90% prescribed by the defendants' rules and of course exceeded the 85% prescribed by an order of the Board of Railway Commissioners. But the car in question was wrongly placed or allowed to remain next to the engine when the train left McAdam Junction, in direct violation of the company's rule No. 25 (a):\n* * * More than two consecutive brakes must not be cut out on a freight train and none on the car next the engine which must always have a quick action triple in good working order.\nHad this car not been in that position\u2014had a car with brakes of full efficiency been next to the engine\u2014 when the brakesman set the brakes on the foremost car of the train of detached cars at the Fairville siding it would probably have been held and the accident would thus have been avoided.\nThere is no evidence of defective system, and a perusal of the record has satisfied me that no such issue was present to the minds of the court, the jury, or counsel, at the trial. Had it been raised, the learned Chief Justice who tried the action would undoubtedly have submitted to the jury some question appropriate to elicit a finding upon it. He did not do so. I am certainly not prepared to hold that under no circumstances should a freight car on which a truck becomes disabled en route be permitted to proceed to its destination with an auxiliary truck. Whether it should or should not must depend on the nature of the freight, the degree of urgency in its transmission, and other circumstances, upon all of which the responsible officials of the railway company on the spot must exercise their judgment. In the present case the judgment of these officials may have been erroneous\u2014they may even have grossly neglected their duty\u2014but such mistake or neglect, if any, was that of fellow employees of the plaintiff's deceased husband and cannot be imputed to the company itself, so that such common employment would not afford a defence to a claim based on it. The law on this branch of the case is fully discussed in the judgment delivered in this court in the comparatively recent appeals in Bergklint v. Western Canada Power Co.[2]. The duty was of such a character that its discharge was necessarily deputed to officials along the line of the railway. There is no suggestion in the evidence that the company had employed incompetent officials for this purpose or had failed to provide all material and equipment necessary to enable them to do whatever they might deem requisite or proper. The case was not one of defective original installation or its equivalent, as in Ainslie Mining and Railway Co v. McDougall[3], nor of negligence in allowing a permanent part of a plant to fall into dangerous disrepair, as in Canada Woolen Mills v. Traplin[4], due to a defective system of inspection.\nA master is not bound to give personal superintendence to the conduct of the works, and there are many things which in general it is better for the safety of the workmen that the master should not personally undertake. It is necessary, however, in each case to consider the particular duty omitted, and the providing proper plant, as distinguished from its subsequent care, is especially within the province of the master rather than of his servants. Toronto Power Co. v. Paskwan,[5].\nIf there was any negligence in sending forward the car in question with an auxiliary truck it was in the \"subsequent care,\" rather than in the \"providing\" of proper plant\u2014it was in the discharge of a duty naturally devolving on the person or persons to whom the company was entitled, and, indeed, from the very necessity of the case, compelled to entrust it. Wilson v. Merry[6].\nNo doubt the placing of the car with defective brakes next to the engine or allowing it to remain there when the train left McAdam Junction was clearly a direct violation of Rule 25 (a); but it was equally clearly the act of a servant of the company to whom the discharge of the duty of seeing that such a car was not so placed was properly entrusted. The same may be said of the failure to \"card\" the car as defective.\nIn no aspect of the case can I discover any evidence which would justify a finding of negligence imputable to the defendant itself as distinguished from its employees\u2014negligence consisting of breach of a duty which it could not delegate so as to relieve itself of responsibility at common law for its discharge\u2014 negligence to which the defence of common employment would not afford an answer.\nI would, therefore, restrict the plaintiff's recovery to the sum of $2,000 under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act,\" to which her right is now admitted, as it was in the provincial appellate court. The appellant is entitled, should it see fit to exact them, to its costs in this court and the Appellate Division. But, as the company did not admit liability under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" for $2,000 in its plea, or make any tender of that amount, or pay it into court, the plaintiff should have her costs of the action down to and inclusive of the judgment at the trial.\nBrodeur J. (dissenting)\u2014I. concur with Mr. Justice Idington.\nMignault J.\u2014I have given to this case my most serious and anxious consideration, and have carefully read the evidence, but I cannot come to the conclusion that the judgment appealed from was rightly decided.\nThere is really no dispute or contradiction in the evidence as to the material facts: The respondent's husband, Justus G. Cheeseman, was an engineer in the employ of the appellant, and on the 21st February, 1917, was in charge of a locomotive which, with another locomotive of the appellant, in charge of one Kaine, was hauling, on that night, a train of forty-seven freight cars from McAdam, N.B., to West St. John, Cheeseman's locomotive being the second, and Kaine's the first. The train was a regular freight train, but was some hours late; it carried a consignment of frozen meat to be transhipped at St. John to Europe, and apparently was proceeding with all possible haste. The car which came into collision with Cheeseman's locomotive was a box car, No. 67639 C.R.I.M.P., and on its way from Montreal had sustained damage to its rear truck, near Greenville, Maine, necessitating the removal of this truck, and its replacing by an auxiliary truck. The latter truck was not connected with the brakes, but the front truck was, and the evidence of the assistant superintendent, David H. Ryan, is that the hand brake connected with the front truck was found, after the accident, wound up and in good condition, but the braking capacity of the car was diminished by at least fifty per cent. The train was made up at McAdam, and car No. 67639 was placed immediately behind Cheeseman's engine. On the way, near Fairville, the train was stalled on an up grade, and even with the aid of the locomotive of the Boston train, which had come up behind, could not be moved, and in the effort to move it, the coupling between the fifth and sixth cars broke, so it was decided to bring the five first cars into Fairville and to return for the rest of the train. At Fairville, the conductor, Sullivan, had the five cars backed on No. 1 siding\u2014how far they were backed being somewhat uncertain, the conductor thinking it was three or four car lengths, but it is possible they were left nearer the switch\u2014and then the engines were uncoupled from the cars and went down to the main line, the conductor following them to the switch. Sullivan directed the brakesman, O'Leary, to get on top of the cars and to set the hand brakes. O'Leary states that he wound up the brake on the first car, after the engines were uncoupled, and then went on to the second car, but the evidence of Mr. Ryan\u2014 who arrived on the scene about an hour after the accident\u2014shews that he did not wind its brakes. O'Leary noticed, when he was on the first car, that the cars were moving, and he is the only witness who saw that they were moving, but his memory seems hazy on this point, so it is difficult to say whether it was merely the slack between the cars easing off, or whether they started down the siding on account of a slight down grade. At all events car No. 67639 struck the side of Cheeseman's locomotive, which was then backing up the main line, bending in the cab, so that the engineer was pinned in and so severely scalded by escaping steam that he died a couple of days later.\nThe respondent, Cheeseman's widow, acting for herself and her four young children, sued the appellant both under the New Brunswick \"Workmen's Compensation Act,\" and under chapter 79 of the New Brunswick Consolidated Statutes, 1903, embodying the provisions 'of \"Lord Campbell's Act,\" claiming $20,000 damages.\nThe appellant admitted its liability under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" for the full amount allowed by the Act, $2,000, but denied liability under \"Lord Campbell's Act.\"\nThe case was tried before Chief Justice McKeown and a jury and a verdict was rendered for $12,000, for which sum (including the $2,000 admitted under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act\"), judgment was entered. This judgment was affirmed by the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, Hazen C.J. White and Grimmer JJ., White J. taking no part in the judgment. It is from the latter judgment that this appeal is taken.\nThe jury found that Cheeseman's death was not caused by the negligence of any of the employees of the appellant, but that the accident was the result of a defect in the equipment or arrangement of the train, that defect being\nauxiliary truck and defective brakes on said car, the brakes being connected with only one truck, therefore not having sufficient power to hold the cars which ran back and struck the engine on the main line at Fairville No. 1 siding.\nThe jury absolved the deceased from any contributory negligence, and found that there was no negligence on the part of the defendant in the employment and retention of the brakeman O'Leary, and that the latter was not inefficient or incompetent for employment or retention as a brakesman on a freight train. The following question was also put to the jury:\u2014\n7. If you find that there was negligence both on the part of the defendant company and on the part of the deceased as well, whose negligence was the final cause of the accident\u2014in other words, who had the last chance of avoiding the accident?\nTo this the jury answered:\u2014\nCanadian Pacific Railway. Co.\nViewing all the evidence, I am of the opinion that the jury could not reasonably find\u2014if their answer to question 7 be construed as a finding of negligence against the appellant\u2014that the accident was caused by the appellant's negligence as distinguished from the negligence of its employees, the fellow servants of the deceased. Leaving aside the use of an auxiliary truck for car No. 67639 without brake connection, and the placing of this car immediately behind the locomotive, which\u2014if they amount to negligence\u2014are the negligence of the employees of the company, and coming to the real cause of the collision, it was undoubtedly due to the fact that the conductor failed to comply with the following rule of the company, being rule 7 of the air brakes rules:\u2014\nWhen necessary for a train with an engine to stand on a grade for over five minutes, air-brakes must be released and train held by handbrakes. If cars are to be detached from a train or engine, the airbrakes must be released and hand-brakes immediately applied on the train before same are detached.\nSullivan knew that there was an auxiliary truck under the first car, and had he caused the hand-brakes to be set before uncoupling the engines, as it was his duty to do, no accident could have happened, and therefore the negligence of Sullivan alone, and his failure to comply with this rule, was the cause of the five cars moving down the siding and colliding with Cheeseman's engine, so that the latter's death was brought about by the negligence of one of his fellow workmen.\nThere can be no doubt that under these circumstances the defence of common employment is a fatal objection to the respondent's action in so far as it is based on \"Lord Campbell's Act,\" and exclusive of her remedy under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act.\" The object of the latter Act was to give to the workman a remedy where none could be claimed under the common law, the risk of injury through the negligence of a fellow servant being a risk assumed by the workman at common law. Bartonshill Coal Co. v. Reid[7]; Wilson v. Merry[8]. The jury have expressly found that O'Leary was not inefficient or incompetent for employment, and even granting that the braking power of the first car was reduced by the fact that an auxiliary truck, unconnected with the brakes, had been placed under the car, this was not the cause of the accident, which would have been impossible had Sullivan complied with rule 7 and had seen that the hand brakes were applied on the five cars before uncoupling the engines.\nWith all possible deference, it would seem to me somewhat of a mockery to hold the appellant negligent and liable for this accident, when it had done all it could do to render such an accident impossible by expressly ordering that the hand-brakes be applied before the engines are detached, and when no accident could possibly have occurred had this order been complied with.\nThe \"Workmen's Compensation Act\" was adopted, as I have said, to provide a remedy in cases where, on account of the negligence of a fellow servant, no remedy existed at common law. The respondent should have been content with the scale of compensation provided by this Act, the maximum amount of which is conceded to her. When she goes further and also claims damages under \"Lord Campbell's Act,\" her claim is clearly, in the circumstances of this case, defeated by the application of the fellow servant rule.\nMr. Mullin argued that the company had allowed a negligent system to be established in operating its cars, whereby the accident in question was caused, and that therefore the company is liable. There was no evidence of any such system; on the contrary, had the system or rules of the company been followed, the accident could not have occurred.\nIn my opinion the verdict is clearly against the weight of the evidence and should be set aside, and the respondent's action dismissed for anything in excess of the $2,000.00 admitted by the appellant under the \"Workmen's Compensation Act.\"\nMy brother Anglin thinks the respondent should have her costs in the trial court, but should pay those of the appellant in the Appeal Division of New Brunswick Supreme Court and in this court, if the appellant sees fit to exact them. In this I am disposed to concur, but I must say that it deals most liberally with the respondent, who should have been satisfied with the remedy provided for cases like this one by the \"Workmen's Compensation Act,\" liability under which was never denied, but on the contrary expressly admitted by the appellant.\nI would allow the appeal.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Hugh H. McLean.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Daniel Mullin.\n[1] 45 N.B. Rep. 452; 40 D.L.R. 437.\n[2] 50 Can. S.C.R. 39; 54 Can. S.C.R. 285; 34 D.L.R. 467.\n[3] 42 Can. S.C.R. 420.\n[4] 35 Can.

Douglas (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1918: November 7; 1918: November 18.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF NOVA SCOTIA.\nDistress\u2014Rent\u2014Entry\u2014Breaking\u2014Entrance by other than usual mode.\nD. was tenant of one part of a building and B. of the other. The parts were separated by a partition in which was a door at one time used in common, but B. had fastened it with a hook on his side and fitted into it the frame of a second door against which he placed a case of type. A bailiff with a distress warrant against D. for rent could not obtain entrance to his premises by the ordinary mode. He went on the premises occupied by B. and induced him to remove or allow to be removed the case of type and the extra door and then entered D.'s premises by lifting the hook on the door in the partition and opening that door. He levied the distress and in an action by D. claiming damages for illegal distress and trespass:\u2014\nHeld, that B., having the right to remove the obstruction to entrance into the other part of the building, it was immaterial whether he did so himself or allowed the bailiff to do it; and that after such removal entrance to D.'s premises was made without a breaking, and the distress was legal. Gould v. Bradstock (4 Taun. 562) applied.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia[1], affirming the judgment at the trial in favour of the plaintiff.\nThe facts are sufficiently stated in the above head-note.\nBurchell K.C. for the appellants referred to Long v. Clarke[2]; Miller v. Tebb[3]; Gould v. Bradstock[4]. Hall K.C. and McArthur for the respondent cited Nash v. Lucas[5]; Miller v. Curry[6].\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This appeal is one from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banc[7], dismissing an appeal from a judgment of the trial judge but reducing the damages from $2,500 to $1,500.\nThe action was one brought by a tenant against his landlord for, as was alleged, an illegal distress upon his goods in his rented premises, the illegality consisting of a wrongful breaking into by the landlord of the premises.\nA majority of the appeal court upheld the illegality of the distress upon the ground that there had been an illegal breaking into by the landlord of the demised premises in order to distrain for the overdue rent, and that, therefore, he was liable in the action for trespass brought.\nThe facts are not in dispute. The premises leased to the plaintiff were divided off from other premises leased to one Brody, by a wooden partition in which there was a swinging door which had at one time been used by the occupants of both premises to pass from one to the other.\nBrody had put a simple latch on his side of the door which could be lifted with one's finger and had also placed, another loose or unfastened door up against the latched door, and a case of type against the loose or unfastened door. When the landlord came to distrain he asked Brody to move his case of type, take away the second door and unhook the latch on the first door, and it was held by the Chief Justice, Ritchie and Mellish JJ. that these things, having been done by Brody at the landlord's request, the latter was guilty of an illegal entry in pushing open the unlatched door and entering into the premises of the plaintiff tenant. It is right to say that Mr. Justice Ritchie, who was a party to the judgment, expressed himself as concurring with \"some doubt\" while Mr. Justice Chisholm, with whose judgment Mr. Justice Longley concurred, dissented in a very vigorous and, if I may be permitted to say so, a very luminous judgment.\nThe question before us being reduced down to the one question whether there was an illegal breaking into the premises by the landlord, I am of opinion, after looking into the authorities on the question of illegal entry, that there was none such in the present case.\nBrody, the occupier of the adjoining tenement divided from the one in question by the wooden partition with the swinging door latched on Brodie's side, had, in my opinion, a perfect right to remove the case of type he had placed against the loose door, then to remove the door itself which was not fastened, and finally to lift the latch on the partition door. It does not matter in the least whether he did each and all of these acts of his own mere motion or at the instance and request of McKay the landlord. He had a perfect right to do what he did. When these obstructions were removed the way was open and clear for the landlord to push the door open, enter and distrain.\nI am quite unable to follow the Chief Justice's reasoning that, assuming Brody to have the right to remove his own case of type in his own tenement, and his own loose and unfastened door, and then to lift his own latch, which he himself had placed on the swinging door on his own side, because he did so at McKay's request,\nit must all be regarded as of the landlord,\nand was, he thinks,\nclearly such an entry as could not be justified for the purpose of distress.\nOn the contrary, I think that Brody only did what he had an absolute right to do whether spontaneously or at McKay's instance and which, when done, enabled the landlord to enter by pushing open the swinging unfastened door and execute his distress.\nAny other person than the landlord who entered to distrain would have committed a trespass, not the landlord who entered without breaking any latch or fastening, simply pushing the swinging door open for the lawful purpose of levying a distress.\nI think the modern case of Long v. Clarke[8], directly in point in this case.\nThere the plaintiff, being unable to get into the house by the front entrance, went into the next house; from there he went into the yard at the back, and then got over a wall (said to vary in height from 5 to over 10 feet) into the yard at the back of the plaintiff's house, and entered the house by means of a window (the report does not say whether it was closed or not, but the inference from the judgment is that it was open) and distrained on the goods. Held by the Court of Appeal to be a lawful distress. Lord Esher M.R. says, at page 121:\u2014\nIn this case we are dealing with a landlord's bailiff distraining for rent. What is the ordinary law applicable to such a case? It gives a right to the landlord to do that which, if any other person did it, would be a trespass, and the question is whether what has been done in the present case is within what is permitted by the law of distress. When a landlord goes into a house to distrain, whether the door be open or shut, he does that which, in any other person, would be a trespass, and it is just the same if he merely walks across the land to the front door. The sole question is what limitations on the right of the landlord to go on the premises and distrain the law imposes on him. He cannot go into any building or into any house if he can only do so by breaking into it. He can go in at the door, which is the most obvious way of entering; but further, he can get in by a window if it is left open. There is no trespass in doing either of these acts, because he does not break in. So it is incorrect to say, as has been suggested, that the landlord cannot go into the house if he finds a hole in the side of it, and for the same reason, that in so entering he is not breaking in. This law is applicable to any building into which the landlord wants to get for the purpose of distraining, such as a warehouse, a stable, or a barn. Thus, supposing he enters a curtilage without breaking anything, still he cannot break into any stable or building within the curtilage which is locked.\nIt is unnecessary for me to make further quotations from the judgments of the learned judges in that case. They are all to the same effect as that from Lord Esher and are, to my mind, conclusive on the point now before us.\nI would, however, cite the case of Ryan v. Shilcock[9], where it was held the breaking must be such a breaking as is also equivalent to a forcible entry; and that of Gould v. Bradstock[10], where the landlord himself occupied a room over that of his tenant beneath him, divided by a flooring of boards nailed on rafters, in which Sir James Mansfield justified the entry of a landlord to distrain on his tenant below him in taking up a portion of the flooring between the apartments, and entering to distrain through this aperture so made.\nI think the appeal must be allowed with costs throughout and the action dismissed.\nIdington J.\u2014I am, in one respect, in the same frame of mind as the learned trial judge that I have some doubt as to the legality of this act complained of, but, with the greatest respect, I submit that such frame of mind properly directed should, in this case, have resulted in a dismissal of the plaintiff's (now respondent's) action with costs.\nI, therefore, am of the opinion that the court below which, on a careful analysis of what is expressed, seems to have been in the like predicament, should have come to the conclusion that no court has a right to find a man guilty of wrongdoing unless the law clearly declares him to be so when regard is had to the relevant facts.\nIt seems to me that the case of Gould v. Bradstock[11], which seems to go a great deal further than needed to maintain a dismissal of this respondent's action, stands yet as good law, though I find it was not decided by the great Chief Justice Mansfield, as counsel inadvertently assured me it was, when I felt puzzled by the expressions quoted, and hence prompted to inquire.\nEverything Mr. Brody did to facilitate the landlord's entry was perfectly legal up to and including the lifting of the hook he had placed there for his own reasons and to serve his own uses. How doing that which a man had an absolute right to do, if he saw fit, can be made in law to demonstrate illegality in someone else's act beyond that, is what I am unable to understand. With the very greatest respect I submit that to so hold only confuses two things, one legal and the other of an undecided quality now to be passed upon, on its merits, and tends to further confusion of thought in trying to solve, or solving, the actual problem when reached.\nThe problem is, when otherwise approached, reduced to the question of the legality of a landlord entering by a door he presumably had placed there for common use by his tenants, or by himself and the tenant in question, as an easy mode of ingress and egress and requiring no force to open it and enter.\nIn the situation thus created that door was as much an outer door of the premises in question as any other door. To use the illustration I presented to counsel for consideration in the course of the argument, suppose the part of the appellant's premises occupied by Brody had been dedicated by him as a public street, would it be contended such a door was not an outer door? I submit not.\nIt clearly was a door in the outer wall of the premises leased by the landlord to the tenant, and it might well have happened that the landlord himself, instead of Brody, might have become the occupant either actively using it or merely as landlord or owner of vacant premises.\nCan it be said that in such an event he could not have used the door in question, never fastened or locked in any way by the tenant in question, as a means of entry to distrain?\nI think it would be much easier to support as legal such an entry, than the raising of a window partly open as in Crabtree v. Robinson[12], or the coming down through a skylight as in Miller v. Tebb[13], after crossing another person's premises, or analogous cases, for which ample authority is shewn hardly consistent with the judgment appealed from.\nThe trap-door in the roof in question in the Ontario case relied upon could not in principle be called a door in an outer wall.\nI should be averse to refining away the law as already established by many decisions, even if that law is the result of over-refinement, to help a plaintiff with no better case than respondent happens to have here.\nAnd if any doubt, I repeat it should have been resolved at the trial as against him and hence so decided here.\nThe further ground was taken in argument that there was no tenancy. If so then I fail to see what ground respondent has to stand upon unless and until he established a better title to the goods in question than he did.\nBut it seems idle to contend in face of all that transpired and is expressed in the correspondence between the parties, that he had not become a tenant of the appellant at the old well-known rental.\nIt seems rather late, after seemingly abandoning such a ground below, to start it here.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the action be dismissed.\nAnglin J.\u2014More than a century ago a landlord occupied an apartment over a mill demised to his tenant from which it was divided only by a flooring of boards nailed on rafters. In order to distrain for rent the landlord took up a portion of this flooring in his own apartment and entered through the aperture thus made. Sir James Mansfield held that his interest in the floor entitled him to raise it without incurring liability for trespass, and that the entry into his tenant's premises through the opening so made was lawful. Gould v. Bradstock[14].\nAlthough I do not find that this decision has been followed in any subsequent reported case in the English courts, it has never been questioned and its authority is recognised by such eminent writers on the Law of Landlord and Tenant as Foa, 5th ed., page 525, and Bullen (on Distress), 2nd ed., p. 154. See, too, 11 Hals. Laws of England 163. Mr. Foa points out that a perpendicular partition between the demised premises and another tenement in the same building formed by boards nailed upon studding would stand in the same position. The boards, if removable without injury to the demised premises, may be likewise taken off without trespass by the lawful occupant of the adjoining tenement.\nThe facts in the case at bar fully appear in the judgments rendered in the provincial appellate court. Assuming any controverted facts\u2014and there are practically none\u2014in the plaintiff's favour, I am unable to distinguish this case from Gould v. Bradstock[15]. On its authority it would appear that his interest in them entitled Brody, the tenant of the adjoining premises, to remove the board covering, to raise the hook and to push open the door, which it is not pretended would do any injury to the plaintiff's premises. Whether those acts were all done by Brody at the instance of the landlord or by the bailiff with Brody's concurrence or authority, is, in my opinion, quite immaterial. I see no reason why Brody could not authorise the landlord or his bailiff to do all or any of them as his agent, and it seems to be a fair inference from the evidence that some of these acts were done by Brody himself, and the others with his authority by the landlord's bailiff.\nIf an aperture was thus lawfully made the landlord could certainly enter through it to make his distress just as he might enter through an open window or a hole in an outer wall. The one thing that a distraining landlord must not do is to break into the premises. Long v. Clarke[16]. The case of Nash v. Lucas[17], relied upon by the learned Chief Justice of Nova Scotia is, I think, with respect, clearly distinguishable. As Mr. Justice Chisholm points out the opening of the window, the entry into the house through it, and the unfastening of the locked door, all done in that case by the landlord's direction, were acts of trespass.\nApplying the principle of the decision in Gould v. Bradstock[18], there was no breaking in in this case. Apart from that authority, however, I confess I should have been inclined to the contrary view. I cannot regard the raising of the hook on the partition door in this case as in any sense equivalent to the raising of a latch on the front door of demised premises (the usual mode of entry) permitted because the fair inference is that it was thus secured in order to keep it closed and not for the purpose of keeping persons out. Ryan v. Shilcock[19]. The partition door had long ceased to be a usual mode of entry into the demised premises. It was, in my opinion, indistinguishable from a closed window. The landlord can justify having opened it only as an act done by Brody or by his authority.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs throughout.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I cannot see how we can distinguish the present case from the case of Gould v. Bradstock18.\nFor the reasons given by my brother Anglin I would allow this appeal with costs of this court and of the courts below and would dismiss plaintiff's action with costs.\nMignault J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed. The respondent occupied as a tenant a store belonging to the appellant, which was separated from another store in the same building, rented to one Brody, by a partition in which a door had been placed, and this door had, for a while, served as a means of communication between the two stores. Some time before the distress of which the respondent complains, Brody had placed a hook in this door on his side whereby the door could be fastened, and had also put up an outer door, on his side, which had been closed by means of nails or screws. These nails or screws had been removed by Brody on a previous occasion, when it was necessary to enter the respondent's store to close an opening through which the snow came in, and the outer door had been merely placed against the other door without being fastened. At the time of the distress, Brody removed, at the request of the appellant, the outer door, and the hook on the inner door was lifted either by himself or with his permission. In my opinion Brody had a perfect right to unhook the door or to allow it to be unhooked and consequently the appellant, in entering the respondent's premises by this door, was not guilty of trespass, and the distress for rent due by the respondent was not illegally made. Under the authorities cited by my brother Anglin, I am clearly of opinion that the action of the respondent is unfounded.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be allowed and the action dismissed with costs in this court and in the courts below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: A.

Walker, (1918) 57 S.C.R. 493\nDate: 1918-11-18\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway Company (Defendant) Appellant;\nand\nJoseph Walker (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1918: October 18, 21, 22; 1918: November 18.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN.\nNegligence\u2014Railways\u2014Master and Servant\u2014Switch stand\u2014\"Fixed signal\"\u2014\"Knowledge.\"\nThe respondent was an engineer on an east-bound train which collided on a west-bound track with another train through the improper setting of a switch. He alleged that he could not see the switch lights from his side of the engine owing to clouds of escaping steam and drifting snow obstructing his vision and that he passed them, on his fireman's assurance that they were \"all right,\" without feeling any motion to cause him to realize that he had diverged to the west-bound track. Rule 401 of the Rule Book of the appellant company provided that \"engineers must know the indication of all fixed signals before passing them,\" and a \"fixed signal\" was thus defined: \"A signal of fixed location indicating a condition affecting the movement of a train.\"\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal (11 Sask. L.R. 192), affirming on equal division the judgment of the trial court with a jury, against the company, confirmed, Davies C.J. and Duff J. dissenting.\nPer Idington and Brodeur JJ.:\u2014Upon the evidence, the signals on the target of a switch stand are not \"fixed signals\" within the meaning of Rule 401. Davies C.J. contra.\nPer Anglin J.:\u2014The words \"must know\" do not import knowledge acquired by the use of the engineer's own eyes to the exclusion of every other source of knowledge however reliable.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1], affirming, on equal division, the judgment of the trial court with a jury which maintained the plaintiff's action.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported. Tilley K.C. and Reycraft K.C. for the appellant.\nP. M. Anderson for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014This was an action brought by the plaintiff, respondent, to recover damages for injuries sustained by him in a head-on collision which occurred between the east-bound express, of which he was the engineer in charge, going out from Moose Jaw to Regina, and the west-boun d\u2019express coming in to Moose Jaw, about a mile east of that station. The collision was the result of the plaintiff's train improperly getting across from its proper track to the track of the west-bound express, and the broad question to be determined is whether the plaintiff contributed by his negligence to the collision which caused his injuries. The jury found in his favour and awarded him $15,820 damages, made up of special damages $2,320, and general damages $13,500, and the trial judge entered judgment for that amount.\nOn appeal to the Appeal Court of Saskatchewan the court was equally divided. The Chief Justice and Elwood J.A. being to allow the appeal and dismiss the action, while Newlands J.A. and Lamont J.A. were to dismiss the appeal, so that the judgment in plaintiff's favour stood.\nThis is an appeal from that judgment of the Court of Appeal.\nThe two learned judges of the Court of Appeal, Newlands and Lamont JJ., who supported the judgment in plaintiff's favour, did so on the sole ground that, in their opinion, the switch light was not a \"fixed signal\" according to the rules of the company and that the plaintiff therefore did not break the rule 401 requiring that engineers must know the indications of all fixed signals before passing them.\nNewlands J. says:\u2014\nIt was admitted by counsel on the argument before this court that if a switch light is a \"fixed signal\" the plaintiff, respondent, should not have passed this point without ascertaining that this light was burning, and if so, the colour of it,\nand Lamont J. says:\u2014\nIt was not a question of construing the rule. The rule is clear. It is a question of determining whether or not a disc or light placed on a switch brings it within the rule and this, in my opinion, is a question for the jury.\nThe other two judges held, as did also the trial judge, that it was a fixed light and they pointed out that the plaintiff himself admitted in his evidence that there was nothing to which the definition of a target signal would apply except the disc or target set on a switch stand.\nThere was no difference of opinion in the Court of Appeal as to what the result should be if the switch lights were held to be fixed signals.\nAs to the damages awarded plaintiff, which is made a ground of appeal as being excessive, I am inclined to think them very large and beyond what the evidence justified, but in the view I take of the law and the evidence upon the other points of the case I do not feel it necessary to deal with the question of damages.\nThe essential points on which this appeal must be decided are whether the disc or target on a switch stand is a \"fixed signal\" within the rules, and whether the engineer was justified in passing on the occasion in question the switch signals at points X and Y shewn on the sketch of the railway track at Moose Jaw without knowing the indications they gave would lead the train from No. 3 track, which was its proper track, to No. 2 track, which was the track of the incoming express with which the plaintiff's train collided. The Tri Cities Express, so called, with plaintiff as engineer in charge, left Moose Jaw about 10 p.m. for Regina on the night of the 4th January, 1916.\nThe plaintiff had been running as an engineer over the route for a year and five months previous to this date, and always left the depot at Moose Jaw by the same tracks as on the night of the accident and was well acquainted with defendant's east, yard at Moose Jaw.\nIn my opinion, the trial judge properly charged the jury on the question as to whether the target signal on the switch stand was a \"fixed signal\" or not, but the jury ignored his direction and found, contrary to the evidence, which was all one way, that the switch stand and target signals at X and Y did not comply with the rules defining a target signal. Even Walker himself admitted that there was nothing to which the definition of target signal would apply except the disc or target set on a switch stand. I think in the light of the trial judge's charge to them on this point the finding of the jury that these signals were not \"fixed signals\" was \"perverse,\" and I cannot understand why, after having charged them as he did on the point, the trial judge left the question to them at all.\nA \"fixed signal\" is stated in the rules to be a\nsignal of fixed location indicating a condition affecting the movement of a train.\nNow the target on a switch is of fixed location and admittedly indicates\na condition affecting the movement of a train.\nFor myself I do not entertain a doubt upon the question.\nThat leads us to the second question, whether the engineer was justified in passing the switch signals at points X and Y on the plan of the track without knowing the indications the lights gave that they would lead his train from its proper track No. 3 on to track No. 2, which was the track of the incoming express.\nRule 401 says:\u2014\nthat engineers must know the indications of all fixed signals before passing them.\nThe reason why such imperative language is used is obvious. The lives in many cases of hundreds of innocent passengers may be imperilled by the engineer of an express train ignoring the rule. In the case before us the engineer not only did not know but took everything for granted and did not attempt personally to acquire knowledge of what indications the signal lights upon them gave. He knew all about the incoming express, all about the \"cut-off\" at the switches X and Y which, if improperly set, would carry him over to the west bound express track. He knew the location of these two switches and what the lights upon the target of the switch stand indicated. It appears to me after carefully reading his evidence that he knew everything necessary to be known by an engineer in charge of an express passenger train to induce him to take special precautions before passing these switches X and Y to assure himself beyond doubt and to know, as the rule states,\nthe indications of all fixed signals before passing them.\nIf these signal lights shewed green, then he could safely go straight ahead along his own track, while, if they shewed red, he would know that the switches were set for a divergence to the west-bound main line, in which case, of course, he must stop and have the switches properly set.\nAs a fact, though unknown to plaintiff, signal lights on these two switch stands X and Y shewed red, and consequently the train passed over the cut-off to the west-bound line and proceeded along it some three quarters of a mile until a head-on collision occurredo\nNeither before or when his train passed across from its proper track to the west-bound track or afterwards did the engineer know anything about the lights or what track he was on. He neither looked himself nor did he instruct the fireman to look. He ran his train across to the west-bound track in ignorance, inexcusable, I think, of what the signals indicated.\nThe plaintiff's excuse for not knowing how the switches were set and what the lights on their targets indicated was that he could not see them from his side of the engine as they were on the left, or fireman's side, of it and the wind was blowing the smoke and steam past his, that is, the plaintiff's side of the engine cab. It was a stormy night and one which called for more than ordinary precautions. The train was going very slow, just crawling through the station yard and for about seven car lengths before coming to the switches the fireman, to plaintiff's knowledge, was not looking out. Curiously enough, although, as he says, he had instructed him to watch for the signals on the several switch stands which they had first passed on leaving the station, he did not instruct him to look out for these in question. The plaintiff knew the fireman had ceased to keep a look out when the engine was at least seven car lengths or 140 yards from the switches in question, as Walker himself testifies. The fireman was attending to his fire, plaintiff knew he was so attending. Two paces across the car would have enabled him to see and know for himself whether the lights on the targets of these switch stands entitled him to go on or required him to stop and avoid going over to the west-bound track. But the plaintiff neither took this, what one would think, necessary precaution nor instructed the fireman to look out and see what the signals indicated, and so the train passed across to the wrong track and along it for three-quarters of a mile till it collided with the incoming express. The plaintiff simply ignored rule 401, which said:\u2014\nengineers must know the indications of all fixed signals before passing them.\nBut this man not only did not himself know or find out what the signals indicated before passing them, nor did he instruct the fireman to see although he knew the latter had given up looking out and was attending to his fires for some considerable distance before reaching the signal lights on these two switch stands X and Y. The fact is he took everything for granted, ignored the rule I have quoted and assumed all was right.\nIn the face of the facts I have stated, the perfect knowledge the plaintiff possessed with regard to all the necessary facts relating to this railway yard, the location of the different switches, the indications which the signals on the targets of these switches gave as to the train's movements, &c., the necessity imposed upon him of knowing the indication of all fixed signals before passing them, and the utter ignorance he acknowledges himself to have been in as to the indications of the signal lights on the switches X and Y when he diverged to the west bound track,\u2014I am at a loss to understand how any jury could be found in the face of the judge's charge to them as to what were \"fixed signals\" to say that plaintiff was not guilty of negligence in passing these switches at the time he did and without any knowledge of the indications they gave.\nIn my humble opinion, the plaintiff should have been nonsuited on his own evidence. As he was not, I can only hold the verdict to have been perverse.\nThe excuse put forward that he got what he called a high ball or proceed signal from the switch tender at the station and that this entitled him to assume that the line was safe and the switches all right for him is not, in my judgment, worthy of consideration That he did not believe in it himself is shewn by his own evidence that as they were leaving the station he instructed the fireman \"to keep a sharp look-out\" for the switches, which, he says, he did until the train reached what is shewn on the plan in evidence as the Creek Bridge, when the fireman got down from looking out and said \"all right\". But this place where the fireman got down from looking out was quite a distance from the switches in question, some seven car lengths plaintiff says, and the train was just crawling at a rate of two to four miles an hour. During all this time no one was looking out and the plaintiff simply assumed, without knowing, as the rule required him to do, that the switches were set properly for his train's track. The plaintiff himself, on his evidence, shewed clearly why he was so careless and negligent respecting the indications which the light signals of switches X and Y gave. He relied upon the signal given to him, as he says, by the switch-tender when he was leaving the station.\nQ.\u2014Do you think there was no duty after you passed those switches to see again whether you were on the right track or not?\nA.\u2014No, as long as I had got the signal from that man, whose place and duty it is to line up those switches, and has always done it.\nQ.\u2014That is Mr. Weeler?\nA.\u2014Yes. As long as he gave me the signal that all those switches were lined up, that relieved me.\nQ.\u2014Having got the signal or high ball from the switch-tender at the station?\nA.\u2014Yes.\nQ.\u2014You then felt perfectly warranted in going ahead. A. Yes.\nQ.\u2014Notwithstanding you could not see your track?\nA.\u2014Yes. Because he gave that signal to me to say that those switches were all lined up.\nQ.\u2014Having got the signal from Mr. Weeler on the station, and started on the right track, you would have felt\u2014in consequence of that you would have felt perfectly safe in going on without anything further?\nA. Yes. I did.\nQ.\u2014And there was no further duty cast upon you? A. No.\nQ.\u2014And that was what you relied on? A. Yes.\nHis Lordship:\u2014Why did you tell the fireman to keep an extra look out?\nA.\u2014As an extra precaution.\nThose clear and explicit statements of the plaintiff himself as to why he passed the fixed signals X and Y without knowing what they indicated as to his proceeding or stopping effectually disposed of the other excuses offered by him as to his not crossing the engine cab and seeing for himself what these signals indicated; one of these excuses was that possibly he might, by crossing over, miss seeing a fusee burning or flaring on the track indicating danger. The fact being that he had already sworn positively that remaining in his post on his right hand side of the cab he could see nothing outside on the track because of the wind blowing the smoke and steam on his side of the car. This fusee excuse in the light of his sworn reasons for passing the switch stands without knowing the indications they gave respecting the movements of his train seems to me to be simply an afterthought and a very questionable one at that.\nMy conclusions, after a very full study of the evidence and after hearing the arguments at bar, are that the signals on the target of a switch stand are \"fixed signals,' within the meaning of the rules beyond reasonable doubt, and that the plaintiff, in running his car across the \"cut-off\" at the switch stands X and Y on to the west-bound track, did so in ignorance of what these signals indicated and in careless and negligent assumption that they indicated all was right for him to go ahead on his own proper track because of the signal or high ball, as he called it, he got from the switch-tender when leaving the station; and that, in acting on such unwarranted assumption, he violated rule 401 which required him unless and until he knew what the signals indicated to stop his train and find out; that the train was running at a very slow rate and could be stopped in a moment as he himself said and that there was nothing to justify him in acting as he did upon his unwarranted assumption that the signals indicated all was right for him to proceed; that his duty clearly was if his fireman was busy with his fire in order to get up speed to step across the engine cab before reaching the switch stand and see for himself what their lights indicated, and if anything prevented his doing that to stop the train till he did know whether safety or destruction lay ahead of him.\nI think the appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed.\nIdington J.\u2014The question raised herein of the interpretation and construction of the rules bearing upon the duty of the engineer in charge of a locomotive drawing a train when it involves, as herein, the determination of whether a switch stand in a railway yard constitutes a \"fixed signal\" or not, is of such a technical character as to require expert evidence to assist the learned trial judge in order that he may direct the jury aright.\nNotwithstanding the apparent simplicity of such a phrase as \"movement of a train,\" I am unable to hold that these rules, so far as defining a \"fixed signal\" when using such said phrase, are framed in such plain ordinary language that the learned judge could and must, unaided by such like evidence as I have indicated, direct the jury as to the meaning thereof in the way that the law requires relative to documents framed in plain ordinary language. I take the law to be correctly laid down in Taylor on Evidence, 10th ed., at pp. 45-6, as follows:\u2014\nMatters of great nicety arise in connection with this subject. But the clear general rule is that the construction of all written documents is for the court alone. The construction of these is, as we have said, for the court alone so soon as the true meaning of the words in which they are couched, and the surrounding circumstances, if any, have been ascertained as facts by the jury; and it is the duty of the jury to take the construction from the court, either absolutely., if there be no words to be construed as words of art or phrases used in commerce, and no surrounding circumstances to be ascertained; or conditionally, when those words or circumstances are necessarily referred to them. The term \"written documents\" includes Acts of Parliament, judicial records, deeds, wills, negotiable instruments, agreements and letters. A misconstruction by the court is the proper subject of appeal to a court of error; but a misconstruction by the jury cannot in any way be effectually set right. The effect of the rule consequently is to render the law certain. A marked instance of its application occurs in the case of the construction of the specification of a patent, for, though the interpretation of such an instrument\u2014relating as it does to matters of science and skill\u2014would seem peculiarly adapted to the practical information of jurors, the court must construe it after merely ascertaining from the jury an explanation of technical terms. Again, the construction of all written contracts is for the court.\nThe onus of making appellant's contention in that regard clear rested upon it in order to establish that respondent had been guilty of contributory negligence.\nIt failed at the trial to adduce any evidence save such as elicited by its counsel in the cross-examination of the respondent.\nThat evidence clearly declared that none of the switch stands passed by him in the Moose Jaw yard at the time in question were fixed signals.\nHe had long experience and before that had passed an examination on these rules and acted according to his understanding thereof.\nThe requirements of the rules as to fixed signals, in relation to switch stands in the yard, do not seem to have been observed, for he passed three or four of them in the same yard in his usual manner; which was hardly consistent with a rigid and literal observance of his duties relative to actual \"fixed signals\" well known to be such.\nIndeed, such observance would hardly be practicable in a station yard where many switches had to be passed in the course of shunting trains.\nMoreover, the switch-tender's signal, given respondent, seems to have been something intended to have been done and acted upon in the usual manner, and as if a necessary requirement which he was accustomed to observe; clearly in disregard of the switch stands being treated as fixed signals.\nThe incident of that non-observance strongly suggests that the switch stands in the yard were not considered by any one in appellant's service as fixed signals.\nThere were two trials in this case, and if such a vital point as raised herein really in fact seriously intended to be determined I should have expected the appellant to have met it fully and fairly and to have put beyond doubt the true solution of the question involved by proving that switch stands were in fact part of that which expert railwaymen understood by the ambiguous term in question.\nThe learned trial judge submitted the question to the jury and they answered adversely to appellant.\nI am not surprised at the result in face of the evidence. Nor, leaving aside the propriety of the submission of the question, can I see how the appellant can complain.\nIndeed, it seems to me that the plain duty of the appellant was to have proved conclusively that such switch stands were fixed signals which every engineer knew and in relation to which the respondent was bound to observe duties relative thereto as such. Failing to do so, or even make an attempt to aid the court in the way the law as laid down in the above quotation, and much more, from, Taylor indicates, I cannot see how it can now complain.\nHad it done so and proved as it now claims instead of the contrary as its counsel seems to have intentionally or otherwise done, I could see some ground of complaint.\nThe minor inferences and arguments based on suggestions of other neglect on the part of respondent were clearly all for the jury and its verdict final.\nI think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDuff J. (dissenting).\u2014I am to allow this appeal with costs.\nAnglin J \u2014The plaintiff was the engineer on an east-bound train of the defendants running from Moose Jaw to Saskatoon. On a cold and windy winter night this train collided on the west-bound track with a westbound train about a mile and a half east of Moose Jaw. It is now admitted that the plaintiff's train had been diverted to the west-bound track owing to the misplacing of two switches controlling a \"cut-off\" or crossover track connecting the two main tracks, at a point about three-quarters of a mile west of the place of collision and that this constituted actionable negligence imputable to the defendants which renders them liable unless the collision should be ascribed to fault or negligence of the plaintiff.\nIf the mechanism of the switches in question was not out of order, of which there is no evidence\u2014and no such suggestion was made at the trial\u2014set as they were for diverging tracks they must have shewn red lights-Had he seen or been otherwise informed that the switch stands shewed red lights the plaintiff would have known that should his train proceed it would pass from the east-bound to the west-bound track. He was under orders to proceed on the east-bound track.\nThe defendants assert that in passing these red switch lights, as he did, not merely was the plaintiff grossly negligent but that he broke a definite rule of the company sanctioned by the Board of Railway Commissioners. They also charge him with further neglect in having failed to discover that he was on the westbound track before the collision became inevitable.\nIn reply he asserts that from the right hand side of the engine cab\u2014admittedly \"the engineer's side\" on which he says it was his duty to be\u2014he was unable, owing to clouds of escaping steam and drifting snow obstructing his vision, to see the switch lights in question, which were on the left-hand side of the track, and that he passed them without being aware that they were set for the \"cut-off\" and did so in reliance on his fireman's assurance that they were \"all right\"\u2014an assurance which he the more readily accepted (as he maintains he was entitled to do) because he had already received from the switch tender what is known as a \"high ball\" signal to the same effect. In his evidence he says that owing to the slow speed of his train he did not feel any motion that would cause him to realise that he had diverged at the \"cut-off,\" and that, after it had passed to the west-bound track, although he was looking out, the clouds of steam and drifting snow prevented his noticing that there was a parallel track to his right which would not have been there had he been on the east-bound track.\nThe plaintiff's fireman was killed in the collision, and the only evidence of the circumstances preceding it is given by the plaintiff himself. The defendants offered no evidence. Upon a charge not objected to at the trial, or now, a jury has found that there was no negligence on the part of the plaintiff. This implies that they believed the plaintiff's evidence and found all controverted matters of fact bearing upon that issue in his favour. They accepted as sufficient his explanation of his inability to see the indicating lights of the switches set against him and of his failure to realise that his train had passed to and was proceeding on the west-bound track. These were matters which it was within their province to pass upon and I am not prepared to hold that their implied findings in regard to them were so clearly perverse that we should set them aside.\nIt follows that, unless the defendants can establish that the plaintiff disregarded some rule which he was bound to obey at all hazards\u2014a rule so imperative that failure to comply with it would conclusively debar him from recovery regardless of any considerations of negligence or reasonable excuse\u2014the judgment for the plaintiff cannot be disturbed. The defendants submit that rule 401 is such a rule and that it was disregarded by the plaintiff. The relevant part of that rule reads as follows.\u2014\nEngineers must know the indications of all fixed signals before passing them.\nConceding this rule to be imperative, the plaintiff answers the defendants' contention based upon it by averring that the switch stand signals which he passed although set against him were not \"fixed signals,\" and that if they were, he complied with the requirements of the rule properly interpreted.\nOn the first of these two questions there has been much divergence of judicial opinion The trial judge asked the jury to determine it and acted upon their negative answer. The Court of Appeal would appear to have regarded it as a question proper to be dealt with by the court. The four learned appellate judges were equally divided in opinion upon it, Newlands and Lamont JJ. agreeing with the construction placed by the jury on the term \"fixed signals\" and the Chief Justice of Saskacthewan and Elwood J. holding that switch stand signals are \"fixed signals\" within the definition of that term contained in the book of rules.\nIt would almost seem to be a hardship for the plaintiff should he, against his sworn statement of his understanding to the contrary, which the jury must have accepted and without any expert or other evidence opposed thereto, be held bound, (at the peril of being held blameworthy should he act on the contrary view), by an adverse interpretation of this term as used in rule 401, as to which learned judges have disagreed. While there is a great deal to be said for the opposite view, with such light as we now have on the question I would be inclined to agree with the contention put forward by the defendants, substantially for the reasons stated by Elwood J.[2] I am satisfied moreover, that without any such special rule as that under consideration, an engineer's disregard of a switch stand signal or indicator set against him, whether it be technically a \"fixed signal\" or not, would disentitle him to recover for injury sustained in an ensuing collision, if he saw, or if, under the circumstances, it should be held that but for his own fault he would have seen that it was set against him. But I find it unnecessary, and on this record I think it would be unwise, to express a definite or concluded opinion on the question whether switch stand signals are or are not \"fixed signals.\"\nAssuming that they are, whether the plaintiff did or did not comply with rule 401 depends, in my opinion, on the meaning to be attached to the words \"must know.\" In the strict sense knowledge is, of course incompatible with error. One cannot \"know\" that which is not the fact. But nobody contends that rule 401 means that fault on the part of an engineer will be conclusively established should he proceed under a mistaken conviction as to the indication of a switch light although he had exhausted every means humanly possible to ascertain the fact. \"Must know\" does not import that there must be a certainty which it is quite beyond our finite and fallible powers to attain\u2014does not imply that mistake however caused will always be inexcusable. The defendant's contention is not that. It is that the engineer is obliged to have a conviction that the indication of every fixed signal entitles him to proceed, based on personal ocular observation, before he does so; that if he proceeds without \"knowledge\" thus acquired he does so at his peril If the words \"must know\" import exclusively, as the defendants contend, know edge acquired from the testimony of the engineer's own eyes, rule 401 admittedly was not obeyed. If, on the other hand, information on which a reasonably prudent man would, under the circumstances, have been justified in believing that there was certainty, as great as the limitations of human fallibility permit should exist, that the switches in question were set in his favour suffices as the foundation of the \"knowledge\" of that fact demanded by the rule, and the jury was satisfied, as it must have been, that the plaintiff had information of that character, his right to recover cannot be successfully impugned although the switch signals were in fact set adversely to him and personal observation, if feasible, might have so informed him.\nI have selected the following definitions of the active verb \"to know\" from standard English dictionaries:\u2014\nTo have cognizance of (something) through observation, inquiry or information; to be aware or apprised of (F. savoir, Ger. wissen) to become cognizant of, learn through information or inquiry, ascertain, find out:\nTo be congnizant, conscious, or aware of (a fact), to be informed, to have learned; to apprehend (with the mind), to understand. With various constructions: a. with dependent statement, usually introduced by that. Murray.\nTo be convinced or satisfied regarding the truth or reality of; to be informed of; as, to know things from information. The Imperial.\nTo perceive or understand as being fact or truth (primary definition) and, in a general sense to have definite information or intelligence about; be acquainted with either through the report of others or through personal ascertainment, observation, experience or intercourse. The Century.\nTo perceive or apprehend as true; to recognize as valid or as a fact on the basis of information possessed, or of one's understanding or intelligence, to have mental certitude in regard to, together with a clear comprehension of; to perceive with understanding and conviction. Webster.\nA moment's reflection will suggest many material truths within our certain knowledge of which, although not founded upon any testimony afforded by our eyesight, we would immediately challenge any denial. Knowledge based on the testimony of our fallible senses is far from being universally accepted as the highest or the most certain. There are other sources of moral certitude.\nWalker, in his evidence, asserts that he had duties to discharge which required him, at least while running within the Moose Jaw yard limits, to remain on the right-hand side of his engine. He particularises the necessity of his being in a position to see a possible flagman's signal or a burning fusee on his side of the track which, were he on the left-hand side of the engine, might escape his attention. Rule 11 forbids passing a burning red fusee. A flagman's light swung across the track would have required him to stop (r. 12). Any object waived violently by any one at or near the track is a signal to stop (r. 13). Common knowledge tells us that he might have added that the position of the throttle, the lever and the air-brake controller, all of which he might be suddenly required to use with the utmost promptitude to meet an emergency, also made it incumbent upon him, at least while within yard limits, to retain his position on the right-hand side of the engine cab. While there appears to be no rule imposing on the engineer in explicit terms the duty of remaining on his own, or the right-hand side of the cab, rule 35, in three places, implies such a duty:\n35.\u2014A yellow flag or a yellow light placed beside the track on the same side as the engineer of an approaching train, indicates that the track 3,000 feet distant is in condition for speed of but six miles an hour unless otherwise instructed, and the speed of a train will be controlled accordingly. A green flag or a green light, placed beside the track, on the same side as the engineer of an approaching train, at a point beyond the slow track, indicates that full speed may be resumed.\nA \"slow\" sign placed beside the track, on the same side as the engineer of an approaching train, may be used to mark a point where a slow order is in effect.\nHaving regard to the definitions, the uncontradicted evidence and the passages from the rules to which I have referred, I have no hesitation in concluding that the words \"must know\" in rule 401 do not import knowledge acquired by the use of the engineer's own eyes to the exclusion of every other source of knowledge however reliable. The rule may be satisfied by knowledge acquired by inquiry or information from the fireman, when the engineer cannot himself see the signal indication from the place he occupies in the cab, provided he takes adequate precautions to ensure, as far as reasonably possible, the accuracy of such information. Thus the engineer may rightly be required to see that his fireman, if he is relying upon him to communicate information as to signals, is in a position to see them, has taken what appear to be reasonably sufficient means to ascertain what they are and has communicated the information in such a manner as to obviate any reasonable possibility of misunderstanding. The plaintiff has sworn that he discharged his duty in all these particulars, and the jury whose function it was to pass upon his credibility, have accepted his statement. I find nothing in the rules which prevents an engineer, under these circumstances, from relying upon the information given by his fireman that switch stand signals or indicators on the left-hand side of the track which he may be unable to see himself appear to be in order and \"ranged up\" to allow the train to proceed. On the contrary, were an engineer obliged to cross over to the left-hand side of the cab to verify with his own eyes the indication of every switch light on the left-hand side of the track encountered in a yard such as that at Moose Jaw, not only would the running of trains be seriously impeded but other dangers above indicated, against which it was his duty to guard, would not be provided for.\nUpon the findings of the jury the proper conclusion, in my opinion, is that Walker had the \"mental certitude\"\u2014the \"conviction\" based on information\u2014necessary to satisfy rule 401.\nIf I thought that on its proper construction rule 401 imposes on the engineer the duty under all circumstances of ascertaining by personal observation the indications of every switch stand light on the left-hand side of the track before passing it, I should have had to consider very carefully indeed before holding the plaintiff disentitled to recover, whether the discharge of duties inconsistent with the observance of it was not also required of him, and, if so, whether the defendants could invoke against him a failure to comply with that rule caused by the necessity of fulfilling such other duties.\nThe verdict is no doubt large, but it is not so excessive that it is possible to say that the jury must have been influenced by improper considerations in arriving at it, and while I might, if trying this action, have reached different conclusions as to some facts deposed to by Walker relevant to the question of contributory negligence, I could not, without usurping the functions of the jury in regard to these matters, substitute my views for theirs\nI would, for these reasons, dismiss this appeal.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This is a railway accident in which the plaintiff, respondent, was seriously injured. He was the engineer on a passenger train of the appellant company and he was bound to go east on a double track.\nHis train was then on track No. 1 at the station at Moose Jaw, and in order to reach track No. 3 or the east-bound main track, on which he was to run to reach the next station, the switches had to be lined up by an employee called the switch-tender.\nHaving received from the conductor of the train the order to start, and having received from the switch-tender the high ball signal indicating that the switches were properly laid, he started his train, which went down on the east-bound track; but by a very serious and evident mistake of the switch-tender the switch at the end of the yard through which the train could be transferred from the east-bound track to the westbound track had been left open and the train engaged itself on the west-bound track and came into collision with another train a few minutes after.\nIt is common ground that the switch, which I will call the Y switch because it is indicated in that way on the plan filed in the case, was not properly set. There was negligence on the part of the company's employees in giving Walker instructions to proceed with his train when that switch was not properly lined up. Then there is no doubt as to the company being liable for that negligence.\nBut the contention of the company is that the proximate cause of the accident was the negligence of Walker, because he should have ascertained and known the indication that this switch was set in such a way that his train would be brought on a west-bound track instead of being kept on the east-bound track. He is then charged with having failed in the duties which he had to perform and with being guilty of contributory negligence.\nThe jury found in favour of the plaintiff on that question of contributory negligence and that verdict was accepted by the trial judge and confirmed by the Court of Appeal.\nMr. Tilley, for the company, relied on rule 401 of the General Train Rules, approved by the Railway Commission, which says:\u2014\nEngineers must know the indication of all fixed signals before passing them. At railway crossings, drawbridges, junctions or train order offices, they will require the fireman to observe and communicate the indications of signal.\nIt is contended on the part of the respondent that he had ascertained through his fireman that the Y switch was properly set and that he could proceed and, besides, he adds that a light on a switch stand is not a fixed signal and that rule 401 does not apply in this case.\nThe accident happened during the night of the 4th of January, 1916. It was a dark, stormy and very cold night, 30 below zero, A strong wind was blowing from the north and the steam coming from the engine was passing over to the right side of the engine, the engineer's side, so that the latter was enveloped in a fog, it being practically impossible for him to see on his side. His fireman had been instructed to keep a lookout. The switches were on the side of the fireman, and he reported that everything was all right. The poor fireman was killed as a result of the collision and his evidence unfortunately was not available at the trial.\nThe jury has found, as I have said, that the engineer, in those circumstances, was not guilty of contributory negligence. He could not see himself, in view of the fog which was surrounding his side of the engine, and it was proper for him to instruct his fireman to look and see.\nBesides, has that rule any reference to the lights on the switch stand? I do not think so, because then there would be a conflict between the rules 10 and 661 and rule 401. Rule 10 says that a red light means that the train should stop. Rule 661 says:\u2014\nTrains or engines may be run to but must not be run beyond a signal indicating stop.\nThese two rules read together mean that when a red light is seen the engine must stop and the train must not go further. It could not apply to lights on switch stands, because there the trains are not bound to stop; but lights on the switch stand simply indicate that the green is set for the main track and the red is set for the diverging track. If rule 401 was to be read as applying to switch stands, then the duty of the engineer in this case would have been to stop at the four red lights which were on the switch stands before he reached the Y switch, and nobody contends that.\nThe plaintiff has said in his evidence, and it was not contradicted, that those switch stands are simply indicators and not fixed signals as included in rule 401. I think he was right in his contention; because otherwise there would be conflict between the rules 10 and 661 on one side and rule 401 on the other.\nI have come to the conclusion that the jury was right in declaring that there was no contributory negligence on the part of plaintiff.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Willoughby, Craig & Company.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Anderson, McNiven, Fraser & Rose.\n[1] 11 Sask.

Respondent\n1918: October 15; 16; 1918: November 18.\nPresent:\u2014Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Duff, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA.\nAssessment and taxes\u2014Municipal corporation\u2014Excessive valuation\u2014Statutory appeals\u2014Res judicata\u2014\"The Town Act\", (Alta) 1911-12, c. 2, ss. 285, 267. When a town Act provides a means of relief, in case of excessive assessment, by way of appeal to a municipal Court of Revision and thence to a District Judge, the decision not appealed against of either of these courts, confirming the assessment, is res judicata; the assessed party cannot afterwards invoke such excessive assessment as a ground of defence in an action for the recovery of the tax.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], which affirmed the judgment of Ives J. at the trial, by which the plaintiff's action was dismissed with costs.\nThe appellant, incorporated under the provisions of \"The Town Act\" of the Province of Alberta, brought action against the respondent for taxes in respect of certain real property owned by her within the limits of the municipality, alleging that the respondent was duly assessed for such property. The respondent founds her defence in particular upon the provisions of section 267 of \"The Town Act,\" complaining that the assessment was obviously excessive and illegal. The appellant's answer was that, no appeal having been taken prior to the confirmation of the assessment by the municipal council, the respondent has no status to resist payment of the taxes.\nA. H. Clarke K.C. for the appellant.\nLafleur K.C. and E. V. Robertson for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014The judgment of the learned trial judge upheld by the Court of Appeal for Alberta decided that because the assessment complained of is obviously excessive and that the assessment of the lands in question does not bear a fair and just relation to the value at which other land in the immediate vicinity is assessed, this action for the recovery of taxes imposed should be dismissed with costs.\nThe Act under which the assessment was made provides a means of relief in such cases by way of appeal to the municipal court of revision and from that court to the District Judge. The respondent had taken an appeal from the assessment to the Court of Revision Which consisted of members of the appellant's council, and that court, of which four members heard the appeal, decided to confirm the assessment, and dismissed the appeal.\nThe respondent did not pursue the matter further by an appeal to the District Court Judge which was open to her. The result was that the assessment roll stands supported by section 285 of \"The Town Act\" which reads as follows:\u2014\n285. The roll as finally passed by the council and certified by the assessor as so passed shall be valid and bind all parties concerned notwithstanding any defect or error committed in or with regard to such roll or any defect, error or mis-statement in the notice required by section 276 of this Act or any omission to deliver or to transmit such notice. I have long entertained the opinion that the only remedy which a ratepayer, complaining of an assessment being excessive, has, is to pursue such remedies as the \"Assessment Act\" may furnish for the redress of such a grievance.\nIf in the way of exceeding its jurisdiction a municipality or its officers have attempted to impose a tax which they, or it, have no power to impose, as, for example, in the case of property exempt from taxation, such taxes cannot be collected for the attempted imposition thereof is void.\nIt has been strenuously argued before us that inasmuch as the basis of such taxation as imposed and in question herein is imperatively required by law to rest upon an actual value, of the kind defined, that a serious departure therefrom is also beyond the jurisdiction of appellant and hence void.\nSuch a view of the law would be to render the collection of taxes dependent in many cases upon the very doubtful result of an issue to try what is actual value such as defined in the statute in question herein.\nNo decision binding us has ever gone so far.\nAnd experience, for example in the hearing of many appeals in cases of expropriation here, tempts one to suggest that the result of such a decision as sought herein by maintaining the judgment appealed from, would bring some appalling consequences, not only to us but also to those concerned in collecting taxes.\nOf course that is no reason for shrinking from so declaring the law if we so find it, but it makes one pause and reflect upon the view presented by many judges in dealing with similar legislation. I may be permitted to say that I never knew any one better qualified to speak upon such a subject than the late Chief Justice Hagarty, who so long presided in Ontario courts, including the Court of Appeal for Ontario, and in dealing with such a proposition in the case of Canadian Land & Emigration Co. v. The Municipality of Dysart et al.[2], he spoke as follows:\u2014\nIf we were to pronounce illegal some of the proceedings here complained of, I am afraid we would be exacting an ideal perfectibility in the working of our municipal system. * * * I think the design of the legislature was to work out the whole system of assessment by the machinery provided. Firstly, the action' of the assessor; secondly, the appeal to the Court of Revision; thirdly, the final appeal to the County Judge or stipendiary magistrate. * * * The intervention of the courts in the manner sought for by this appeal would be disastrous to the working of the municipal system. If the Court of Revision is to be in effect prohibited from enforcing the assessment, what is to be done?\nIt seems to me that this was good law and sound sense (which generally coincide) and must be accepted as our guide.\nThe logical results of the maintenance of the argument presented on behalf of respondent would be that an over or under valuation in the assessment would be void for want of jurisdiction and hence bring the case within the line of cases such as furnished by decisions on exemption already referred to, as the statute only permits actual value as defined as the basis therefor, and hence that that issue must be determined by trial of the fact in each case of such like dispute. There is no room for drawing any other line if that mode of thought is to be applied in deciding this case.\nIt is not the excessive departure from actual value as defined that is involved in such a proposition. Perhaps a hair divided the false and true. The absolutely true line must be discovered if the proposition is sound.\nI cannot think that such is the correct interpretation and construction of the statute in question.\nThe evident purpose of the legislature was to tax such actual values as the assessor, and the special appellate courts designated, might determine to be the true value of the property assessed.\nWhen the question of excessive assessment is raised I can see another possible alternative in the way of a defence founded thereon. It is a finding of fraud which vitiates everything.\nThere is much to be said as to this appellant's assessor's conduct being akin to that which would lay a good foundation for such a defence when he treated, as he says, the line laid down for him in the statute as a joke.\nBut there are others involved besides him who are said to be respectable men composing the town council.\nAlthough such a line of attack was open to respondent she did not pursue it.\nI only refer to it now as apparently a quite possible defence which some municipal authorities may have to face if they persistently disregard the law, as there is too much reason to believe there is a tendency to do in that regard in some places.\nIf ever such a case arise the party suffering and feeling he cannot succeed by the ordinary course of appealing must raise the issue distinctly.\nAs the law stands I see no relief for those upon whom excessive assessments are imposed but the remedies by way of appealing or a charge of fraud if it exist.\nI am not surprised to learn from Chief Justice Harvey's judgment that subsection 3 of section 267 of \"The Town Act\" has done much harm. It facilitates and probably protects the perpetration of fraud by putting an impediment in the way of appellants who should be encouraged as so many inspectors, as it were, checking the careless assessor's slovenly work. It tends to confusion of thought and to defeat the purpose of a just valuation which is the object of the law.\nThe appeal should be allowed but the costs should be withheld. I feel so inclined for I agree with the courts below that there has not been that observance of the statute which there should have been.\nDUFF J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014The purport and intent of section 285 of \"The Town Act,\" having regard to the provisions by which it is preceded, is to make the assessment roll valid and binding in respect of all matters within the cognizance of the Court of Revision. The chief subject of the jurisdiction of that court is the determination of appeals based on the ground that assessments are \"too high or too low.\" In regard to these questions its jurisdiction is exclusive.\nThe complaint of the defendant is that her assessment is \"too high\"\u2014too high because the assessor flagrantly disregarded the basis of assessment prescribed by the legislature\u2014but nevertheless \"too high.\" To make an assessment of the property in question as part of the \"ratable land in the town\" (ss. 265 and 266) was the duty of the assessor. Whether in the making of it he erred wilfully or through ignorance as to the application and effect of s. 267, it was an assessment which it was within his jurisdiction to make and, therefore, essentially different from attempted assessments of exempted property held so utterly void, because made wholly without jurisdiction that they would not support taxation at all in such cases as Toronto Railway Co. v. City of Toronto[3]; Canadian Oil Fields Co. v. Village of Oil Springs[4]. While the method of assessment prescribed by section 267 is more than merely directory, I cannot regard an intention to follow its provisions as a condition of the jurisdiction to make an assessment. An assessment in fact for an amount equal to the \"actual cash value\" of the land would not be a nullity merely because in arriving at it the assessor had disregarded or ignored section 267 of the statute.\nThat it is within the jurisdiction of the Court of Revision, the District Court Judge, and, on appeal from him, of this court in cases involving an assessment of appealable amount to entertain taxpayers' appeals based on excessive assessments made in utter disregard of the method of assessment prescribed by the legislature is, I think, sufficiently established by such decisions as Rogers Realty Co. v. Swift Current (2), where my brother Idington pointed out\nthat in making the assessment in question the assessor had ignored the statute which ought to have bound him\u2014\nprecisely as in the case at bar. Although in that case the question of jurisdiction does not appear to have been raised in argument it should scarcely be assumed that this court unconsciously exercised jurisdiction to reduce the assessment which it would not possess unless the Court of Revision had it in the first instance.\nMoreover, the defendant exercised her right of appeal to the Court of Revision in the present case. She did not further appeal as she might have done, against its adverse judgment to the District Court Judge and, had his decision been likewise adverse, to this court. Rogers Realty Co. v, Swift Current[5]; Grierson v. Edmonton[6]; Pierce v. Calgary[7], are recent instances of such appeals having been successfully taken. The judgment of the Court of Revision upon a matter within its jurisdiction is binding on the defendant as res judicata. It cannot be ignored in this or any other court merely because deemed erroneous either in law or in fact. As Mr. Justice Burton said, in London Mutual Ins. Co. v. City of London[8]:\nIf in the exercise of his functions, but acting within his jurisdiction, the assessor does an erroneous act, it is no more null and void, while unquestioned by appeal, than an erroneous decision of this court on a matter within its jurisdiction, while unreversed. * * * The legislature has thought fit to entrust the power of adjudicating upon the correctness of that act (an assessment, right or wrong) to certain persons and as a general rule those persons alone can do so.\nThe observations of Hagarty C.J.O., in Canada Land & Emigration Co. v. Dysart[9], are also in point as to matters within the jurisdiction of the Court of Revision under section 274 of the \"Town Act.\"\nIt was suggested in the course of the argument by my brother Duff that whatever may be said of what the assessor did there is nothing to shew that the Court of Revision in dismissing the present defendant's appeal and confirming the assessment ignored the requirements of section 267 of the statute. But, as my learned brother himself pointed out later, if there was really no assessment there probably was no subject matter of appeal within the jurisdiction of the Court of Revision. Moreover, it is probably a fair inference, having regard to the evidence in the present record, that the Court of Revision must have committed the same error as that charged against the assessor. I prefer not to rest my judgment on this somewhat doubtful ground.\nBecause the only defence, in my opinion, arguable which has been set up raises a question which, I think, it was within the jurisdiction of the Court of Revision to determine, subject to appeal, and because, whether the jurisdiction of that court over it is exclusive or not, having been invoked and exercised its unappealed decision establishes a case of res judicata, I would, with respect, allow this appeal. The plaintiff is entitled to judgment with costs throughout.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014The question in this case is whether the respondent, having been assessed for a property in the town of Macleod and having appealed to the Court of Revision on the ground that the assessment was too high and not having pursued further, can now resist on the same ground an action instituted by the town for the collection of the taxes.\nBy virtue of the law of Alberta, provision is made as to the way municipal assessments on lands should be made and courts are provided in those statutes for the purpose of hearing and determining whether the assessments are too high or too low.\nIt appears that the assessors might have put on the lands of the respondent a higher amount than the cash value for which the property should have been assessed; but at the same time it is admitted that the assessment was uniform throughout the town and that no real injustice is being suffered by the respondent as a result of that assessment. However, she appealed to the Court of Revision and she was entitled in case she would have been displeased with the decision of the Court of Revision to go before the District Judge and she could even have come up before the Supreme Court. Pearce v. Calgary[10]. She seemed to be satisfied with the judgment of the Court of Revision and did not bring her case further. When she was sued for the taxes she pleaded that the assessment was too high and should not be maintained.\nShe relies mostly on a judgment which has been rendered in the Privy Council in the case of Toronto Railway Co. v. City of Toronto [11]. I think that that case should be distinguished from the present one. In the Toronto Railway Case 11 the question to be determined was not the quantum of assessment but the assessability of electric tramways as real estate or as fixtures. The Privy Council decided that the courts which had been established for the purpose of determining whether the assessment was too high or too low could not have jurisdiction in a case where there was a question as to the assessability of the property.\nIn the present case it is not a question of the validity of the assessment, because it cannot be seriously disputed that the lands in question were to be assessed; but it is simply a question of quantum. This case, then, is very different from the Toronto Railway Case11. The respondent has found it advisable to go before the courts provided by the statute to have it determined whether her assessment was too high or too low. It becomes res judicata, as far as she is concerned, and she could not invoke the same reason in an action for the recovery of the taxes. The judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta which decided in her favour should be reversed.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs of this court and of the court below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 41 D.L.R. 357; [1918] 2 W.W.R. 718.\n[2] 12 Ont.

Fitzpatrick C.J. dubitante. Pearce v. Calgary (54 Can. S.C.R. 1, 32 D.L.R. 790, 23 D.L.R. 296, 9 W.W.R. 195, 668), followed.\nJudgment of the Local Government Board of Saskatchewan reversed, Brodeur J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the decision of the Local Government Board of the Province of Saskatchewan confirming the decision of the Court of Revision, in respect of assessment, for taxation purposes, of subdivided lots of land belonging to the appellant.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nF. H. Chrysler K.C. for the appellant.\nHarold Fisher for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I concur in the disposition of this appeal made by Mr. Justice Anglin.\nI have, however, much reluctance in allowing the appeal because, firstly, I rather doubt our jurisdiction. Montreal Street Railway Company v. City of Montreal[1]; and, secondly, because the local authorities ought to be more competent to fix the value of the properties in question than I can assume to be.\nIdington J.\u2014I think this appeal should be allowed and the assessment of the lands in question put at $100 an acre, or the equivalent thereof for the lots which are said to be a tenth of an acre each.\nThe parties, it is said, agreed that the evidence taken in another appeal, by the Hudson Bay Company, should be read along with that taken in this. The only evidence directly taken in this case was that given by Mr. Reith, and he values the land in question at $75 to $100 per acre. The use of the evidence in the Hudson Bay Case being agreed to, suggests, as well as did the location on the map in evidence, that the land in each case was practically of about the same value. But it seemed to be as to either that as subdivisions into town lots they are for the present time worthless.\nIn regard to the other lands the assessor was examined and gave the following evidence:\u2014\nQ.\u2014How did you arrive at the assessment of $350.00 per acre?\nA.\u2014We know of acreage being sold much in excess of 1350.00.\nQ.\u2014Then your witness stated it is valueless. Do you agree with that?\nA.\u2014I do, to a certain extent.\nQ.\u2014You do not think it could be sold at the present time? A. No.\nQ.\u2014Could you trade it for anything? A. I do not know.\nQ.\u2014You know nothing you could trade it for? A.\u2014I do not know.\nQ.\u2014The nuisance ground occupies 40 acres? A.\u2014Yes.\nIt is not difficult to understand from that evidence of the assessor, in regard to land which other evidence in the same appeal shewed was not good for much else than for subdivision, although not subdivided, that in making the assessment in question he had ignored the statute which ought to have bound him. I infer that if subdivided it would probably be more valuable in subdivisions than that in question in this case. When evidence was given, in regard to either property, of values some years ago, we cannot shut out from our minds the common knowledge that such values, founded upon delusions that prevailed some years ago, exist no longer.\nThe statute imperatively requires that land shall be assessed at its fair actual value and buildings and improvements thereon at not more than 60% of their actual value. That statutory obligation clearly was not observed by the assessor, nor has it been observed by the Court of Revision or the Local Government Board.\nIndeed it was not argued that the evidence would warrant the finding. It was argued, however, that inasmuch as under section 415, s.s. 11, of the city's Act, it was provided as follows:\u2014\nThe board may, of its own motion, revise the assessment of the city generally, or of any part thereof, or of any individual properties in respect of which no notice of appeal has been given, and for such purpose it may set a day or days for the hearing and adjourn the same from time to time, and may cause such notices to be given and such parties to be served as may be deemed expedient.\nthat it was not competent for us to interfere and that the judgment of the board must be accepted as infallible notwithstanding the evidence. I do not so read the statute. That section certainly gives the board unusual powers, but it was not sitting in pursuance of the sub-section just quoted, which relates to causes in which no notice of appeal has been given and requires it to give notice of the sitting of such court, and the parties concerned to be served. That is not the proceeding that is in question here. All that is in question here is a judgment of that board sitting in appeal from the Court of Revision. It is quite competent for the legislature, if it see fit, to treat such a board, when discharging other duties than its appellate ones, as infallible, as section 11 seems to contemplate according to the argument presented.\nThe legislature, however, has not seen fit to attach that weight of infallibility to the board in question or to attach any importance whatever to an inspection or judgment based upon an inspection of the premises.\nThe powers given for the board to revise of its own motion, cannot be made to imply more than giving it jurisdiction to initiate a revision of its own.\nReason and common sense suggest that when it is required to give notice to those concerned of its intention to proceed to such a revision, that it must hold a sitting and hear evidence just as any other tribunal. That it has not done in any such capacity as indicated by the sub-section.\nAll it did pretend to do was to hear the appeal from the Court of Revision upon which there is only the one witness's evidence which bound, or should have bound, the board appealed from, as it binds us.\nThis is the fourth appeal of this kind of property, once valuable in booming times, now greatly depreciated, and in each instance heretofore the value placed by the witness has been taken for our guide. I see no reason for departing from the mode of disposing of an appeal which has been used heretofore.\nThe respondent should bear the costs of this appeal.\nAnglin J.\u2014Our jurisdiction to entertain this appeal under section 41 of the \"Supreme Court Act\" is unquestionable. Our duty, if the evidence satisfies us that the assessment appealed against exceeds the \"fair actual value\" or the \"true value\" of the property to a \"substantial\" extent (stats. of Sask., 1915, ch. 16, s. 387), is to allow the appeal and to reduce the assessment to such \"fair actual value\" as disclosed by the evidence. Pearce v. Calgary[2].\nWe have not the advantage of any statement of the grounds on, or the reasons for, which the Local Government Board affirmed the assessment of the appellants' Rosemount property. We are informed, only by the the certificate of the city clerk, that\nthe members of the Board made a personal inspection of the property and also made personal inspection of adjoining properties and personal inspection of various other properties throughout the city of Swift Current and compared the assessment upon such properties with the assessment in question.\nWe can merely surmise to what extent the conclusion reached was influenced by these inspections and comparisons.\nThe right of the board sitting as an appellate tribunal, in the absence of statutory provision therefor, to take a view has been challenged. It is at least questionable. There is nothing to indicate that the special jurisdiction conferred by s.s. 11 of section 415 of the City Act (stats. of Sask. 1915, c. 16) was exercised by the board. In the case of \"individual properties\" that jurisdiction appears to be confined to those\nin respect of which no notice of appeal has been given.\nBut, making every possible allowance for the effect of the board's inspection of the property (assuming it to have been rightly made) and for the facts that the weight to be attached to the evidence in regard to the Hudson's Bay Company's property (introduced by consent) is materially lessened by the circumstance that the property now under consideration is in immediate proximity to the city's nuisance ground, that the original assessment was supported by the oath of the assessor, and that only one witness was called to give evidence in regard to the value of the Rosemount subdivision, I am nevertheless satisfied that the assessment of the latter as building lots at an average value of about $120 apiece\u2014a valuation approximating $1,200 an acre\u2014was improper and grossly exceeds its true or fair actual value.\nThe evidence of J. K. Reith, a real estate dealer of some years' experience in Swift Current, who was the sole witness that spoke as to Rosemount, was that\nthere is not any lot in the whole subdivision worth $25 * * *; the only thing you could use it for is farm land,\nand he placed its value at $75 to $100 per acre. This witness's testimony was not affected by his cross-examination; and the city chose to leave it uncontradicted. The assessor, in giving evidence in regard to the assessment of the Hudson's Bay Company's property, which he had placed at $350 per acre, said that he agreed to a certain extent with a witness called for the appellants in that case who had stated that that property was valueless. Other witnesses had valued it at from $25 to $30 and from $25 to $50 an acre\u2014 none at any higher figure. Mr. Reith added that Rosemount \"is not any better\" than the Hudson's Bay quarter.\nIt must always be extremely unsatisfactory for an appellate court, lacking the local knowledge, the familiarity with assessment work and the opportunity of personal inspection possessed by a local tribunal, to attempt to revise its valuations on the mere record of oral testimony of witnesses called before it. While such a duty is imposed upon us, however, we must discharge it as best we can.\nIn the present case I am satisfied that the assessment is not merely substantially but grossly excessive. It would almost appear that the board, regarding the maintenance of \"a fair and just proportion\" between the assessment of the land in question and\nthe value at which lands in the immediate vicinity of the lands in question are assessed\nas the dominant requirement of the statute, had subordinated, if it did not ignore, the imperative provision that\nland shall be assessed at its fair actual value.\nThe maintenance of \"a fair and just proportion\" between it and other assessments in the vicinity becomes material only where there is not a substantial difference between the amount of the assessment in question and the \"true value\" of the property. The only evidence of \"fair actual value\" or \"true value\" before us is \"from $75 to $100 per acre.\"\nI would allow the appeal and reduce the assessment to $100 per acre.\nBrodeur J. (dissenting)\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the local Government Board of the Province of Saskatchewan against the assessment of subdivided lots of land known as Rosemount in the City of Swift Current. The judgment of the Local Government Board had confirmed the decision of the assessor of the municipality and of the Court of Revision.\nThe Local Government Board was instituted a few years ago for the purpose of controlling the municipal authorities concerning the raising of moneys by way of debentures, to supervise the expenditure of moneys borrowed, to revise the assessment of municipalities and to hear assessment appeals. Their powers are very extensive, since, as regards assessments, the Board may, of their own motion, revise the assessment of a city, even when there is no notice of appeal and no complaint (Sask. statute 1915, ch. 16, sec. 415, s.s. 11). It is declared by the Act that the decision of the board shall be final and conclusive in every case adjudicated upon (sub-section 15).\nThe evidence that we have in this case is very meagre and we have no reasons of judgment either from the Court of Revision or from the Local Government Board. It is common ground, however, that members of the board have made a personal inspection not only of the properties at issue but also of adjoining properties and various other lands throughout the city of Swift Current and have compared the assessment upon such properties with the assessment in question in this case. The certificate of the city clerk states that in the opinion of the board the properties in question had been given their fair actual value and it bore a fair and just proportion to the value at which lands in the immediate vicinity of the land in question was assessed.\nIn those circumstances, it seems to me that we could not very easily interfere with the views expressed by the board, since the members thereof had an opportunity of visiting the land and forming a fair opinion upon the assessment of the properties in the municipality.\nIt may be that at the present moment those properties could not be sold for the price at which they have been assessed because we are at a time when money is very scarce and when it is likely very hard to dispose of properties. But this is only temporary, and on that point the board is in a far better position to determine the actual value of the property than we are ourselves. I am of opinion then that the judgment appealed from should be maintained with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Begg & Hayes.\nSolicitor for the respondent: C. E.

Whitney, (1918) 57 S.C.R. 543\nDate: 1918-03-11\nGreat Northern Insurance Company (Defendant). Appellant;\nand\nWilliam D. Whitney (Plaintiff) Respondent\n1918: March 4, 11.\nPresent:\u2014Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Idington, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE APPELLATE DIVISION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA.\nInsurance\u2014Horse\u2014Materiality\u2014Alteration\u2014Inquiry by Company. An insurance company cannot invoke as material a representation, in an application for insurance, as to the cost price of the thing insured, when a palpable alteration of the figures appears on the face of the application and no inquiry is made by the company as to the reason for such alteration.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (10 Alta. L.R. 292; 32 D.L.R. 756, affirmed).\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], affirming the judgment of Walsh J. at the trial and maintaining the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nG. H. Ross K.C. and Barron for the appellant.\nAuguste Lemieux K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014The respondent sued for $800, the amount of an insurance on the life of a stallion. The only defence raised is that in the application for the insurance it was stated that the price paid for the horse was $1,500, whereas in reality it was only $800.\nThere is no suggestion that there was any bad faith on the part of the respondent. The facts are that the company's agent who procured the insurance took the documents home and filled them out and sent them back to the respondent to sign. The respondent's sight is not very good and he did not check the statement over; the agent told him to sign it, that it was all right. The respondent, however, swears, and there is no contradiction, that the question of price as to what he paid was never mentioned, that the agent merely asked what the value of the horse was. The trial judge has found that\nit is quite clear from the evidence that this stallion at the time this application was made was really worth $1,500.\nMr. Justice Walsh gave judgment for the plaintiff for $800, which he reduced to two-thirds thereof, i.e., $533.33, on his attention being called to clause 11 of the policy regarding the payment of not more than two-thirds of the amount\nand in view of the defendant counsel's consent.\nThe judgment proceeds on the ground that it was the agent's and not the plaintiff's fault that the payment made for the horse was given as $1,500, and that notwithstanding the clause in the application which provides that if another person other than the applicant fills out this form or any part of it he shall be deemed the agent of the applicant and that Luckwell was the agent of the defendant and not the agent of the plaintiff.\nThe defendant's appeal was unanimously dismissed by the four judges composing the court.\nThe judgment may be upheld for the reasons given in the courts below and further because it is submitted the cost and the value are not sufficiently distinguished. The cost or price paid for the animal, though important for the purpose of checking the value at the time of the application for insurance and preventing over-insurance, can be no absolute criterion of the value, for, first, it must depend on how long before the insurance the purchase was made; and in this case, it was two years before; and, secondly, a horse may be bought cheap like anything else, or indeed more so than most things. Curiously enough, it is the company's counsel who in his cross-examination of the respondent suggests that this was so in the present case and that the real price of the horse was then $1,500.\nThe contract contains a mass of complicated conditions under some or one of which the company could probably wriggle out of most insurance they might write. The officials of the company suggested a settlement. But the company, apparently seeing a loophole to avoid making any payment, repudiated its liability in toto.\nIf the appellant company gave to the statement made with respect to the price paid for the horse the importance it now seeks to attribute to it, I cannot understand why, when the application for insurance was received, the attention of its officers was not drawn to the palpable alteration of the figures which appear on the face of the document. The original price of the horse was, in the first instance, given at $800 and this was changed to $1,500; and apparently no inquiry was made about the reason for this alteration.\nIt is, in my opinion, clear that the respondent throughout acted in good faith; when he filed his proof of loss he stated the price of the horse at $800.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nIDINGTON J. \u2014 I think, in the peculiar circumstances presented in this case that the knowledge of Luckwell, the agent, was that of the appellant. Indeed I am disposed to infer from an inspection of the alterations in the figures in the parts of the application of which so much has been made, that no one else than Luckwell, on behalf of the appellant, ever read and passed upon them or there would have been an inquiry started as to why the obviously altered figures were in the condition they were.\nIn such an event no doubt the result would have been due rectification and a very ready acceptance of the risk which never involved more than the judgment recovered.\nTreating Luckwell as the agent of the company and it responsible for the condition of the application, I see no escape from the conclusions unanimously reached by the learned judges who have had occasion to pass upon the defence set up, and hence agree that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014This appeal, in my opinion, lacks merit.\nI am not satisfied, if the answer in the application as to the \"price paid\" for the horse should be taken, as against the insured, to have been $1,500, that it was absolutely untrue. There is more than a suggestion in the record that the horse had been sold by one Hodges for $1,500 to Harker, that Harker had re-sold him for the same price to a purchaser, who paid only $700 and made default for the balance of $800, and that in consideration of the plaintiff, paying this balance, he then obtained the animal from Harker, to whom the price paid was thus actually $1,500. But on both the \"application\" and the \"description\" furnished with it the figures \"$1,500\" have manifestly been written over other figures, which may well have been $800. If the representation as to the cost price was regarded as material, it is scarcely conceivable that an application and description with such obvious alterations in these figures should have been acted upon without verification or inquiry. The almost irresistible inference is that as only $800 of insurance was sought upon a horse valued at $1,500 the price paid by the assured was deemed negligible.\nThe fact that the policy limits the risk of the insurer to \"two-thirds of the actual cost\" of the animal insured confirms this view.\nClause 22 of the policy provides for immunity of the insurance company\nwhere it shall be found that the material statements set forth in the application upon which the acceptance of the risk was based were untrue.\nIf the statement as to cost was untrue and was binding on the assured, it has not been established that it was in fact, or was deemed, material, or that the acceptance of the risk was induced by, or based upon, it.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014This is an action on a contract of insurance of a horse. The insurance company contends that the application contains a false statement which was material to the risk, namely, that the plaintiff paid $1,500 for the horse, whereas, in fact, he paid only $800.\nThe application, which was declared by the contract to form part of the policy, was prepared by the agent of the company and was signed by the applicant. It was a condition of the policy that if the application is prepared by a person other than the applicant that person should be deemed the agent of the applicant and not the agent of the company.\nThe applicant was never asked by the agent how much he had paid for his horse. There is a question, however, in the application by the answer to which he would have been supposed to declare that the horse had cost him $1,500.\nAll the parties seem to be in good faith in the matter, and the mistake which has occurred was likely due to the fact that the applicant declared to the agent that the horse was worth $1,500. The evidence shews that the horse was worth that price.\nIt is in the circumstances of the case somewhat of a technical defence that is raised by the insurance company. Luckwell, the agent who filled up the application, was acting as agent of the company; and if he has not thought fit to inquire as to the price paid for the horse, his negligence would be the negligence of the company. Besides, the statement which was made would not be considered as being a material statement in the circumstances of the case because it is pretty clear by the application that the figures $1,500 or $800 seem to have been changed and altered. That fact should have been sufficient for the company to inquire as to it. They have not done so however. I think that the company should be called upon to pay the insurance.\nThe judgment of the courts below which dismissed its plea should be maintained with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\n[1] 10 Alta.

VII. c. 6, s. 4. A contract for the drilling of an oil well provided: \"That if at anytime during the prosecution of the said work, or after the completion thereof, any dispute, difference or question shall arise between the parties hereto, or any of their representatives, touching the said work, or the construction, meaning, or effect of these presents, or anything herein contained, or the rights or liabilities of the parties or their representatives, under these presents or otherwise in relation to the premises, then every such dispute, difference or question shall be referred to\" arbitration. After an award had been made, the appellant took an action in damages for breach of contract and the respondent applied for a stay of action.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that the intention of the parties was to refer to arbitration not only the disputes between them but also the question whether these disputes fell within the arbitration clause; and that the issues between the parties ought to be determined by arbitration rather than by action.\nPer Fitzpatrick C.J. and Anglin and Brodeur JJ.:\u2014The provision \"at any time during the prosecution of the work or after the completion thereof\" relates to time and not to the condition of the work and is applicable even if the work is not being prosecuted through the default of one party.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (12 Alta. L.R. 501; 34 D.L.R. 375), affirmed. Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment of Hyndman J. and maintaining an application by the defendant to stay the plaintiff's action for damages for breach of contract. The appellant and the respondent entered into an agreement for the drilling of a well for the discovery of oil or gas. The principal clause of the agreement is cited in the above head-note. The respondent proceeded under the contract, but at a depth of 2,400 feet, a joint of the casing collapsed and broke. Continuance of the work had been agreed on, but a dispute occurred between the parties as to the size of the casing; the respondent appointed an arbitrator and called upon the appellant to do the same under the terms of the arbitration clause. The appellant notified the respondent of the appointment of an arbitrator, though maintaining at the same time that no dispute had arisen and that the appointment was without prejudice to its right to so maintain and to dispute the validity of any award.\nA third arbitrator was subsequently named and an unanimous award was made in favour of the respondent. The appellant then took an action in damages for breach of contract. The respondent made an application for stay of that action, pursuant to section 4 of the \"Arbitration Act\" (Alta.), 9 Ewd. VII. ch. 6. This application was refused by Hyndman J., but granted by the Appellate Division.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. and J. H. Charman for the appellant.\nA. H. Clarke K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the judgment which will be delivered by my brother Anglin. He has dealt very fully with the matter and there is little need that I should add anything to his reasons, with which I agree.\nI may say, however, that I think the courts should be reluctant to permit an appeal to them by one of the parties to an agreement to refer questions that may arise between them to a domestic forum rather than the ordinary courts, when that agreement is couched in such wide terms as in the present case. The bringing of an action in such cases on a technical point even if necessarily held permissible is likely to defeat the intention of the parties to the agreement, as I cannot doubt would be the case here. I think the parties to this agreement intended at the time it was entered into that all questions that might arise between them touching the subject matter of the contract should be settled by arbitration without proceedings before the courts.\nThis is the second attempt on the part of the appellants to withdraw these matters from the arbitrators and such proceedings would go far to render agreements for arbitration undesirable as rather increasing than avoiding litigation.\nThe appellants appointed an arbitrator \"without prejudice,\" by which I can only understand that they were willing to wait and see if the award were in their favour and accept or refuse to be bound by it accordingly. This, I think, is also a proceeding to be discouraged and is an additional reason why I would dismiss the appeal.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting)\u2014There are several rather important and difficult questions raised herein which, in the last analysis, depend upon the construction of the submission, and that ought to be determined by the court under the circumstances existent in this case.\nAllowing the action to proceed will facilitate that being done. I therefore think the appeal should be allowed with costs. I may be permitted to add that I am very far from holding that every case dependent upon the construction of the submission must be tried out by a court. Many documents, penned by commercial men especially, I believe, would often find, if submitted to men of the class that framed them, a construction more in accord with what the parties concerned contemplated than would be apt to be given by a court.\nIn this case, however, I think the court probably will be the better tribunal to determine the questions raised.\nI purposely abstain from intimating or discussing what points of construction may be involved, or presenting any views thereupon, and thereby embarrassing those who will have to consider and dispose thereof.\nANGLIN J.\u2014Under the terms of sec. 5 of the \"Alberta Arbitration Act\" (1909, ch. 6), if the defendant desired to obtain a stay of this action he was obliged to apply for it\nbefore delivering any pleadings or taking any other steps in the proceedings.\nTo determine on a mere perusal of a statement of claim whether the real issues between the parties are within the scope of an agreement for arbitration, or are such that, notwithstanding that they fall within its purview, the court should, in the exercise of its discretion (Lyon v. Johnson[2]), refuse to stay the action is often a difficult matter. It is so in the case at bar. The judges of the provincial courts have differed upon this question. For my part I should, therefore, have preferred to have taken the course adopted by North J. in Re Carlisle[3], and have directed that the motion to stay should stand over until the pleadings should be closed and such evidence taken (if any) as the judge before whom the case might come for trial should deem necessary to develop and make plain the real matters in controversy. The issues would probably then be defined and it could be determined more readily and satisfactorily whether they do or do not fall within the scope of the arbitration clause in the agreement between the parties.\nI understand, however, that two of my learned brothers think the adoption of this dilatory course unnecessary and therefore unjustified. In deference to their view I shall express my opinion upon the question whether the cause of action disclosed in the statement of claim is such that the judgment granting a stay should be reversed.\nThe appellants seek to distinguish the case of Willesford v. Watson[4], cited by the learned Chief Justice of Alberta, and refer to some observations upon it made by Jessel M.R. in Piercy v. Young[5]. In the Willesford Case 4, Lord Chancellor Selborne held that under the submission there before the court\nthe very thing which the arbitrators ought to do (was) to look into the whole matter, to construe the instrument, and to decide whether the thing which is complained of is inside or outside of the agreement.\nHis Lordship declined to have the court\nlimit the arbitrators' power to those things which are determined by the court to be within the agreement.\nThe words of the submission, to which effect was thus given, were as follows:\u2014\nAny dispute, question or difference * * * between the parties to these presents * * * touching these presents or any clause or matter or thing herein contained, or the construction hereof * * * or touching the rights, duties, and liabilities of either party in connection with the premises. This arbitration clause was contained in a mining lease. The question between the parties was whether a claim arising out of the sinking by the lessees of a shaft through the leased land in a slanting direction into adjoining mining land, of which they were also lessees, was in violation of the lessors' rights. They alleged that it was, and also maintained that such a dispute was not within the provision for arbitration and accordingly they brought action for an injunction. Their action was stayed. In the case at bar the agreement provides for the arbitration of\nany dispute, difference or question between the parties hereto * * * touching * * * the construction, meaning or effect of these presents or anything herein contained or the rights or liabilities of the parties * * * under these presents or otherwise in relation to the premises.\nI am, with respect, of the opinion that it is impossible to distinguish this language from that in the Willesford agreement. The scope of the arbitration clause now before us is, if anything, wider than that dealt with by Lord Selborne and vests in the arbitrators the power to determine whether or not any claim presented to them is within the purview of the submission. In Piercy v. Young[6], the agreement was merely for the reference to arbitration of\nany differences or disputes which may arise between the partners.\nSuch an agreement was clearly distinguishable from that in the Willesford Case[7], as the Master of the Rolls points out, and the only relevancy of his judgment is his observation that\nOf course persons can agree to refer to arbitration not merely the disputes between them, but even the question whether the disputes between them are within the arbitration clause.\nI may add that, except for whatever limitation may be involved in the words at any time during the prosecution of the work or after the completion thereof,\nI see no serious difficulty in treating the cause of action stated in the statement of claim as a\ndispute, difference or question * * touching the effect of these presents * * or the rights or liabilities of the parties under these presents or otherwise in relation to the premises,\nwithin the meaning of those terms as used in the agreement. To quote Lord Selborne, the parties here\nseem to have taken more than ordinary pains to throw in words that cover all things collateral as well as things expressed.\nThe plaintiffs complain of an alleged wrongful withdrawal by the defendant of the casing thereby destroying the well and depriving them of an opportunity to exercise an option to purchase the casing (presumably in place) given by the agreement. They also complain of the non-completion of the well to a depth of 2,500 feet. They claim payment of a balance of $10,875 of moneys deposited by them with the Royal Bank of Canada as a guarantee for the carrying out of the contract by them, out of which payments were to be made to the defendant as they accrued due. They also claim damages to the amount of $21,625.\nWhether the casing was properly or improperly withdrawn from the well by the defendant in an unsuccessful effort to remove 300 feet of it from the bottom after it had collapsed, whether the failure to complete the contract is attributable to the fault of the defendant or to a wrongful failure of the plaintiffs' managing director to give proper directions as to the diameter of the well if it should be continued below the depth attained at the time of the collapse, whether the removal of the 300 feet of casing at the bottom of the well was impracticable as alleged by the defendant, whether the plaintiffs' managing director was within his rights in insisting that the defendant should furnish him with \"conclusive evidence\" of the impracticability of removing 300 feet of casing and of the necessity for reducing the diameter of the well if the work were to be continued, whether any damage sustained by the plaintiffs is attributable to fault or misconduct of the defendant and, if so, what would be a reasonable sum to allow as compensation, and whether the plaintiffs are entitled to the balance of $10,875 deposited in bank \u2014all these appear to be questions\ntouching the effect of these presents * * * or the rights or liabilities of the parties under these presents or otherwise in relation to the premises.\nIt is true that the determination of the practicability of carrying an 8\u00bc-inch casing to the full depth of 2,500 feet is by the agreement left with \"the owners' managing director\" whose decision upon it is made final. But whether such a decision was given or was wrongfully withheld and what was the effect upon the rights of the parties of such a wrongful withholding if it occurred, or of the defendants' failure to carry out a proper and lawful direction if given, appear to be questions\ntouching the effect of these presents or the rights or liabilities of the parties under these presents or otherwise in relation to the premises.\nIt may be that if they should find the withdrawal of the casing to have been tortious, the arbitrators would determine that a claim in respect of it is not covered by the arbitration agreement. It would be competent for them to so hold, though for my part I find it difficult to understand how such a claim can be other than\nin relation to the premises * * * under these presents or otherwise\u2014\njust as was that based on the alleged wrongful sinking of a transverse shaft in the Willesford Case[8]. The parties have seen fit, to use the language of Jessel M.R.,\nto refer to arbitration not merely disputes between them, but even the question whether the disputes between them are within the arbitration clause.\nI agree with Chief Justice Harvey that the opening words\nrelate to time and not to condition of the work and the parties would naturally be considering the contract as one to be performed and not one to be broken and in that case everything would happen \"during the prosecution of the work or after the completion thereof,\" and in their contemplation at the time of the making of the agreement it appears to me that these words would be considered comprehensive enough to cover every question that might arise out of the contract.\nThen it may be that the work has been completed. It is true that the work has not been completed by the drilling of a successful well, but if this is due to the default of the plaintiff the work has been completed in so far as the contract imposes any obligation on the defendant to complete it, and the arbitrators have so found.\nI think the parties meant to provide, and have provided, for the arbitration of any dispute or difference arising between them in relation to the premises, whether under the contract or otherwise, after the commencement of the work.\nBut it is said that although they should be within the arbitration clause of the agreement the plaintiffs' claims as disclosed in the statement of claim are of such a character that the court in the exercise of its discretion should not stay the action. It is the case presented by the statement of claim that must be dealt with (Monro v. Bognor Urban District Council[9]).\nIf the judge of first instance had refused a stay in the exercise of judicial discretion the Appellate Court might properly have declined to entertain an appeal from his order. Clough v. County Live Stock Ins. Association[10]; Walmsley v. White[11]; Vawdrey v. Simpson[12]. But the learned judge based his refusal on the ground that the claims set up in the statement of claim are not within the agreement for arbitration. He apparently did not exercise any discretion;\nIn the Appellate Division, on the other hand, the majority of the court held the cause of action to be within the scope of the arbitration agreement, one learned judge thinking it proper to go outside of the statement of claim and to\nlook at the affidavit evidence and discover what the real dispute is about.\nAlthough there is no explicit reference to any consideration of discretion in the opinions delivered by the learned Chief Justice (concurred in by Walsh J.) and Mr. Justice Stuart, it should not be assumed that those learned judges overlooked the fact that, although the cause of action should be within the purview of the arbitration agreement, the court would have a discretion\u2014to be exercised judicially, not arbitrarily\u2014to grant a stay. On the contrary, it should be assumed that the conclusion was reached that the circumstances did not call for an exercise of this discretion.\nIf the sole matter to be dealt with by the arbitrators were a question of law, a stay of the action on that ground might be properly refused: Edward Grey & Co. v. Tolme & Runge[13]. But where there are important questions of fact to be determined, such as the practicability of continuing the well with a diameter of ten inches, the propriety of taking out the casing, whether the managing director did or did not exercise the power conferred on him by the agreement, and the amount of damage sustained by either party, the circumstance that important questions of law are also involved will not justify the refusal of a stay if the claims in the action be otherwise proper for submission to arbitrators. Rowe Bros. v. Crosley Bros.[14]; Lock v. Army, Navy and General Assurance Association[15]. Especially must this be so where the parties have, as here, expressed their purpose that all questions of the construction of the agreement, which may be the chief legal questions to be determined, should be dealt with by the arbitrators. That circumstance, with the fact that there is no claim in the present case which is clearly outside the purview of the arbitration clause, distinguishes it from Printing Machinery Co. v. Linotype and Machinery Ltd.[16].\nNeither, in my opinion, does it appear that the claim in the pending action is in itself, or that it involves, a question of such a character or arising under such circumstances that a judge in the exercise of his discretion should retain it for decision by the court. Such a case was Barnes v. Youngs[17], as is explained in Green v. Howell[18]. On the contrary, having regard to the terms of the arbitration agreement, the questions presented by the statement of claim seem to me to be such as may very properly be dealt with by arbitration under it.\nOnce the conclusion is reached that the agreement for arbitration is wide enough to embrace the claims presented in the action it is the prima facie duty of the court to allow the agreement to govern (Willesford v. Watson[19]), and the onus of shewing that the case is not a fit one for arbitration is thrown on the person opposing the stay of proceedings. Vawdrey v. Simpson[20]. In my opinion the appellants have not satisfied that onus. The arbitration already had\u2014the appellants' arbitrator having been appointed under protest\u2014resulted in a determination that it is not economically practicable to carry the well beyond its present estimated depth of 2,400 feet at the diameter of ten inches and that the delay in arriving at a decision as to the course to be adopted for the completion of the well is attributable to the appellant company and C. W. MacMillan, its managing director, and in an award to the respondent of the contract price for drilling to an estimated depth of 2,400 feet and his cost of the reference. It does not appear whether the claims now made by the plaintiffs were or were not presented to the arbitrator. The submission of \"all questions between the parties\" by the respondent's notice appointing his arbitrator, was accepted by the appellants when they appointed their arbitrator under protest, was broad enough to include those claims. If they were not presented or dealt with, however, it may yet be open to the appellants to have \"the matters referred\" remitted to the same board, take them up and dispose of them (s. 11) or possibly to have a new board constituted for that purpose. On this phase of the case, which was not discussed at bar and is not before us for decision, I express no view.\nI am, for the foregoing reasons, of the opinion that the order of the Appellate Division granting a stay of proceedings in this action should not be disturbed.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014By a contract made between the parties on the 25th of February, 1915, it was agreed that McNaught. should drill a well to a depth of 2,500 feet for the purpose of discovering oil on the Stokes-Stephens Oil Company's property. Clause 4 of that agreement provided that if at any time during the prosecution of the said work or after the completion thereof any dispute, difference, or question shall arise between the parties thereto touching the said work, or the construction, meaning or effect of those presents, or anything herein contained or the rights or liabilities of the parties under these presents or otherwise in relation to the premises, then every such dispute, difference or question shall be referred to arbitration.\nAn action was instituted by the oil company claiming damages for breach of that contract. They claim that the well has been destroyed by withdrawing the casing therefrom. Application was then made by the contractor McNaught, to stay this action, pursuant to section 5 of the \"Arbitration Act\" of Alberta.\nThe latter section is to the effect that if a party to a submission commence legal proceedings in any court against any other party to the contract, the latter may before pleading apply to the court to stay the proceedings.\nThe honourable judge of original jurisdiction refused the application but his decision was reversed by the Appellate Division.\nThe question is whether the matters disclosed in the action come within the arbitration clause stipulated by the parties in their contract.\nThe plaintiff company claims that the work has been destroyed by the fault or negligence of the contractor.\nThe work of drilling oil wells is a peculiar one and known only to a somewhat limited class of persons. It is no wonder then that the parties have agreed to refer to arbitration matters concerning it and that their rights or their liabilities under the contract should be decided upon by arbitrators. They went even so far as to declare that the meaning of the contract itself should be passed upon by those arbitrators.\nIt seems to me that the intention of the parties in that respect is as formal as it could be and it would require very exceptional circumstances to prevent arbitrators from acting.\nThe plaintiff contends, however, that those circumstances must arise during the prosecution of the work or after its completion and that in the present case the work has not been completed and is not being prosecuted.\nThat provision in the contract relates to time and not to the condition of the work and we could construe it as relating as well to a breach of the contract as to its performance. All the rights of the parties arising out of the contract as well as all their liabilities are within the terms of the submission.\nThe claim which is now being made by the appellant company arises out of the contract and its rights will have to be determined by the construction or meaning of that contract.\nThe parties have agreed to determine that they will have arbitrators to decide their claims, instead of resorting to the ordinary courts of the land. It is our duty, therefore, to act upon that agreement.\nIt is highly desirable, as was stated in the case of Bos v.

O'grady (Plaintiff) Respondent.\n1918: October 15; 1918: October 21; 1918: October 29; 1918: December 9.\nPresent: Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. and Davies, Idington, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\nPresent: Sir Louis Davies C.J. and Idington, Anglin and Brodeur JJ. and Cassels J. ad hoc.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA.\nAppeal\u2014Final judgment\u2014Substantive part of action\u2014Promissory note\u2014 Security\u2014Conditional Payment.\nIn an action in the Court of King's Bench, Man., on a document providing for payment of money a case was stated for the opinion of the court as to whether or not said document was a promissory note. On appeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal thereon:\u2014\nHeld, that the judgment disposed of substantive rights of the parties, and was a final judgment as the same is defined in sec. 2 (e) of the \"Supreme Court Act.\"\nThe document was in the following form:\u2014\n\"On the 15th Sept., 1911, without grace, after date I promise to pay to the order of O'G., A. & Co. at the Bank of Nova Scotia, Winnipeg, the sum of three thousand dollars, value received.\"\n\"Stock certificate for 50 shares Gas Traction Co. Ltd., attached to be surrendered on payment.\"\nThe memo. as to shares was written on the document before it was signed.\nHeld, Brodeur J. dissenting, that the memo. was not an integral part of the document, that it was not a condition but a consequence of payment, and the document was, therefore, a valid promissory note.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1918] 2 W.W.R. 267; 40 D.L.R. 378) reversing ([1918] W.W.R. 115), affirmed.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1], reversing the judgment at the hearing[2], on a stated case.\nThe facts are fully stated in the above head-note. A motion was made to quash the appeal on the ground that the judgment of the Court of Appeal was not final.\nW. L. Scott for the motion referred to St. John Lumber Co. v. Roy[3]; Jones v. Tucker[4].\nGeo. F. Henderson K.C. contra was not called upon.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This is an action to quash for want of jurisdiction. In this case an action was brought on a document claimed to be a promissory note for $3,000. After the statement of claim had been amended a stated case was prepared by the parties which, after reciting the document, asked the opinion of the court as to whether it was a promissory note, and if the court should decide that the document was not a promissory note the plaintiff should have leave to amend, whereas if the court should hold that the document was a promissory note the defendant should have the right to set up any defence he desired. The stated case was heard by Mr. Justice Metcalfe, who held that the document in question was not a promissory note. Appeal was taken to the Court of Appeal; where the judgment below was reversed, the court holding that the document was a promissory note. The defendant now appeals to the Supreme Court and the respondent moves to quash on the ground that the judgment is not a final judgment.\nIn my opinion the judgment below finally disposes of an important element of the defendant's defence and with respect to which he is without remedy if the appeal here is refused.\nMotion dismissed with costs.\nGeo. F. Henderson K.C. for the appellant.\nE. K. Williams for the respondent.\nDavies J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin. Anglin J.\u2014The respondent moves to quash this appeal on the ground that the judgment appealed against is not final. That judgment disposed of a preliminary issue of law submitted upon a stated case. It determined that the document sued upon was a promissory note. It follows, should the judgment stand, that rights peculiar to a promissory note as distinguished from an agreement to pay money not of that character have been finally accorded to the plaintiff, and the defendant has been deprived of defences which he might have had to a mere promise to pay money not in the form of a negotiable instrument. Such rights I cannot but regard as substantive rights within the meaning of the definition of final judgment adopted by Parliament in 1913.\nThe motion, in my opinion, fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This is a motion to quash for want of jurisdiction.\nAn action had been brought on a document claimed to be a promissory note and a stated case was prepared by the parties which, after reciting the document, asked the opinion of the court as to whether it was a promissory note or not. The trial judge held that the document in question was not a promissory note. An appeal was taken and the Court of Appeal held that the document was a promissory note. The defendant now appeals to this court.\nIt seems to me that we have jurisdiction. The right which has been determined by the court below is a substantive right and, in view of the \"Supreme Court Act\" as amended in 1913, we have the power to determine now which of the parties was right as to their contentions affecting the document in question. The motion to quash should be dismissed with costs.\nOn a later day the appeal was heard on the merits.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This appeal comes to us in the form of a stated case, and we are asked whether a certain document is a promissory note or not.\nThe document in question was on a printed form, except the memorandum in the lower left-hand corner and reads as follows:\u2014\nWinnipeg, 1st December, 1910.\nOn the 15th of September, 1911, without grace, after date I promise to pay to the order of O'Grady, Anderson and Co. Ltd., at the Bank of Nova Scotia, Winnipeg, the sum of three thousand dollars.\nValue received.\nJoseph Lecomte.\nStock certificate for\n50 shares Gas Traction Co. Ltd.\nattached to be surrendered on\npayment.\nI am of the opinion that the document is a promissory note, and J answer the question submitted in the affirmative.\nThe point to determine was whether the memorandum on the lower left corner of the note formed an integral or substantive part of the note. I am of the opinion that it did not and answer accordingly.\nIdington J.\u2014I am of the opinion that the instrument in question herein is clearly a promissory note, and hence this appeal should be' dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014On the short ground that the appended words do not qualify the obligation created by the unconditional promise to pay which precedes the maker's signature, I would hold the document before us to be a promissory note within s.s. 1 of sec. 178 of the \"Bills of Exchange Act\" (R.S.C. 1896, ch. 119). Any rights which the maker of the note may have under the appended memorandum will not arise until payment of the note has been made. It is, therefore, not necessary for the holder to aver or to prove readiness and willingness at the date of maturity of the note to deliver to the maker the stock certificate mentioned in the memorandum as a condition of his right to recover on the note. Still less can he be required to aver or to shew tender of the certificate either then or before action.\nAs Hawkins J. said, with the concurrence of Wills J., in Yates v. Evans[5], at p. 448:\u2014\nThe early part of the document is a complete note in itself\u2014there is nothing in the memorandum to qualify the terms of the note and there is no ambiguity in the note * * * All that is necessary for the purpose of suing is that the amount claimed is due.\nThe decision of the English Court of Appeal in Kirkwood v. Carroll[6], overruling Kirkwood v. Smith[7], and holding that s.s. 3 of sec. 83 of the Imperial statute (our s.s. 3 of sec. 176) does not import, as Lord Russell C.J. had held in the earlier case, that\nif the document contains anything more than is there referred to it would not be a valid promissory note,\nvery materially weakens, if it does not wholly destroy, the value of a number of Canadian cases relied on by the appellant.\nI would dismiss the appeal.\nBrodeur J.\u2014The question we are called upon to decide is whether the written document on which the action is based is a promissory note. It reads as follows:\u2014\nWinnipeg, 1st December, 1910.\nOn the 15th of September, 1911, without grace, after date I promise to pay to the order of O'Grady, Anderson and Co. Ltd., at the Bank of Nova Scotia, Winnipeg, the sum of three thousand dollars.\nJoseph Lecomte.\nStock certificate for\n50 shares Gas Traction Co. Ltd.\nattached to be surrendered on payment.\nThe part in italics was written on the document before it was signed. The other part was on the ordinary printed form of a promissory note.\nIt cannot be disputed that these written words, providing that the stock certificate for 50 shares should be surrendered on payment of the $3,000 agreed upon, form part of the document. The signature is inserted in such a manner as to have the effect of authenticating them. Halsbury, vbo. Contract, No. 775.\nIn a case of Campbell v. McKinnon[8], decided in 1859, some words had been written on the back of an ordinary form of promissory note, and Chief Justice Robinson said, at page 614, that\nThe agreement written on the back must be looked upon as part of the instrument, being upon it before and at the time it was signed.\nThe respondent is, then, under abligation to pay to O'Grady, Anderson & Co., or to their order, at such a date a certain sum of money provided that a certain stock certificate should be at the time of payment surrendered to him.\nAnd O'Grady, Anderson & Co., in accepting that document, become entitled to claim under it on the condition that they surrender that stock certificate.\nAnd any subsequent assignee who becomes the holder of that promise to pay cannot claim payment without tendering that stock certificate. But is that document an unconditional promise to pay?\nIt was decided in England, in a case of Bavins v. London and South Western Bank[9], that a document in the form of an ordinary cheque ordering a banker to pay a sum of money\nprovided the reciept form at the foot hereof is duly signed, stamped and dated\nwas not unconditional and, therefore, was not a cheque within the meaning of the Act.\nIn the case of Bavins, as in the present case, the document provided payment to order and was in that respect apparently negotiable; but the obligation for the payee or the bearer to sign a certain receipt in that case, and the obligation for the bearer or the payee in this case to deliver a certain stock certificate, rendered the document a conditional one. As a result, the document we have to construe is not a negotiable instrument the property in which is acquired by any one who takes it bon\u00e2 fide and for value notwithstanding any defect of title in the person from whom he took it. The engagement contained therein could not be transferred by simple delivery of it (Stevens Mercantile Law, 5th ed., page 286).\nSeveral decisions have been brought to our attention in connection with this question of unconditional promise to pay.\nI may divide them into two groups:\u2014\nOne has reference to those promissory notes called lien notes because in the body of the notes it is stipulated that the money which is to be paid is the consideration for sale of property and that neither the title nor the right to possession is to pass until payment. The other group has reference to what I will call suretyship notes. They are notes signed by two persons of whom one is a surety, and stipulation is made in the body of the note that the time given to one of the makers of the note will not prejudice the right of the holder to proceed against the other maker.\nWith regard to the cases on lien notes the jurisprudence was at first somewhat uncertain. They were generally used in connection with the sale of agricultural implements. By the contract, the vendor would retain the ownership of the machines sold to the farmers, but would put the latter in possession thereof. Then the farmers would give their promissory notes, and it would be stipulated in the body of the notes that the title to the machine for which the note was given should remain in the vendors until the note was paid.\nIn 1894, in a case of Merchants Bank v. Dunlop, decided in Manitoba[10], it was held that the recital in the notes should be construed as simply stating the consideration for which the note was given, viz., the sale of the article and the vendor's promise to complete the sale upon payment. The note was held a valid promissory note.\nIn the same year (1894) the same question came before Mr. Justice Maclennan in Chambers in Ontario, on an appeal from the County Court in a case of Dominion Bank v. Wiggins[11]. In rendering his decision Mr. Justice Maclennan said that in view of the general interest and importance of the question he had conferred with the other members of the Court of Appeal, of which he was a member, and that they agreed in his conclusions, viz., that the maker of the note is not compellable to pay when the day of payment arrives, unless at the same time he gets the property with a good title, and the payment to be made is, therefore, not an absolute unconditional payment at all events, such as is required to constitute a good promissory note.\nIn the following cases, the decision of the Ontario case was followed:\u2014\n1897.\u2014Prescott v. Garland[12], by the full court of New Brunswick; 1899.\u2014Bank of Hamilton v. Gillies[13], by the full court of Manitoba; 1906.\u2014Frank v. Gazelle Live Stock Association[14].\nIn the group of suretyship cases there are three decisions:\u2014\n1892.\u2014Yates v. Evans[15]; 1896.\u2014Kirkwood v. Smith[16]; 1903.\u2014Kirkwood v. Carroll[17].\nThe document on which those decisions were based was in the form of a joint and several promissory note by a principal debtor and a surety with a proviso that time may be given to either without the consent of the other, and without prejudice to the rights of the holders \/?\/to proceed against either party.\nIn the Yates Case15, which was the first decided, the court held that the clause was a mere consent or licence that time may be given to the principal debtor and that if time may be so given the surety will not avail itself of that as a defence.\nIn Kirkwood v. Smith16, it was held that the documents were not valid promissory notes.\nBut in 1903, in Kirkwood v. Carroll17, the Court of King's Bench decided that those additions to the promissory notes did not qualify them, and it was declared that Kirkwood v. Smith[18], could not any longer be regarded as an authority.\nIn those documents the makers did not stipulate any conditions in their favour; the words added to the promissory notes were simply licences in favour of the holders; and they are in that respect very different from the lien cases and the present case, where the makers practically said: I am ready to pay at such a date, but provided you give me a full title to the machine sold, or provided you give me my stock certificates.\nIt is a condition which is imposed upon the creditor of the debt and in favour of the maker of the alleged promissory note.\nThe payment of the money and the surrender of the stock certificates are to be contemporaneous acts.\nAnson, Contracts, 7th ed., p. 299, says:\u2014\nIt is safe to say that, in the absence of clear indications to the contrary, promises, each of which forms the whole consideration for the other, will be held to be concurrent conditions.\nApplying these principles to the present case I come to the conclusion that the document in question is a conditional one, and that it does not constitute a valid promissory note as defined by section 176 of the \"Bills of Exchange Act.\"\nI would adopt the views expressed by the Court of King's Bench and by Mr. Justice Fullerton in the Court of Appeal.\nCassels J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: L.

Where, through no fault of the vendor, the quantity of land sold proves to be much less than that mentioned in the deed, and there is no warranty as to quantity, the purchaser is without remedy.\nThe description of the land sold as \"containing 271 acres\" or \"271 acres more or less\" is not such a warranty.

Idington J. contra.\nJudgment of the Appellate Division (36 D.L.R. 349) reversed, Idington and Duff JJ. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], reversing the judgment on the trial in favour of the defendants.\nThe question for decision on the appeal is stated in the above head-note.\nA. S. Matheson for the appellants.\nChrysler K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE :\u2014The appellant by deed dated 27th February, 1909, agreed to convey to the respondent his farm described as follows:\u2014\nAll that part of section three (3) Township eight (8) Range one (1) west of the fifth (5th) Principal Meridian, lying west of the river, said land containing two hundred and seventy-one (271) acres and being located in Alberta, Canada. This description is in accordance with that in the appellant's certificate of title from the South Alberta Land Registration District which adds, however,\nas shewn on a plan of survey of the said township signed at Ottawa, 24th August, 1898, by Edouard Deville, Surveyor-General of Dominion lands and of record in the Department of the Interior.\nA transfer dated 15th Nov., 1910, as printed in the record, but which is undoubtedly an error for 1909, was made by the appellant to the respondent; and the latter has a certificate of title dated 1st December, 1909.\nThrough an error in the survey the property is described as containing 271 acres when as a fact it has been subsequently ascertained to contain only 164.80 acres. It is admitted that there was an innocent mistake common to both parties.\nExcept that the deficiency is so remarkably large there is nothing to distinguish this case from any other in which the contract calls for a larger area than the property actually contains.\nNothing is more clearly established in the practice of conveyancing, and it is so laid down in all the books, than the rule that after completion of the conveyance the purchaser who has had the opportunity of raising objection to any least deficiency in the quantity agreed to be conveyed has no further remedy. The so-called exceptions to the rule include a representation made at the sale collateral to the contract for sale and amounting to a warranty of the truth of the fact stated.\nI can find in this case no evidence whatever either of an intention on the part of either party that there should be any warranty or that such was given. The testimony carries the matter no further than the written document which is the very ordinary statement of quantity in the property agreed to be sold and which it is admitted the appellant had the best reason for believing was correct. If we were to hold that there was ground for decreeing compensation in this case, I do not know how it could be refused in any case at all, as the established rule would be reversed and the conveyance with payment of the purchase money would cease to be a final settlement of the sale.\nI agree further with Mr. Justice Stuart that no such claim as that on which the judgment appealed from is based ought to have been admitted upon the pleadings which raise an entirely different one. Even if the respondent were entitled to any relief I do not think the judgment of the Appellate Division could stand. The agreement was for the sale of the farm at a named sum and this has been carried out. There can, I think, be no possible warrant for the court to substitute for the terms of the agreement a purchase price arrived at by a pro rata one on the acreage of the farm. This is no way to arrive at the damages sustained by the respondent.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nDAVIES J.\u2014I concur with my brother Anglin J. and I would allow this appeal with costs and restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014This appeal presents a case which is remarkable, not only by reason of its peculiar facts, but also by reason of the very peculiar state of our law relevant thereto, being such as it is. The facts are undisputed. The inferences therefrom may vary.\nAccording to the law as presented by appellant we are asked to render a judgment which would produce not only a bare denial of justice but a shocking injustice. The judgment appealed from, no doubt, if left standing, would execute substantial justice between the parties.\nThe real question is whether or not the law is such as appellant contends.\nThe appellants and respondent in 1909 lived in the State of Washington. The respondent had a farm there which he valued at seven thousand dollars and the appellant, P. C. Hansen, agreed to buy at that price, pay three thousand five hundred dollars cash and transfer a piece of land in Alberta represented by him to contain two hundred and seventy-one acres. The cash part of the price was paid and then the appellants and the respondent executed an agreement, dated 27th February, 1909, made between the former as parties of the first part and the latter as party of the second part whereby it was witnessed:\nThat the said party of the first part, in consideration of the covenants and agreements hereinafter made by the party of the second part, hereby covenants and agrees that he the said, first party will deliver unto the second party hereto a warranty deed shewing a clear title to the following described property, to wit:\nAll that part of section three (3) Township eight (8) Range one (i) west of the Fifth (5th) Principal Meridian, lying west of the river, said land containing two hundred and seventy-one (271) acres, and being located in Alberta, Canada.\nThe instrument then proceeded to bind the party of the second part that he would\nin consideration of the covenants of the said first party\ndeliver a warranty deed conveying to him the lands described free of encumbrance.\nIt is to be observed that there is nothing in this instrument relative to the cash part of the transaction or indeed in any way pretending to set forth the entire actual bargain between the parties. It relates only to part of that entire contract. It is not an ordinary contract of purchase and sale yet may fall within the rules of law applicable thereto. The conveyance from respondent provided for by this instrument was duly given and his land resold by appellant. All that the appellant P. C. Hansen gave to respondent in way of assumed compliance with his covenant, above quoted, was by a transfer in the usual form under the \"Alberta Land Titles Act,\" dated 15th November, 1909, in which the lands professed to be thereby transferred were described as follows:\u2014\nThat portion of section three (3) in Township eight (8) Range one (1) west of the Fifth Meridian, which lies to the west of the Old Man River as shewn on a plan of survey of the said Township signed at Ottawa 24th August, 1898, by Edouard Deville, Surveyor-General of Dominion Lands, and of record in the Department of the Interior containing two hundred and seventy-one acres more or less.\nWhich is followed by a reservation as follows:\u2014\nReserving unto His Majesty, His successors and assigns all gold and silver and unto the Calgary and Edmonton Land Company, Limited, their successors and assigns, all other minerals and the right to work the same.\nIt is to be again observed that this description bears a resemblance to yet is far from being identical with that in the covenant of 27th February, 1909, above quoted.\nCan it be held in law to have been identical therewith? That is one of the questions to be considered herein.\nThis transfer professed on its face to have been made in consideration of $3,500 and the receipt thereof is therein acknowledged. There were no covenants expressed therein of any kind.\nThe \"Land Titles Act\" implies only one on the part of the vendor and that is one for further assurance of a very limited nature which does not touch what is involved herein.\nThe expression in the description used in the covenant of 27th February, 1909, was such as called for absolutely 271 acres, but is modified in the transfer to read 271 acres more or less.\nCan the latter be said to be a fulfilment of the obligations in the former?\nI pass the reservation of minerals, though a clear departure from the contract, because nothing is made of that herein, and confine my question to the rest of what appears.\nThat transfer was registered and a certificate of title issued, dated 1st December, 1909, constituting respondent the owner of an estate in fee simple in lands which are described substantially the same as in the transfer containing two hundred and seventy-one acres more or less.\nIt turned out upon investigation some months later that within that part of section three thus described there were only one hundred and sixty-four 8\/10 acres instead of the promised two hundred and seventy-one acres.\nThe parties seem to have been friendly and it was for a long time assumed that their efforts at rectification made first by claims on the railway company which had sold the land to Hansen, and next upon the Dominion Government, made through, first one parliamentary representative and then through another, his successor, might bring relief. Ail that ended nowhere; but it accounts for the loss of time which had elapsed before resorting to the court on the 1st November, 1912.\nHad the litigious spirit been predominant and suit entered immediately upon discovery and before respondent's Washington farm had been resold by Hansen, I think there can be little doubt but that rescission might have been had of the entire contracts between the parties.\nIt seems to be admitted that is now impossible. Hence authorities bearing upon that aspect of the case, of which a few are to be found, are almost useless for our present purpose. The latest application of the law relevant thereto, at least up to the stage when a conveyance has been accepted, appears in Lee v. Rayson[2].\nAnd the large number of decisions in specific performance cases, which have been cited to us, shewing that compensation has been many times insisted upon by the courts, seem still more remote from the business in hand.\nIn any such case as presented herein there would have been clearly either a refusal of specific performance or it would have been only granted with compensation.\nIn his evidence P. C Hansen was asked and answered as follows:\u2014\nMr. McDonald: You do admit that you told him your land had 271 acres in it?\nA. I think I told Henry there was 271 acres, at least I told him that is what the deed called for.\nMr. Matheson You thought at that time there were 271 acres?\nA. Yes, certainly, because I had the deed for it.\nand from his examination for discovery there is the following evidence:\u2014\n13: Q. Did you ever mention to him the number of acres that were there? A. I told him that according to the deed it was 271 or 272 acres, I think. That is my recollection. Of course it was a long time ago.\n14. Q. And at that time he had not had any opportunity of measuring the land or examining it? A. No.\n15. Q. As a matter of fact how many acres are there in that piece?\nA. Well, that is pretty hard for me to say, you know, I never measured it. I bought the land and 1 got a title for it and of course I bought hundreds of acres of land and I have never measured a piece of land yet. I have always taken the title for it.\nThis has been relied upon, as evidencing a collateral warranty, enabling two of the learned judges in the Appellate Division to hold respondent entitled to relief, though recognizing the general rule that after a contract of sale and purchase has been executed by the delivery of the conveyance there can be no relief got by a purchaser, by reason of any failure on the part of the vendor to give thereby what he had bargained to give, unless there has been actual fraud on his part or some covenant in the deed of conveyance upon which he can sue.\nMr. Justice Beck agreed in the result but apparently on the ground that the general rule thus recognized was not, in the Alberta jurisdiction, where an agreement for the sale of land is not followed by a deed of grant, but by a transfer, which in his opinion is, in effect, only an order to the registrar to cancel the vendor's certificate of title, and to issue a new one in the purchaser's name leaving, in his opinion, in full force and effect all the covenants of the agreement for sale.\nThere certainly is much to be said for this view if, as I understand, the system introduced by the \"Land Titles 'Act\" into Alberta, that it forbids covenants in the instrument of transfer, and that in itself it is of no value until recognized, and given vitality by the registrar's certificate, which in truth is what passes the title; and also if we have regard to the origin and development of the rule in question.\nBut unfortunately the doctrine it represents has not been confined to transactions relative to the sale of some interests in land.\nIt is set forth by that very able judge, the late Lord Justice James, in the case of Leggott v. Barrett[3], at foot of page 30, as follows:\u2014\nbut I cannot help saying I think it is very important, according to my view of the law of contracts, both at common law and in equity, that if parties have made an executory contract which is to be carried out by a deed afterwards executed, the real completed contract between the parties is to be found in the deed, and that you have no right whatever to look at the contract, although it is recited in the deed, except for the purpose of construing the deed itself. You have no right to look at the contract either for the purpose of enlarging or diminishing or modifying the contract which is to be found in the deed itself. * * * unless there be a suit for rescinding the deed on the ground of fraud, or for altering it on the ground of mistake.\nThis was said, not in a case relative to the sale of land, but where the only questions involved depended upon the terms of a dissolution of partnership, and how far the defendant was bound by the terms as expressed in the deed of dissolution, which had been preceded by an agreement in writing possibly capable of a wider import than in the said deed.\nIn the same case Lord Justice Brett, perhaps somewhat more concisely, said as follows:\u2014\nI entirely agree with my Lord that where there is a preliminary contract in words which is afterwards reduced into writing, or where there is a preliminary contract in writing which is afterwards reduced into a deed, the rights of the parties are governed in the first case entirely by the writing, and in the second case entirely by the deed; and if there be any difference between the words and the written document in the first case, or between the written agreement and the deed in the other case, the rights of the parties are entirely governed by the superior document and by the governing part of that document.\nIt might be argued that it was not necessary for the decision of that case to express any such opinions and hence these expressions should be held to be mere obiter dicta. Indeed, Brett L. J. distinctly says he could see no difference at all between the preliminary contract and the deed.\nBe that as it may, the definition of the doctrine as expressed by James L.J. has received acceptance by others on the Bench, and writers of text books.\nWhy, as it is thus expressed, there should be found ground for relief in the case of mistake which, I take it, means mutual mistake, and then only limited to the case of a possible alteration of the deed, must puzzle any one but those conversant with the peculiarities which our judge-made law has so frequently developed.\nAnd I may be permitted to remark that if we look for its parallel in the wider field of law applied to mercantile transactions we will not easily find its application to have been permitted there to frustrate the execution of justice.\nWe will find that the common sense of mankind engaged in these pursuits has so impressed the judicial mind therewith, that it has so developed the law, as generally to furnish implications that execute the purposes of the contracting parties and thereby escape the undesirable consequences of a rigid adherence to such a rule.\nThe rigid application of the doctrine has doubtless received a greater measure of success, if I might say so, in relation to contracts respecting land than in those relative to mercantile transactions. This has probably arisen because the former have been more generally conducted, than the latter, through skilled men ready to apply that due diligence, which courts are apt to insist upon, in the way of procuring safeguarding covenants following careful examination of what is being bought or sold.\nBut what measure of diligence should be required of men dealing in wild lands? Must they have a survey made?\nI am almost tempted to ask if when and where the reason for the rule ceases should it not then also cease to operate?\nPassing all these suggestions and coming to the question of the observation of the rule as stated above, we find (in 1883) the case of Palmer v. Johnson[4], decided by A. L. Smith J. holding expressly that a purchaser, after conveyance and without any covenant therein upon which he could rely, might resort to a stipulation in the original contract providing for compensation in case of error, misstatement or omission being discovered in the particulars\u2014otherwise meaning the terms of sale.\nIn this he professed to follow the law as laid down in Bos v. Helsham[5], and In re Turner and Skelton[6]. He discarded the decision by V.-C. Malins, in the case of Manson v. Thacker[7], a short time previously and essentially of the same nature in its leading features. The reason assigned by him for so doing was that Malins V.-C. had rested his decision upon the grounds that the purchaser should by the exercise of due diligence have observed the misstatement before conveyance executed.\nThis decision of A. L. Smith J. was upheld in the Court of Appeal[8]. Of that appellate court Brett M.R., whose opinion expressive of the rule of law applicable to the case of an executory contract followed by an executed contract and the resultant consequences thereof, has been quoted above, was the first to give his opinion in support of the decision by A. L. Smith J.\nOne might be tempted to suggest that the two opinions are irreconcilable; but Brett M.R., speaking doubtless of the argument which had pressed that view, says as follows:\u2014\nSmith L.J. in his judgment, from which this appeal is brought, points out all that was there meant, \"All that was there held was,\" he says, \"that where the parties enter into a preliminary contract which is afterwards to be carried out by a deed to be executed, there the com- plete contract is to be found in the deed, and that the court has no right whatever to look at the preliminary contract,\" but Bos v. Helsham[9], had decided that this particular contract for compensation was one which was not to be carried out by the deed of conveyance, and therefore it did not come within the principle of the law and was not merged in the deed.\nWith great respect for the memories of these judges I doubt if the explanation is quite satisfactory. It certainly did not occur to the astute mind of Jessel M.R. in his more elaborate judgment in, In re Turner and Skelton[10], or to that of Malins V.-C. in Manson v. Thacker[11], where each had to grapple with the same doctrine though of course not with the identical expression of it.\nMoreover, the opinion of James L.J. expressly covered the law of contracts both at common law and in equity. By the latter, as lucidly shewn in the case of Holroyd v. Marshall[12], at page 209, there is in a sense no need for a formal conveyance, as a valid contract for a present transfer passes at once the beneficial interest to the vendee.\nThe fair deduction from these cases is, I submit, a narrowing of the rule and limiting it to the mere effect of the conveyance of the legal estate which does not as a matter of course seem to have such elemental force in it as to extinguish anything in the contract of purchase but what is strictly limited to the passing of that common law legal estate.\nAnd what of it when it fails to pass title to the substantial part of that which the parties believed they were contracting for? Does the doctrine only rest upon a mere play upon words, or was it developed from and does it rest upon the requirement of due diligence and subject to the limitations so implied. However, if the distinction drawn by Brett M.R. be sound, then it is very helpful in maintaining the judgment appealed from by reason of its limiting the operation of the rule simply to what may be a mere fractional part of the contract, leaving all else intact and operative.\nAs already pointed out, not only was there the verbal assurance of there being in fact two hundred and seventy-one acres offered, which the appellant admits, but also there was an express contract under seal for a warranty deed of two hundred and seventy-one acres, which never has been given, indeed could not be effectively given in the Province of Alberta. The respondent, doubtless relying upon the assurance of appellant, P. C. Hansen, was induced to accept a certificate of title which professed to be for two hundred and seventy-one acres \"more or less\" but in fact falls one hundred and six acres short of the two hundred and seventy-one acres promised.\nTrue there was not a specific agreement for compensation but there was a collateral agreement upon which, applying ordinary reason and common sense, the respondent was quite as much entitled to rely for his protection which would, upon being enforced, bring him the equivalent result in damages. And under the peculiar circumstances of the giving of the written contract, which did not profess to deal with the entire transaction between the parties, I think its nature and purport may well be looked to as shedding light upon the meaning and intention of the verbal assurance that there were two hundred and seventy-one acres to be given.\nI observe the attempt faintly made by Hansen to fall back upon what the deed, as he alleges, had expressed. A comparison of the dates and other facts leaves, as highly probable, the inference that at the time he spoke of giving such assurance he had never seen what he calls the deed. If it was present at the bargaining I fail, to see why the conveyancers drawing up the written covenant did not incorporate the language used therein. Not only did he fail to catch the expression \"more or less\" therein, but also the entire wording of the description varies so much from either that in the so-called deed from the railway company to Hansen or the certificate of the registrar, that I am driven to the conclusion that neither was at hand.\nThe transfer from the railway company to Hansen is dated 20th Feb., 1909; the affidavit of execution thereof is dated 22nd Feb., 1909; the affidavit of Kemmis as to value, doubtless for the registrar's use in fixing fees, is dated 26th Feb., 1909; and the certificate of the registrar is dated 1st day of March, 1909.\nHaving regard to the relative localities where these several acts where respectively done, and the dwelling place of the parties concerned herein, and place where the bargaining and execution of the covenant took place, it is extremely improbable that Hansen on the 27th February, or before, had had any opportunity of seeing, much less of speaking from, the deed as he suggests.\nThese facts and dates are important not only as a means of rendering more definite the terms of the verbal assurance he gave, but also as reflecting what purpose was intended in the giving of that assurance.\nI have not the slightest doubt it was fully intended to persuade respondent to rely upon it, and that he did rely upon it and none the less so because it was followed or accompanied by a covenant emphatically consistent therewith.\nSuch being the facts, I am unable to distinguish between the force and effect thereof and what was in the case of De Lassalle v. Guildford[13], given effect to, in the way of a warranty for good drainage given by an intended lessor to an intended lessee who was induced to take and took possession under a lease which had no covenant relative to drainage. That was an action for damages and so far as I can see could have been successfully answered if maintainable by just such arguments as appellants have presented here, relying upon the line of authority I have already dealt with.\nLet us test the matter in another way, as exemplified in the case of Piggott v. Stratton[14], when the representation of a vendor that he was bound by some lease from others not to build so as to obstruct a sea-view of those choosing to build on land he was selling, was held enforceable by injunction, though the same argument doubtless was used as herein, and as is implied in the doctrine in question, that the vendee should have protected himself by a covenant in the deed but had not. How is that decision consistent with the doctrine? It is only possible to make it so by assuming that the law never intended to deprive purchasers of the plain rights which a solemn representation carries with it even when mistakenly made in good faith.\nThe converse of this case, as it were, where there was no evidence of representation to be relied upon and nothing enabling the plaintiff to claim the benefit of restrictive covenants, came up in the case of Renals v. Cowlishaw[15], when Hall V.-C. dismissed the action and was upheld in doing so by the Court of Appeal[16].\nThe principles involved in that case come to be dealt with in the case of Spicer v. Martin[17], where, after conveyance, it was discovered that the purchaser might lose the benefits of restrictive covenants unless an injunction granted and it was granted accordingly and upheld on somewhat different grounds from mere misrepresentation.\nThe case of Lagunas Nitrate Co. v. Lagunas Syndicate[18], at pages 402, 403, 413-15, 417, 434 and 456, shews how a defendant was, long after conveyance, in absence of fraud, and where rescission had become impossible, granted damages plaintiff was entitled to, arising out of the condition of the property at the time of conveyance not having been such as plaintiffs were entitled to have it. Yet there was no covenant in the conveyance to rely upon. Again, the case of Clarke v. Ramuz[19], dependent upon the doctrine of equity, which I have already adverted to, of the vendee being the trustee of the purchaser from the time the contract of purchase had been formed, shews how, even after conveyance, the duty of such vendor to protect the property from deterioration has been enforced.\nThere had been in that case some earth in substantial quantities-removed from the property after the making of the contract of sale, but before the conveyance, and the vendee was condemned to pay damages on discovery after the conveyance.\nThis case seems rather a decisive answer to the argument founded upon due diligence. Surely the vendee could have seen the earth in question had been taken without the knowledge of either vendee or vendor.\nAll these cases I refer to, not as strictly in point decisive of the question raised herein but of how much care is to be taken in applying some expressions of opinion of very able judges which, if given effect to in the widest sense the language used might be capable of, would lead to doing an injustice which the courts have in these cases striven to avoid on one ground or another.\nAnd the more I consider them the more I find it necessary to observe the terms of the covenant to give the respondent two hundred and seventy-one acres. It was not a mere symbol of numbers that appellant agreed to give but of so many acres of ground.\nIt must not be overlooked that men, when dealing in wild lands, think of the acreage thereof and not of the illusory description a surveyor's blundering work had put upon paper.\nI am quite aware that, in Doe d. Meyrick v. Meyrick[20], and other cases, the rule has been laid down that, where in a deed there has been a general and specific description of the property, only that specifically described will pass. But I think we must ever observe, as was done in Ringer v. Cann[21] by Baron Parke and cited with approval by Wood V.-C. in Jenner v. Jenner[22], at page 366, the object of the parties.\nAnd the fact should not be overlooked that what is thus attempted to be put off upon the confiding purchaser as worth three thousand five hundred dollars to secure which to respondent was the object of the parties here, had almost immediately before been bought for sixteen hundred and twenty-six dollars by the appellant P. C. Hansen.\nThis is not the case of only an immaterial or small fractional part of that bargained about being in question, but more nearly resembles that which was involved in the case of Cole v. Pope[23], where, without actual fraud as here, the price had been paid and a conveyance got by a purchaser of what in truth as it turned put the vendor had no title to and the purchaser was held entitled to recover his purchase money.\nThe decision in the case of Joliffe v. Baker[24], so much relied upon, is, if we examine closely the facts, possibly reconcilable with justice and common sense.\nThe vendor in the opening letter of negotiations had stated in his description of the property, the quantity of land to be three acres, but the description in the contract of purchase, drawn up later and after the purchaser had come to inspect and presumably inspected the premises, alleged the property to \"contain by estimation three acres or thereabouts.\" It turned out that there were only two acres, one rood and twelve perches. The price was \u00a3270. There were upon it a four-room cottage, a pig-sty, cow-pen, garden, and a capital meadow, which facts suggest that the shortage in mere acreage was probably in the eyes of the parties but a comparatively trifling part of the whole of that which was sold (although assessed at \u00a350), and might well fall within the allowance therefor in the description.\nThere was nothing in that case upon which the plaintiff could by any possibility hang a claim of warranty beyond the not very uncommon one that the purchaser taking and paying for a thing which turns out to be a trifle less valuable than he had expected, and hence was driven to rely upon alleged fraud, which was quite untenable.\nThe court could not find anything in the conveyance upon which to found a warranty of quantity when that was expressly referred to as by estimation. I fail to see much resemblance between that case and this. In closing his long judgment Mr. Justice Williams refers to a number of cases of defect in the quantity including Portman v. Mill[25], and says he cannot extract a rule therefrom. Neither can I, yet I cannot escape feeling a suspicion derived from the tone of his closing remarks, that had he been confronted with such a case as the Portman Case (1) or that herein he might have found a remedy.\nIt is observable that it was only in the next year that A. L. Smith J. who had concurred in the result decided Palmer v. Johnson[26], cited above and I may add that the greater number of the other decisions I have referred to, and rely upon herein, were decided since the Joliffe Case [27] and shew clearly that there can be found a collateral warranty resting upon the representation made; and especially so, when as herein that is equally consistent therewith followed by a covenant not yet fulfilled, instead of being followed, as in the Joliffe Case(3), by an agreement which by its very terms so modified the representations as to render the representation worthless.\nI need not enter upon the question of what a collateral warranty may or must consist of, for I agree, speaking generally, with what Mr. Justice Walsh has set forth in that regard, and the meaning thereof is illustrated by the cases I have cited.\nAlthough holding with him that which he relies upon to be sufficient reason for dismissing the appeal, I am yet inclined to think that the covenant under seal was not extinguished by what transpired. The gist of the rule in question relative to an executory contract being extinguished by the executed contract, implies that it has been substantially executed and thus has carried out the purpose and attained the object of the contracting parties.\nCan it be said to have been executed in this case unless we assume that the respondent's assent to the transactions relied upon as its execution was induced by the representation?\nI am disposed to attach more importance to the indirect effect, not limiting it to the words \"Warranty deed\" but the entire tenor of the written covenant, than Mr. Justice Walsh does, as shewing the purpose of the appellant in making the representation he did and of the respondent in accepting it.\nLet us revert, in that connection, to a consideration of the doctrine of its extinction as respectively expressed by James and Brett LL.J. and some of the reasons for its existence.\nBrett L.J. distinctly puts it upon the ground of the superior nature of the later writing substituting the oral agreement, or deed substituting the prior writing.\nIf that expresses its meaning we have before us in this case a covenant under seal which is followed by a transfer which is not under seal and a certificate o title which is neither under seal nor given any force or vitality by virtue of any seal.\nThe superior document, if common law notions relative to the value of a seal are to prevail, is that covenant, under seal, which has never been fulfilled if due effect is to be given to all the language used relevant to what was contracted for. And as the superior document has never been fulfilled may I suggest it has not been extinguished?\nA reason for part of the operation of the rule laid down by those learned judges, which, however, is not given expression to by them, is that rule of law against the admission of oral evidence varying that which has been written. The real reason, I submit, for the rule in question is, that, in such transactions as the sale of real estate, the parties are presumed to have used due diligence and care and to have expressed in the later and final writing, what they mutually had agreed upon and hence it cannot be varied by oral evidence.\nAs governing what in the vast majority of cases happens in England or Ontario, the rule is a wise one and not lightly to be set aside, but as Mr. Justice Beck has suggested is it under the circumstances in which parties find themselves in those jurisdictions in which the Torrens system of passing titles prevails, likely to be as useful or workable as elsewhere?\nAnd when we find in the reports of the courts of our western provinces the number of cases we do, where its observance may be suspected of having produced injustice, it becomes our duty not too hastily to extend its operation but to scrutinize closely the facts in each case and see if in truth they permit the operation of the rule.\nWe have seen how by later development that which may be held to be a collateral part of the purchase contract is not supposed to be extinguished by only that relevant to the passing of the legal estate.\nDoes not all that bring us back to the original question of whether or not any such passing of title can be said to have taken place in pursuance of a covenant under seal, to convey by a method clearly impossible as contracted for, two hundred and seventy-one acres of land when that which has been given neither in fact nor in form executes the purpose of the covenant?\nI doubt it so much that I cannot see my way to allow an appeal by a judgment that would rest upon an affirmative answer to the query I put. As already stated I hold the representation made, coupled with the covenant as illuminating the meaning and purpose thereof, such a warranty as relied upon below.\nI have examined all the authorities cited and many more to ascertain whether or not it really is law as suggested that a man can misrepresent and mislead no matter how innocent of fraud, and profit thereby at the expense of another who has had no fair opportunity to test the truth of the representation.\nI submit there is no justification for imputing to the law such inevitable and unjust results as herein claimed for expressions, in terms too wide, of a doctrine that is supposed to be so well known and daily relied upon as that in question.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nDUFF J. (dissenting).\u2014I think the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nANGLIN J.\u2014I am with respect of the opinion that this appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored.\nThe plaintiff (respondent) very properly concedes that, owing to his delay in instituting this action, the absence of fraud and the impossibility of a restitutio in integrum he is not entitled to the equitable remedy of rescission. His alternative claim to recover damages he rests on (a) a warranty as to the quantity of land which he asserts is implied in the agreement for sale by the words in the description of the land to be transferred, \"containing two hundred and: seventy-one acres,\" which follow its designation (in itself definite, unequivocal and complete) as that part of a defined section lying west of the river; and (b) an alleged collateral warranty consisting in a verbal representation that the parcel in fact contained 271 acres.\nThere can be no question as to the identity of the parcel with which the parties were dealing. The plaintiff got the land for which he bargained. Both he and the defendant were quite innocently mistaken, as to the acreage, which was only 164.80 instead of 271. There is, therefore, neither a suggestion nor ground for a suggestion of fraud. The preliminary contract contains no provision for compensation for any deficiency in the quantity or quality of the estate. It may also be worth noting that before he took his transfer the plaintiff had learned that there was a very considerable deficiency in the quantity of the land, although he ascertained its precise extent only afterwards.\nIn the transfer itself and in the certificate of title obtained by the plaintiff words of designation, the equivalent of those used in the preliminary agreement, are followed by the words,\ncontaining two hundred and seventy-one acres more or less.\nThe words, \"more or less,\" cannot cover a deficiency of 106.20 acres in a parcel supposed to contain 271 acres. Portman v. Mill[28]. I do not, therefore, see any material difference between the description in the transfer and certificate and that in the preliminary agreement. Moreover, since the transfer was made in the form prescribed and customary in the Province of Alberta, it must be taken to be the form of conveyance for which the parties to the agreement in ended to stipulate. I am, therefore, with respect, unable to assent to the view, which I understand Mr. Justice Beck to express, that the doctrine of merger of the preliminary agreement in the conveyance is inapplicable to such a transfer. I agree with Mr. Justice Walsh that (at all events in the absence of evidence as to the meaning according to the law of the State of Washington of the term \"warranty deed\" used in the agreement) the provision for such a deed cannot be taken to import a stipulation that the transfer to be given under the \"Alberta Land Titles Act\" should contain a warranty of the quantity of the land. If that should be its meaning a serious obstacle to reliance being placed upon such a stipulation would probably be presented by the acceptance, especially with knowledge of a deficiency, of a transfer without any such warranty.\nBut whether the transfer itself or the preliminary agreement is looked to, I am of the opinion that the words \"containing two hundred and seventy-one acres\" or \"containing two hundred and seventy-one acres more or less\" are merely a part of the description, probably to be regarded as falsa demonstratio (see cases collected in 10 Hals., p. 407, n. (g) ), and not importing a covenant or warranty as to quantity which could found a demand either for compensation or for damages after the completion of the contract. Penrose v. Knight[29]; Follis v. Porter[30]; Clayton v. Leech[31]; Dart on Vendors and Purchasers (1905 ed.), p. 812; Williams on Vendors & Purchasers (1911 ed.), pp. 6, 10, 11. In an action to enforce the contract while still executory a court of equity might of course entertain a claim for compensation as incidental to its jurisdiction to grant specific performance. The right to that relief would not rest upon breach of any warranty implied in a statement of quantity in the description but would be based upon the equitable doctrine of mistake. After completion, however, unless a case can be made for rescission (Debenham v. Sawbridge[32]), the only remedy is by an action at law for damages. Neither innocent mistake nor innocent misrepresentation will support such an action. It must either be in tort for deceit or upon contract for breach of warranty. Jolliffe v. Baker[33], at pages 267-9. Moral fraud, the essential of deceit, is entirely absent. The transfer does not contain any contract of warranty. Lord Moulton, in Heilbut v. Buckleton[34], at page 47, states the nature of such a contract and indicates the difficulty of establishing it when not expressed. There is no covenant in the transfer which gives a remedy. As Mr. Justice Stuart has said, we have been referred to no case where it has been decided that in a conveyance a statement of the number of acres contained in the parcel following the description of it amounts to a warranty. That appears to have been rather assumed in Jolliffe v. Baker (2), (in other aspects a strong authority for the defendant) in the latter part of the judgment of Watkins Williams J. (pp. 273-4). But that learned judge held that the terms of the description, regarded as a warranty, were literally true and that there had been no breach. That case is clearly not authority for the proposition that a mere statement of quantity in a description of land imports a warranty.\nThe claim based upon an alleged verbal warranty is in a position even more unsatisfactory. The only representation as to quantity of which there is any evidence amounted, in my opinion, to nothing more than a statement by the defendant that his own deed called for 271 acres\u2014as in fact it did. Whether a vendor's representation on a sale imports a warranty is always a question of intention. The existence of that intention must be established. It is a matter of fact to be determined upon \"the totality of the evidence.\" Heilbut v. Buckleton[35]. I am unable to discover in the record any evidence which would justify a finding that the defendant intended to make, or that the plaintiff understood him to make, a contract of warranty. On the contrary, the reference by the defendant, when speaking to the plaintiff of the quantity of land, to the description in his deed would to me rather seem to exclude the idea that any such undertaking was contemplated. Moreover, I doubt whether the statement of claim can be regarded as alleging a collateral warranty. If not, it would be unsafe for an appellate court to base a judgment on the existence of an intention which was not put in issue, which the defendant had not a fair opportunity of meeting, and upon which we are deprived of the advantage of a finding by the trial judge.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] 12 Alta.

[1914], c. 71, ss. 8 (1) and 15 (1).\nBy sec. 15, sub-sec. 1, of the \u201cLibel and Slander Act\u201d (R.S.O. [1914], ch. 71), the defendant, in an action against a newspaper company, is not entitled to take advantage of the want of notice required by sec. 8 unless the name of the proprietor and publisher is stated at a specified place in the paper. In a case in which there was no proof that the name was so stated:\u2014\nHeld, reversing the judgment of the Appellate Division (43 Ont. L.R. 218; 43 D.L.R. 463), that the failure of the plaintiff to allege non\u2011compliance with the requirements of sec. 15 (1) in his reply to a plea setting up want of notice is not an admission of the fact of such compliance.\nHeld, also, that under the practice in Ontario, even if the defendant by his plea alleges such compliance, the same is not admitted by the absence of denial in the replication.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], affirming, by an equal division of opinion, the judgment at the trial by which the plaintiff\u2019s action was dismissed.\nThe plaintiff brought action for an alleged libel published in the Toronto World, having served the notice required by sec. 8, sub-sec. 1, of the \u201cLibel and Slander Act\u201d on the city editor of the paper. The defendant company, claiming that this was not service on the defendant as the section required pleaded want of notice to which plea issue was joined. The trial judge dismissed the action on this ground and his judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Division. An appeal was taken to the Supreme Court of Canada, and when it came on for hearing, the question was raised by the court of there being no proof on the record that the requirements of sec. 15, sub-sec. 1, had been complied with, and counsel for the respondents contended that it was admitted by the pleadings.\nD.J. Coffey for the appellant.\nKenneth Mackenzie for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by\nANGLIN J,\u2014The plaintiff appeals from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[2], affirming, on an equal division of opinion, the judgment of Middleton J. granting a motion by the defendant for the dismissal of this action on the ground of non\u2011compliance by the plaintiff with sub-sec. 1 of sec. 8 of the \u201cLibel and Slander Act\u201d (R.S.O., ch. 71). The notice of the alleged libel complained of, addressed to \u201cThe Editor of the World,\u201d was delivered to the city editor of that newspaper. Middleton J. held this insufficient, following Burwell v. London Free Press Co.[3], and Benner v. Mail Printing Co.[4]. By his appeal the plaintiff seeks to have these decisions overruled.\nThe defendant\u2019s motion was made under Ont. Con. Rule 222, upon admissions contained in the plaintiff\u2019s pleadings and examination for discovery disclosing the fact above stated.\nSec. 15, sub-sec. 1, of the \u201cLibel and Slander Act\u201d (R.S.O., ch. 71) provided that: No defendant shall be entitled to the benefit of sections 8 and 14 of this Act unless the name of the proprietor and publisher and the address of publication are stated either at the head of the editorials or on the front page of the newspaper.\nWe had occasion recently to consider a corresponding, provision of the \u201cAlberta Libel Act\u201d in Scown v. Herald Publishing Co.[5] Nowhere in the material before the court does it appear that the defendant company complied with the requirements of sub-sec. 1 of sec. 15. The newspaper itself, the production of a copy of which is made prim\u00e2 facie evidence by subsection 2, is not in the record.\nTo meet this difficulty, raised by the court itself, counsel for the defendant invoked paragraph 7 of his client\u2019s plea, which avers the plaintiff\u2019s neglect to give the notice prescribed by sub\u2011sec. 1 of sec. 8, and his failure in his reply to set up the defendant\u2019s non\u2011compliance with sub\u2011sec. 1 of sec. 15. But assuming paragraph 7 of the statement of defence to be a good plea without an averment that the defendant had complied with sub-sec. 1 of sec. 15, the absence from the reply of an allegation of non-compliance therewith is not an admission that it had in fact been complied with. Even if the defendant had expressly averred compliance with sub-sec. 1 of sec. 15 in his statement of defence, the failure of the plaintiff in his reply to deny that allegation would not amount to an admission of its truth under the Ontario practice. Con. R. 144.\nThe appeal to this court is upon a case stated (\u201cSupreme Court Act,\u201d section 73), on which it is our duty to give the judgment which the court whose decision is appealed against should have given (section 51). We cannot, whether for the purpose of upholding or for that of impeaching the judgment appealed from, supplement the appeal case by admitting evidence that should have been placed before the provincial courts. Red Mountain Railway Co. v. Blue[6].\nOn the ground, therefore, that compliance by it with sub-sec. 1 of sec. 15 of the \u201cLibel and Slander Act\u201d is a fact which cannot be presumed in the defendant\u2019s favour on a motion made under Con. R. 222 but must be established by it, and that the record contains no admission of that essential fact by the plaintiff such as that rule requires the appeal must be allowed and the judgment dismissing the action set aside.\nIt should be unnecessary to add that from the allowance of the plaintiff\u2019s appeal no inference may be drawn as to the opinion of the court in regard to the soundness of the two decisions followed by Mr. Justice Middleton.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: D.J. Coffey.\nSolicitors for the respondents: McKenzie & Gordon.\n[1] 43 Ont. L.R. 218; 43 D.L.R. 463.\n[2] 43 Ont. L.R. 218; 43 D.L.R. 463.\n[3] 27 O.R. 6.\n[4] 24 Ont. L.R. 507.\n[5] 56 Can.

K. Williams for the respondents.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin. Idington J:\u2014The contract evidenced by the appellant's policy was a chose in action and the benefit thereof clearly passed to respondent by virtue of the assignment of Nelson and Foster under and pursuant to the provisions of the \"Assignments Act,\" R.S.M. [1913] ch. 12 in the same plight and condition as it was held by the assignor at that time.\nThe respondent assignee was just as much entitled to comply with the condition which, being complied with, gave vitality and force to the appellant's obligation as his assignor had been and would have had if no assignment had been made.\nIt matters not then where the money came from\u2014 the condition has been fulfilled.\nIt so turns out that the estate was in an insolvent condition. To-morrow the like case might arise under circumstances in which the insured, although driven to make an assignment, might be possessed of an ample estate which could liquidate all the obligations of the insured.\nAre we to hold that such an unfortunate insured was deprived of the right to have his assignee recover on such an obligation? No case has been cited deciding any such thing or anything like it.\nThe case of Connolly v. Bolster[2], is the only one counsel claimed as being so. It, on examination, bears no resemblance to this.\nWhat was attempted there was to get a receiver appointed in hope that by such means such steps could be taken as might place the party concerned in funds to raise the money to meet the condition and give force and thereby vitality to the obligation.\nThat appointment was refused. And I venture with some confidence to think that, in the case of Collinge v. Heywood[3], had someone been kind enough to lend or give the plaintiff before action the money to pay, and he then had paid the bill of costs there in question, the plaintiff, even if hopelessly bankrupt and his benefactor never likely to receive any return for his advance, must have succeeded. The motive for such generosity could not have been inquired into.\nI think the case has been rightly decided by the court below, and that in doing so they have not had to rely upon any principles of equity, but upon the rigid common law. Everything nominated in the bond has been complied with.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014I am disposed to agree with the appellant's contention that under the terms of the policy sued upon actual payment by the assured of a liability of the class insured against imposed upon him by law was not merely a condition precedent to his right of action, but the very thing against loss from which the insurance was effected. In other words, not only would no right of action against the insurer arise until such payment but no actual or absolute liability on its part would exist.\nNevertheless, when his employee, Fornell, was injured a contingent right arose in favour of the assured against the insurer and there was a corresponding contingent liability on the part of the latter. Upon payment of whatever liability the law imposed in consequence of the injury sustained by Fornell, ascertained by due process, that contingent right, as well as the correlative contingent liability, would become absolute. This was the situation when the insured, having become insolvent, made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors under the \"Assignments Act\" (R.S.M. [1913], ch. 12). I am satisfied that the contingent right of the assured against the defendant company thereupon passed to his assignee. Neither can there be any reasonable doubt that it was the intention of the parties to the insurance contract that this should happen. Condition 1 of the policy provides that, while the policy shall terminate upon an assignment by the insured for the benefit of his creditors,\nsuch termination shall not affect the liability of the company as to any accident theretofore occurring.\nThis condition is not limited in its terms to cases in which the assured shall have actually paid the claim of an injured employee before the assignment, and it would, in my opinion, be unwarrantable to place such a restriction upon its application. It follows that the parties to the contract sued upon must have contemplated that the assignee might make the payment (which the assured would by the assignment have divested himself of the means of making) necessary to convert the contingent right which passed by the assignment into an absolute right and the corresponding liability of the insurer into an absolute liability.\nNor does this view do violence to the condition precedent to his client's liability of payment of the employee's judgment by, and loss thereby to, the assured so much pressed by counsel for the appellant\nAn assignee for creditors is a trustee not only for the creditors but also for the debtor. It is his duty to make the most of the estate and pay the debts; but it is the debtor's estate all the time; and when the debts are paid it is his duty to restore the surplus or what is not required for debts, if there be any, to the debtor. The assignee is accountable to the debtor for his dealings with the estate and if he is guilty of any wrongdoing or breach of trust or if he neglects or refuses to do his duty in respect of the estate he can be held to his duty and be compelled to perform it at the debtor's instance. The covenant in question was a counter security which the debtor possessed to protect him against the claim of the plaintiffs and others * * *. The debtor still had an interest in the covenant notwithstanding the assignment and that interest was the right to have it enforced against the defendant the moment anything fell due on the mortgage. That beneficial right he could assign and transfer * * * Ball v. Tenant[4], per Maclennan J.A.\nThe fallacy in the appellant company's contention is that it ignores the assured-assignor's continued interest in its liability. Because of that interest payment by his trustee to his judgment creditor (Fornell) out of the assigned estate would be payment by the assured-assignor and to his loss. It would diminish the fund to meet his creditors' claims. In the event of a deficiency he would in consequence of such payment remain liable for a larger balance to his other creditors. Should there be a surplus returnable to him it would be less pro tanto than it would have been had the Fornell claim not existed.\nNor is the appellant entitled to inquire, or to base a defence upon, the source from which the money paid by the assignee to Fornell came any more than he would be entitled to make a like inquiry or to raise such a defence if the payment had been made by the assured himself. It would be intolerable that a person bound to indemnify or reimburse a judgment debtor should escape liability because the latter had borrowed or had received as a gift from some kindly disposed friend either of himself or of the judgment creditor the money required to meet his obligation. The assignee has paid a judgment against the assured-assignor as he was entitled to do in the interest of all his cestuis que trustent\u2014the other creditors as well as the debtor. He is accountable only to them for the money so expended. The source from which it came is their business but not that of the insurer.\nMoreover, the insurer's liability is not measured by the amount of the dividend to which the judgment creditor would ultimately have been entitled on a distribution of the debtor's estate had his judgment not been satisfied. It is the full amount of the judgment of which, when satisfied, it covenanted for reimbursement. The assured, as already pointed out, is directly interested in having the entire liability to his judgment creditor discharged. Were it not he would remain personally liable for any unpaid balance of it. Since the payment of the judgment the respective rights and liabilities of the parties in the present case are, in my opinion, indistinguishable from those dealt with in such English cases as In re Law Guarantee, Trust & Accident Society; Liverpool Mortgage Insurance Company's Case[5]; Cruse v. Paine[6]; Re Perkins. Poyser v. Beyfus[7].\nThe appellant's contingent liability for the full amount of Fornell's judgment existed when the assured made his assignment. The correlative contingent right of the assured passed to his assignee and payment of the judgment by him has converted the latter into an absolute right, enforceable for the benefit of the estate in which both creditors and debtor are alike interested, and the former into an absolute liability.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014This is an action for the recovery under a contract commonly known as an employers' liability policy. That policy undertook to indemnify Nelson & Foster against loss from the liability for damages on account of bodily injuries suffered by an employee of the company. One condition of that policy was that no action could be instituted against the company to recover unless it shall be brought for loss actually sustained and paid in money by the assured in satisfaction of a judgment after trial of the issue.\nAn accident occurred to an employee of Nelson & Foster and an action was instituted against them. While the case was pending, Nelson & Foster made an assignment under the provisions of the \"Assignments Act\" of Manitoba, R.S.M., [1913] ch. 12. Judgment having been rendered against Nelson & Foster in favour of that employee, the assignee paid the amount of the judgment with money which was handed over to him by a man named Brandon, who does not seem to have been a creditor, but who seems to be interested in some way or other in the distribution of the assets of Nelson & Foster or in the discharge of their liability with regard to that employee. An action was then instituted by the assignee, the respondent Newton, to recover from the insurance company for the loss which had been suffered and the reimbursement of the money which he had paid to that employee.\nThe applicant company claims that it should not be held responsible for a larger sum than the amount of dividend to which that employee was entitled. That question came up in a case which was decided in 1914 in England, viz., the case of In re Law Guarantee Trust & Accident Society; Liverpool Mortgage Ins. Co's Case[8]. It was there held that in a contract of insurance or indemnity the insurance company was liable to pay to the liquidator the amount of the deficiency and not merely the amount of dividend payable.\nLord Lindley, in his work on Partnership, 5th ed., page 375, says that:\nwhere one person has covenanted to indemnify another, an action for specific performance may be sustained before the plaintiff has actually been indemnified; and the limit of defendant's liability to the plaintiff is the full amount for which he is liable; or if he is dead or insolvent the full amount provable against his estate and not only the amount of dividend which such estate can pay.\nThe contention of the appellant is that this contract is not only a contract of indemnity to but also of previous payment by the insured. But in this case there was a previous payment which had been made and we are not concerned with the question whether that payment has been rightly or legally made by the assignee. The condition of previous payment has been fulfilled and the insurance company cannot pretend now that it is not bound to reimburse the amount which has been paid by the assignee.\nA question has been raised also with regard to the power of the assignee under the \"Assignment Act\" to recover. The contract of assignment disposes of that contention, since it is therein declared that the assignor has handed over to the respondent all his personal estate, rights and credits, choses in action and all other personal estate.\nI may say with the learned trial judge, Mr. Justice Prendergast, that the assignee was bound to protect the trust, to save all that could be saved of the estate and to make out of it all that could be made. There was a chose in action that could be left barren or could be made to develop into an actual asset. It was then the assignee's duty to do what was necessary to preserve or to enforce the claim which he now exercises against the appellant company.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nCassels J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Coyne, Hamilton & Martin.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Murray & Noble.\n[1] [1917] 2 W.W.R. 1120.\n[2] 187 Mass, 266.\n[3] 8 L.J.Q.B. 98; 9 A. & E. 633.\n[4] 21 Ont.

On the last day of the option, as M. declined to execute his undertaking, D. refused to sign a draft deed of sale and the transaction fell through. Three weeks later S. sold the property to M. on terms similar to those under which it was to be sold to D. C. then claimed from S. $3,951.76, being the commission of one per cent. on the price of sale.\nHeld, Davies C.J. and Idington J. dissenting, that, under the law of the Province of Quebec, a conditional obligation fails when the condition itself fails; and when a term is fixed during which the condition must be accomplished, the obligation ceases if the condition is not accomplished during the term.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014When time is made of the essence of a contract, strict compliance with the stipulation is exacted under the English equity system as well as at common law.\nPer Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\u2014On a question arising under Quebec law, a decision rendered according to the rules of the English law should not be relied on unless it appears that there is no difference between the two systems of law in regard to the subject matter.

S., having taken advantage of C.'s work as its agent, cannot repudiate its liability to pay the agreed commission. Burchell v. Gowrie ([1910], A.C. 614) and Stratton v. Vachon (44 Can.

Lafleur K.C. and T. P. Butler K.C. for the appellant.\nH. G\u00e9rin-Lajoie K.C. and J. H. G\u00e9rin-Lajoie for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting)\u2014This was an action to recover a commission claimed by the plaintiffs, appellants, upon a sale made by the respondent Sisters of Charity to Messieurs Mignault and Morin of a parcel of real estate in Montreal.\nThe action was maintained by the trial judge for the sum claimed, $3,951.76, and on appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal.\nNo material facts are in dispute. The question to be decided is whether on these facts the defendants, respondents, are liable to pay the plaintiffs the commission sued for.\nRespondents, in September, 1912, gave the appellants an option to purchase the lands in question for $395,176 good until Friday 13th September, 1912, noon, and on the same day, by a separate letter referring to the option, bound themselves to pay appellants a commission of one per cent. on the amount of the purchase-money if the sale was effected by them during the currency and on the terms of the option.\nIt is common ground that the time limit for carrying out the option was extended until 12th November, 1912.\nThe plaintiffs accepted the option, and, at the time of accepting, paid the respondents $5,000 on account.\nAfterwards, on the 11th and 12th November, within the time limit, the appellants, having secured a purchaser ready and willing to take the property on the terms provided in the option, attended with such purchaser, one Desjardins, at a notary's office to carry out the agreement of purchase. Respondents were present by their attorney. Desjardins was present and ready and willing to carry out the purchase but was prevented from doing so by the claim set up by two third parties, Messrs. Mignault and Morin, to the effect that they, and not the purchaser Desjardins, had bought the property through the agency of the appellants and its sub-agent, one Rollit, and that they were entitled to a deed of the property for the sum of $395,176 instead of some $425,000 which Desjardins contended they had agreed to pay as the purchase-price from him to them.\nThe result of the dispute was the withdrawal of Desjardins from the purchase of the property.\nOwing to the disputes between the two alleged purchasers, Desjardins on the one hand and Mignault and Morin on the other, each one claiming to be entitled as the purchaser through the appellants of the land and to receive a deed of the same for the consideration price of $395,176, the transaction was not completed. The respondents, defendants, were not responsible for this.\nA few days afterwards, however, and after the time limit had expired, namely, on the 4th December, the defendants, respondents, agreed to accept the claim of Mignault and Morin to be the purchasers as opposed to the claim of Desjardins to be such and executed to them a deed of the property in question for the sum of $395,176 on the same conditions as those stipulated for in the option they had given to the plaintiffs, appellants, and at the same time credited the said Mignault and Morin on the purchase-price with the $5,000 paid to them by the plaintiffs, appellants, on the 12th September previously.\nBy accepting these parties as the purchasers it is contended the defendants adopted the contract made by the plaintiffs, appellants, or their sub-agent with Mignault and Morin as purchasers, profited by the same, and could not deprive the appellants of their right to a commission on the sale, even though it was not completed until after the time stipulated for in the option and in the accessory obligation with respect to the commission.\nThe relation of Mignault and Morin as purchasers from the respondent defendants of the land in question was, it seems to me, brought about by the plaintiffs and by directly dealing with them even after the expiration of the stipulated delay for closing the transaction, the respondents waived the delay, adopted the contract negotiated for them by the plaintiffs within the stipulated time, and having done so and taken advantage of the plaintiffs' work as their agent, cannot be permitted to repudiate their liability to pay the commission. The rule which should govern in cases of this kind has been laid down by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Burchell v. Gowrie and Blockhouse Collieries Ltd.[2], and has been followed in this court in Stratton v. Vachon[3].\nThat rule is that where an agent has brought the landowner into relation with an actual purchaser he is entitled to recover his commission although the owner has sold, behind the agent's back, on terms which he had advised them not to accept. Lord Atkinson, in delivering the judgment of their Lordships, said, in answer to the contention that the acts of an agent cannot be held to be the efficient cause of a sale which he has opposed:\u2014\nThe answer * * * is that if an agent such as Burchell was brings a person into relation with his principal as an intending purchaser the agent has done the most effective and, possibly, the most laborious and expensive, part of his work, and that if the principal takes advantage of that work and, behind the back of the agent and unknown to him, sells to the purchaser thus brought into touch with him on terms which the agent theretofore advised the principal not to accept, the agent's act may still well be the effective cause of the sale.\nThere can be no doubt in my judgment that the plaintiffs, appellants, brought the purchasers in this case, Mignault and Morin, into direct relation with the respondent vendors and that the plaintiffs were the efficient cause of the actual sale or acceptance by the defendants, respondents, of Mignault and Morin as the purchasers. The knowledge that they had when so accepting of Mignault and Morin having been brought as purchasers into relations with them as vendors by plaintiffs; the adoption of the terms of sale contained in the option they had given the plaintiffs; the crediting on the purchase-price to Mignault and Morin of the $5,000 paid by the plaintiffs to them when the option was given and the commission agreement entered into; all combine to convince me that the respondents cannot be permitted to escape through the time limit from their liability to pay plaintiffs the stipulated commission sued for. They must be held to have clearly waived this time limit.\nI would allow the appeal with costs here and in the Court of Appeal and restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nIdington J. (dissenting)\u2014I would allow this appeal with costs here and below and restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nAnglin J.\u2014The material facts of this case and the relevant documents appear in the judgment delivered by Mr. Justice Pelletier in the Court of King's Bench[4], and in the opinion of my brother Mignault, which I have had the advantage of reading. I fully concur in my learned brother's view that the question presented must be determined not by the principles of English law, but by those of the civil law which obtain in the Province of Quebec.\nAlthough art. 1082 C.C. omits the first, or positive, clause of art. 1176 C.N.:\u2014\nLorsqu'une obligation est contract\u00e9e sous la condition qu'un \u00e9v\u00e8nement arrivera dans un temps fixe, cette condition est cens\u00e9e d\u00e9faillie lorsque le temps est expir\u00e9 sans que l'\u00e9v\u00e8nement soit arriv\u00e9,\nthe reproduction of the second clause in these terms,\u2014\nif there be no time fixed for the fulfilment of a condition it may always be fulfilled,\nclearly implies the converse proposition, that, where a contract contains a stipulation as to the time for the fulfilment of a condition to which the obligation imposed is made subject, that condition cannot be fulfilled so as to render the obligation absolute after the time so fixed has elapsed. On the expiry of the delay, if the condition remain unperformed, the obligation entirely ceases.\nArt. 1082, according to the codifiers' foot-note (first report, p. 71, No. 102), is based on Pothier (Bugnet) 209, 210 and 211, and 6 Toullier 623 et seq. The opening paragraphs of section 209 of Pothier read as follows:\u2014\n209. Lorsque la condition renferme un temps pr\u00e9fix, dans lequel elle doit \u00eatre accomplie, comme si je me suis oblig\u00e9 de vous donner une certaine somme si un navire \u00e9tait cette ann\u00e9e de retour dans les ports de France, il faut que la chose arrive dans le temps pr\u00e9fix; et lorsque te temps est expir\u00e9 sans que la chose soit arriv\u00e9e, la condition est cens\u00e9e d\u00e9faillie, et l'obligation contract\u00e9e, sous cette condition, est enti\u00e8rement \u00e9vanouie.\nMais si la condition ne renferme aucun temps pr\u00e9fix dans lequel elle doive \u00eatre accomplie, elle peut l'\u00eatre en quelque temps que ce soit; et elle n'est pas cens\u00e9e d\u00e9faillie, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il soit devenu certain que la chose n'arrivera point.\nToullier deals with certain exceptions indicated by Pothier, not material to this case, which the codifiers did not adopt. In the codifiers' First Report, p. 71, No. 102 (art. 1082 C.C.), art. 1178 C.N. would seem to be erroneously referred to instead of art. 1176 C.N. While the comment of the codifiers, at p. 20 of their report, does not explain the omission from art. 1082 of the first sentence of art. 1176 C.N., it must, I think, be assumed, in view of the reference to Pothier, that in their opinion it was unnecessary because of its obvious implication in the second sentence which they reproduced as art. 1082. The purview of that article is further evidenced by art. 1084, which is a reproduction of art. 1178 C.N. and presents the only case in which a condition is deemed to have been accomplished though actually not so. Art. 1083 C.C., which corresponds to art. 1177 C.N., throws further light upon the meaning of art. 1082 and the effect which it must have been intended to have. As to the operation of the last mentioned article\u2014see Letang v. Renaud[5].\nI entertain no doubt whatever; for the reasons stated by my brother Mignault, and by Carroll and Pelletier JJ. in the Court of King's Bench, that the failure of the plaintiff to bring about within the time stipulated the event on the happening of which, according to the terms of the contract, the defendants' obligation would arise amounted to the failure of a condition precedent with the result that the defendants were thereby entirely freed from any obligation to the plaintiff. Deschamps v. Goold[6], is in point. I rest my judgment on this view of the case and add the references to English law which follow merely to indicate that, in my opinion, the result, if ruled by its principles, would be the same. The contrary view, if I may say so with respect, in the last analysis of it would appear to rest upon some misapprehension as to the scope and application of the equity doctrine that time, unless made so expressly or by necessary implication, is not to be deemed of the essence of contractual obligations.\nHere the stipulation as to the time, for its fulfilment is made of the essence of the condition on which the defendants assumed an obligation to pay commission as distinctly as language could make it so. The promise which the plaintiff accepted was that the defendants would pay a commission of 1%\nif said sale is affected during the currency of said option which expires on Friday the 13th instant at noon, and provided also this sale is completed, the deed signed and first payment of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) duly paid to the Grey Nuns within fifteen days after the acceptation (sic) of said option and not otherwise. Terms more explicit and emphatic it would be difficult to indite. Where time is thus made of the essence of a contract strict compliance with the stipulation is exacted under the English equity system as well as at common law. Conventio vincit legem. An extension of the time for completion and payment of the first instalment (which was reduced from $100,000 to $50,000) until the 11th of November was agreed to, but, as appears from the letter of the defendants' agent, St. Cyr, of the 11th September,\nall other conditions (were) to remain the same.\nEven if, upon a proper construction of it, time should not be regarded as having been expressly made of the essence of this contract, neither its character nor the nature of the relief sought admits of the application of the doctrine of equity which, under some circumstances, treats a term as to the time of performance as not of the essence of a contract. The contract before us would, under English law, create an ordinary common law obligation to pay money upon the happening of a stated event. The plaintiff's action, if brought in an English court, would be strictly a common law action to recover the money so contracted to be paid, and the common law rule as to the effect of the stipulation as to time would govern it. Noble v. Edwardes[7]. The case is not one in regard to which a court of equity would, before the \"Judicature Act,\" have entertained a bill for specific performance, or to restrain proceedings at law, or for other equitable relief. It is, therefore, not one in which, under the \"Judicature Act,\" the equity view as to the effect of a stipulation as to time would control. Stickney v. Keeble[8]; Renter v. Sala[9]. The equitable doctrine could not be invoked to take such a case out of the rule of the common law, which exacts performance of \u00e1 condition within the delay allowed as the foundation of the right to enforce the obligation to which it is attached.\nHaving made a contract under which it would become entitled to a commission only upon the happening of a stated event within a definite period \"and not otherwise,\" the plaintiff in effect agreed to forego all claim to commission unless that event should happen within the time stipulated. In order that an action on such a contract should succeed the plaintiff must shew fulfilment of the condition according to its terms. Alder v. Boyle[10]; Peacock v. Freeman[11]. The authority of the case last cited, so far as relevant to that at bar, is not affected by a distinction in regard to it made by the Court of Appeal in Skinner v. Andrews[12].\nThe plaintiffs cannot recover merely because although the condition of the defendants' obligation is not fulfilled, they have derived a benefit from what it did. Barnett v. Isaacson[13]. This case, in some aspects, closely resembles that at bar. The defendant had promised the plaintiff a commission of \u00a35,000 in the event of his introducing a purchaser of the defendant's business. An accountant, introduced to the defendant by the plaintiff as a person likely to procure a purchaser of the business, eventually bought it himself. Construing the contract on which the plaintiff claimed as entitling him to a commission if his introduction brought about the sale, but also as meaning that if it failed to produce that result he should not be paid the commission (implying the term expressed in the \"and not otherwise\" of the contract in the present case) the Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff could not recover. As the Master of the Rolls put it:\u2014\nAll that the plaintiff did under the contract was done upon the terms that he was not to be paid unless he was successful. The jury gave him \u00a32,000 (upon a quantum meruit) though he failed, and so the verdict could not stand.\n*****\nTo entitle the plaintiff to sue upon a quantum meruit the rule was that if the plaintiff relied upon the * acceptance by the defendant of something he had done, he must have done it under circumstances which led the defendant to know that if he, the defendant, accepted what had been done it was on the terms that he must pay for it.\nLord Justice Lopes said:\u2014\nAs to the claim upon a quantum meruit, it could only arise upon a promise to be implied from a request by the defendant to the plaintiff to perform a service for him, or upon the acceptance of services of the plaintiff so as to imply a promise by the defendant to pay for those services. Neither of these alternatives occur here. Nothing was done outside the contract.\nIn Lott v. Outhwaite[14], another authority for the latter view, Lindley L.J., in rejecting a claim for quantum meruit, observed that\nthere could be no implied contract where there was an express one.\nSee also Green et al. v. Mules[15].\nThe case of Burchell v. Gowrie and Blockhouse Collieries Ltd,[16], chiefly relied on by the appellant, is, in my opinion, clearly distinguishable as my brother Mignault points out. The agent's employment in that case was a general one. The contract was, as Lord Atkinson puts it at p. 626:\u2014\nthat should the mine be eventually sold to a purchaser introduced by him, he (Burchell) would be entitled to a commission at the stipulated rate.\nThere was no such condition as in the case at bar that to entitle the agent to his commission the sale must be effected and carried out and part of the purchase-money paid within a fixed period\u2014still less an agreement that unless all these things should happen within the time stipulated there should be no claim for commission\u2014\"and not otherwise,\"\nThe ground of Burchell's recovery was that the defendants had wrongfully deprived him of the benefit of his contract. The judgment proceeded, as my brother Mignault says, on the principle enunciated in art. 1184 C.C. as the citation by Lord Atkinson of Inchbald v. Western Neilgherry, Coffee Plantation Co.[17], in support of it shews. Here, on the contrary, the defendants put no obstacle whatever in the way of the plaintiff earning its commission. They were ready and willing, on the date fixed for completion and payment, to convey to the purchaser designated by the plaintiff. The failure to carry out the sale was not due to any fault of theirs or because of the intervention of Mignault and Morin as rival purchasers, as the appellant suggests, but solely and simply because Desjardins, the plaintiff's nominee as purchaser under its option, refused to carry out the transaction. When that occurred, the time within which the plaintiff might fulfil the condition entitling it to a commission having expired, the defendants were freed from all obligation to it.\nIn the case at bar the plaintiff was not \"generally employed\" to sell. Its employment was limited. Lord Watson, in Toulmin v. Millar[18], clearly indicates the difference between a general employment and a limited mandate to sell according to stated terms and not otherwise. In order to entitle a plaintiff to recover for services rendered under such a limited mandate its terms must be fulfilled. Stratton v. Vachon[19], was a case of general employment similar to that of Burchell.\nWhen Mignault and Morin came to the defendants some time afterwards seeking to acquire their property on the terms on which they were willing to dispose of it, the defendants were at perfect liberty to sell to them. The mere fact that they had been prospective sub-purchasers from Desjardins in the event of a sale to him (procured for him by one Rollit, who had acted as a sub-agent for the plaintiff in procuring Desjardins himself to accept its option from the defendants) could not, after the expiry of that option, deprive the latter of the right to accept an offer from Mignault and Morin. Sibbitt v. Carson[20], is in point and, in my opinion, was well decided.\nMuch is made of the fact that the defendants credited to Mignault and Morin on account of their purchase-money this $5,000 received from the plaintiff when it had written to St. Cyr taking up the option which it held. It might have been more prudent had this not been done. But the defendants had offered the $5,000 back to the plaintiff from whom they had received it, thus evidencing their understanding that the option and the incidental commission agreement were at an end. The plaintiff had refused to accept the money. It, in fact, belonged to Mignault and Morin. Under all the circumstances the crediting of this sum to Mignault and Morin on account of the purchase-price payable by them for the property affords no ground for holding that the defendants adopted and carried out a sale which the plaintiff had arranged. On the contrary, it is abundantly clear that all relations between the defendants and the plaintiff in connection with the sale of the property in question had been terminated and that the defendants sold it to Mignault and Morin as they might have sold it to any other purchaser who might offer to buy it.\nIn my opinion the plaintiff has neither a legal nor a moral claim against the defendant for the commission for which it sues.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I concur in the opinion of Mignault J.\nMignault J.\u2014The question involved in this appeal is whether the appellants are entitled to a commission of $3,951.76 on a sale made by the respondent, on the 4th December, 1914, to Messrs. Mignault and Morin, of a property on Sherbrooke Street, Montreal, for the price of $395,176, the appellants claiming to be entitled to a commission of one per cent. under an agreement with the respondent. The Superior Court, Green-shields J., maintained the appellants' action, but this judgment was reversed by the Court of King's Bench, Cross J. dissenting. Hence the appeal to this court.\nIt is important to state at the outset that the appellants' action is based on a contract, and is not a claim of the nature of a quantum meruit. If this contract does not support the appellants' action, there seems no escape from the conclusion that their action was rightly dismissed by the judgment appealed from.\nThe contract is contained in two letters of Mr. Alfred St. Cyr, the respondent's agent, to the Colonial Real Estate Company. These letters are as follows:\u2014\nMontreal, September 3rd, 1912.\nThe Colonial Real Estate Company,\nMontreal, P.Q.\nDear Sirs:\u2014\nI hereby agree to give you the option of purchasing from the Grey Nuns that certain piece of land situated on the corner of Sherbrooke, St. Lawrence and Milton streets, in the city of Montreal, haying a frontage of one hundred and sixty-six (166) feet on Sherbrooke st. Three hundred (300) on St. Lawrence st. and two hundred and three (203) feet on Milton st., comprising a total area of about forty-nine thousand three hundred and ninety-seven (49,397) feet, English measure, being lot No. one hundred and eighteen (118) of the official plan and book of reference of St. Lawrence ward, in the said city of Montreal, for the price of eight dollars ($8) per superficial square foot, English measure; one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) payable cash on passing deed of sale and the balance, that is two hundred and ninety-five thousand one hundred and seventy-six dollars ($295,176), payable within five years from date with interest at the rate of five and a half per cent. (5\u00bd%) per annum payable semi-annually. The purchaser to pay taxes from first September, 1912, and proportion of insurance premiums from the same date.\nBalance of the purchase-price payable at any time by giving a three months' written notice to that effect. The vendors declare that there is still a mortgage on the property of about fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) which the purchaser will assume. All buildings erected on grounds to be sold and all buildings to be erected shall be insured against loss by fire by companies and through insurance agencies approved by or chosen by the Grey Nuns. Said insurance to be not less than eighty per cent. (80%) of their value and the same to be transferred to the Grey Nuns to the extent of their interest. The sale to be made free of commission or expense to the Grey Nuns who, nevertheless, will supply to the purchaser their title deeds to said property. The purchase to be passed before our notary.\nThis option is good only until Friday the thirteenth instant at twelve o'clock noon and not later.\nYours truly,\nAlfred St. Cyr,\nAgent Grey Nuns.\nMontreal, September 3, 1912.\nThe Colonial Real Estate Company,\nMontreal, P.Q.\nDear Sirs:\u2014\nIn reference to the option given you this day on behalf of the Grey Nuns for the purchase of their property, situated corner of Sherbrooke, St. Lawrence and Milton streets, I beg to inform you that the Grey Nuns bind themselves to give you a commission of one per cent. (1%), that is to say, three thousand nine hundred and fifty-one dollars and seventy-six cents ($3,951.76), on the total amount of the sale of said property, if said sale is effected during the currency of said option which expires Friday the 13th instant at noon, and provided also that this sale is completed, the deed signed, and the first payment of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) duly paid to the Grey Nuns within fifteen days after the acceptation of said option and not otherwise.\nYours truly,\nAlfred St. Cyr,\nAgent Grey Nuns. The terms of these letters can give rise to no difficulties of construction. The contract was a conditional one, the condition being the sale of the described property for the price of $395,176,\nduring the currency of the option * * * and not otherwise.\nIt is common ground between the parties that the term for the completion of the sale and the signing of the deed was extended to the 12th November, 1912, when it finally expired, and also that certain modifications were made as to the amount in cash which had to be paid on passing the deed of sale. These latter modifications, however, are not material for the decision of the case, the whole question being whether the appellants can claim a commission on a sale made by the respondents after the expiration of the option.\nOn the 12th September, the Colonial Real Estate Company wrote to Mr. St. Cyr, on behalf of an unnamed client, the following letter:\u2014\nSeptember 12th, 1912.\nMr. Alfred St. Cyr,\nAgent, Grey Nuns, Montreal, P.Q.\nDear Sir:\u2014\nOn behalf of our client we hereby accept your option dated September 3, 1912, for that certain piece of land situate on the corner of Sherbrooke, St. Lawrence and Milton streets, being lot No. 118 of the official plan and book of reference of St. Lawrence ward, in the city of Montreal said to contain 49,397 square feet for the price of eight ($8) dollars per square foot or a total price of three hundred ninety-five thousand one hundred and seventy-six ($395,176) dollars, on the following conditions: Forty-five thousand one hundred and seventy-six (145,176). dollars payable cash on passing of deed of sale. Fifty thousand ($50,000) dollars in one year from date of passing deed, and the balance, that is, three hundred thousand ($300,000) dollars payable within five years from that date with interest at the rate of five and a half (5\u00bd%) per annum, payable semi-annually. Taxes, interest and insurance to be adjusted as from September 1st, 1912.\nWe enclose our cheque for five thousand ($5,000) dollars on account of the purchase-price.\nAs per your letter of the 3rd inst. it is distinctly understood that you will pay us a commission of one per cent. of the sale price, that is to say, three thousand nine hundred and fifty-one dollars and seventy-six cents ($3,951.76) on the completion of sale.\nYours truly,\nThe Colonial Real Estate Company.\nIt appears that the appellants were then dealing with one Rollit who had made them an offer, also on behalf of the unnamed clients, for this property, with a cheque for $5,000, and this was the sum which the appellants sent to the respondent. Rollit was to get one-half of the commission from the appellants.\nSubsequently, at the request of the respondent, the appellants named, by a letter dated the 11th November, 1912, Mr. J. A. Desjardins as the purchaser they had obtained for the property. This gentleman, the proof shews, had made arrangements to sell the same property to Messrs. Mignault and Morin for the sum of $425,000, thus making a clear profit of nearly $30,000. The respondent had nothing to do with this resale.\nThe respondent ordered notary Prud'homme to prepare a deed of sale of the property, and, on the 11th November, duly authorised representatives of the respondent went to the office of the notary to sign a deed of sale of the property which had already been prepared. However, as Messrs. Mignault and Morin declined to execute their undertaking to buy the property from Desjardins for $425,000, Desjardins refused to sign the deed of sale and to make the cash payment required, and the whole transaction fell through. The option expired the next day without the appellants having obtained a purchaser for the property.\nAt this stage there can be no doubt that the conditional contract the respondent had made with the appellants could give the latter no right to a commission; the condition having failed.\nAnd now because the respondent, on the 4th December, 1912, when it was free from any obligation towards the appellants or any one else, sold their property to Messrs. Mignault and Morin for $395,176, on terms similar to those under which it was to be sold to Desjardins, the appellants, basing their action, as I have said, on the expired contract, and not on a quantum meruit, claim the commission of one per cent. from the respondent.\nI am, without any hesitation whatever, of the opinion that, under the law of the Province of Quebec, the appellants' action cannot succeed. Nothing is more elementary than that a person obliging himself to pay a sum of money upon the happening of a certain event, within a fixed term, is free from any obligation should the term expire before the happening of the event. In other words, a conditional obligation fails when the condition itself fails, and where a term is fixed during which the condition must be accomplished, the obligation is at an end if the condition be not fulfilled during the term. Art. 1082 of the Civil Code clearly implies this when it says:\u2014\nIf there be no time fixed for the fulfilment of a condition, it may always be fulfilled; and it is not deemed to have failed until it has become certain that it will not be fulfilled.\nThis article, although negative in form, while art. 1176 C.N. is affirmative, makes it clear that where a term has been fixed, the condition cannot be accomplished after the expiration of this term. This rule is really elementary and seems to require no argument, but I will nevertheless quote from Pothier and Baudry-Lacantinerie to shew that there is no possible room for doubt. Pothier, vol. 2, Obligations, ch. 3, no. 209, says:\u2014\nLorsque la condition renferme un temps pr\u00e9fix, dans lequel elle doit \u00eatre accomplie, comme \"si je me suis oblig\u00e9 de vous donner une certaine somme si un tel navire \u00e9tait cette ann\u00e9e de retour dans un port de France;\" il faut que la chose arrive dans le temps pr\u00e9fix; et lorsque le temps est expir\u00e9 sans que la chose soit arriv\u00e9e, la condition est cens\u00e9e d\u00e9faillie, et l'obligation contract\u00e9e sous cette condition est enti\u00e8rement \u00e9vanouie.\nBaudry-Lacantinerie, vol. 13, in his treatise on Obligations, No. 799, expresses the same opinion:\u2014\nSi les parties ont fix\u00e9 un d\u00e9lai pour l'accomplissement de la condition et que l'\u00e9v\u00e8nement ne se produise qu'apr\u00e8s l'expiration de ce d\u00e9lai, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, par cel\u00e0 seul qu'il n'a pas lieu dans le temps assign\u00e9, l'\u00e9v\u00e8nement qui arrive n'est pas celui que les parties avaient en vue. Comme le dit excellemment Demolombe: \"La fixation du temps forme, dans ce cas, l'un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments constitutifs et comme une partie int\u00e9grante de l'\u00e9v\u00e8nement lui-m\u00eame\" (Demolombe XXV., n. 339).\nIl s'ensuit que les juges ne sont pas admis \u00e0 proroger le d\u00e9lai. S'ils le prorogeaient, ils changeraient la condition et m\u00e9connaitraient la ioi du contrat.\nReliance is placed by the appellants on the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Burchell v. Gowrie and Blockhouse Collieries Ltd.[21]. This decision was rendered in a case originating in Nova Scotia, and obviously is based upon the English law.\nMay I say, with all possible deference, that I would deprecate, on a question under the Quebec law, relying upon a decision, even of the Privy Council, rendered according to the rules of the English law. It would first be necessary to shew that there is no difference between the two systems of law by referring to authorities binding under the French law, and this has not been done. Very earnestly, I am of the opinion that each system of law should be administered according to its own rules and by reference to authorities or judgments which are binding on it alone. What I have said also disposes of the decision of this court in the case of Stratton v. Vachon[22], an Alberta case, also relied on by the appellants.\nI may, however, say that the decision of the Privy Council in the Burchell Case[23] has no application whatever to the present case. The head-note of the report says:\u2014\nIn an action by the appellant to recover an agreed commission on the proceeds of a sale of mining property by the respondent company the latter contended that he was not the efficient cause of the particular sale effected:\u2014\nHeld, that as the appellant had brought the company into relation with the actual purchaser he was entitled to recover although the company had sold behind his back on terms which he had advised them not to accept.\nThere was no conditional contract with the agent in the Burchell Case23. The referee had held that Burchell had a continuing power of sale, which their Lordships construed as meaning that his employment was \"a general employment.\" And they cite as applicable to such cases the rule laid down by Willes J. in Inchbald v. Western Neilgherry Coffee Plantation Co.[24].\nI apprehend that whenever money is to be paid to another upon a given event, the party upon whom is cast the obligation to pay is liable to the party who is to receive the money, if he does any act which prevents or makes it less probable that he should receive it.\nI could entirely concur in this rule, and base my opinion on art. 1084 of the Quebec Civil Code, but there is absolutely nothing in the present case which would justify this court in applying it to the respondent. There is no suggestion of any fraud or collusion chargeable against the respondent. It did what it could do to execute its obligation, and the transaction failed because the purchaser found by the appellants refused to sign the deed within the term.\nWill it now be said that the respondent could not sell its property without incurring liability towards the appellants? Or for how long a time should it abstain from exercising its rights as an owner? And can it be contended that, assuming that the respondent could, after the term, sell its property, it should not, at anytime, sell it to any purchaser with whom the appellants had dealt, unless it was prepared to pay to the appellants a commission to which the latter never had more than a conditional right, which right had come to an end on the 12th November by the failure of the condition?\nThe Superior Court held that the respondent had adopted the appellants' contract and was, therefore, liable for the commission. With deference, I would say that it is immaterial whether it adopted it after the appellants' right had ceased to exist, provided it had done nothing to prevent the happening of the condition during the specified term.\nIt is also said that the respondent kept the $5,000 it had received from the appellants and afterwards, on the 4th December, credited it to Mignault and Morin, to whom it really belonged. The respondent, on the 25th November, tendered back this money to the appellants and the latter refused to accept it. What more could the respondent do?\nI have carefully examined the Quebec decisions of which the learned counsel for the appellants has since the argument filed a list. None of these decisions support the contentions of the appellants. I may add that nothing in the record shews any extension of the delay beyond the 12th November, 1912, or any waiver whatever by the respondent.\nFor these reasons my opinion is that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: T.

C.\u2014Art. 3262 (a) R.S.Q.\nUnder article 3262 (a) R.S.Q., the police magistrate who presided at the trial was empowered to hold the Court of Sessions of the Peace only \"in case of the absence or inability to act of\" the regular Judge of the Sessions of the Peace.\nHeld, that \"absence\" means absence from the bench or, at most, absence from the court-room in which the trial takes place when it begins.\nWhen a person, accused of having unlawfully used means to procure a miscarriage, puts forward a defence of innocent and lawful purpose, the evidence of other women that he has previously practised abortion on them by a similar method is admissible in rebuttal.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, affirming the judgment of the Court of Sessions of the Peace, at Quebec.\nThe accused, appellant, was found guilty of abortion by the trial judge, but he prayed for a case to be reserved for the Court of King's Bench.\nThe questions submitted in the reserved case stated by the trial judge are as follows:\u2014\n1. That the trial and conviction are null, because the judge who tried the case had power to act only in the absence or incapacity of the Judge of Sessions, whereas the latter was, in fact, neither absent nor incapacitated. 2. That the trial judge erred in admitting evidence of other criminal acts of the appellant.\n3. That, in any event, there was error in admitting such evidence of other criminal acts in rebuttal.\nThe circumstances of the case are fully stated in the judgments now reported.\nFerdinand Roy K.C., Alleyn Taschereau K.C. and Paul Drouin for the appellant.\nArthur Lachance K.C. and Arthur Fitzpatrick for the respondent.\nDavies J.\u2014I concur in the reasons for judgment stated by my brother Anglin and would dismiss this appeal.\nIdington J.\u2014The appellant was convicted of abortion on his trial had therefor, pursuant to his election for a trial without a jury, and on the 15th May, 1917, sentenced to a term in the penitentiary.\nThe learned trial judge on motion of counsel for appellant decided same day or next to reserve questions of law for the Court of Appeal.\nOf these we are appealed to in regard to the following:\u2014\n\"A.\" Cette cour devait-elle admettre les t\u00e9moignages de Laetitia Clouthier et de Bernadette Clouthier pour \u00e9tablir que l'accus\u00e9 a d\u00e9j\u00e0 commis le crime dont on l'accuse?\n\"B.\" En supposant cette preuve l\u00e9gale, pouvait-elle \u00eatre permise pendant l'enqu\u00eate de la Couronne \"in rebuttal?\"\nI have as result of reference to numerous decisions on which I rely specially upon Rex v. Bond[1], and Rex v. Crippen[2], come to the conclusion that the answers of the majority of the Court of Appeal to these questions are unquestionably right, In the former case the law applicable to such a case, and the limitations thereof, is so fully and ably dealt with that I need not repeat what therein is applicable. Whether such proof should in all cases be tendered in support of the case for the prosecution or only be given by way of rebuttal must depend upon the particular circumstances of each case.\nIf for example the appellant had refrained from tendering his own evidence, and relied upon others to establish an alibi, such evidence in rebuttal could not have been properly received merely in way of rebuttal.\nBut by his going into the witness box, to prove his innocence and try to shew a case wherein accident or mistake was all that was or could be involved, he raised a question which had to be met and could be effectually so by proving his previous criminal acts which could not rest upon mere mistake or accident.\nOne of these took place in 1914 and the other a year or two earlier\u2014quite enough to illuminate the whole story.\nAs to the collateral effects on the minds of those having to pass upon such a case, that is something counsel defending an accused have to reckon with, and be prepared for if rendering same necessary by pursuing a hazardous course.\nOften they have to take chances and do the best they can; but all that furnishes no reason for rejecting evidence when clearly admissible either in opening or in rebuttal according to the circumstances of each case.\nAnd one guiding rule in regard thereto should ever be section 1019 of the Criminal Code which reads as follows:\u2014\n1019. No conviction shall be set aside nor any new trial directed, although it appears that some evidence was improperly admitted or rejected, or that something not according to law was done at the trial or some misdirection given, unless, in the opinion of the Court of Appeal some substantial wrong or miscarriage was thereby occasioned on the trial; provided that if the Court of Appeal is of opinion that any challenge for the defence was improperly disallowed a new trial shall be granted. (55-56 Vict., ch. 29, sec. 746.)\nI think this curative section applicable here.\nThe appellant, after obtaining the foregoing reservation for the Court of Appeal on the 27th of August, 1917, nearly three months and a half later, bethought himself of something else and that was to question the jurisdiction of the court that tried and convicted him.\nHe applied to the judge who had tried him, and, I incline to think, had with his granting his former reservation become (under the peculiar conditional jurisdiction he had for acting) functus officio, unless in response to the possible requirements and directions of the Court of Appeal, he had to submit questions relative to his jurisdiction.\nHe graciously acceded, though I most respectfully submit he might have been well advised under all the circumstances and the material submitted to him, to have refused to state any further question, unless and until the Court of Appeal under its power in section 1015 of the Criminal Code so directed.\nThe result would probably have been from what now appears that on this branch of the case there could have been no further appeal herein.\nWhen or how otherwise can the convicted be limited in regard to his appellant rights?\nSuppose he had a dozen objections to make and chose to submit one at a time only and revert to the trial judge when that decided to state the next, and try the experiment with each, as it is agreed there is no time limit, could he go on through his list thus?\nOut of respect to the Court of Appeal I will assume in this case that they have in substance acted under sec. 1015 and of the questions thus secondarily presented there would remain the third as follows:\u2014 3. Aviez-vous juridiction pour instruire et pr\u00e9sider le proc\u00e8s exp\u00e9ditif de l'accus\u00e9 dans les circonstances ci-dessus expos\u00e9es et ce proc\u00e8s n'est-il pas nul pour avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 instruit devant un juge qui n'avait pas juridiction?\nIt was suggested by Mr. Fitzpatrick in argument that as the trial must be presumed to have begun with the election of the accused and his pleading to the charge and fixing a date for the continuance of it the learned trial judge whose jurisdiction is attacked and his jurisdiction that far being maintained unanimously we could not entertain this part of the appeal.\nI agree there would be much force in the argument, especially when we bear in mind the possibility of an accused so acting being led by the appearance of things to assume that it was the judge who interrogated him as to his wish that would be his judge, but I fear the decision of this court in Giroux v. The King[3], puts an end to the import formerly attached to that test of arraignment and pleading and fixing a date for trial.\nIt seems the remaining question must therefore be answered.\nI admit the possible serious consequences of such a view for unless the fact that a judge once seized of the conduct of a case is to be allowed to continue it even if his senior, whose absence is the basis of his jurisdiction, should return there may be confusion arise some day.\nIt is not this case that embarrasses me, but what may flow from our recognition of a dissent that only cuts a proceeding in two.\nI agree with the view taken by the majority in the Court of Appeal that the learned senior judge's actual absence from the trial is enough to rest the jurisdiction of his substitute upon.\nThis statute enabling that to be done is not like some others which expressly or impliedly intended absence to mean an absence beyond the place of residence or jurisdiction. Upon that many decisions rest.\nI may also observe that the inability of the senior judge to undertake the duty is an alternative ground for naming a substitute.\nThe statement of Judge Langelier that for personal reasons he did not wish to sit ought to be presumed as meaning for good reasons which in law were a valid excuse and would in the alternative suffice, although not expressed on the record.\nAs at present advised I should so presume, if I thought the statement in the record could be displaced by any such proof as offered.\nI do not however think the record can be so displaced for our purpose by such alleged proof.\nI therefore think the learned trial judge must be held to have had jurisdiction and therefore the appeal be dismissed with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014Convicted by the Court of Sessions of the Peace of having unlawfully used means to procure a miscarriage upon one Alice Vachon in July, 1916, and thereupon sentenced to imprisonment for a term of five years, the appellant applied for and obtained the reservation of several questions of law under section 1014 of the Criminal Code. The questions so reserved were determined adversely to him by the Court of King's Bench\u2014unanimously, with the exception of three, in respect of which Mr. Justice Lavergne dissented. The defendant now appeals to this court. I find his three grounds of appeal succinctly stated in the judgment of Mr. Justice Cross in these terms:\u2014\n(1) That the trial and conviction are null, because the judge who tried the case had power to act only in the absence or incapacity of the Judge of Sessions, whereas the latter was, in fact, neither absent nor incapacitated.\n(2) That the learned trial judge erred in admitting evidence of other criminal acts of the appellant. (3) That, in any event, there was error in admitting such evidence of other criminal acts in rebuttal.\n(1) The appellant urges that it appears by an affidavit intituled and filed in the Court of Sessions of the Peace, apparently made gratuitously by one Chouinard, the clerk of the court, that, although there are formal entries in the record of the trial that Judge Choquette presided in the absence of Judge Langelier, made by the direction of the former, the latter was in fact in his chambers in the court house at the time of the commencement of the trial. Affidavits filed on behalf of the Crown in the Court of King's Bench not only do not contradict the fact so deposed to, but rather support the inference that it is true. In stating the reserved case Judge Choquette has informed the court that although Judge Langelier had certainly been absent from the city of Quebec when the preliminary inquiry was held, neither he nor Judge Langelier can state whether the latter was or was not in his chambers, as alleged in the affidavits, when the trial of the accused began. He adds:\u2014\nL'eut-il \u00e9t\u00e9, vu sa d\u00e9claration qu'il ne pouvait si\u00e9ger, j'avais d'apres ma commission j\u00faridiction pour entendre la cause.\nThe reserved case contains no further statement as to the presence or absence of Judge Langelier.\nI am unable to accede to the contention of counsel for the Crown that the admitted absence of Judge Langelier at the time of the preliminary investigation would give Judge Choquette jurisdiction to sit upon the trial of the defendant. His trial was a new proceeding which began only after arraignment and plea at a later date then fixed for the hearing. Giroux v. The King[4]; Re Walsh[5], at p. 17. The absence of Judge Langelier having been recorded as the ground upon which Judge Choquette acted in his stead, the right of the Crown to invoke Judge Langelier's inability to act, if that be the import of Judge Choquette's reference to \"sa d\u00e9claration qu'll ne pouvait si\u00e9ger,\" would seem at least questionable. I think the case must be dealt with on the footing that Judge Choquette's jurisdiction was dependent upon the \"absence\" of Judge Langelier.\nCounsel for the Crown maintained that entries in the trial book conclusively established his absence and strenuously resisted their being controverted upon extraneous evidence. I question whether upon a proceeding such as this\u2014a recourse afforded by the statute for the very purpose of determining whether the trial is open to exception upon any substantial ground that can properly be stated as a question of law\u2014the verity of a statement in the record in regard to a mixed matter of law and fact essential to his jurisdiction made by or under the direction of a judge of a court of inferior jurisdiction, although it be a court of record, should be conclusively presumed (Mayor of London v. Cox[6]; Falkingham v. Victorian Railways Commissioner[7], at pages 463-4).\nBut we are dealing with a stated case (sub.-sec. 6 of sec. 1014) and, except as provided for by sub.-sec. 2 of sec. 1017 and subject to the power conferred by sub-sec. 3 of the same section, I incline strongly to the view that in disposing of the questions reserved the appellate court is confined to the facts set forth in the stated case. Unless the affidavit of Chouinard, intituled and filed in the Court of Sessions should be taken to be part of the stated case, it does not disclose the presence of Judge Langelier in the court house or even in the city of Quebec at the time when the defendant's trial began. In the view I take, however, it is unnecessary to determine these points.\nFor the purpose of disposing of the question now under consideration I shall assume (without so deciding) that it has been established by material proper for our consideration that Judge Langelier, though not present in court, was in fact in his chambers at the court house when the trial began. The defendant and his counsel appear not to have been aware of that fact, however, until after the trial had concluded and may therefore be excused for not having taken exception before or during it to the jurisdiction of the presiding judge.\nActing under Art. 3262(a) of the R.S.Q. (enacted by 5 Geo. V., ch. 52, sec. 3) Judge Choquette was empowered to hold the Court of Sessions of the Peace only\nin case of the absence or inability to act of one or more of the (Judges of the Court of Sessions of the Peace).\nBy the Order-in-Council by which he was appointed and in his commission the judge whom he is to replace is designated as\nthe Judge of the Court of Sessions of the Peace whose residence is established in the City of Quebec.\nThis was Judge Langelier.\nThe expression \"absence or inability to act\" should of course be given a construction at once reasonable and in harmony with the purpose of the statute. \"Inability to act\" may or may not involve \"absence.\" It is usually accompanied by physical absence; and absence may be due to physical inability to be present. But, as used in the statute, \"absence\" clearly means something different from \"inability to act.\" It connotes physical non-presence from whatever cause. The question is non-presence in what place or within what area? We are not concerned with the cause of absence. It must be presumed to be for some good and sufficient reason (Engeman v. The State[8]), and not to be due solely to a mere arbitrary refusal to act, since such dereliction of duty (Klaise v. The State[9]) will not be assumed. For an instance of a statute authorising a deputy magistrate to sit upon the mere request of the magistrate appointed to hold the court see R.S.O. 1914, ch. 88, sec. 10.\nIt cannot have been the intention of the legislature that the jurisdiction of the replacing judge and the validity of any trial had before him should be open to question merely because it can be shewn that when it began the Judge of the Court of Sessions of the Peace was elsewhere in the city of Quebec or even in the court house itself. Many grave inconveniences and uncertainties in the administration of justice would result from such a construction of the statute. It would impose upon the replacing judge the obligation of instituting a judicial inquiry as to the whereabouts of the Judge of the Court of Sessions of the Peace before the commencement of every trial.\n\"Absence,\" as used in this statute, must, I think, be taken to mean absence from the bench, or, at the utmost, absence from the court-room in which the trial takes place. That is a fact of which the replacing judge can be personally cognisant when the trial is beginning. Beyond that his actual knowledge ordinarily cannot extend. Reason and authority would seem to concur in indicating this to be the proper construction of what must be conceded to be an ambiguous term (Watkins v. Mooney[10], at pages 652-4)\nseldom used without explanatory words.\nPhillips v. Phillips[11], at p. 172. Thus it may necessarily import prior presence. Buchanan v. Rucker[12], at p. 194; or it may mean merely\nnot being in a particular place at the time referred to,\nwithout importing prior presence. Ashbury v. Ellis[13], at p. 345. It may imply constructive as well as actual absence. In re Brown[14], at p. 385. In its technical meaning and standing alone it signifies \"want of appearance.\" Phillips v. Phillips[15]. In common usage (it) simply means a state\nof being away from or at a distance from, not in company with,\nPaine v. Drew[16], at p. 317; and the words of a statute are to be taken in their ordinary familiar signification and import. Potter's Dwarris on Statutes, p. 193.\nThe reference in the order-in-council and commission to the \"residence in the city of Quebec\" of Judge Langelier are invoked by the appellant in support of his contention that \"absence\" here means absence from that city. But these words are not in the statute, and it is the statute that prescribes the conditions of the jurisdiction which it confers. The language of the commission and order-in-council cannot aid in its construction.\nIn Bingham v. Cabbot[17], the Supreme Court of the United States was called upon to determine the meaning of the word \"absent\" in a statute affecting the constitution of Federal Circuit Courts. By sec. 4 of ch. 20 of the statute of the 1st session of the First Congress the Federal Circuit Courts were constituted each to consist of two Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States and the District Judge. Sec. 1 of ch. 22 of the statute of the 2nd session of the Second Congress enacted that the attendance of only one of the Justices of the Supreme Court should be sufficient and that\nwhen only one Judge of the Supreme Court shall attend any Circuit Court and the District Judge shall be absent * * * such Circuit Court may consist of the said Judge of the Supreme Court alone.\nIt appeared that the District Judge was present on the Bench but a memorandum in the margin of the record stated that he \"did not sit in the cause.\" The court said, at p. 36:\u2014\nWe are perfectly clear in the opinion that, although the District Judge was on the Bench, yet, if he did not sit in the cause, he was absent in contemplation of law.\nIn Engeman v. The State[18], a similar question arose under a New Jersey statute of 1888 enabling the Chief Justice, or any associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the State\nin case of absence, sickness or other inability, or vacancy in the office of the law or president judge of any county in this State to sit or perform the duties of his office.\nVan Syckle J., delivering the judgment of the court, said, at p. 251:\u2014\nIt is not necessary that the Supreme Court Justice, before he may proceed with the business in these courts shall institute a judicial inquiry to ascertain why the law judge is not in attendance. \"Absence\" in this Act means non-presence in the courts; when the law judge is temporarily away he must be presumed to be away by reason of some inability to attend and he is absent in the statutory sense.\nIn Byrne v. Arnold[19], the Supreme Court of New Brunswick passed upon the construction of the 105th section of the Canada Temperance Act, providing that\nif (a) prosecution is brought before two * * * justices no other justice shall sit or take part therein unless by reason of their absence or the absence of one of them, etc.\nThe court was of the opinion that if the justices before whom the prosecution was begun were lawfully subpoenaed as witness, they would, although physically present in the court-room, be \"absent\" in contemplation of the statute so that two other justices might lawfully carry on the proceeding. Allen C.J., with whom Weldon and Fraser JJ. concurred, said at 164:\nI think the word \"absence\" in this section does not necessarily mean actual absence from the place or room where the trial is held; but would apply to a case where the justices had, for some cause, become incapable of sitting and taking part in the proceedings. If such was the case I think they would be absent within the meaning of the Act, though not absent in fact.\nPalmer J. adds at 167:\nWhen the Canada Temperance Act enacts that when a justice is absent another can act, it does not mean that such justice is not in any particular house or place but simply that he is not taking part in the hearing of the case, i.e., does not form a member of the court * * * If this construction of the Act is not correct it would be in the power of a defendant to defeat any trial, and a construction that would lead to such a result, I do not think is even reasonable.\nIn Ex parte Cormier[20], the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, again called upon to construe a statute empowering another magistrate to act in the absence of the police magistrate, held that\nThe absence intended is * * * not actual absence from the jurisdiction or even from the place of trial, but it includes inability to attend to the business of the court such as was proved in this case.\nThe attendance of the police magistrate had been required before another tribunal apparently sitting in the same building at the time of the trial.\nOf course the history of the legislation or the context of the statute may indicate an intention that the word \"absence\" should receive a stricter construction. Opie v. Clancy[21], at pages 46-7-. Compare Manners v. Ripsam[22] with Lucas v. Ensign[23], at p. 144.\nWhile I think that the mention of inability to act of the Judge of Sessions as a distinct ground upon which the replacing judge may sit in his stead makes it clear that \"absence\" in the statute means actual absence and not merely constructive absence such as was held is sufficient in Bingham v. Cabbot[24], and Byrne v. Arnold[25], I am of the opinion that the \"absence\" of Judge Langelier is sufficiently established by the admitted fact that when the trial of the appellant began he was neither on the Bench nor in the court-room where such trial was held. His subsequent presence would be immaterial. Reg. v. Perkin[26]; Ex parte Cormier[27].\n(2) The evidence in chief on behalf of the Crown furnished cogent proof of a miscarriage having followed the use by the defendant upon the person of Alice Vachon of instruments adapted to procure it. That it was so caused was an inference clearly open. The defendant's criminal intent was also prim\u00e2 facie established since every man is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his acts. Giving evidence on his own behalf the accused admitted having used instruments as deposed to by the chief witness for the Crown (a matter theretofore in issue on his plea of not guilty), but he denied his intent to procure a miscarriage, averring that miscarriage had in fact already begun before his intervention and that his purpose was merely to obviate septic poisoning. The defence of innocent intent was thus set up. To rebut this defence \u2014to aid the court in determining the true intent of the accused, thus made the vital issue\u2014the Crown maintains that evidence of the use by him of similar instruments in two other cases for the purpose of procuring miscarriage was admissible.\nThe objections taken by the defence to the admissibility of this evidence are that it is irrelevant to the issue, that it is unfair to the accused as tending to prove the commission by him of other crimes and that he is a person of bad character, and that it contradicts him on a collateral issue.\nAnswers of the accused upon purely collateral matters are no doubt conclusive. But matter that is relevant is not purely collateral. Moreover, that the evidence in question had the effect of contradicting him on such a matter would not be a good reason for excluding it if otherwise admissible.\nIt no doubt tended to impeach the defendant's character. But that again does not form a ground for its exclusion if admissible for other purposes. Rex v. Kurasch[28], cited by Mr. Roy himself, makes this very clear. See too Rex v. Thompson[29].\nThe other objections are more serious and, in view of the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in Rex v. Pollard[30], call for careful consideration. Counsel for the Crown maintains that the evidence in question is relevant and admissible because in itself it tends to make it more probable that the intent of the accused in using instruments on Alice Vachon was criminal and not innocent and also because it established two of a number of cases in which, according to the evidence of Alice Vachon, the accused had stated to her that he had administered like treatment under similar circumstances, and is corroborative of her testimony. The passage in Alice Vachon's evidence is as follows:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Est-ce que le m\u00e9decin a essay\u00e9 de vous rassurer? R.\u2014Oui monsieur.\nQ.\u2014Qu'est-ce qu'il vous a dit? R.\u2014Il m\u2019a dit qu'il en traitait d'autres pour la m\u00eame chose que moi et qu'il y en avait que \u00e7a prenait du temps, plus de temps que moi.\nQ.\u2014Vous en a-t-il nomm\u00e9 des cas? R.\u2014Il m'a pas nomm\u00e9 des cas. Il m'a pas nomm\u00e9 les noms, mais qu'il y en avait une \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec ici qui restait chez eux \u00e0 elle et puis qu'elle \u00e9tait malade la m\u00eame chose que moi, mais qu'elle \u00e9tait pas d\u00e9courag\u00e9e. Q.\u2014Vous a-t-il parl\u00e9 de d'autres aussi, mademoiselle? R.\u2014Oui, il m'a dit qu'il y en avait deux ou trois qu'il soignait comme \u00e7a.\nThis testimony counsel for the Crown maintains affords some evidence that procuring abortion was systematic with the accused.\nIn Pollard's Case[31], basing its decision on Rex v. Bond[32], the Ontario Court of Appeal held that testimony similar to that given in the case at bar by Bernadette Cleremont n\u00e9e Cloutier and Laetitia Cloutier had been improperly admitted in the absence of other evidence of a system of the existence of which a single prior criminal act of the same kind would not afford any proof.\nIn Makin v. Attorney-General for New South Wales[33], at p. 65, Lord Herschell formulated the rule in these terms, which have been accepted as authoritative in all subsequent cases:\u2014\nIt is undoubtedly not competent for the prosecution to adduce evidence tending to shew that the accused has been guilty of criminal acts other than those covered by the indictment, for the purpose of leading to the conclusion that the accused is a person likely from his criminal conduct or character to have committed the offence for which he is being tried. On the other hand, the mere fact that the evidence adduced tends to shew the commission of other crimes does not render it inadmissible if it be relevant to an issue before the jury, and it may be so relevant if it bears upon the question whether the acts alleged to constitute the crime charged in the indictment were designed or accidental or to rebut a defence which would otherwise be open to the accused.\nThis language is expressly approved of by the House of Lords in Rex v. Ball[34]. In Rex v. Wyatt[35], Lord Alverstone, after citing it, quoted from the judgment of Lord Russell of Killowen C.J. in Reg. v. Rhodes[36], at p. 81, the following passage:\u2014\nIt seems to me quite clear that if the transactions with Elston and Chambers had taken place before that with Bays at a period not too remote, the evidence of Elston and Chambers would have been admissible against the prisoner. The transactions with them were similar to that charged in the indictment. At p. 193 Lord Alverstone concludes:\u2014\nThe evidence objected to was clearly admissible as tending to establish a systematic course of conduct on the part of the accused and as negativing any accident or mistake or the existence of any reasonable or honest motive.\n\"These last words,\" says Jelf J., in Rex v. Bond[37], at p. 412, \"are equivalent to and confirm Lord Herschell's expression\nto rebut a defence which would be otherwise open to the accused.\nAs Darling J. points out in the same case, at p. 409, Lord Herschell did not mean\nthat such evidence might be called to rebut any defence possibly open but of an intention to rely on which there was no probability whatever. Here, however, the evidence was called to overthrow a defence already set up and admitted to be the defendant's answer to the charge.\nIn the latest reported case that I have found, Rex v. Thompson[38], Lord Reading C.J. said, at p. 632:\u2014\nThere is no doubt as to the principles of law applicable to this case; they are well settled and in recent years have been frequently discussed and approved, and notably by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, in Makin v. Attorney-General for New South Wales[39], and by the House of Lords in R. v. Ball[40]. The general rule is that the evidence tendered must be relevant to the charge for which the accused is being tried. If the evidence merely proves, or tends to prove, that the accused is of such evil character or disposition that he is likely to have committed the offence charged against him, it is irrelevant and is inadmissible. If it tend? to prove that the accused committed the crime charged against him it is relevant and admissible, notwithstanding that incidentally it may also prove, or tend to prove, that the accused is a person of criminal or immoral character or disposition. Reg. v. Ollis (per Channell J.)[41]; Perkins v. Jeffery[42]. The difficulty lies in the application of this general rule to particular cases.\nThis judgment was affirmed in the House of Lords, 13 Crim. App. R. 61[43]. In Rex v. Boyle and Merchant[44], at p. 347, the same learned Chief Justice, discussing the admissibility against a defendant charged with demanding money with menaces of evidence of other recent transactions similar in all respects to that charged, said\nWe think that the ground upon which such evidence is admissible is that it is relevant to the question of the real intent of the accused in doing the acts. Its object is to negative such a defence as mistake or accident or absence of criminal intent and to prove the guilty mind which is the necessary ingredient of the offence charged. * * * In the recent case of Mason v. Rex[45], this court followed the decision in Reg. v. Rhodes[46], and came to the conclusion that the evidence of similar transactions subsequent to the charge was admissible in order to rebut the defence set up.\nAvory J., quoting the foregoing language with approval in delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Perkins v. Jeffrey[47], at p. 708, preceded it with this statement:\u2014\nBut it is, we think, open to doubt whether evidence is admissible to prove a \"system or course of conduct\" unless it is relevant to negative accident or mistake or to prove a particular intention.\nIn Rex. v. Shellaker[48], on a prosecution for unlawfully and carnally knowing a girl under 16, evidence of previous acts and conduct of the accused tending to shew that he had previously had connection with the girl was held admissible, as Isaacs C.J. said, citing Reg. v. Ollis[49], for the purpose of shewing intent. See too Rex v. Smith,[50]; Reg. v. Francis[51]; Archbold's Criminal Pleading Evidence and Practice, 25th ed. (1918), 345 et seq. Roscoe's Criminal Evidence, 12th ed., p. 80.\nIn Rex v. Fisher[52], Channell J., speaking for the Court of Criminal Appeal, said at p. 152:\u2014 The principle is clear, however, and if the principle is attended to I think it will usually be found that the difficulty of applying it to a particular case will disappear. The principle is that the prosecution are not allowed to prove that the prisoner has committed the offence with which he is charged by giving evidence that he is a person of bad character and one who is in the habit of committing crimes, for that is equivalent to asking the jury to say that because the prisoner has committed other offences he must therefore be guilty of the particular offence for which he is being tried. But if the evidence of other offences does go to prove that he committed the offence charged, it is admissible because it is relevant to the issue, and it is admissible not because, but notwithstanding that, it proves that the prisoner has committed another offence.\nAnd at p. 153:\nIf all the cases had been frauds of a similar character shewing a systematic course of swindling by the same method, then the evidence would have been admissible.\nThe passage first quoted from the Fisher Case[53] is approved in Rex v. Rodley[54], at p. 472. In Rex v. Ball[55], a case of incest, the House of Lords upheld the admission of evidence of previous incestuous relations between the defendants to establish, as Lord Loreburn C. says, at p. 71, that\nthe proper inference from their occupying the same bedroom and the same bed was an inference of guilt or\u2014which is the same thing, in another way\u2014that the defence of innocent being together as brother and sister ought to fail.\nThis, says Avory J. in Rex v. Rodley54, at p. 473,\ncomes within the rule previously indicated that (such) evidence is admissible to rebut a defence really in issue.\nIn Reg. v. Ollis[56], the defendant was charged with obtaining money on three worthless cheques. To prove guilty knowledge the prosecutor on a former charge against the accused (of which he had been acquitted), based on a like use of a single worthless cheque, was called and gave evidence that he had been induced to give the accused his cheque by a false representation that another cheque taken in exchange was good. A strong court held the evidence admissible, Lord Russell of Killowen C.J. saying, at p. 76:\u2014\nIt is impossible to say that all these facts were not relevant as shewing an intention to defraud. The fact of the dishonour of the first cheque might, and perhaps ought to, have been capable of explanation, but it is impossible to say that it was not relevant.\nChannell J., at p. 782, gives a very apt illustration of the principle as applied to a case of passing counterfeit coin.\nIn part the syllabus in The People v. Hodge[57], reads as follows:\u2014\nWhere defendant on trial for manslaughter in procuring an abortion, admitted the abortion, but claimed that he believed that the operation was necessary, and that he performed it without criminal intent, evidence that he had performed a similar operation on another woman for the purpose of producing an abortion was admissible on the issue of intent.\nSee too The People v. Seaman[58], at p. 357 et seq.\nI do not cite Reg. v. Dale[59], referred to by Mr. Justice Cross, because, although very much in point, and an opinion of Charles J., whom Lord Alverstone in Rex v. Thomson[60], at p. 22, speaks of as \"a great authority,\" it has been adversely commented upon by that learned Chief Justice at p. 396 and by Lawrence J., at p. 424, in Rex v. Bond[61], the case which probably calls for the most careful consideration.\nThat case involved a charge similar to that now before us. The accused had admitted to Crown witnesses that he had used instruments on the complainant but \"suggested\" that it was for a lawful purpose and with no criminal intent.\nThat was substantially his defence. The evidence of one Taylor, that he had performed a like operation upon her to procure a miscarriage, was admitted to shew criminal intent. She added, however, that the accused had told her \"he had put dozens of girls right.\" The judgments are very carefully and, if I may be permitted to say so, as was usual with that learned judge, very accurately analysed by Osier J.A. in Rex v. Pollard[62], with the probable exception of that of A. T. Lawrence J. As Mr. Justice Osier says, at p. 99:\u2014\nThe point (in Pollard's Case62) was not actually decided in the recent case of The King v. Bond[63], but it would seem from the opinions of the majority of the judges who took part in the decision that the evidence was not in the circumstances admissible. * * * In the case before us the evidence of system which carried the day against the accused in The King v. Bond (supra), or anything approaching it, which would let in proof of a single prior criminal act as part of a system is wanting; and therefore, in my opinion, the conviction of the prisoners cannot stand (p. 102).\nThe evidence of system referred to was the statement of the prisoner in the Bond Case63 made to the Crown witness Taylor that, \"he had put dozens of girls right.\" Pollard's Case62, therefore, is authority for the admissibility on the issue of intent of proof of a single prior criminal act of like nature provided some proof is first given of a system of which it may form part.\nOf the seven judges who heard the appeal in the Bond Case63, two, Alverstone C.J. and Ridley J., thought the evidence of the prior act inadmissible apparently because the defence was not accident or mistake and the evidence of system was in their opinion insufficient.\nJelf J. and. Darling J. thought the evidence admissible without reference to the statement of the accused as to his treatment of dozens of other girls, and that the fact that it was a single instance affected only its weight and not its admissibility. The reasoning of Darling J., at pp. 409-10, is very cogent. He concludes:\u2014\nTaylor's evidence went to prove that, contrary to the defendant's allegation in defence as to his being engaged in doing a lawful act, he was doing a thing which, in his view, was apt to procure abortion, and that because it was so he had already done it with that unlawful avowed knowledge and purpose. This evidence, therefore, tends to prove that the defendant had, in repeating his former conduct, an intention different from that alleged by him in his defence, so it is not foreign to the point of it nor less relevant because it goes to prove the charge in the indictment.\nJelf J., at p. 413, says:\u2014\nUpon the question whether there was or was not a design on the prisoner's part to procure the miscarriage of Ethel Jones evidence that on another occasion he had done the same thing with similar instruments under similar circumstances with that design upon another girl seems to me to have a definite bearing. The fact that only one other case was brought forward and that case nine months old, goes in my mind, only to the weight, and not to the admissibility of the evidence. The subject of inquiry is the state of mind of the prisoner when he used the instruments upon Ethel Jones and the improbability that on one occasion under precisely similar circumstances he should have the design to procure a miscarriage, and on the other occasion should have another and an innocent object would tend to shew (and that is all that is necessary) that he had the bad design in regard to Ethel Jones. Of course, if instances are multiplied, the weight of the evidence is greatly increased, and if a system is shewn it may be irresistible. But to my mind it is quite unnecessary to shew a system which is only a question of degree.\nKennedy J., if there had not been anything more, would have excluded the evidence of a single prior act done nine months before as affording no just ground of an inference of guilty intent in the case on trial. Citing Reg. v. Cooper[64], at pp. 549-50, however, he thought the statement made by the prisoner to the witness Taylor could not be excluded and amounted to proof of a course of conduct sufficient to render proof of the prior operation admissible as evidence of an act that formed part of such course of conduct and warranting an inference of a systematic pursuit of the same criminal object. A single instance of a former similar offence is in his opinion relevant without proof of system only to rebut a defence of accident or mistake.\nI confess my inability to understand how evidence of a single prior similar act can be relevant to an issue of design versus accident or mistake, if it be wholly irrelevant to an issue of criminal versus innocent intent.\nA. T. Lawrence J., as I read his judgment, distinctly held evidence of the former offence admissible as relevant on the issue of intent. He says, at p. 420:\u2014\nThe relevance depends upon the issues actually in contest; whenever it is in issue whether the prisoner, though he did the act alleged, did it without any intention, i.e., accidentally, or without any criminal intention, i.e., innocently, such evidence may be given.\n*********\nIf the act charged is manifestly an intentional act, but the defence is that it was honestly or properly done, such evidence is admissible to rebut this defence by shewing knowledge of some fact essential to guilty knowledge or by shewing that in other cases similar acts have been committed by the prisoner by the like means under the like circumstances. The number of cases and the peculiarity of the circumstances tend to shew the improbability of the innocent intention (p. 421).\nThe mind of the prisoner can only be revealed by his words or by his acts. It is in many cases impossible to form a sound conclusion upon the state of his mind at a given moment, unless his words and acts under similar circumstances are subjected to investigation. It is for this reason that I think the words of Lord Herschell\u2014\"to rebut a defence which would otherwise be open to the accused\"\u2014are an essential part of the proposition of law. This idea is also expressed by Lord Alverstone C.J. in Rex v. Wyatt[65], when he says that such evidence is admissible as negativing any accident or mistake or the existence of any reasonable or honest motive.\nAny statement of the law which omits this latter part of the proposition would seriously cramp the administration of justice and cannot be supported upon principle.\n*********\nIn all cases in order to make evidence of this class admissible there must be some connection between the facts of the crime charged in the indictment and the facts proved in evidence. In proximity of time, in method, or in circumstances there must be a nexus between the two sets of facts otherwise no inference can be safely deduced therefrom (p. 424).\nThe learned judge concluded:\u2014\nIt is impossible without reversing a long series of cases to say that the evidence of Taylor was not admissible. It shewed that the illness of the prosecutrix was the result of design, and not of accident; it shewed that the prisoner's scheme or system when the indulgence of his passions had got girls into trouble was to use these instruments upon them to relieve himself from the burden of paternity; it tended to rebut the defence he set up of an innocent operation, and to negative any reasonable or honest motive for its performance.\nIt seems to me with respect, to be reasonably clear that Mr. Justice Lawrence agreed with Darling and Jelf JJ. rather than with Kennedy and Bray JJ., as Mr. Justice Osier appears to have thought.\nNo doubt, however, as put by Osier J.A., it was\nthe evidence of system which carried the day against the accused in The King v. Bond[66].\nIt led Kennedy and Bray JJ. to hold the evidence in question admissible thus supporting the conclusion of Darling, Jelf, and Lawrence JJ. in favour of dismissing the appeal. While the Bond Case66, therefore, certainly cannot be cited as an authoritative decision for the admission of evidence of the commission by the accused of another similar offence, if unaccompanied by some other similar evidence of system, to prove criminal intent where that is in issue, or to rebut a defence of innocent or lawful purpose, the reasoning of Darling, Jelf, and Lawrence JJ. seems to me unanswerable. With Jelf J. I am of the opinion that whatever objection there may be to evidence of a single other similar offence goes to its weight only and not to its admissibility. It\ntends to rebut the defence (of innocent purpose) which would be otherwise open to the accused\n(Makin v. Attorney-General for New South Wales[67])\u2014\nto rebut the defence set up,\n(Mason v. Rex[68])\u2014\nto rebut a defence really in issue,\n(Rex v. Rodley[69])\u2014 to overthrow a defence already set up and admitted to be the defendant's answer to the charge\nRex v. Bond[70], per Darling J.\u2014\nIts object is to negative the defence of absence of criminal intent (Rex v. Boyle and Merchant[71]), to establish that the defence of innocent conduct should fail (Rex v. Ball[72]), to prove a particular intention (Perkins v. Jeffrey[73]). With Lord Russell C.J. I find it impossible to say that such evidence is not relevant (Reg. v. Ollis[74]), inasmuch as it tends to make more probable the criminal intent regarding which, in view of the defence set up, it was essential that the Crown should not leave room for reasonable doubt. How far it does so is a question of degree which affects its weight not its admissibility; see the speech of Lord Atkinson in Rex v. Thompson[75], at p. 72.\nBut while I think the evidence of the Cleremont and Cloutier women was admissible without and apart from any evidence of system, we have in the passage quoted from, the testimony of Alice Vachon, an admission by the accused of his practice or system of procuring abortions quite as clear and strong as was that deposed to by the witness Taylor in the Bond Case70 and deemed sufficient by Kennedy and Bray JJ. to render admissible evidence of another like offence committed by the accused. The evidence here is of two like offences in the commission of which the method pursued was so similar to that adopted in the accused's treatment of Alice Vachon that the necessary nexus is clear notwithstanding that they took place, one, two years, and the other, four or five years before.\nThe admissibility of the evidence could probably be upheld also on the ground that it is corroborative of the testimony of Alice Vachon that the accused had told of having treated other girls in the same manner. Rex v. Chitson[76].\nThe weight of the testimony was, of course, for the consideration of the trial judge in this case, as it would have been for that of a jury had the trial been by jury, I entertain no doubt whatever that the evidence objected to was admissible.\nNor have I any doubt that the evidence was properly received in rebuttal. It was offered to meet the defence of innocent purpose put forward by the accused. While such a defence was always open, there was no probability of its being set up until the prisoner gave his testimony. It was then actually in issue. Rex v. Bond[77], at pp. 409, 420. The evidence was offered to rebut the respondent's denial of criminal intent and, according to the view stated in a very recent criminal case, could not properly have been admitted for that purpose until that defence was definitely put forward. Avory J. in delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Perkins v. Jeffery[78], said, at p. 708:\nHaving regard to what was said in the House of Lords in the case of Rex v. Christie[79], as to the practice in a criminal case of guarding against the accused being prejudiced by evidence which though admissible would probably have a prejudicial influence on the minds of the jury out of proportion of its true evidential value, we think that such evidence as to other occasions should not be admitted unless and until the defence of accident or mistake, or absence of intention to insult, is definitely put forward.\nBut as Osier J.A. said in Rex v. Pollard[80], at p. 103, in answer to the contention of the appellants that the evidence objected to, if admissible, should have formed part of the Crown's case in the first instance and that it was erroneous to admit it in reply:\u2014 In my view, however, the point is of no importance. If admissible at all, the evidence might, by leave of and in the discretion of the trial judge, be given at either stage of the case for the purpose of disproving honesty of motive, if that were the defence relied upon, or of rebutting a defence of accident or mistake, or to contradict the defendant on a point material to the charge, as in The King v. Biggins[81].\nIn Rex v. Crippen[82], the Court of Criminal Appeal held that:\nWhere evidence which is relevant to the issue is tendered by the prosecution to rebut the case set up by the defence it is for the judge at the trial to determine in his discretion whether such evidence should be allowed to be given or not. Even if the judge exercised his discretion in a way different from that in which the Court of Criminal Appeal would have exercised it, that affords no ground for quashing the conviction of the prisoner. If, however, it is shewn in any case that the prosecution has done something unfair which has resulted in injustice to the prisoner the Court of Appeal may interfere.\nHere the learned judge when admitting the testimony of Cleremont and Clouthier definitely informed the defendant that he would have the fullest opportunity of meeting it by calling any further evidence he might wish in sur-rebuttal and offered him an adjournment for that purpose; and the defendant actually gave evidence in contradiction of that given by those witnesses.\nNot only was the evidence in my opinion properly admitted but every care was taken that the accused should suffer no possible injustice by its reception in rebuttal.\nThe appeal fails and should be dismissed.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed with costs. The reasons for judgment of Mr. Justice Anglin and of Mr. Justice Lemieux having been communicated to me, I concur in those reasons.\nLemieux C.J. (ad hoc).\u2014On the 15th May, 1917, Brunet, a physician, was convicted, before Judge Choquette, at Quebec, of practising abortion on the person of one Alice Vachon, and sentenced for such crime to five years in the penitentiary (303 Crim. Code).\nBefore passing sentence, the judge at Brunet's request reserved for the decision of the Court of King's Bench, the two following questions:\u2014\n1. Whether the presiding judge had jurisdiction to hear and determine the case;\n2. Whether certain evidence adduced in rebuttal by the Crown was legal or not.\nAppellant Brunet has contended, as well before the Court of King's Bench as before the present court, that Judge Choquette had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the case and that the evidence in reply put in by the Crown was illegal and prejudicial to the accused inasmuch as the trial judge had relied on such evidence to convict the appellant.\nFirst Question.\nValidity of the evidence in rebuttal or in reply adduced by the Crowm\nAs stated in the record of the reserved case, it was proved by the prosecution that the accused had, on the 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th days of July, 1916, used certain surgical instruments on the person of one Alice Vachon, an unmarried female, who was pregnant at the time, for the purpose of procuring her miscarriage.\nThe Crown, in making its proof in chief, adduced the evidence of the girl upon whom the illegal operation had been performed as well as medical evidence of the symptoms of Alice Vachon and of the mutilated condition of the f\u0153tus and then rested its case.\nBrunet, the accused, thought proper to be examined in his own behalf and stated, as a witness, that the instruments used by him on the person of Alice Vachon were so used for a lawful purpose and without any criminal intent.\nIn order to repel such criminal intent which the girl's evidence would fasten on him, the following question is put to Brunet by his attorney:\u2014\nQ.\u2014At all the visits which Alice Vachon made to you, she has sworn that you had worked in her body with certain instruments to bring about abortion, at almost every one of her visits, except in the afternoon; I ask you, is that true or not?\nA.\u2014I did not use instruments to bring about abortion, but I used instruments to produce disinfection.\nIn cross-examination, he was asked by the Crown if it was not true that, in 1914, he had procured the miscarriage of two females living on Bridge St., Quebec city.\nFollowing are the questions asked him in that connection as well as his answers thereto:\u2014\nQ.\u2014Now, did you not either procure the abortion of two young girls residing on Bridge St. in the fall of 1914? Question objected to. Question allowed. A.\u2014It was not done, that is sure.\nQ.\u2014I put you the question whether, in the fall of 1914, you did not procure the abortion particularly of a girl residing on Bridge St.? Question objected to. Objection reserved. A.\u2014I do not recollect that.\nQ.\u2014Will you swear that that did not happen? A.\u2014I would have to see the person to be able to tell.\nQ.\u2014You cannot remember? A.\u2014Why no; in 1914, I do not remember.\nThe Crown, in reply or in rebuttal, heard, as witnesses, two women, Laetitia Cloutier and Bernadette Clouthier, who testified that the appellant had procured the miscarriage of each of them, some few years before, by methods which resembled those described by Alice Vachon as having been applied to her.\nBrunet, heard as a witness in his own behalf, expressly admits having used instruments on the person of Alice Vachon; he denies however that it was with the criminal intent of procuring abortion, but states, on the contrary, that it was for disinfection purposes. Brunet's assertion was obviously intended to exculpate himself and to repel or disprove all evidence tending to shew that he had employed such instruments for abortive purposes.\nUnder such circumstances, was the Crown entitled to contradict Brunet, to rebut his affirmation and to examine, in reply, witnesses to shew that Brunet, with a criminal intent, that of causing abortion, had performed, on those very witnesses, similar practices, using instruments like those used in the case of Alice Vachon? In this matter of evidence in reply, the rule adopted by all the English authors is that such evidence must not be confirmatory. Evidence in reply must, as a general rule, be strictly confined to rebutting the defendant's case and must not merely confirm that of the plaintiff or prosecutor.\nBrunet's contention, as embodied in his testimony, that he had used certain instruments on the person of Alice Vachon not with a view to determining abortion but in order to produce disinfection, purported on his behalf the allegation of a certain fact intended to establish his good faith and dismiss any criminal intent.\nSuch his claim amounted to a special plea based on a special fact which the Crown, in the examination in chief, could not anticipate. That theory of the disinfection constituted a new fact which the Crown had the right to disprove or rebut by evidence in reply of other facts excluding good faith, that is to say, of similar practices previously performed by the accused, on other persons, for a like criminal purpose.\nSuch evidence was not confirmatory of the prosecutor's case, but was evidence the nature and intent of which was to rebut the defendant's case and pretensions.\nJurisprudence or at least a list of judgments are to the effect that the evidence to prove in reply or in rebuttal against the accused similar acts committed by him on other occasions is legal, when the defence of absence of intent to commit a crime is definitely put forward. It has been decided that such evidence was admissible upon three grounds: to establish design, to rebut the defence of accident, mistake or lack of criminal intent, and as shewing a systematic course of conduct.\nAs said in Perkins v. Jeffery[83]:\nThere is an essential difference between evidence tending to shew generally that the accused had a fraudulent or dishonest mind, * * and evidence tending to shew that he had a fraudulent or dishonest mind in the particular transaction, the subject matter of the charge, then being investigated.\nIn the most recent criminal law treatise entitled Outlines of Criminal Law, published by Kenny, Professor of the Laws of England, 8th ed., p. 354, we find the following doctrine expounded:\u2014\nNor is there, even in English law, any intrinsic objection to giving evidence of the prisoner having committed other crimes, if there be any special circumstance in the case to render those crimes legally relevant,\n*********\nWhilst the fact of a prisoner having committed other similar offences is not relevant to the question whether he committed the actus reus of which he is accused now, yet, so soon as this actus reus has been fully established, evidence of those previous offences may well be relevant to the question of his state of mind in committing this act (his mens rea) if the defendant do actually raise that question (Rex v. Rodley)[84]. Such evidence was originally admitted only in exceptional offences where a denial of mens rea was peculiarly easy, like embezzlement or false pretences. But now the admissibility is recognised as a general rule in no way limited to peculiar classes of crime.\nAnd the author quotes a number of cases where decisions were rendered supporting that principle.\nOn that ground, we find: that the evidence in reply adduced by the Crown through the two girls Leatitia and Bernadette Clouthier was legal inasmuch as such evidence was not confirmatory of the prosecution's case, but was meant to disprove or deny the assertion made under oath by Brunet, of a new fact intended to establish his good faith; that such evidence was further legal inasmuch as it exposed or purported to expose Brunet's perverse or criminal mind in his practices or in his use of instruments on the person of the Vachon girl, to procure her abortion, by reason of the fact that, for a like criminal purpose, he had previously performed in a similar way on the Clouthier girls.\nSecond Question.\nHad Magistrate Choquette proper jurisdiction to hear and determine the case?\nMagistrate Choquette, who tried and convicted Brunet, is a Judge of the Sessions of the Peace, but his jurisdiction as such is subject to a particular condition, that is to say, he may sit only in the case of absence or inability to act of Judge Langelier, who is the regular Judge of the Sessions of the Peace, in and for the District of Quebec.\nBrunet's contention is that Magistrate Choquette has heard and determined the information with which he was charged without due power or jurisdiction so to do, owing to the fact that, at the time of the trial, Judge Langelier was not absent, but that, on the contrary, he was then present in his chambers, at the court house, Quebec city, and furthermore that the condition to which Magistrate Choquette's jurisdiction is subject, i.e., the absence of Judge Langelier, does not appear in the record.\nAll the proceedings had in the Brunet case before Magistrate Choquette bear, as a head-line, the statement that Magistrate Choquette is sitting in the absence and owing to the absence of Judge Langelier.\nSuch declaration in the record is supposed to be true or implies a presumption pro tantum of truth, to wit: that Judge Langelier was juridically absent for reasons deemed valid which it is not our province to question or appreciate. Such presumption pro tantum could of course be nullified and superseded by a stronger presumption or by legal evidence, offered in the usual way of legal debate, in support of a plea declining the jurisdiction of the court.\nNo such declinatory plea was ever urged in this matter.\nWe read, in Broom's Legal Maxims, p. 722, that\nwhere acts are of an official nature, or require the concurrence of official persons, a presumption arises in favour of their due execution. In these cases the ordinary rule is omnia pr\u0153sumuntur rite et solleniter esse acta donec probetur in contrarium, everything is presumed to be rightly and duly performed until the contrary is shewn. The following may be mentioned as general presumptions of law illustrating this maxim\u2014 that a man, in fact acting in a public capacity, was properly appointed and is duly authorised so to act; that the records of a court of justice have been correctly made, according to the rule, res judicata pro veritate accipitur; that judges and jurors do nothing causelessly and maliciously; that the decisions of a court of competent jurisdiction are well founded, and their judgments regular, etc.\nThe statute, when referring to the absence of Judge Langelier, making conditional upon such absence the jurisdiction with which Magistrate Choquette is vested, uses a word which must be construed in a broad and liberal acceptation. The word \"absent\" does not mean \"physically away from the district or the court house.\" The juridical construction of that word \"absence\" rather implies non-presence of the judge on the bench or in the court-room. The reasons for the judge's absence from the hench or the court-room may be numerous and may consist in relationship to either of the parties in the case, in having expressed his opinion on the matter at issue, in his feeling temporarily indisposed and in so many other reasons ejusdem generis as may induce the judge to abstain from attendance on the bench or in the court-room.\nIt is Judge Langelier himself who, in such instances, appreciates the validity of the reasons of his absence. He is not bound nor called upon to make a statement in writing as to his absence and his reasons therefor or to fyle same in the record, in order to vest Magistrate Choquette with the necessary jurisdiction.\nSuch absence was sufficiently established by the statement heading the proceedings in the case: \"present, Hon. Judge Choquette, in the absence of Judge Langelier.\"\nThe following decision seems to conform to the spirit of the statutory enactment under discussion as well as to common sense: \"Absent\" as used in Acts, 1888, p. 64, authorising the Chief Justice to hold court in the absence of a law judge means non-presence in the courts. When the law judge is temporarily away, he must be presumed to be away by reason of some inability to attend, and he is absent in the statutory sense. The State v. Engeman[85], from Words and Phrases Judicially Defined, vol, 1, p. 35.\nAt the time when the reserved case was argued before the Court of King's Bench, the Crown fyled a sworn declaration wherein Judge Langelier stated that it was to his knowledge and with his consent that Magistrate Choquette had tried the Brunet case.\nSuch statement, supposing it were valid or necessary, would go to shew that Judge Langelier had agreed that the case be heard by Magistrate Choquette, because, obviously, for one reason or another deemed legitimate, he himself did not want to act. The above declaration would also preclude any supposition that Magistrate Choquette might have interfered in the case or arrogated to himself powers and jurisdiction with which he was not legally vested. In this affair, after Brunet had been sentenced, there took place certain formalities which, unless sternly discountenanced and reproved by our courts of justice, might lead to serious mishaps of a nature to interfere with the administration of justice in criminal matters.\nTwo months after the sentence, a clerk in the office of the Court of Sessions of the Peace gave his affidavit wherein he stated that Judge Langelier was present in court while Brunet was being tried. That clerk had no authority to make such declaration which had and could have no legal weight or value whatever. It could not avail as against the oft-repeated statement contained in the record that Magistrate Choquette had acted in the absence of Judge Langelier.\nOther affidavits were also produced either to deny or corroborate the entry made in the record anent the absence of Judge Langelier. Such affidavits were not and could not be of any consequence in the decision of the reserved case. If really Magistrate Choquette had no jurisdiction, if he usurped the functions which he then exercised, there was but one way, during the trial, to dispute his jurisdiction and that was by special plea or exception. And if such want of jurisdiction only came to appellant's knowledge after his conviction, he could yet complain by urging the usual grounds, which he utterly failed to do.\nWe consequently find that Magistrate Choquette had due jurisdiction to hear and determine the case.\nI am for dismissing the appeal.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] [1906] 2 K.B. 389.\n[2] 27 Times L.R. 69.\n[3] 56 Can.

The Quebec Wood and Forest Regulation No. 24 provides that the survey of Crown timber limits, to be valid, must be made according to instructions \"previously approved by the Minister\" of Lands and Forests, and when the survey is completed, the reports, plans and field notes of the surveyor must \"be submitted to the Minister\" and \"approved by him.\" In this case, the instructions, after being issued, were modified by the Chief Superintendent of Surveys, who, being called upon to explain these changes, made a report to the Minister containing his reasons for making them and also annexed to it a plan of the survey operations which had been carried out on those amended instructions. The Deputy Minister, whose approval was equivalent to that of the Minister, then placed his initials on the report with the letters \"Appd.\"\nHeld, Davies C.J. and Mignault J. dissenting, that a new trial should be had to determine whether the Deputy Minister of Lands and Forests had merely approved the explanations given by the Superintendent of Surveys or whether he meant to give his approval to the survey operations as required by Regulation No. 24.\nPer Idington, Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\u2014Parol evidence is admissible to remove such a latent ambiguity.\nPer Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\u2014The requirements of Regulation No. 24 are of the nature of rules of procedure, and the approval of the Minister covers any previous informality in the fulfillment of these requirements. Alexandre v. Brassard ([1895]A.C. 301,) followed.\nPer Davies C.J. and Mignault J. dissenting.\u2014Upon evidence, the intention of the Deputy Minister in approving the report of the Superintendent of Surveys was to give the approval required by Regulation No. 24. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Rimouski, which dismissed the plaintiff's action.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nAlex. Taschereau K.C. and J. Hall Kelly K.C. for the appellant.\nTessier K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting).\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench which reversed a judgment of the Superior Court and awarded the respondent, Price Brothers & Company, the sum of $1,367.45 as damages for wood cut by the appellants upon the respondent's timber limit.\nThe dispute between the parties was as to boundary lines of their respective timber limits and that dispute depended largely, if not altogether, upon the result of a survey of these limits made by surveyor Addie, the plans and report of which survey Addie had reported to Mr. Girard, the Director and Inspector of Surveys, who in his turn had formally submitted Addie's report to the Hon. Jules Allard, Minister of Crown Lands, with very full explanations as to certain changes in the instructions for the survey which had been made by him and the reasons why they had been made.\nThis latter report had been approved of by the Deputy Minister of the Department of Lands and Forests on the 7th April, 1914, and it is conceded that the approval of the Deputy Minister is equivalent by statute to the approval of the Minister himself.\nThe main contention of the appellant Shives Lumber Company on the appeal was that the report of Girard, the Director and Inspector of Surveys, was only one relating to the changes he had made in the \"instructions\" for the survey and did not cover the survey itself which consequently had not been approved of as required by statute before it becomes binding upon interested parties.\nI am quite unable to accept this argument.\nIt is true Girard deals at length in his report with the reasons why he had altered the original instructions, such reasons being that both the parties interested had desired and consented to the changes made, because while one would on the altered instructions gain somewhat on the west the other would receive compensation on the east.\nThe conclusions of his report, however, contain its pith and substance and read (as I translate) as follows:\n(The italics are mine.)\nI will draw your attention also to the fact that said instructions were modified in March, 1912, that the line in question was run according to them, in 1913, giving therefore to the Shives Lumber Co. all the time necessary to oppose said instructions before the work was done on the ground, and that the protest was handed over to Price Bros, and to the Department only on the 15th March last (1914).\nTo the present report I attach a copy of the local map, shewing in yellow the dividing lines between the timber limits belonging to the Shives Lumber Co. and the Price Bros., as well as a blue copy of the plans of the work of Surveyor Addie dividing the timber limits belonging to the two companies on River Rimouski as well as on River Kedzwick. I respectfully submit the whole matter.\nIn my opinion this report of Girard with its accompanying map and\nplans of the work of Surveyor Addie dividing the timber limits belonging to the two companies\non both rivers contains all the essentials required by the law to enable the Minister to approve or otherwise of the report of the survey, and when approved by the Deputy Minister became binding on the parties. Many other questions were argued by counsel at bar. I have had the opportunity of reading the reasons for judgment prepared by Mr. Justice Mignault on all of these points and his conclusions are quite satisfactory to me and need not be repeated. In a letter of the 14th August, 1914, sent by the Deputy Minister of the Department to each of the parties and enclosing copies of the report of Mr. Girard, Superintendent of Surveys, the Deputy says expressly: \"This report has been approved by this Department.\" Nothing could be plainer or clearer than this as shewing departmental approval.\nThis appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014This is an action by the respondent claiming by virtue only of being licensee of the Crown on behalf of Quebec, of a right to cut timber on the Crown domain, to recover from the appellant, which also is a licensee of the said Crown, the value of certain timber alleged to have been cut by the latter.\nThe licences issued by the Crown for such purposes are somewhat indefinite in regard to the exact area supposed to be covered thereby. They transfer no right of property. They are mere licences to cut. The fruits thereof are not such tangible things that trespass or trover may lie for, against one claiming as of right (whatever might be such right against a third party who was a mere tort feasor), unless and until the area covered thereby has been delimited.\nThe parties hereto are rival claimants. The Crown owns the land and the timber and, in order, I presume, to keep in its own hands the control of the delimitation of such lands as a licence may be applicable to and cover, and avert the possibility of confusion arising from mistakes, or worse, on the part of any of those claiming under such licences and consequent loss of revenue, as well as for the protection of all concerned, there are, amongst others of a like kind, regulations passed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, authorized by statute, of which the important one now in question is as follows:\u2014\n24. Crown timber agents, or any other authorized person shall, at the joint written request of holders of adjacent limits, give instructions as to the manner of surveying and running the boundaries of such lands in order that they may be conformable to existing licenses. But, in order to be valid, such instructions must be previously approved by the Minister. Surveys shall be made at the expense of the parties requiring the same, and, when completed, the reports, plans and field notes shall be submitted to the Minister and, if approved by him, a copy shall be sent to the office which issued such instructions and be kept in its archives. The boundaries so established at the joint request of the interested parties shall be fixed and permanent and cannot be altered.\nThere had been instructions by the Deputy Minister, presumably pursuant to another regulation, issued to a surveyor at the request of respondent, to make a survey which might, if fully executed and the results had been duly adopted by the Minister, have been held to have delimited the line between these parties. That work, however, was interrupted upon the appellant complaining to the Minister or his Department.\nI am unable to see how the respondent can found upon that alone any claim.\nIndeed it is not pretended that in law such work as done thereunder can of itself support the respondent's claim.\nIt is useful as an historical introduction to that which transpired later and then coupling what had been so done with later work founded upon a variation of the prior instructions it is contended the whole proceedings constituted a compliance with the above quoted regulation, and thereby in law finally determined the line between the parties and consequently the right of property in that in question.\nIt is not seriously disputed, I imagine, that if such a line had been duly established then the appellant must be held on the facts to have cut some timber within the respondent's limit so established;\nIt is clear that there was a meeting, after the interruption of the survey as directed, of some persons representing in some capacity or other the parties concerned, in presence of the Superintendent of Surveys.\nIt is surprising that they should have left the nature of their decision, if any, of a clear definite nature ever reached, to be the subject matter of dispute, as it is herein, instead of putting in writing what the above quoted regulation requires, namely, \"a joint written request of holders of adjacent limits\" to a Crown timber agent or other authorised person, which I presume the Superintendent of Surveys was. Even then the Minister must previously have approved of the instruction to execute the purpose of said owners before proceeding therewith.\nInstead of such a simple and direct method of procedure as the \"joint written request,\" we are asked to accept instead thereof what may be extracted from an involved, long drawn out correspondence from which assent or conditional assent by each party might be found in the nature of ratification or a willingness to join in such written request. I cannot think that should be accepted as a substitute for the express requirement of the regulation.\nNor can I accept in substitution for the previous approval of the Minister, required by the regulation, a later adoption thereof long after the work relied upon had been completed. And much less so when there is the gravest reason to doubt the import of that which is relied upon as approval.\nLong after the work now relied upon as establishing the line in question was done pursuant to such loose and unbusinesslike methods as I have adverted to, upon appellant complaining of the original instructions having been improperly changed, there seems to have been a request made by the Deputy Minister to the Superintendent of Surveys, to report upon that subject.\nI infer from the contents of the report itself that such was the nature of the request the Superintendent refers to, for we have not in the record the written request for a report. Why that is so, I am at a loss to understand but must do the best I can with the material placed before us. I cannot, under these circumstances, draw from the initialled mark of approval by the Deputy Minister any such sweeping conclusions as we are asked to do from such dubious mark of approval.\nThat was no more nor less than a proper exoneration of an officer charged with erroneously having interpolated something into the original instructions his predecessor had framed, and which the Minister had acted upon.\nIt was an entire work, founded entirely upon instructions previously given or approved by the Minister, that the exigencies of the situation demanded.\nWhat is produced and relied upon as in conformity with the exacting requirements of the regulation falls very far short thereof.\nIndeed no ratification would seem permissible under the regulation in the way of substitution therefor, no matter how desirable.\nRatification was beyond the power of the Minister or his deputy. Nor could the assent of the parties concerned either previous to or after the work was done alter the nature or quality of the proceeding or its results.\nThe rights of the Crown the dominant proprietor could not be thus disposed of.\nUntil the relation between the Crown and each of its licensees in question herein had been accurately determined or the lines thereof laid down as required by law, there was no property vested in respondent, or even right of property which it could assert.\nIt is conceivable that two such licensees as those in question might frame a contract between them providing that in certain contingencies in relation to such districts as in question either should pay or indemnify the other for some supposed wrong done to the other's interest under its licence and thus found a something out of which an action at law upon that contract might arise even if independent of the regulation in question. But nothing of that sort exists in fact herein nor is any such like claim pleaded or attempted to be proven.\nThe action is founded upon a supposed wrong done in or upon or in relation to property which had not yet in law or fact become the property of respondent.\nI can see no possibility of such a right of action being maintainable at present under existing circumstances. Nothing is existent capable of supporting a claim for damages or enabling the proper assessment thereof. Nor can there be unless and until, if ever, the delimitation of the properties under licence has been established either pursuant to the section quoted above or the following sec. 25 of the regulations which does not seem to have been invoked herein as foundation for present claim. I assume above it had originally been acted upon but was not pursued in such a way as to lead to any definite results. I am, therefore, not surprised to find that upon appellant pressing its complaints on the attention of the Minister that he finally decided to refer the question to the law officers of the Crown and as a result thereof that he found it necessary to inform these litigants that he had decided that the modification of instructions, not having been officially made, were of no value and proceedings would have to be taken \"to have this error straightened up,\" to use the phrase announcing the result.\nThe respondent saw fit to take and prosecute this action instead of abiding thereby.\nIt thus assumed the heavy burden of proving a compliance with the regulation and attempted it by circuitous methods which I find failed.\nThe onus of proof resting upon it, the proper and direct method would have been to call the Minister or his deputy as a witness.\nI infer that by reason of the impossibility of shewing that the surveyor's instructions, as amended, had the previous approval of either the Minister or his deputy, which was needed to render same valid, either would have failed to supply the needed proof.\nI, therefore, am of opinion, that the appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the action be dismissed with costs without prejudice to the new survey being had under either regulation\u201424 or 25\u2014with the approval of the Minister or his deputy and to such, if any, rights as the result thereof may disclose the respondent to have.\nSince writing the foregoing I find that I am alone in the result just reached, and to render a judgment of the court possible I assent to the result expressed by those desiring a new trial as being nearest of the divergent opinions of my colleagues to what I conceive, right. Anglin J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Brodeur.\nBrodeur J.\u2014Il s'agit dans cette cause du bornage de terres publiques sur lesquelles l'appelante et l'intim\u00e9e ont des permis de coupe de bois qui leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 octroy\u00e9s en vertu des articles 1597 et suivants des Statuts Refondus de la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nLe bornage de ces concessions foresti\u00e8res ne peut pas se faire de concert entre les propri\u00e9taires voisins, ou par l'intervention de l'autorit\u00e9 judiciaire, ainsi que les articles 504 et 505 du Code Civil le prescrivent pour les terrains des particuliers, mais il ne peut avoir lieu que sur les instructions de l'autorit\u00e9 administrative et il ne devient effectif et l\u00e9gal qu'apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9 par le ministre ou le sous-ministre des Terres et For\u00eats (arts. 24 et 25 des R\u00e8glements des Bois et For\u00eats; et arts. 1527 et 1597 S.R.P.Q.).\nToute la question dans cette cause est de savoir si le bornage invoqu\u00e9 par la demanderesse intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait suivant des instructions valables de l'autorit\u00e9 administrative et s'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9 par le sous-ministre.\nIl devient n\u00e9cessaire de raconter bri\u00e8vement les faits importants qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu au litige. Je citerai cependant d'abord le texte de l'article 24 des R\u00e8glements des Bois et For\u00eats qui d\u00e9termine dans quelles conditions l'arpentage doit se faire, et quel en est l'effet:\u2014\n\"Les agents de bois de la Couronne,\" dit l'article 24, \"ou toute autre personne autoris\u00e9e donnent, \u00e0 la demande \u00e9crite et conjointe des possesseurs de locations voisines, des instructions sur la mani\u00e8re d'arpenter et de d\u00e9limiter ces terrains pour les rendre conformes aux licences existantes; mais ces instructions, pour \u00eatre valables, doivent \u00eatre pr\u00e9alablement approuv\u00e9es par le ministre. Les arpentages se font aux frais des requ\u00e9rants et lorsqu'ils sont compl\u00e9t\u00e9s, les rapports, plans et notes de l'arpentage sont soumis au ministre et s'il les approuve copie en est transmise au bureau qui a \u00e9mis ces instructions et gard\u00e9e dans ses archives. Les bornes ainsi \u00e9tablies \u00e0 la demande conjointe des int\u00e9ress\u00e9s sont fixes et permanentes et ne peuvent \u00eatre chang\u00e9es.\" J'ai soulign\u00e9 dans cette citation les parties qui portent sur le pr\u00e9sent litige.\nVoici maintenant les faits de la cause.\nEn 1909, la compagnie Price s'est adress\u00e9e par \u00e9crit au D\u00e9partement des Terres pour faire faire le bornage de plusieurs concessions foresti\u00e8res qu'elle avait dans la r\u00e9gion de la rivi\u00e8re Rimouski et de la rivi\u00e8re Kedzwick. Des instructions furent pr\u00e9par\u00e9es par M. Gauvin, qui \u00e9tait alors surintendant des arpentages, approuv\u00e9es par le sous-ministre du temps, M. Tach\u00e9, et transmises \u00e0 l'arpenteur Addie. Cette proc\u00e9dure \u00e9tait irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re, car cette demande de bornage devait se faire, suivant l'article 24 des R\u00e8glements, par les deux parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es conjointement. Il n'y a que dans le cas o\u00f9 l'un des possesseurs (art. 25) refuse d\u00e9 se joindre \u00e0 son voisin pour faire le bornage que ce dernier a le droit de faire seul la demande. Il n'y a pas de preuve dans le cas actuel que la compagnie Shives ait refus\u00e9 de faire une demande conjointe. Mais ce d\u00e9faut initial a \u00e9t\u00e9 certainement couvert par les d\u00e9marches subs\u00e9quentes de la compagnie Shives qui, en 1911, a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la compagnie Price de faire ce bornage en commun et, sa demande ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e, les compagnies ont toutes deux fait l'organisation n\u00e9cessaire pour que l'arpentage de leurs lignes de division soit effectu\u00e9 suivant les instructions qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9es par le sous-ministre; et elles ont toutes deux envoy\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sentants pour assister l'arpenteur Addie et surveiller ses op\u00e9rations. C'\u00e9tait dans l'hiver 1912.\nLes concessions foresti\u00e8res de la compagnie Shives sont entour\u00e9es au nord, \u00e0 l'est et \u00e0 l'ouest par celles de la compagnie Price. L'arpenteur Addie a d'abord commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ouest de la concession Shives, sur la rivi\u00e8re Rimouski, et, suivant les instructions qu'il avait du d\u00e9partement, il proc\u00e9da \u00e0 tirer les lignes en droite ligne astronomique. Cette op\u00e9ration faisait gagner environ sept milles de terre \u00e0 la compagnie Shives.\nQuand l'arpenteur fut arriv\u00e9 pour d\u00e9terminer la ligne orientale de la concession Shives, il a naturellement suivi la m\u00eame direction; mais alors la compagnie Shives s'est oppos\u00e9e \u00e9nergiquement \u00e0 ce que l'arpenteur continu\u00e2t ses op\u00e9rations; et ce dernier, accompagn\u00e9 des parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es, s'est rendu \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec pour voir l'arpenteur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du d\u00e9partement, qui \u00e9tait alors M. Girard.\nCelui-ci, apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les parties et leurs suggestions, a reconnu que l'arpentage \u00e0 angle droit avec les rivi\u00e8res serait plus juste; et, pour donner effet \u00e0 ce qu'il consid\u00e9rait le consentement des int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, il a modifi\u00e9 les instructions de l'arpenteur. Mais, par oubli ou autrement, il n'a pas fait approuver cette modification par le ministre ou le sous-ministre.\nL'arpenteur muni de ces nouvelles instructions en a fait tenir une copie \u00e0 la compagnie Shives le 23 mars 1912 et cette derni\u00e8re en a accus\u00e9 r\u00e9ception en disant:\nThe correct instructions which you now have from the department are in keeping with what was agreed upon.\nQuelques jours plus tard, la compagnie Shives demandait combien la compagnie Price Bros. se trouverait \u00e0 gagner de terrain dans la ligne ouest par ces nouvelles instructions; et l'arpenteur lui a r\u00e9pondu, par lettre du 4 avril 1912, qu'elle gagnerait environ 7 milles.\nLa ligne fut dans l'hiver suivant, en 1913, tir\u00e9e suivant les nouvelles instructions et la compagnie Price s'est trouv\u00e9e \u00e0 reprendre les sept milles de terrain qu'elle avait perdus par l'arpentage de l'hiver pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent. D'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, la compagnie Shives se trouvait \u00e0 gagner consid\u00e9rablement de terrain dans sa ligne est.\nL'arpenteur d\u00e9posa au minist\u00e8re son rapport, ses notes d'arpentage et le plan du bornage fait et il fut pay\u00e9 de ses frais d'arpentage par les deux compagnies; mais la compagnie Shives fit ce paiement sous prot\u00eat, en disant que la compagnie Price avait eu plus de terrain qu'elle n'avait droit d'en avoir. Elle se rendit alors aupr\u00e8s du d\u00e9partement pour s'objecter \u00e0 ce que le rapport et le plan de l'arpenteur fussent accept\u00e9s parce que les instructions de ce dernier n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 au pr\u00e9alable approuv\u00e9es par le ministre ou le sous-ministre.\nLes choses en rest\u00e8rent l\u00e0 pour un an environ, quand le surintendant des arpentages, M. Girard, le 7 avril 1914, fit un rapport au ministre sur la plainte faite par la compagnie Shives. Il reconnait dans son rapport qu'il a peut-\u00eatre eu tort d'avoir modifi\u00e9 les instructions sans en avoir re\u00e7u l'autorisation du d\u00e9partement; mais, cette modification ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 bas\u00e9e sur le consentement des parties, il ne croit pas qu'il y aurait lieu maintenant de changer de nouveau ces instructions sans le consentement de la compagnie Price. Il d\u00e9clare aussi que les descriptions des locations, foresti\u00e8res pouvaient \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es de diff\u00e9rentes mani\u00e8res et que c'est la raison pour laquelle il a fait le changement demand\u00e9 par les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s.\nIl annexe \u00e0 son rapport une copie du plan de l'arpentage.\nCe rapport, autour duquel roule tout le litige, a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9 par le sous-ministre actuel en y inscrivant le mot \"app.\" suivi de ses initiales: \"E. M. D.\" et des chiffres \"8-4-14,\" ce qui signifierait, suivant la preuve, approuv\u00e9 le 8 avril 1914.\nIl s'agit de savoir si cette action du sous-ministre constitue l'approbation requise par l'article 24 des R\u00e8glements au sujet du plan de l'arpenteur ou bien si l'approbation du sous-ministre porte simplement sur la conduite de M. Girard et de la modification faite par lui dans les instructions.\nJ'aurais \u00e9t\u00e9 d'abord port\u00e9 \u00e0 croire que cette signature du sous-ministre sur le rapport de M. Girard constituait une approbation non-seulement des instructions donn\u00e9es \u00e0 l'arpenteur mais aussi du rapport et du plan d'arpentage faits par ce dernier. Mais M. Girard, dans sa d\u00e9position, nous dit que le ministre ou le d\u00e9put\u00e9-ministre n'a pas pris action sur le plan de l'arpenteur. Voici le texte de cette partie de sa d\u00e9position:\u2014\nD. Est-ce que le ministre a pris quelque action sur ces plan et field-notes, depuis qu'ils sont l\u00e0? R. Non, monsieur.\nD. Ni le sous-ministre? R. Non.\nD. Ni le d\u00e9partement? R. Non. Je peux ajouter que j'ai fait v\u00e9rifier les notes et le plan pour voir si tout \u00e9tait correct, pour voir si les pi\u00e8ces de monsieur Addie concordaient entre elles.\nD. Qu'est-ce que vous entendez par ces mots? R. J'ai fait faire par un dessinateur, j'ai fait reconstruire les plans pour voir si le plan est conforme \u00e0 celui qui est produit, pour voir si le plan est parfaitement conforme aux notes fournies; c'est ce que l'on fait toujours.\nD. Tout ceci n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis au ministre ou au sous-ministre pour son approbation? R. Non, monsieur.\nIl me semble qu'il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire d'avoir sur ce point le t\u00e9moignage du sous-ministre pour savoir exactement ce qu'il a entendu approuver quand il a mis ses initiales sur ce rapport, d'autant plus que l'action du d\u00e9partement, en transmettant une copie du rapport tel qu' approuv\u00e9 aux parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es, a \u00e9t\u00e9 interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 comme signifiant que le bornage fait par Addie \u00e9tait approuv\u00e9 par le sous-ministre et que certaines expressions relev\u00e9es dans les lettres de l'avocat de la compagnie Shives nous portent \u00e0 croire que, dans son opinion, l'approbation du rapport Girard par le sous-ministre mettait \u00e0 n\u00e9ant les pr\u00e9tentions de cette compagnie quant \u00e0 la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de l'arpentage.\nIl est important de mettre fin \u00e0 ces difficult\u00e9s entre les deux compagnies. Je ne serais pas pr\u00eat, pour ma part, \u00e0 renvoyer l'action de la demanderesse si, par oubli ou autrement, on n'avait pas mis au dossier le t\u00e9moignage du sous-ministre, car en renvoyant l'action les parties auraient \u00e0 proc\u00e9der de nouveau au bornage et \u00e0 encourir des frais bien plus consid\u00e9rables que la valeur du bois en litige. S'il s'agissait d'un bornage entre particuliers o\u00f9 l'autorit\u00e9 judiciaire pourrait elle-m\u00eame faire tracer les bornes (art. 504 C.C.) nous pourrions, je crois, disposer du litige avec les pi\u00e8ces que nous avons devant nous. Mais les tribunaux, dans le cas de concessions foresti\u00e8res, n'ont rien \u00e0 faire avec la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 du bornage. Cette question est du ressort exclusif de l'autorit\u00e9 administrative.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente cause nous avons d'abord \u00e0 rechercher si le bornage a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9 par le d\u00e9put\u00e9 ministre.\nLe document que nous avons devant nous est certainement ambigu. Le rapport de M. Girard nous indique bien les circonstances dans lesquelles il a modifi\u00e9 les instructions de l'arpenteur; et comme son rapport est approuv\u00e9, il en r\u00e9sulterait alors que les instructions qu'il a pr\u00e9par\u00e9es sont \u00e9galement approuv\u00e9es.\nIl est bien vrai que ces instructions n'auraient pas alors \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9es avant d'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 transmises \u00e0 l'arpenteur. Mais la ratification post\u00e9rieure de ces instructions par l'autorit\u00e9 administrative serait suffisante pour les valider. C'est ce qui r\u00e9sulte de la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Conseil Priv\u00e9 dans la cause de Alexandre v. Brassard[1], ou Lord Macnaghten, en parlant de ce qui devait se faire devant l'autorit\u00e9 religieuse pour l'\u00e9rection canonique d'une paroisse, disait:\u2014 It is rather in the nature of a rule of procedure, and in their Lordships' opinion it is for the ecclesiastical authorities and for them alone to decide as to the validity of any objection founded on non-compliance with it.\nDans le cas actuel, c'\u00e9tait aux autorit\u00e9s administratives du D\u00e9partement des Terres de d\u00e9cider si les instructions avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mises r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement ou non. Et comme le sous-ministre a approuv\u00e9 la conduite de son officier, M. Girard, il a, par l\u00e0 m\u00eame, suivant moi, approuv\u00e9 les instructions qu'il avait donn\u00e9es \u00e0 l'arpenteur.\nEt quand subs\u00e9quemment il envoyait copie du rapport \u00e0 la compagnie Shives et disait que ce rapport avait \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9, il ne faisait que porter \u00e0 la connaissance de cette partie le fait que Ton d\u00e9cidait que ces instructions \u00e9taient valides et accept\u00e9es comme telles par le ministre.\nOn dira peut-\u00eatre que la demanderesse ne pourrait pas faire la preuve testimoniale du fait que le sous-ministre a approuv\u00e9 non-seulement les instructions pr\u00e9par\u00e9es par M. Girard mais aussi le rapport et le plan de M. Addie.\nLa r\u00e8gle \u00e9dict\u00e9e par l'article 1234 C.C. est que la preuve testimoniale ne peut pas \u00eatre admise pour contredire ou changer les termes d'un \u00e9crit valablement fait. Les termes de cet article sont \u00e9videmment pris de Greenleaf on Evidence, qui est d'ailleurs cit\u00e9 par les codificateurs sous cet article 1234 C.C. Cet article 1234 C.C., dans la version anglaise, se lit comme suit:\u2014\nTestimony cannot in any case be received to contradict or vary the terms of a valid written instrument.\nGreenleaf, au paragraphe 275, cit\u00e9 par les codificateurs, \u00e9nonce la m\u00eame r\u00e8gle en se servant des termes suivants:\u2014\nParol contemporaneous evidence is inadmissible to contradict or vary the terms of a valid instrument. L'article correspondant du Code Napol\u00e9on, qui est l\u2019article 1341, est dans des termes plus restrictifs, vu qu'il dit qu'il n'est re\u00e7u aucune preuve par t\u00e9moins contre et outre le contenu des actes.\nCependant Bonnier, Trait\u00e9 des Preuves, p. 120, no. 143, en commentant cet article d\u00e9clare que:\u2014\nCe n'est point prouver outre le contenu aux actes que de compl\u00e9ter au moyen de la preuve testimoniale des \u00e9nonciations ambigues ou insuffisantes.\nLangelier, De la Preuve, nos. 584-585, apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les r\u00e9dacteurs de notre article ont copi\u00e9 la r\u00e8gle du droit anglais plut\u00f4t que celle du droit fran\u00e7ais et apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9nonc\u00e9 au no. 603 la r\u00e8gle que l'on ne pourrait prouver par t\u00e9moins la mani\u00e8re dont les parties \u00e0 un acte l'ont elles-m\u00eames entendu, dit au no. 604 que si l'\u00e9crit donne une d\u00e9signation de chose qui peut s'appliquer \u00e0 plusieurs choses, on peut prouver quelle est la chose que l'auteur de l'\u00e9crit a voulu d\u00e9signer ainsi.\nLe m\u00eame principe est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans Taylor, on Evidence, 10th ed., p. 855, par. 1194, et dans Best, on Evidence, 10th ed., p. 208, par. 226.\nDans la pr\u00e9sente cause on pourrait donc prouver par t\u00e9moins si le sous-ministre entendait, en approuvant le rapport de M. Girard, approuver en m\u00eame temps le plan de l'arpenteur qui lui \u00e9tait soumis. Les tribunaux pourront ensuite avec cette preuve d\u00e9cider d'une mani\u00e8re certaine si le bornage fait par l'arpenteur Addie a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9 par l'autorit\u00e9 administrative et si l'action de la demanderesse \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9e.\nPartant du principe que les tribunaux n'ont pas juridiction pour d\u00e9cider de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 d'un arpentage de locations foresti\u00e8res, mais que c'est l\u00e0 une question dont la d\u00e9cision appartient exclusivement au ministre ou au sous-ministre des terres; \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le fait que nous avons \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter une ambiguit\u00e9 cach\u00e9e (latent ambiguity) et que la preuve \u00e9crite ne dit pas clairement si le sous-ministre a approuv\u00e9 le bornage, je serais d'opinion, dans ces circonstances, de renvoyer le dossier en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pour qu'on y prouve si le sous-ministre, en initialant le rapport Girard, a ou non approuv\u00e9 le bornage et a eu ou n'a pas eu l'intention de donner lui-m\u00eame l'approbation requise par l'article 24 des r\u00e8glements.\nLes frais de cette cour, ainsi que des cours inf\u00e9rieures, devront suivre le sort de la cause.\nMignault J. (dissenting)\u2014At first sight this case appears quite a complicated one, but when the voluminous record and the lengthy factums are examined, the question to be decided is restricted into a very narrow compass.\nThe appellant and the respondent hold adjoining timber licences from the Government of the Province of Quebec. The respondent has, towards the west, timber limit River Rimouski No. 1 East, and, towards the east, timber limit Kedzwick No. 2. Between these limits, going in an easterly direction, the appellant holds timber limits River Kedzwick No. 3 and Kedzwick East. Consequently, the parties occupy neighbouring territory both on the east and on the west, and the difficulty between them arose in connection with the running of the boundary line between their respective concessions.\nIt is to be remarked that in as much as timber licences confer no right of ownership in the land, the provisions of the Civil Code as to boundaries are without application. The whole matter is governed by the provisions of the Quebec revised statutes concerning public lands, and by regulations made by order-in-council under these provisions (art. 1534 R.S.Q.).\nThe regulation governing the parties in this case is Regulation No. 24 of the Wood and Forests Regulations and reads as follows:\u2014\nSurveys.\n24. Crown Timber Agents, or any other authorised person shall, at the joint written request of holders of adjacent limits, give instructions as to the manner of surveying and running the boundaries of such lands in order that they may be conformable to existing licences. But, in order to be valid, such instructions must be previously approved by the Minister. Surveys shall be made at the expense of the parties requiring the same, and when completed, the reports, plans and fieldnotes shall be submitted to the Minister and, if approved by him, a copy shall be sent to the office which issued such instructions and be kept in its archives. The boundaries so established at the joint request of the interested parties shall be fixed and permanent and cannot be altered.\nIt is common ground between the parties that, although the approval of the Minister of Lands and Forests is required by this regulation, the approval of the Deputy Minister is to the same effect and is binding upon the licensees.\nSome time in 1909, the respondent applied to the Crown Lands Department to have boundaries run between their respective limits, and Mr. George K. Addie, provincial land surveyor, was charged with the tracing of these boundaries under instructions issued by the Department.\nThis was not the joint written request required by Regulation 24, but the correspondence exchanged between the appellant and the respondent in 1911 and 1912 shews that the latter company agreed, and even proposed to the respondent, to join it in having the survey made jointly and to pay one-half of the expense, and in view of this agreement it is somewhat singular that the appellant should now raise the technical objection that a joint request from both parties for the survey should have preceded the instructions given by the Department in 1909. I think the appellant should not be heard now to urge this objection in view of the full consent which it gave to the survey being made at the joint expense of the parties and of its participation therein.\nI may, moreover, dispose of the objections of the appellant that, under Regulation 24, a joint written request of the parties should have preceded the instructions given to the surveyor, and that these instructions should have been previously approved by the Minister, by stating that, in my opinion, all these requirements, and also the approval of the field notes, strenuously insisted on by the learned counsel of the appellant at the argument, are of the nature of rules of procedure and are not a condition precedent to the validity of all subsequent proceedings. These rules are useful ones for the guidance of the Minister and to permit him to give a sanction, by his approval, to the survey made with the concurrence of the holders of contiguous timber limits, but the whole matter is one for the consideration of the Minister alone, and if he gives his approval to the survey and tracing of the boundary, this approval, when sufficiently expressed, covers any previous informality of the proceedings.\nSupport for the position I take is afforded by the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Alexandre v. Brassard[2]. The question there was whether a decree of the Archbishop of Montreal, followed by civil recognition, canonically erecting the parish of St. Blaise, which had been formed by the dismemberment of three old parishes, could be sustained in view of the fact that it was alleged that the requirements of the Quebec revised statutes concerning the erection of parishes and their civil recognition had not been complied with. And it was contended that, although it was not competent for the court to set aside a canonical decree for the erection of a parish for ecclesiastical purposes, the court was at liberty to inquire into the proceedings which gave rise to the decree and that if these proceedings were found not in accordance with the provisions of the law, the decree could not be treated as a decree available for the purposes of founding civil recognition.\nAnswering this contention, Lord Macnaghten said, at p. 307 of the report:\u2014\nTheir Lordships cannot take this view. It appears to them that the provision in question is not a limitation on the jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical authorities, of a condition precedent to the validity of all subsequent proceedings. It is rather in the nature of a rule of procedure, and in their Lordships' opinion it is for the ecclesiastical authorities and for them alone to decide as to the validity of any objection founded on non-compliance with it.\nI would apply this test to determine the validity of all the proceedings previous to the approval of the Minister, and state that, in my opinion, it is for the Minister alone to decide as to the validity of any objection with regard to the regularity of the proceedings. If he gives his approval, it precludes any question being raised as to the regularity of the proceedings.\nReturning now to the recital of the pertinent facts, I may say that Mr. Addie went on the ground in February and March, 1912, and proceeded, in presence of representatives of the parties, to run these boundaries. Without any opposition whatever he ran the boundary between River Rimouski No. 1 East, held by the respondent, and River Kedzwick No. 3, occupied by the appellant. He then prepared to run the boundary between Kedzwick East (the appellant's) and Kedzwick No. 2 (the respondent's), when Mr. Dickie, representing the appellant, objected to the manner in which Mr. Addie desired to trace the boundary, and, in view of this opposition, Mr. Addie suspended operations and with, or followed by, representatives of the parties, he returned to Quebec.\nNext in sequence in the recital of the facts comes a meeting, on 20th March, 1912, between Mr. Addie and representatives of the parties, to wit, Mr. Anderson on behalf of the appellant and Mr. Sissons on behalf of the respondent, in the office of Mr. Plamondon, an employee of the Department, at which Mr. Girard, Superintendent of Surveys, assisted. At this meeting, an agreement was arrived at by the parties as to the running of the boundaries between their respective limits on both the west and the east side, and the former instructions to Mr. Addie were modified. It is alleged that Mr. Girard made some changes in these instructions, but it was stated at the hearing by the learned counsel for the respondent that the changes in the instructions of 1909 were mentioned in Mr. Addie's letter to the appellant, dated 23rd March, 1912, and if so the appellant fully acquiesced therein by its letter to Mr. Addie of 27th March, 1912.\nMr. Addie returned on the ground in February and March, 1913, and then and there, in presence of the representatives of the parties, and without any opposition from them, he ran new boundary lines between River Rimouski No. 1 East and River Kedzwick No. 3 on the one hand, and between Kedzwick east and Kedzwick No. 2 on the other. On the 14th May, 1913, he made a full report to the Minister, with a plan of his operations and his field notes thereunto annexed. He also sent a full report to the appellant on the 27th May, 1913, with a copy of his report to the Minister and duplicates of the plans accompanying the latter report.\nThe appellant, on the 7th June, in a letter to Mr. Addie, acknowledged receipt of this report, sent to Mr. Addie a cheque for $1,085.54, for its share of the expenses of the survey, but stated that it was not at all satisfied with the result as it could not understand why there should be the great difference between the first and last lines that Mr. Addie ran out.\nSome months later, 8th October, 1913, the Hon. Mr. John Hall Kelly, K.C., Legislative Councillor, wrote to the Department on behalf of the appellant expressing the same dissatisfaction, and asking for a copy of all instructions given for the survey. It does not appear what answer was made to this letter, but nearly six months after, 14th March, 1914, Mr. Kelly caused to be served on the respondent and on the Minister a formal protest against the running of the line: At least one ground of this protest, that the line was run without the consent of the appellant, appears to me contrary to the facts proved in this case. Mr. Kelly followed this protest by a letter to the Minister of the 28th March 1914, in which he alleges that the first instructions were changed at the request of the respondent, an assertion also controverted by the evidence. Mr. Kelly asked the Minister to give the matter his consideration at once, as otherwise\nthe matter will have to be thrashed out before the courts to have it decided.\nIt is under these circumstances, and in view of these letters and protests and of the request of Mr. Kelly that the Minister should give the matter his consideration at once, that Mr. Girard, Superintendent of Surveys, made his report to the Minister of Lands and Forests on the 7th April, 1914, in which he refers to Mr. Kelly's letter of the 28th of March, and in which he makes a complete report of all the operations connected with the survey and the running of the line, frankly admitting that he had made some changes in the instructions to the surveyor without the authority of the Department. He concludes by saying:\u2014\nJ'annexe au pr\u00e9sent rapport copie de la carte r\u00e9gionale, indiquant en jaune les lignes divisant les diverses locations foresti\u00e8res appartenant \u00e0 la \"Shives Lumber Company\" et \u00e0 \"Price Bros.,\" ainsi qu'une copie bleue des plans du travail de monsieur l'arpenteur Addie divisant les locations foresti\u00e8res appartenant \u00e0 ces deux compagnies sur la rivi\u00e8re Rimouski aussi bien que sur la Kedzwick.\nAt the foot of this report we find the following:\u2014\nApp.\nE.M.D.\n8, 4, 14.\nThis, Mr. Girard states, means:\u2014\nApproved E. M. D. (being the initials of the Deputy Minister, Mr. Elz\u00e9ar Miville D\u00e9ch\u00eanes) and the date, 8th April, 1914.\nI fail to see how it can be disputed that this was a decision by the Deputy Minister on the very point which Mr. Kelly had asked the Minister to consider. And although it is argued that this is merely an approval of Mr. Girard's explanation why the former instructions were modified, I am of the opinion that the approval so given extends to the whole report and to' the plans and maps submitted with it. I cannot see the object of so initialling the report, if the intention was merely to accept Mr. Girard's explanation, and not to give official approval to the survey.\nMr. Kelly evidently placed this construction on the approval, for, on the 13th August, 1914, he wrote to the Minister, referring to a letter from the Department of the 16th April, enclosing a copy of Mr. Girard's report, and in this letter he says:\u2014\nI also note that this report has been approved by the Department; and he expresses the regret that he had not been given the opportunity\nto answer the said report, before the approval of the Department was obtained.\nIn this letter Mr. Kelly submits that the instructions could not be modified without the written request of his clients and that these instructions should have been previously approved by the Minister, and he requests that these two points be submitted to the law officers,\nbecause a suit of considerable importance will be pending between Price Brothers and the Shives Lumber Company and the Department, in the event of the Department maintaining the position that it has taken that the line, as run in the last instance, is a legal one.\nFinally, we have a letter of the 14th August from the Deputy Minister to the respondent, in which the Deputy Minister transmits a copy of Mr. Girard's report, adding:\u2014\nThis report has been approved by the Department.\nI cannot but believe that the intention of the Deputy Minister, in approving\" Mr. Girard's report, was to give the approval, required by art. 24 of the Wood and Forests Regulations, for if the object of the Deputy Minister was merely to accept, as argued, the personal explanation of Mr. Girard and not to approve the report itself, there would have been no reason for writing a formal approval at the foot of the report itself. And, as already stated, Mr. Kelly's letter of the 13th August shews that he placed the same construction on the approval.\nIt is true that, at Mr. Kelly's request, the Department referred the points raised by him to its law officers and subsequently to the Attorney-General. It is also true that the Deputy Attorney-General reported that Mr. Kelly's objections were well taken, and that the Department thereupon notified the parties that a new survey and determination of the boundary would be necessary. But I have, with deference, to disagree with the conclusions of the learned Deputy Attorney-General, and I think the approval of the Deputy Minister, covering, as it does, the whole of Mr. Girard's report, necessarily carries with it approval of the instructions issued to Mr. Addie. While no doubt it would have been more regular to insert the approval of the Deputy Minister on the plan itself, and the Department should see that this is done now, I cannot take the responsibility of exposing the parties to the expenses of a new survey when I am convinced that there has been substantial compliance with the requirements of Regulation 24, and that, if there be any informality, the approval of the Minister disposes of any question as to the validity of the proceedings.\nThis is the only point on which this court is called upon to express any opinion, and it has not to say whether the lines run in 1913 gave to each party the territory to which it was entitled. This is a point as to which the Minister, or his Deputy, is the sole judge, and as I find that the Deputy Minister, by approving Mr. Girard's report, has given his approval to the line run by Addie, I can only concur in the exhaustive and very complete opinions of the late lamented Sir Horace Archambeault, Chief Justice, and of Mr. Justice Carroll in the court below.\nThe lumber, the price of which is claimed by the respondent, was cut in territory which the survey of 1913 placed within the limits granted to it. The value of the lumber was admitted, and the appellant was condemned to pay it to the respondent. With this determination of the litigation between the parties I concur.\nSome point has been made of the fact that the Deputy Minister was not called as a witness to state what he intended when he wrote his approval at the foot of Mr. Girard's report. Another question would be upon whom rested the onus of so calling Mr. Dech\u00eanes, on the respondent who relied on the approval as extending to the entire report, or on the appellant who sought to restrict this approval to the personal explanations of Mr. Girard? My personal view is that the respondent could rely on the approval as extending, as its unqualified terms shewed, to the whole report, and that if the appellant desired to limit in any way the general effect of this approval, the onus of proving the limitations rested on it. At all events, neither party saw fit to call Mr. D\u00e9ch\u00eanes, and I do not think that the omission is one for which the respondent alone should be considered liable.\nIn my opinion substantial justice has been done to the parties by the judgment of the Court of King's Bench. A new survey might possibly give the same result and would undoubtedly expose the parties to considerable expense. It seems in every way desirable to bring the litigation to a close, and I would not lightly disturb so well considered a judgment as the one appealed from.\nFor these reasons, I am of the opinion that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal allowed, new trial ordered.\nSolicitor for the appellant: John Hall Kelly.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Tessier & C\u00f4t\u00e9.\n[1] [1895] A.C. 301, at p. 307.\n[2] [1895] A.C. 301.\n"

L.R. 108; 39 D.L.R. 528), that a building used as a combined store and dwelling was not insured.\nHeld also, Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that the contract was intended to insure occupied dwellings only; that the failure of the insurance agent to insert the name or description of the occupant was immaterial; and that the word \u201cby\u201d in the restrictive description quoted could be deleted as not required to express the intention and make the contract sensible. London Assur. Corp. v. Great Northern Transit Co. (29 Can. S.C.R. 577), followed.\nTo the knowledge of insurer and insured the buildings were not completed when the policies issued and could not be expected to be occupied for some time.\nHeld, Idington and Brodeur JJ. dissenting, that though the risk might presently attach to the unoccupied buildings, yet after they were once occupied the insurance would be suspended on any becoming vacant, and a loss occurring during such vacancy would not be covered.\nThe Appellate Division held that the insured was entitled to recover $1,200 on each building actually occupied as a dwelling at the time of the fire, and ordered a reference to ascertain the amount due.\nHeld, per Davies C.J., Anglin and Mignault JJ., that as the basis of the claim was certain and the amount, once the facts were established, ascertainable by a mere arithmetical computation, the insured was entitled to interest on the sum eventually found due from the expiration of sixty days after the proofs of loss were furnished. Held, further, that the Supreme Court of Canada should not interfere with the discretion of a provincial appellate court in allowing issues of law arising on the documents and facts in the record to be raised though not pressed at the trial.\nAPPEAL from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario[1], reversing in part the judgment on the trial in favour of the plaintiffs.\nThe facts are stated in the above head-note. The only questions raised were whether or not the insurance policies covered houses that were vacant when destroyed by fire and one used as a store and dwelling combined. Also whether the judgment could provide for payment of interest before the amount due the insurer was ascertained.\nHugh J. Macdonald and J.E. Lawson for the appellants, cited Hawthorne v. Canadian Casualty Ins. Co.[2]; Davidson v. Waterloo Ins. Co.[3]; Toronto Railway Co. v. City of Toronto[4], at pages 120-1.\nMcKay K.C. for the respondents, referred to McKay v. Northern Union Ins. Co.[5]; Boardman v. North Waterloo Ins. Co.[6]; The Baltic Case[7].\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nIDINGTON J. (dissenting).\u2014The respondent, on the 9th May, 1913, issued ten insurance policies to the owners of a row or block of ten buildings, insuring for three years said owners (who paid a cash premium for each of same) against losses by fire in respect of any of said buildings. One of said owners, with the consent of the respondent, transferred his interest in said policies to his wife, the appellant B. Langbord.\nThe houses were all unoccupied, and indeed not quite finished at the time when these transactions took place. None were occupied till at least six weeks had run from the date of the insurance thus professed to have been effected and in fact paid for.\nAnd some further time expired before tenants were got for all. Exactly how long is not made clear. Yet, according to some opinions expressed below, these thrifty people were knowingly paying in advance for nothing. I cannot find on the true interpretation and construction of the contract that such was ever conceived by those concerned to be the nature of their contract.\nThe said policies were all in the same form and each was designed to cover the tenement corresponding with the number it was applicable to.\nEach contained the following clause:\u2014\n$1,200.00 on the 2 story brick fronted, roughcast, shingle roof building and additions, including foundations, plumbing, steam, gas and water pipes and fixtures, while occupied by . . . as a dwelling, and situated on . . . on the east side of Keele Street, Toronto, Lot 50, 51, 52, Plan No. 1612, between Eglinton Avenue and Cameron Avenue, known as house Number\u2014.\nIn the course of the trial many defences were set up. And as, in my opinion, each and all thereof, except two dependent upon the legal interpretation and construction of their contract, were so effectually disposed of by the findings of the jury in answer to questions submitted, which upon the relevant facts they alone were entitled to pass upon, I will deal only with those excepted which I have referred to.\nIt seems that four, or possibly five, of the houses in question had been vacant for a considerable time before, and at the time of, the fire which destroyed said block and resulted in what is now in question herein.\nIt is urged that the said policies must be read as if the words \u201cowner or tenant\u201d had been written therein, where a blank space is left after the word \u201cby,\u201d and much varying ingenuity has been displayed in filling up in imagination what the respondent, in using the printed form, deliberately left blank.\nI respectfully submit we have no right to fill up anything in a contract emanating from the respondent and therefore to be rather construed as against than in favour of it.\nAt best it stands as an ambiguous contract.\nIn order to interpret and construe it correctly, we may summon to our aid the surrounding circumstances before and immediately succeeding its execution.\nThe conduct of the parties in such relation is, in my opinion, fatal to any such contention as set up and maintained on the ground of vacancy, when we consider that the insured was paying, evidently from the outset, on the hypothesis that the policies were intended to insure against loss by fire notwithstanding vacancies of no matter how long duration, unless under circumstances giving rise to conditions beyond what the contracting parties had in that regard in view in contracting.\nIn such latter event there might arise a question of something material to the risk falling within the terms of statutory condition No. 2.\nThat possible aspect of the matter has been disposed of by the verdict of the jury to whom it was submitted.\nMoreover, the vacancies now claimed to have voided the policies existed at the time when the appellant paid for and got a renewal of each policy in May, 1916, for a further term of three years. I know not why we should actually fill in the blank with words selected by the manager of respondent instead of what common sense would indicate in light of the conduct of the parties by inserting the word \u201cnobody\u201d if, as I am not, obsessed with the idea that it must be filled in.\nThe words \u201coccupied by\u201d are in themselves meaningless and should be treated, as they evidently are, as surplusage. I submit that we must ever, if possible, try to fit the language used to the actual situation with which those contracting were confronted and dealing, if we would do justice.\nCan there be a shadow of doubt herein that it was the impossibility of fittingly meeting that situation by any ordinary expedient of filling in the blank in a way which could be rendered conformable with the mutual understanding of the parties, that led to the entire omission of any attempt to do so?\nThat being my view of the situation I forbear from inserting anything, and then the language used to be given effect to can only be rendered intelligible by treating those words \u201coccupied by\u201d as mere surplusage which somebody forgot to draw a pen through in filling up a printed form.\nThe clearly intelligible purpose was to insure dwelling-houses at the usual rate therefor as agreed upon, and not stores, which would have to pay a higher rate and could not be insurable for a three-year term.\nIf the respondent could have shewn any such difference of rates had ever been made applicable to distinguish occupied from vacant dwelling-houses, I might have been able to see the situation in another light. But no such distinction has ever been made that the experts called by respondent can tell of. Cases dependent upon the varying conditions which marine insurers have to meet and have long provided for in manifold ways can be of no help here.\nNo one pretends that insurance may not be made to meet conditions of any kind.\nWhat we are asked to do here is make a contract which the parties did not make, never thought of making, and by resorting to another class of insurance business entirely outside the class of insurance business the parties were dealing with to make a series of contracts for them.\nI think the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge be restored with an amendment thereto excepting the shop or corner store of the block as furnishing any basis for recovery, and hence reducing the judgment to $10,800 with costs to appellants of the trial and in the Appellate Division and two-thirds of the cost of their appeal here, in which they have only partially been successful.\nThe question of interest should not be meddled with now.\nANGLIN J.\u2014At the trial the plaintiffs recovered $12,000\u2014$1,200 in respect of each of ten houses insured with the defendants. On appeal, as a result of somewhat divided opinions[8], their recovery was restricted to their claims upon policies on such of the houses as were actually occupied as dwellings at the time of the fire, and the occupancy of one house being uncertain, a reference was directed to ascertain the amount of the plaintiffs\u2019 enforceable claim.\nI think it is not possible to set aside the finding of the jury that the vacancy of the premises was not a change in their condition material to the risk within the meaning of the second statutory condition. While I should quite probably have found otherwise if trying the case myself, there are circumstances in evidence which make it impossible to say that ten or twelve reasonable men could not honestly have reached such a conclusion. Neither, on the other hand, in view of the fact that there was a separate policy on each house, can it be held that vacancy in any one or more of them was a change material to the risks upon others which were tenanted.\nThat the words,\nwhile occupied by . . . as a dwelling-house,\nif, and so far as, they should be taken to form part of the contract of insurance sued upon, are not to be regarded either as a condition or a warranty but are descriptive and restrictive of the subject-matter of the risk is conclusively determined by the decision of this court in London Assurance Corporation v. Great Northern Transit Co. (The Baltic Case)[9]. The only possible distinction between that case and the one now at bar arises from the omission to fill in the blank following the word \u201cby\u201d in the policy before us.\nShould the court fill in that blank by whatever word the circumstances indicate, in its opinion, as the most likely to have been in the contemplation of the parties, giving due weight to the maxim verba chartarum fortius accipiuntur contra proferentem? Or should the result of the omission be the excision from the policy of the entire clause in which it occurs on the assumption that the proper inference from the failure to fill in the blank is that the person issuing the policy intended not to make any use of that portion of the form? Or should only that word, or those words, be deleted which can be given no sensible application without filling in the blank? In Glynn v. Margetson & Co.[10], at page 358, Lord Halsbury quotes with approval the statement of Lord Ellenborough in Robertson v. French[11], at page 135, that,\nthe same rule of construction which applies to other instruments applies to * * * a policy of insurance.\nIn my opinion the first alternative of the three suggested should not be adopted. It involves too great a risk of making a wrong guess\u2014too great a probability of making the description, something which neither party intended\u2014unless perhaps the blank should be filled in with the word \u201csomebody\u201d or \u201canybody,\u201d which would be equivalent in effect to striking out the word \u201cby.\u201d While\nthe law will, as much as it can, assist the frailties and infirmities of men in their employments, who * * * may easily make a slip (Lord Say & Seal\u2019s Case[12].\nthe reason underlying the supplying of omitted words is ut res magis valeat quam pereat (Langston v. Langston[13]), and a clear case of necessity to avoid apparent absurdity, repugnancy or inconsistency (Clements v. Henry[14]), and\nsuch a degree of moral certainty as to leave in the mind of a reasonable man no doubt of the intent of the parties.\n(Coles v. Hulme[15]), are pre-requisites to the exercise of this benevolent curial function. Moreover, since the ambiguity or uncertainty is patent, the intention can be gathered only from the other parts of the instrument, as in Flight v. Lake[16]. It cannot be established by extrinsic evidence. See cases collected in 10 Halsbury\u2019s Laws of England, No. 796, notes (k) and (m), and Turner v. Burrows[17]. The policy here affords no clue to the word (if any) which should be supplied to fill the blank.\nIn regard to the second and third alternatives, an analysis of the clause under consideration may be helpful. Its apparent purpose is to provide for a; triple restriction upon the subject matter of the risk; (a) it must be a dwelling-house as distinguished from a building of any other character; (b) it must be occupied as such; (c) assuming the blank to be restrictively filled in, the occupant must be the person designated or answer the description given. It would seem to have been intended to leave a discretion to the person issuing the policy only as to the third restriction.\nIn the construction of an instrument the rejection of words is sometimes permissible but only so far as they are repugnant or insensible\u2014only so far as is necessary to make that sensible which their presence renders insensible. Grey v. Pearson[18], at page 106. In delivering the opinion of the judges advising the House of Lords in Smith v. Packhurst[19], Lord Chief Justice Willes said, at page 136:\u2014\nBefore I proceed to the questions I shall lay down some general rules and maxims of the law, with respect to the construction of deeds; first, it is a maxim, that such a construction ought to be made of deeds, ut res magis valeat quam pereat, that the end and design of the deeds should take effect rather than the contrary.\nAnother maxim is, that such a construction should be made of the words in a deed, as is most agreeable to the intention of the grantor, the words are not the principal things in a deed, but the intent and design of the grantor; we have no power indeed to alter the words or to insert words which are not in the deed, but we may and ought to construe the words in a manner the most agreeable to the meaning of the grantor, and may reject any words that are merely insensible: these maxims, my Lords, are founded upon the greatest authority, Coke, Plowden, and Lord Chief Justice Hale, and the law commends the astutia, the cunning of judges in construing words in such a manner as shall best answer the intent; the art of construing words in such a manner as shall destroy the intent may shew the ingenuity of counsel, but is very ill-becoming a judge. Here the lacking word is the objective of the preposition \u201cby.\u201d If that word \u201cby\u201d be deleted the rest of the clause makes perfect sense. The failure of the person issuing the policy to fill in the blank no doubt precludes the company invoking any restriction as to the personality of the occupant. But what possible justification can there be for rejecting or ignoring such distinct restrictions placed upon the nature of the risk assumed as the words \u201coccupied\u201d and \u201cas a dwelling-house\u201d import? I can find none. I am prepared to treat the failure of the agent issuing the policy to fill in the blank as apparently an exercise of his discretion not to place any restriction on the personality of the occupant, but I am not prepared to treat it as warranting the excision of the entire clause\u2014something apparently not intended to be left to his discretion at all. I would strike out the word \u201cby\u201d to make the contract sensible; but to attain that object no further deletion is requisite; none is permissible. To excise the remainder of the clause would be to make a new contract for the parties.\nThe meaning of the words\nwhile occupied as a dwelling-house\nread consecutively, as I think they must be, in my opinion admits of no doubt. As the Baltic Case[20], establishes, the word \u201cwhile\u201d imports an intermittently suspensive negative. The quest of a difference in shades of meaning between the adverbial conjunction \u201cwhile\u201d of the policy now before us and the \u201cwhilst\u201d of that dealt with in the Baltic Case[21], would be even more vain than pedantic. If not merely two forms of the same word, they are certainly synonymous. The Imperial Dictionary; The Century Dictionary, Vbo. \u201cWhilst.\u201d The risk ceases to attach during periods when the subject matter may not answer to the restrictive description \u201coccupied as a dwelling-house.\u201d See, too, Langworthy v. Oswego Ins. Co.[22], cited by Riddell J. and Huebner on Property Insurance, page 20.\nAlthough the word \u201coccupied\u201d used alone as a word of description may only mean occupied at the date of the assumption of the risk (O\u2019Neil v. Buffalo Fire Ins. Co.[23], Maher v. Hibernia Ins. Co.[24]), used as it is here with the word \u201cwhile\u201d it clearly imports continued occupation during the term of the risk, and that that occupation should be actual as distinguished from mere legal possession as the basis of the risk.\nIt was long since (28 Car. 2) held that:\u2014\nOccupant and occupier are always in law taken for an actual possessor, one that useth, enjoyeth or manureth the land. Ironmongers Co. v. Nayler[25].\nOccupied means actual de facto occupation. Robinson v. Briggs[26]. To treat the word \u201coccupied\u201d otherwise in the present context would be to deny it all effect, just as Mr. Justice Sedgewick points out the word \u201crunning\u201d had been denied effect by the provincial courts in the Baltic Case21. The building would be insured simply as a dwelling-house, not as an occupied dwelling-house, or, \u201cwhile occupied.\u201d If there could be any doubt as to the signification of the two words \u201cwhile occupied,\u201d the addition of the word \u201cby,\u201d which, although to be deleted for other purposes, may if necessary be looked at to ascertain the meaning of the word \u201coccupied\u201d to which it is appended, would seem to remove it. While vacant, as they were for many months prior to, and at the time of, the fire because of failure to rent them, the houses in respect of which it has been held that the plaintiffs cannot recover did not answer the description of the subject matter in the policy and were therefore not covered by the insurance. Mere temporary vacancy, such for instance as that due to the whole family of the occupant being absent over night would involve entirely different considerations. See Meeks v. The State[27].\nThe fact that the houses were uncompleted and therefore not occupied as dwelling-houses when the risks were assumed and for several weeks thereafter was much relied on as indicating that the parties must have intended that the restriction of actual occupation should not apply. No doubt the insurance agent knew of this state of facts; and the policy expressly provides that the risk is to begin from noon on the 8th of May, 1913, the date of the plaintiffs\u2019 application. It may be that, having regard to these circumstances, had one (or more) of the houses been burned before it had become tenanted, assuming the lapse of time not to have been greater than the parties might reasonably be taken to have contemplated for the completion of the building and the securing of a tenant, the courts would have held the plaintiffs entitled to recover in respect of it. But I am quite satisfied that as soon as each house became occupied the suspensive restriction in the policy on it applied and vacancy thereafter, so long as it lasted, took that house out of the risk. Moreover, the action is not upon the original policies, but upon renewals, which are to be regarded as new contracts; Agricultural Savings and Loan Co. v. Liverpool, &c. Ins. Co.[28]; and the evidence is not entirely clear as to the conditions as to occupation at the date of the renewals of the houses that were vacant at the time of the fire, and there is no evidence that they were made with knowledge of vacancy on the part of the company.\nThe controverted suggestion of counsel for the appellants that the defence based on vacancy was confined at the trial to change material to the risk not notified as required by the second statutory condition, if well founded, cannot assist him, inoccupancy as a departure from the description of the risk having been neither pleaded nor pressed. The fact of vacancy was distinctly pleaded (R. 141) and there is no suggestion that any additional evidence bearing on it could have been adduced. The defence which succeeds is purely one of law arising from the construction of the policy sued upon. It was certainly raised and passed upon by the Appellate Division, and it is not usual for this court to interfere with the discretion exercised by a provincial appellate court in regard to raising on appeal issues of law arising on the documents and facts in the record though not pressed at the trial. A case of surprise within R. 143 is scarcely made out. The argument based on the 8th statutory condition is answered by the learned Chief Justice of the Common Pleas.\nI agree with the disposition made by the Appellate Division of the claims in respect of the corner building occupied as a store and of the dwelling-house as to the occupancy of which there is some uncertainty.\nCounsel for the respondent pressed his plea for a reduction in the amount allowed for the loss upon each house only in the event of the court holding that the plaintiffs should recover in respect of the vacant houses.\nOn the claim for interest I agree with Mr. Justice Rose that the plaintiffs are entitled to succeed, but their right to interest dates from the expiry of sixty days after proofs of loss were furnished. In Toronto Rly. Co. v. City of Toronto[29], the Judicial Committee impliedly, if not expressly, approved the statement of Armour C.J. in McCullough v. Newlove[30], at page 630, as to the scope of the provision of the \u201cOntario Judicature Act\u201d which makes interest payable in all cases in which it has been usual for a jury to allow it. The learned Chief Justice said:\u2014\nJudging from my own experience, I may say that I think it has been usual to tell juries in cases where money is claimed under what were formerly called the common counts, that they might give interest from the time when the money claimed became payable, and that juries have usually given it.\nIn the City of London v. Citizens Ins. Co.[31], Ferguson J. held that the fact that the amount to be paid had not been ascertained until the termination of the action did not prevent the plaintiffs, suing on an insurance contract, from recovering interest on\nthe sum now ascertained to have been, and to be, owing to the plaintiffs. The money was payable by virtue of the defendants\u2019 deed and I think the interest should be allowed.\nSince the defendants no longer contest the plaintiffs\u2019 right to recover the full amount of each of the policies on the tenanted houses and since by their general repudiation of liability they precluded themselves from objecting to the sufficiency of the proofs of loss, the face amounts of such policies should be deemed to be debts that became payable according to their terms on the expiry of sixty days after the proofs of loss were furnished. These features distinguish this case from McCullough v. Clemow [32], in which a different result was arrived at by Osler J.A.\nIn view of the very limited measure of success that has attended the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal bur discretion as to costs will, I think, be judiciously exercised if we allow to the respondent five\u2011sixths of its costs in this court. BRODEUR J. (dissenting)\u2014The main question on this appeal is as to the construction of the contract.\nIn May, 1913, ten insurance policies were issued on ten houses built in a row of buildings in Keele Street in Toronto. When the policies were made the houses were not yet finished and were unoccupied. It took several weeks before the work was finished. However, the company, being aware of the fact that those houses were unoccupied, issued a policy for three years and charged the owners the usual rates for a dwelling-house for such a period. The three years having expired, renewal receipts were issued for another period of three years, during which the fire occurred on the 29th of August, 1916.\nThe insurance company having denied liability, the plaintiffs had to institute the present action to recover the amounts of those ten insurance policies. At the trial the issues fought were as to the amount of the loss and as to the contention of the insurance company that the vacancy of some houses caused a change material to the risk not only for those vacant houses but also for those which were occupied at the time.\nThe findings of the jury were that the losses as claimed were proved and that the vacancy of some houses would not constitute a change material to the risk.\nThere was evidence that the fire actually started upon one of those occupied premises and there were other circumstances proved which justified the jury in finding that there was no material change in the risk, and, according to the provisions of the \u201cInsurance Act,\u201d such a question is a question of fact which should be left to the jury (sec. 156, sub-sec. 6).\nA judgment was rendered in favour of the plaintiffs, by the trial judge, for the losses on the whole of the ten houses.\nIn appeal that judgment was maintained as to the occupied houses but was reversed as to the corner house (because it was a store) and as to the houses which were vacant at the time of the fire.\nThe plaintiffs now appeal to this court. There is no cross-appeal on the part of the company; so we have to determine here only whether or not the losses incurred with regard to the store and the unoccupied houses are covered by the contract.\nI will first deal with the unoccupied houses, which is the more important item.\nThe ten policies are all drafted in the same way, with the exception of the house number. Here are the material parts of the policy concerning house No. 1:\u2014\nScottish Union and National Insurance Company . . . does insure Rass Bros. and M. Langbord for the term of three years, from the 8th day of May 1913, at noon to the 8th day of May 1916, at noon, against all direct loss or damage by fire except as hereinafter provided, to an amount not exceeding Twelve hundred xx\/100 Dollars to the following described property while located and contained as described herein and not elsewhere, to wit:\nThen follows the description of the subject-matter of the insurance on a printed slip pasted into a blank space in the policy, which slip is headed \u201cDwelling House Form\u201d:\u2014\nOn the 2 story, brick fronted, roughcast, shingle roof building and additions, including Foundations, Plumbing, Steam, Gas and Water Pipes and Fixtures, while occupied by . . . as a Dwelling, and situated No.\u2014on the east side of Keele Street Lot 50, 51, 52, Plan No. 1612, between Eglinton Avenue and Cameron Avenue known as House No. 1 Toronto.\nThe parts in italics are printed the others are written.\nIt is contended by the appellant that it was not necessary that those buildings should be occupied. On the other hand, it is. contended by the respondent that the words\nwhile occupied by . . . as a dwelling\nare descriptive of the thing insured and they rely on the judgment rendered by this court in the case of The London Assurance Corporation v. The Great Northern Transit Co.[33], which is known as the Baltic Case. That case was concerning the insurance against fire on the hull of the S.S. \u201cBaltic\u201d\nwhilst running on the inland lakes, rivers and canals during the season of navigation. To be laid up in a place of safety during winter months from any extra hazardous building.\nThe \u201cBaltic\u201d was laid up in 1893 and was never afterwards sent to sea. In 1896, she was destroyed by fire.\nThe Supreme Court came to the conclusion that the ship was insured only while employed on inland waters during the navigation season or laid up in safety during the winter months.\nIt was pretty plain and evident in that case that what was insured was a navigating vessel and that the insurance could not cover that vessel when she was laid up, except during the winter months. For several years that vessel had been out of commission and in such a case I could understand very well the decision of this court that the assurance could not cover the time when she had ceased to be used as a navigating vessel.\nBut the facts in this case are very different. First, the circumstances under which the contract was made shew the intention of the parties. When the policies were issued, the houses insured were not quite finished and they were vacant and were likely to be unoccupied for weeks and months. The insurance company knew that the houses were vacant. However, the company was willing to insure them as vacant dwellings, since it was stipulated in the contract prepared by the company itself that the insurance would cover the period from the 8th day of May, 1913, to the 8th day of May, 1916.\nCan it be said, in view of that formal stipulation and in view of the fact that the company knew that the houses would be unoccupied for weeks and months, and in view also of the fact that the company charged for the full three years, that it was not intended on its part to insure the dwelling-houses, whether vacant or not?\nI think that those circumstances shew conclusively that the contract intended by the parties was purely and simply to insure those dwellings; and it was not absolutely necessary that they should be occupied, because if they wanted to stipulate such a condition, it was very easy for them to fill the blank which was in their policy. But they left a phrase there,\nwhile occupied by . . . as a dwelling house,\nwhich did not mean anything by itself, except by striking out the word by or by adding some others, like the owner, the tenant or anybody.\nThe stipulation is the stipulation of the company and it was its duty to make it clear and if there is any ambiguity then it should be construed against the company. According to my view, those printed words,\nwhile occupied by . . . as a dwelling-house\nshould be considered as non-existing. Chapman v. Chapman[34]; Gill v. Bagshaw[35]; Cyc. vo. Accident Insurance, p. 245; Hull v. American Employers Ins. Co.[36]; Merritt v. Yates[37]. The subject-matter of the insurance was a dwelling. Its vacancy might constitute a change material to the risk. But it would then be a question to be determined by the jury, and, in this case, we have a finding that those vacancies did not constitute a material change.\nIt has been suggested that the word by in the phrase,\nwhile occupied by . . . as a dwelling-house.\ncould be struck out and that the policy would then read as on a building while occupied as a dwelling-house.\nThat condition would not change the liability of the company. It would not necessarily mean that the dwelling should be vacant, but it would mean simply that this building should be used as a dwelling-house, and not as a store, as a barn, as a garage, or something different from a dwelling-house.\nNow as to the store. The building was insured as a dwelling-house. It is in evidence that the property was partly occupied by a store and partly for residential purposes. By the \u201cInsurance Act of Ontario,\u201d it is provided that policies for stores should be made on a different footing. The company never intended in this case to insure a store, because the policy should have been for a period not of three years but of one year, as required by the law, and should have described the property not as a dwelling-house but as a store. We have no evidence to shew whether, when the insurance was taken out, it was considered as a store or as a dwelling. If the change was made after the policy was taken out, it became the duty of the insured to notify the company of the change, which I consider as being a material one: and, in that regard, I am of opinion that the jury came to a wrong conclusion which the evidence did not justify.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal should be maintained as to that corner house but it should be reversed with regard to the vacant houses.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nMIGNAULT J.\u2014I concur with Mr. Justice Anglin.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellants: Hugh J.

(Que.)\u20142 Geo. V. c. 56, .s. 33\u2014R.S.Q. (1909) articles 7581 et seq.\nHeld, Idington J. dissenting, that the party expropriating has the right to desist from expropriation proceedings or to amend same, if a serious error is found in the notice of expropriation, such error being a cause of nullity as to the substance of the object of the expropriation.\nPer Davies C.J.\u2014Under the special terms of 2 Geo. V. ch. 56, sec. 33, it was ultra vires of the city respondent to expropriate more lands than required for the extension of the mentioned street, and, therefore, the city had not only the right but the duty to desist from the expropriation of lands not necessary for such extension.\nPer Idington J. (dissenting)\u2014A landowner, served with a notice to treat by any legal entity upon which the legislature has conferred the right of expropriation, can apply for a mandamus, and it is his only proper remedy, to compel that party so asserting its power to proceed, by the appointed means given, to determine the amount of compensation the landowner may be entitled to.\nPer Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\u2014As the general law governing expropriations in Quebec (R.S.Q. (1909) Articles 7581 et seq.,) referred to in the special statute governing the present proceedings, is designated as a \"Matter relating to the Code of Civil Procedure\" (R.S.Q. (1909) Title XII.,) in the absence of any provision in the said general law regarding discontinuance of expropriations, reference may be made to the Code of Civil Procedure; and under the terms of Articles 275 and 1437 C.P., the respondent had the right to discontinue its expropriation proceedings.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 26 K.B. 1), affirmed, Idington J. dissenting.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal, and dismissing the action with costs.\nOn the 30th June, 1913, the city respondent served a notice to the appellant that, according to 2 Geo. V. ch. 56, sec. 33, it was decided to expropriate lots 509 to 517 and 526 to 528 marked on a certain plan, being subdivisions 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12 of lot No. 168. Arbitrators were named and sworn. It was then ascertained by the respondent that, upon the part of the property not necessary for the extension of the street, there was situated an extensive building which did not appear upon the expropriation plan. Thereupon, the respondent served upon the appellant a discontinuance of the expropriation proceedings already commenced and at the same time served a new notice of expropriation for the lots 513, 515, 517 and 528 only, being part of subdivisions 3, 5, 6, 7, of lot No. 168 specially required for the widening of the street. On the 24 January, 1914, the appellant served a petition for an interlocutory injunction to enjoin the respondent from conducting any proceedings under the second notice of expropriation.\nProceedings, by way of mandamus, to force the respondent to proceed under the first notice of expropriation, were also instituted; but, by consent of the parties and to avoid costs, they were left in abeyance until a final decision in the present action would be rendered.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court, Guerin J. maintained the injunction, upon the ground solely that the notice of expropriation and the proceedings thereunder had not been given or undertaken within the twelve months mentioned in 2 Geo. V. ch. 56, sec. 33.\nAime Geoffrion K.C. and Paul St. Germain K.C. for the appellant. A. W. Atwater K.C. and J. A. Jarry K.C. for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014The controversy in this appeal relates to expropriation proceedings taken by the City of Montreal for the extension of Palace street (St. Joseph boulevard) in St. Denis ward from northeastern boundary of Laurier ward to Papineau avenue.\nThe authority for such extension was first granted by the legislature in 1911 and was permissive only and not compulsory.\nIn 1912, however, the legislature amended the enactment of 1911 and made the expropriation of the lands necessary for the extension of the boulevard compulsory upon the city either by mutual agreement with the owner or by expropriation within twelve months from the sanctioning of that Act. This latter Act came into force on April 3rd, 1912. The necessary resolution for the extension of the boulevard passed the city council in March, 1913, which approved of the Barlow plan of January, 1913. The appellant was notified by the city of its intention to expropriate a certain part of her property described in the notice as lots bearing the following numbers shewn on the plan prepared by John R. Barlow, Nos. 509, 511, 513, 514, 515, 516, 517, 526, 527 and 528.\nAs a fact the only lots of those specified as shewn upon the plan necessary for the extension of the boulevard were lots Nos. 513, 515, 517, and 528. The other lots were not necessary for the extension of the boulevard and the four which were so necessary were of a depth back from the boulevard of seven feet which was all of the appellant's land required for the extension. The remaining lots in the rear of the four lots mentioned and which ran back one hundred feet further were not so required. The parties not having been able to come to a mutual agreement as to compensation to be paid appellant, arbitrators were appointed when, after two or three meetings had been held, it was discovered that the plan of January, 1913, which the council had approved of, did not shew a large apartment house facing on Drolet street which had been built by appellant on some of her lots embraced within the expropriation notice in the rear of those actually required for the proposed extension of the boulevard. The proceedings of the arbitrators were then adjourned sine die in consequence of the declaration of the owner's attorneys that there was an error in the plan.\nThe city authorities came to the conclusion that a plan should be prepared according to which the expropriation should be limited to the part of appellant's lands actually required for the widening of the boulevard. A notice to that effect was served upon the appellant and notice given to her that the city desisted from its first notice of expropriation and confined such notice to such part of her lands as laid within the street or boulevard area.\nProceedings were then instituted by the appellant in the Superior Court asking for a declaration that the resolution of the city council which directed the change in the expropriation proceedings and limited them to the strip of appellant's lands lying within the street area and the notice given by the city to her that the city desisted from its first notice of expropriation and confined itself to the four lots actually required for the street extension were one and all illegal and ultra vires. After a hearing, the Superior Court decided against the city and the Court of King's Bench on appeal[2], reversed that judgment holding that under . the circumstances, and in view of the errors shewn to exist in the notice of expropriation the city was within its right in desisting, as it did, and in confining its expropriation proceedings to those lots of the appellant shewn upon the plan as actually necessary for the proposed extension of the street, namely, seven feet in depth and comprising lots 515, 513, 517, and 528 as shewn upon the plan.\nThe points argued before this court were mainly whether the city had power to desist from an expropriation proceeding already commenced because of an alleged serious mistake or error in the notice of expropriation given by it to the owner and the plan on which the notice was based.\nMr. Geoffrion contended that once the notice of expropriation's given and the sum offered as compensation is refused the right to desist from expropriation is gone and much more so when arbitrators are appointed to assess or decide the compensation to be paid. He further contended that this rule or conclusion applied as well to public municipalities as to private corporations.\nIn the view, however, which I take of the proper construction of the statute authorizing this expropriation, I do not think it necessary to discuss at length Mr. Geoffrion's general proposition Suffice it to say that I agree with the judgment appealed from and with that part of my brother Brodeur's reasons in this court to the effect that grave and serious error when shewn in the notice of expropriation would be open to amendment and that to that extent at least the expropriator would have power to desist and amend.\nThe grounds, however, on which I base my judgment are that the statute which governs in this case being a special one imperatively requiring the city to expropriate or amicably purchase certain lands within a limited time for the special purpose of extending a particular boulevard from one specified point to another, and expressly limiting the extent of the lands to be taken to those necessary for the extension, and further enacting that if recourse is had to the expropriation power it shall be taken under articles 7851 and following of the Revised Statutes of 1909, thus excluding the general charter powers, must be strictly followed; that the city had no power to go beyond the limited powers given them by this Act, and that any attempt to expropriate more or other lands than those defined as necessary in the statute to carry out its object and purpose was ultra vires.\nThe statute in question reads as follows:\u2014\n32.\u2014Section 32 of the Act 1 Geo. V. (2nd session), chapter 60, is amended by striking out paragraph b.\n33.\u2014The city shall acquire by mutual agreement or expropriate under articles 7581 and following of the Revised Statutes, 1909, within twelve months from the sanctioning of this Act, for the purpose of extending Palace street (St. Joseph boulevard) in St. Denis ward from the northeastern boundary of Laurier ward to Papineau avenue, all the immovables it may need for such purpose with the exception however of convents, schools, churches and parsonages; and sell by auction, in whole or in part, the lands thus acquired by mutual agreement or by expropriation, on either side of the said boulevard, the whole according to the plan prepared by John R. Barlow on February 25th, 1911, and a copy of which shall be deposited in the office of the city clerk, or according to any other plan approved by the city.\nNo one shall erect any buildings on the lines comprised within the lines given on said plan within twelve months from the sanctioning of this Act, unless the City of Montreal, having become proprietor of the whole or of part of the said Palace street (St. Joseph boulevard), allows it.\nThe amount required to pay the cost of such improvement shall be charged to the loan fund which the city has at its disposal and the proceeds of the sale of such lots and of the materials of the demolished buildings shall be applied to the repayment of the same amount to the loan fund.\nNow it does seem clear to me that in this statute compelling the city to open up and extend the street or boulevard within twelve months from the sanctioning of the Act, the legislature definitely fixed a limitation upon the powers given to the city, and that limitation was that the city should acquire\nfor the purpose of extending Palace street (St. Joseph boulevard) in St. Denis ward from the northeastern boundary of Laurier ward to Papineau avenue all the immovables it may need for such purpose.\nNow surely that language is plain, clear and unequivocal. It is the controlling language of the statute. It gives power to acquire such immovables as may be needed for the extension but no more. The subsequent language of the section authorizing\nthe sale by auction in whole or in part of the lands thus acquired on either side of the said boulevard\nmust be rejected as being altogether inapplicable and without any meaning. They were doubtless inserted by the draftsman under the impression that the general powers of the city under its charter when opening or extending streets or boulevards to purchase or expropriate more lands on each side of the street or boulevard than were required for the street or boulevard extended to the expropriation provided for in this special Act.\nBut these general powers were clearly not intended to be given and were, not given in this special Act enacted for a single and special purpose and being compulsory on the city and not optional.\nIf doubt could exist on the point arising out of the city's charter, I would call attention to the fact that the powers in the special statute given were not to be exercised under the city's charter which gives these special powers of expropriating lands on each side of any street being opened or extended, but are expressly given to be exercised under articles 7581 and following of the Revised Statutes, 1909, which do not give such powers.\nI am of the opinion, therefore, that the powers of the city in this case to expropriate were expressly limited to the\nimmovables needed for the purpose of extending Palace street to Papineau avenue,\nand that the attempt under the special statute here in question and the general powers of expropriation under article 7581 of the Revised Statutes, which is read into the special statute, to expropriate more land than was required for the purpose of the street extension were so far as such an attempt was made ultra vires of the city. I think when this fact was discovered it became not only the right but the duty of the city to desist and to confine the proceedings of the arbitrators to those lands which the statute authorized them to expropriate.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nIdington J. (dissenting)\u2014A long line of authorities beginning with The King v. The Commissioners for improving Market Street, Manchester, reported in a note to The King v. Hungerford Market Company[3], and the judgment in that case, clearly establishes the right of a landowner served with a notice to treat by any legal entity upon which the legislature has conferred the right of expropriation, to apply for a mandamus to compel that party so asserting its power to proceed, by the appointed means given, to determine the amount of compensation the landowner may be entitled to.\nIn Morgan v. Metropolitan Railway Co,[4], Kelly C.B. delivering the judgment of the Appellate Court (then known as that of the Exchequer Chamber), said:\u2014\nEver since the case of Rex v. Hungerford Market Company3 it has uniformly been held that wherever a company is entitled to take land compulsorily under the powers of an Act of Parliament, if they give notice of their intention to take the land, that is an exercise of their option from which they cannot recede, and the notice operates as a contract or an undertaking by them to become the purchasers. That case was decided in the year 1832, and it has never yet been questioned.\nThat of course is only a comprehensive declaration of English law upon the subject. I am, however, unable to find that the law of Quebec differs therefrom in the slightest degree.\nCounsel for the appellant told us in argument that the pursuit by her of that remedy was merely held in abeyance pending this appeal.\nI am entirely at a loss to understand this circuitous way of proceeding when the direct method of asserting her right (if any) was open to her.\nIndeed, I have come to the conclusion that it should not be tolerated.\nI have the gravest suspicion that the judgment appealed from is founded upon reasons which are not maintainable; but I do not think a definite opinion thereupon ought to be expressed further than incidentally necessary to present the reasons for the conclusion I have reached, lest by doing so we add to the confusion of thought this peculiarly circuitous method appellant has taken by way of asserting her right has evidently produced.\nLet us take the suggestion in Mr. Justice Cross' judgment that there is to be made a distinction between the effect of expropriating powers given a railway company and the service of the like power by a municipal corporation, and see if it is well founded in light of the decisions I have referred to.\nIt happens that of these very decisions to which I have referred, the first named and Steele v. The Mayor of Liverpool[5], and Birch v. St. Marylebone Vestry[6], relate to the identical subject matter of expropriation for purposes of opening new streets with which the case in hand is concerned.\nThere is, leaving aside expropriation for the Crown, only one case that I have been able to find which has the semblance of maintaining such a distinction as sought to be made. That is the case of Reg. v. Commissioners of Woods and Forests[7], in which, having regard to the funds at the disposal of the commission and the limited purposes of the Act there in question, the court could easily see its way to hold the defendants entitled to withdraw the notice. To have refused to so hold would have resulted in the court forcing a public body to do that which was ultra vires, or at all events have been improper.\nWhen that case was relied upon in the two which I have cited immediately preceding my citation of it, the respective courts concerned shewed how very limited an application the decision was capable of.\nMoreover, the course of legislation relative to municipalities in many jurisdictions has been to provide expressly against such like contingencies as arise in the proceedings in question herein.\nI express no opinion upon the question of whether or not such like implication may be found in the legislation relevant to anything involved in the rights of the parties hereto. I am only concerned in demonstrating that the appropriate remedy, and indeed the only proper remedy, the appellant has, if any, is by way of mandamus, and that there is grave reason to suppose that there is, or may be, error in the judgment appealed from, and none the less so when the unsuitable injunction method of procedure is allowed as possibly right. Of course, if it were quite clear that she had nothing to complain of we perhaps should refrain from any interference no matter how objectionable the form of procedure as such might be.\nThe case presented is far from that both as to law and facts and it is important no such precedent should be made.\nI think she should be given an opportunity, if so advised, to try that out and to do so freed from any prejudice founded upon anything that has transpired.\nI may point out that in Lind v. The Isle of Wight Ferry Company[8], and in Adams v. London & Blackwall Railway Co.[9], the Court of Chancery in England refused to exercise any of its powers to aid a plaintiff situated similarly to the appellant.\nThese decisions were given at a time when that court had at least as ample powers to enforce by injunction the observance of a party's rights as it seems to me can fall within the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure in Quebec providing for injunction. And they are decisions by a court of which the tradition exists that it was inclined to extend its jurisdiction when it found it necessary in order to do justice.\nWhen we find it in such cases as these, so closely analogous in principle to that now at bar, refusing to assert its supposed power and referring the litigant to the need to seek his relief in the remedy of mandamus alone, I feel we may well follow such precedents.\nThe appellant may have the right to enjoin temporarily the respondent from proceeding under its new notice until she has had an opportunity of trying out the questions involved by way of an application for a mandamus.\nI would therefore allow the appear without costs and modify the judgment accordingly and substitute for the reservation by the judgment of the Superior Court of her right to proceed for damages, the right to proceed for a writ of mandamus, if so advised, without prejudice arising from the proceedings had herein.\nThere does not seem, considering the leisurely way things were done by those concerned, much reason to fear that the city would, in face of a proceeding for a writ or order of mandamus, which I hold to be the proper course in such a case, insist upon proceeding immediately under its new notice. But lest it might be likely to do so, an interlocutory injunction could have been had, no doubt. In allowing the appeal I would grant such interlocutory judgment until the proceedings for mandamus terminate, or such reasonable time as should enable the appellant to terminate same.\nAnglin J.\u2014I have had the advantage of reading the opinion of my brother Brodeur, in which I believe my brother Mignault concurs. While in accord with the conclusion reached I hesitate to commit myself unreservedly to the ground on which my learned brother rests his judgment because of its very far reaching effect. As I understand it, he imports the rules of the code of procedure in matters not expressly provided for by the general law of the province governing expropriations (R.S.Q. arts. 7581, et seq.) into all proceedings had under it, merely because such expropriations are grouped with some other subjects in the Quebec statutes under the heading \"Matters Relating to the Code of Civil Procedure.\" I am satisfied, however, that in the present instance on the ground of error in the substance of the object of the expropriation the respondent would be entitled to the relief which the judgment in appeal accords to it. Any amendment necessary to sustain the judgment on that ground could and should be made. \"Supreme Court Act,\" section 54.\nBrodeur J.\u2014En 1911 la l\u00e9gislature de Qu\u00e9bec a autoris\u00e9 la ville de Montr\u00e9al \u00e0 exproprier dans l'espace de deux ans les terrains requis pour prolonger le Boulevard St-Joseph du quartier Laurier \u00e0 l'Avenue Papineau, suivant un plan pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par John R. Barlow le 25 f\u00e9vrier 1911.\nEn 1912 la l\u00e9gislature a amend\u00e9 la l\u00e9gislation de 1911 et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la ville devrait acqu\u00e9rir ou exproprier, non pas d'apr\u00e8s les dispositions de sa charte, mais d'apr\u00e8s les articles 7581 et suivants des Statuts Refondus de Qu\u00e9bec, tous les immeubles dont elle aurait besoin pour ce prolongement du Boulevard suivant le plan Barlow ou suivant tout autre plan approuv\u00e9 par la ville. Ce qui \u00e9tait en 1911 une autorisation d'exproprier devenait donc par la loi de 1912 une obligation formelle impos\u00e9e \u00e0 la ville de prolonger ce boulevard jusqu'\u00e0 la rue Papineau. Cependant l'expro priation, au lieu de se faire suivant le plan Barlow, pouvait se faire suivant tout autre plan que la ville adopterait et l'expropriation, au lieu d'\u00eatre faite suivant les dispositions de la charte de la cit\u00e9, serait faite suivant la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des expropriations.\nL'appelante, Maria Bisaillon, \u00e9tait propri\u00e9taire de quatre lots de terre ayant front sur le boulevard projet\u00e9. Ces quatre lots de terre portaient respectivement les num\u00e9ros 3, 5, 6 et 7 du num\u00e9ro 168 du cadastre du village de la C\u00f4te St-Louis. Elle \u00e9tait \u00e9galement propri\u00e9taire des lots 8 et 11 du m\u00eame num\u00e9ro 168. Ces derniers lots \u00e9taient situ\u00e9s \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re des premiers lots: et ils avaient front sur. une rue transversale, appel\u00e9e rue Drolet. La Cit\u00e9 n'avait besoin pour le Boulevard St-Joseph que de sept pieds de large, au front des lots 3, 5, 6 et 7.\nEn vertu des dispositions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de sa charte (art. 425), dispositions qui paraissent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 implicitement reconnues dans la loi de 1912, la cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 exproprier non-seulement les lisi\u00e8res de terrain dont elle a besoin pour l'ouverture et l'\u00e9largissement d'une rue: mais elle est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 exproprier plus que ce qu'il lui faut pour l'ouvrage projet\u00e9. Dans ce dernier cas, elle doit revendre le terrain qu'elle a expropri\u00e9 mais qu'elle n'utilise pas. Ce syst\u00e8me peut \u00eatre, dans certains cas, tr\u00e8s avantageux: parce que parfois l'expropriation du front d'un lot peut occasionner la d\u00e9molition d'un b\u00e2timent et alors donner lieu \u00e0 des r\u00e9clamations tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9es. Dans ce cas, il devient plus avantageux d'acqu\u00e9rir tout le terrain pour revendre ensuite la partie dont la ville n'aurait pas besoin.\nAu sujet de l'\u00e9largissement du Boulevard St-Joseph, l'ing\u00e9nieur Barlow avait, le 25 f\u00e9vrier 1911, pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un plan par lequel l'assiette du Boulevard serait de cent pieds de large: et, en outre de cela, il indiquait que cent pieds de terrain de chaque c\u00f4t\u00e9 du boulevard projet\u00e9 devait \u00eatre expropri\u00e9. C'est ce plan qui \u00e9tait devant la l\u00e9gislature et auquel il est r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 dans la l\u00e9gislation.\nLe 27 janvier 1913, un nouveau plan fut pr\u00e9par\u00e9 et l\u00e0 encore, du moins en tant que les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de l'appelante sont concern\u00e9es, l'expropriation projet\u00e9e couvrait non-seulement le terrain n\u00e9cessaire pour l'assiette du Boulevard lui-m\u00eame mais encore cent pieds de plus. Ce plan fut approuv\u00e9 par le conseil de ville le 10 mars 1913 et une r\u00e9solution a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e autorisant l'expropriation de tous les terrains n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00e9largir et prolonger la rue suivant ce plan du 27 janvier 1913.\nLe 30 juin 1913, avis d'expropriation fut donn\u00e9 par la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al \u00e0 l'appelante non-seulement pour les lots de terre qui avaient front sur le boulevard projet\u00e9, c'est-\u00e0-dire les num\u00e9ros 3, 5, 6 & 7 du num\u00e9ro 168: mais aussi des terrains qui se trouvaient en arri\u00e8re de ces lots-l\u00e0 et qui \u00e9taient subdivis\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 avoir front sur la rue Drolet.\nL'avis d'expropriation pour les lots ayant front sur la rue Drolet \u00e9tait \u00e9videmment erron\u00e9. Par exemple, en d\u00e9crivant une partie du No. 168-11, on donnait les tenants et aboutissants et on d\u00e9clarait entr'autres choses que cette partie du num\u00e9ro 168-11 que l'on voulait exproprier \u00e9tait born\u00e9e au nord-ouest par le num\u00e9ro du cadastre 168-11. Comment une partie du lot 168-11 pouvait-elle \u00eatre born\u00e9e par tout le lot 168-11?\nIl en est de m\u00eame de la lisi\u00e8re de terrain en premier lieu d\u00e9crite dans l'avis d'expropriation, que l'on d\u00e9clare faire partie du cadastre sous le num\u00e9ro 168-4. Or, si on examine le plan qui est devant nous, il est \u00e9vident que ce num\u00e9ro 168-4 que l'on d\u00e9crivait faisait partie, au contraire, du num\u00e9ro 168-11.\nIl y avait donc dans cet avis d'expropriation erreur \u00e9vidente et palpable: erreur dans la description des lots et erreur quant \u00e0 l'acquisition des terrains que la ville d\u00e9sirait faire. Je comprends parfaitement que la ville e\u00fbt voulu exproprier tous les lots ayant front sur la rue projet\u00e9e: mais vouloir acqu\u00e9rir des lots qui se trouvaient en arri\u00e8re de ceux-ci, et qui se trouvaient avoir front sur une autre rue, ne devait pas, suivant moi, entrer dans les intentions de la ville.\nLa ville dans son avis faisait une offre de $17,500 pour le terrain qu'elle d\u00e9sirait acheter de l'appelante. L'appelante a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle refusait cette offre et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la valeur des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s qu'on voulait exproprier \u00e9tait de $98,000. Diff\u00e9rence notable, comme on le voit, et qui d\u00e9montre \u00e9videmment qu'il devait y avoir erreur quant aux terrains qu'on entendait de part et d'autre acheter et vendre.\nLes arbitres commenc\u00e8rent leurs proc\u00e9dures pour d\u00e9terminer la valeur du terrain.\nOn avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 tenu deux ou trois s\u00e9ances, quand, tout-\u00e0-coup, il fut d\u00e9couvert que le plan du 27 janvier 1913 ne montrait pas une maison de rapport qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9rig\u00e9e par Maria Bisaillon sur ses lots ayant face sur la rue Drolet, mais qui, par l'expropriation projet\u00e9e se trouvait \u00eatre partiellement prise. Alors les proc\u00e9dures furent ajourn\u00e9es sine die par les procureurs, vu la d\u00e9claration faite par les procureurs de la propri\u00e9taire qu'il y avait erreur au plan. En effet, il ne pouvait pas \u00eatre pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que la Cit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, en instituant ces proc\u00e9dures et en demandant \u00e0 exproprier cent pieds de plus que ce qui \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour le Boulevard, e\u00fbt l'intention de prendre une partie de la maison seulement: et il est \u00e1 pr\u00e9sumer \u00e9galement que la demanderesse appelante ne tenait nullement \u00e0 voir sa maison \u00e9ventr\u00e9e et d\u00e9molie en partie lorsqu'il \u00e9tait si facile de confiner l'expropriation \u00e0 une portion moindre de terrain.\nJe comprends que s'il se f\u00fbt agi de l'ouverture de la rue proprement dite, il aurait pu devenir n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9molir une maison pour partie: mais vu que la ville voulait exproprier non-seulement la partie de terrain n\u00e9cessaire pour l'assiette de la rue mais aussi des terrains riverains, il n'\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 pr\u00e9sumer que l'on e\u00fbt l'intention de d\u00e9molir une grande maison: car autrement la cit\u00e9 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9e de payer tous les dommages r\u00e9sultant de cette d\u00e9molition partielle et qui auraient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pratiquement la valeur de toute la maison.\nCette erreur ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couverte, il me semble que, m\u00eame si nous acceptons la pr\u00e9tention de l'appelante que ces proc\u00e9dures constituent un contrat liant les deux parties, il y a eu \u00e9videmment une erreur qui est une cause de nullit\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la substance de la chose qui faisait l'objet du contrat. Je ne crois pas, vu la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle j'en suis venu sur un autre point, qu'il soit n\u00e9cessaire pour moi de d\u00e9cider si l'avis d'expropriation, suivi de la nomination de son arbitre par la partie expropri\u00e9e, constitue un contrat. Je serais enclin \u00e0 croire, au contraire, que cet avis d'expropriation est de la nature d'une instance judiciaire, ainsi que je le d\u00e9montrerai plus loin.\nLes autorit\u00e9s de la ville ont alors consid\u00e9r\u00e9 la situation et en sont arriv\u00e9es \u00e0 la conclusion de pr\u00e9parer un nouveau plan par lequel elles limiteraient leur expropriation \u00e0 la partie sp\u00e9cialement requise pour l'\u00e9largissement de la rue: et elles ont fait signifier \u00e0 l'appelante, Maria Bisaillon, un avis \u00e0 cet effet d\u00e9clarant que la cit\u00e9 se d\u00e9sistait de son premier avis d'expropriation et qu'elle n'exproprierait que le terrain n\u00e9cessaire pour la rue elle-m\u00eame.\nOn pr\u00e9tend maintenant par la pr\u00e9sente action que la ville n'avait pas le droit de se d\u00e9sister de ces proc\u00e9dures et qu'ayant produit son plan du 27 janvier 1913 elle \u00e9tait li\u00e9e et qu'il ne lui \u00e9tait pas permis de produire un autre plan ou de r\u00e9duire la quantit\u00e9 de terrain qu'elle d\u00e9sirait exproprier.\nLa cit\u00e9 pouvait-elle se d\u00e9sister?\nJe soumets que sans nul doute elle pouvait le faire en vertu des dispositions de notre loi en la mati\u00e8re.\nL'expropriation du terrain en question, comme on l'a vu, ne devait pas \u00eatre faite suivant les dispositions ordinaires de la charte de la cit\u00e9, mais suivant l'acte g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'expropriation de la province, qui se trouve aux articles 7581 et suivants des Statuts Refondus de la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\nCe serait une erreur de croire que cet acte d'expropriation contient toute la proc\u00e9dure qui doit \u00eatre suivie en la mati\u00e8re. Nous retrouvons cet acte au chapitre second du titre XII des statuts refondus de la province de Qu\u00e9bec qui est intitul\u00e9 Des mati\u00e8res en rapport avec le code de proc\u00e9dure civile. La section 9 de ce chapitre contient les dispositions de la loi d'expropriation proprement dite.\nAu cours de l'argument, j'ai sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que nos articles 1431 et suivants du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile pouvaient s'appliquer \u00e0 l'expropriation actuelle et \u00e0 l'expropriation faite en vertu de la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la province. Mais cette suggestion ne m'a pas paru avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e par aucune des parties.\nCependant il me semble qu'il n'y a aucun doute que l\u00e0 o\u00f9 la loi g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des expropriations ne contient pas de clause particuli\u00e8re sur le sujet on doit s'en rapporter au Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile pour d\u00e9terminer respectivement les droits et les obligations des parties et la proc\u00e9dure qui doit \u00eatre suivie. Ainsi, il n'est pas dit, par exemple, dans l'acte des expropriations si une partie peut r\u00e9voquer ou abandonner la proc\u00e9dure qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite. Alors du moment qu'il n'y a pas de dispositions dans l'acte g\u00e9n\u00e9ral nous pouvons donc r\u00e9f\u00e9rer au Code de Proc\u00e9dure: et l\u00e0 nous trouvons l'article 1437 C.P. qui dit que\npendant les d\u00e9lais du compromis, les arbitres ne peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9voqu\u00e9s que du consentement de toutes les parties. Si le d\u00e9lai est ind\u00e9fini, il est libre \u00e0 chacune des parties de r\u00e9voquer le compromis, lorsqu'il lui plait.\nC'est d'ailleurs une r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de notre proc\u00e9dure que nous trouvons \u00e0 l'article 275, C.P. qui dit que\nUne partie peut, en tout temps avant jugement, se d\u00e9sister de sa demande ou proc\u00e9dure, a la condition de payer les frais.\nAppliquant, par cons\u00e9quent, les articles 1437 et 275 du Code de Proc\u00e9dure Civile \u00e0 la cause actuelle, je dis: La cit\u00e9 avait le droit de se d\u00e9sister de son avis d'expropriation parce que d'abord il n'y avait pas de d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 pendant lequel les arbitres devaient faire leur rapport: et ensuite parce qu'elle pouvait, en vertu de l'article 275 du code de proc\u00e9dure civile exercer tout droit qu'une partie poss\u00e8de d'abandonner sa proc\u00e9dure, pourvu qu'elle paie les frais.\nL'appelante nous a cit\u00e9 certaines d\u00e9cisions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues en Angleterre \u00e0 l'effet que les corporations municipales ne pouvaient pas se d\u00e9sister d'un avis d'expropriation.\nNous n'avons pas \u00e0 juger cette cause-ci d'apr\u00e8s la loi qui r\u00e9git les, expropriations en Angleterre mais d'apr\u00e8s la loi qui r\u00e9git les expropriations dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Or, je trouve dans les statuts refondus, ainsi que dans notre code de proc\u00e9dure civile les \u00e9l\u00e9ments n\u00e9cessaires pour d\u00e9clarer qu'une partie peut se d\u00e9sister de sa proc\u00e9dure en expropriation.\nPour ces raisons, l'appel institu\u00e9 par Maria Bisaillon devrait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nMignault J.\u2014Je partage l'opinion de M. le Juge Brodeur.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: St. Germain, Guerin & Raymond.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Laurendeau, Archambault, Damphousse, Jarry, Butler & St. Pierre.\n[1] Q.R. 26 K.B. 1.\n[2] Q.R. 26 K.B. 1.\n[3] 4 B. & Ad. 327.\n[4] L.R. 4 C.P. 97, at page 105.\n3 4 B. & Ad. 327.\n[5] 14 W.R. 311; 7 B. & S. 261.\n[6] 20 L.T. 697.\n[7] 15 Q.B. 761.\n[8] 7 L.T. 416; 1 N.R. 13.\n[9] 2 Mac. & G. 118.\n"

The respondent took proceedings, by way of injunction, to restrain him from doing so, and his action was dismissed. Between the date of the trial and the hearing in appeal, the \"Dominion Insurance Act\" was amended by 7 & 8 Geo. V. c. 29, and sections 4 and 11 provided that a foreign insurance company could not carry on its business in Canada unless and until it has obtained a licence from the Minister of Finance for the Dominion of Canada.\nHeld, that the Court of Appeal should have taken judicial notice of the amendments to the \"Dominion Insurance Act;\" and, if so, the Guardian Fire Insurance Company of Utah not being able through the issuing of a provincial licence to transact any business in British Columbia before having obtained a Dominion licence, the proceedings by way of injunction taken by the respondent were premature.

APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia[1], reversing the judgment of Clement J. at the trial, and maintaining the plaintiff's action.\nThe circumstances of the case are stated in the head\u2014note and the questions in issue on the appeal are referred to in the judgments now reported.\nGeo. F. Henderson K.C. and Cameron for the appellant.\nLafleur K.C. and Atwater K.C. for the respondent.\nTHE CHIEF JUSTICE\u2014 As to the point taken by my brother, Sir Walter Cassels, on the argument that the Guardian Fire Insurance Company of Salt Lake City, Utah, the real defendant in this case, was a necessary party to the action brought to restrain its agent Matthew, the appellant, from applying to the Superintendent of Insurance in British Columbia for a provincial licence to that company to do business in that province, I am not at present ready to pronounce the objection a fatal one. I agree that the company is a proper party to be joined as defendant, and I think the court of the province would have been well advised not to proceed in the hearing of the cause unless and until it had been added as a defendant.\nBut, as a matter of fact, Matthew, its general agent in British Columbia, made the application to the Superintendent of Insurance as the authorized agent of the company in that behalf and while the absence of the company may not be absolutely fatal, it must necessarily lessen and narrow the measure of relief to which the plaintiff company claims to be entitled.\nThe main and substantial question before us is the meaning and effect of the \"Dominion Insurance Act,\" 1917, which came into force 20th September, 1917. The appeal from the trial judge to the Court of Appeal of British Columbia was argued November, 1917, and the Act was therefore in force at that time.\nIt should, in my judgment, have been taken judicial notice of by the Court of Appeal and, if it had been, it would have appeared, which was common ground on the argument at bar, that no foreign insurance company can carry on its activities in the business it is authorised to deal in anywhere in Canada unless and until it first obtains the licence from the Dominion Minister provided for in section 4 of the statute.\nThe obtaining of a provincial licence such as that applied for in British Columbia by the appellant, Matthew, to the Superintendent of Insurance in British Columbia would not operate to permit of the company carrying on any of its activities in that province. It would not affect the prohibitions prescribed in section 11 of the Dominion Act against the company doing any kind of insurance business unless and until it has. first obtained a Dominion licence. The provincial licence was, therefore, useless, innocuous and impotent in itself in any way to injure, hurt or damage the plaintiff company.\nThe result would be that this application was in any event premature. I agree that the official charged with the issuing of provincial licences would be well advised to do so only to companies which had first obtained a Dominion licence. But I do not see anything in either the Dominion or provincial statutes which prevents him granting a provincial licence, useless as it may be, to enable the licencee to carry on any business until after the Dominion licence has been obtained. Upon this ground alone I would allow the appeal, but under the circumstances without costs in this court and in the courts below. For fear that in thus allowing the appeal I might mistakenly be supposed to have done so on the merits, I desire to add that nothing could be further from my intention.\nThe power to determine whether under circumstances and facts as disclosed in this case, or whether in any case such a licence should be granted to any company, is now vested in the Minister of Finance, and neither this court nor any other court, I take it, can interfere with the exercise of his statutory discretion. At the same time I desire not to leave it open to be said that I had in any way, directly or obliquely, reversed or thrown doubt upon the judgment of the Court of Appeal in this case so far as the merits were concerned.\nIDINGTON J.\u2014It seems to me there has existed from the outset a fundamental misconception of the actual legal situation in which the respective parties concerned were placed, otherwise I imagine we should have been presented with some other evidence than submitted and argument thereupon helpful to solve, what I venture to look upon as an entirely novel claim.\nThe appellant happened to be named as attorney, to act for the Guardian Fire Insurance Company, in the event of its obtaining a licence under the \"British Columbia Fire Insurance Act\" and amending Acts. And I assume he consented in such event to so act and may have taken a part in filing with the provincial authorities part of the necessary material for obtaining such a licence.\nBoth the respondent and the Guardian Fire Insurance Company in question were foreign corporations. The respondent was created such in Great Britain, and the other in Utah, one of the United States of America. Neither had any right to do any business in Canada against the will of the Parliament of Canada.\nThat Parliament, as early as 1868, passed an Insurance Act which prohibited the carrying on of such business in Canada by any foreign companies or persons unless and until duly licensed under said Act, and then subject to the conditions laid down therein.\nThat Act was amended from time to time and, by an early amendment, required the licence to be renewed from year to year. The respondent had been, under another name, it is said, duly licensed under said Act. That name was changed more than once, and in 1902 took the form now appearing herein. It also had obtained a licence under, and pursuant to, the provisions of the \"British Columbia Insurance Act\" to do business in British Columbia.\nThat Act, passed for purposes of revenue and other good reasons, rendered registration there necessary and provided for the issuing of a licence as evidence thereof.\nEach insurance company of those concerned saw fit and was possibly required thereby to describe itself as of its place of origin or creation.\nSo far as appears in this case the Guardian Fire Insurance Company had never applied to the Dominion authorities. Until it had done so and obtained a licence or at least had made an application therefor, I think this action was premature. There was nothing to be feared from the merely preparatory and formal application made in British Columbia.\nWhatever might be said for an action such as this had it been taken against the company, I think it cannot properly be maintained as against a mere agent doing no more than appellant had done; apparently in good faith and depending, no doubt, upon his principal duly proceeding to obtain, and duly obtaining, a Dominion licence before doing anything in the way of carrying on business.\nThe respondent had, until that done, presumably nothing to fear. Unfortunately, from the misconception I have adverted to, this objection never seems to have been considered by those concerned until my brother Sir Walter Cassels, on argument, called attention to the failure to make said company a party, and hence we are without argument on the question.\nSo far as I have been enabled to discover, the nearest approach to an agent in an analogous case being held thus liable to be attacked and enjoined, without his principal being made a party, is the case of those handling goods of a principal who was infringing some trade mark as, for example, in the case of Upmann v. Elkan [2], and other analogous cases cited in Kerr on Injunctions, 4th ed., pp. 342 et seq.\nIn such like cases the agent was clearly doing that which was in itself illegal and hence responsible in an action for an injunction. Here, presumably, there was nothing of that kind. The purpose certainly was neither, nor pretended to have been, that of proceeding to carry on the business without obtaining a Dominion licence. If another purpose was had in view it ought to have been established by evidence, which is not attempted.\nIt is true that as early as 1910, before the Utah company was created, sections 4 and 70 of the \"Dominion Insurance Act\" of 1910 had been called in question as being ultra vires the Dominion Parliament by reason of the infringement thereby of provincial rights.\nIn consequence of such question being raised, a case was submitted to this court. That submission, although directed by order-in-council in 1910, was, for some reason or other, not proceeded with to argument until 1912, and not decided here till the following year.\nAn appeal was taken from the judgment of this court[3], to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which was argued in December, 1915, and judgment given there in the following February[4].\nI hardly think any one ever supposed that if the said section had been framed to deal only with foreign corporations, that there could be a question of the power of the Dominion Parliament in that regard.\nFor my part I felt bound to so limit the effect of my answer to the second question submitted, as to avoid all appearance of questioning that power so far as regards the foreign insurance companies.\nThe Judicial Committee, in giving an affirmative answer, seemed to feel bound to express clearly its opinion that as regards foreign corporations the Dominion Parliament had the power if expressed in \"properly framed legislation.\"\nIf it, in fact, was ever supposed by respondent to have been part of the purpose of the Guardian Fire Insurance Company, created in Utah, pending this litigation, to deny the power of the Dominion Parliament and insist upon a right to operate in British Columbia by virtue only of a licence under the \"British Columbia Insurance Act,\" I think it should have so alleged and proved such an allegation. The surmise comes too late after it has obtained an injunction by the court below recognising the unquestioned validity of the Act of 1917, which contained in other respects identical provisions I am about to deal with.\nIn other words, when the appeal seeking for an injunction was argued, and the injunction now in question was granted by the court below, there was no longer, if ever, the slightest reason to seek for such relief.\nThat brings me to a consideration of the situation presented by the application of section 6 of the \"Dominion Insurance Act,\" 1910, and its repetition in the Act of 1917, which enacts as follows :\u2014\n6. Before issuing a licence to a company the Minister must be satisfied that the corporate name of the company is not that of any other known company incorporated or unincorporated, or any name liable to be confounded therewith or otherwise on public grounds objectionable,\nwhich had been brought into and remained part of the Act since 1894.\nIt may be arguable, as I suggested on the argument herein, that the whole situation of the legal relation of the parties concerned is not and cannot be affected by anything contained therein. And hence it may be further arguable that an agent or clerk of any kind can be attacked alone and restrained upon the basis of what we might hold to be the right interpretation and construction of this section.\nEven assuming that such a claim might be arguable as against appellant's principal, I cannot see how such a case can be maintainable against the agent alone.\nThe appellant, it is true, has, by his pleading and his conduct of the defence, gone beyond that, but his foolishly doing so cannot determine the actual legal rights and liabilities existent between such parties and bind us to hold that the granting or withholding of an injunction must be governed thereby.\nThe offence to be considered, and for repetition or continuation of which he is sought to be enjoined, is not that of pleading such a defence but an alleged offence anterior thereto.\nI might rest my opinion here, but the claim, even if to be considered in light of the possible presence of the principal, is one of such a remarkable character that I feel it desirable to point out briefly the actual situation and need of pausing before, in such a case as is presented, laying down as law, in the absence of the Minister and without having his ruling, that he must not entertain for a moment the consideration of such an application.\nAnd when we find that in Canada there actually are carrying on business no less than three or four different sets (and possibly many more) of foreign insurance companies possessing such similar names as \"The Phoenix of London, England;\" \"The Phoenix of Hartford, Connecticut;\" \"The Phoenix of Paris,\" and, it is said, \"The Phoenix of Brooklyn,\" we should I submit, infer that such a condition of things is the result of a considered and settled policy in the administration of the Act.\nIndeed there is the case amongst others of the Guardians (one of which is a branch of that at Utah) competing with respondent in the accident line of insurance, from which it is fairly inferable that the respondent company or its parent company had for many years assented to such an interpretation and construction of the section as being correct.\nConfronted with such a situation it seems to require some boldness on the part of respondent, well knowing all, to ask us to declare it all done illegally and in violation of the section I have just quoted. For my part I cannot assent to the creation of such inevitable confusion as would result from our so declaring in a case launched, as this has been, and steered, as far as possible, clear of an investigation of the actual facts.\nWe are asked to do that on the strength of a decision in which, as I read the case, there was ample ground for suspecting unfair dealing and a conscious purpose of doing wrong.\nTrue, the court put it on another ground\u2014as many of its kind were politely put when in fact reading between the lines there existed grave ground for suspecting intentional wrong\u2014doing or a determination to attempt it.\nCase law, however helpful, is often a blind guide to follow. I do not think that line of cases applicable herein or that they should govern the decision of this.\nI think we should become possessed of a full realisation, or as full a realisation as we can, of the actual legal and commercial situations respectively, and observe an understanding of what men, even when incorporated, are about, and then ask ourselves if there is in truth that exact resemblance between the respective situations which each of the lines of cases presented, and that which confronted the Minister (or succession of Ministers) asked to administer the law as enacted in the \"Dominion Insurance Act.\"\nLet us never forget that the foreign corporation has no rights save in a recognised comity liable to be set aside absolutely or conditionally.\nLet us further bear in mind that each of the foreign corporations now in question herein was created in a different country, conformably to the respective laws thereof, without, so far as we can see, any thought of coming into Canada. And again let us bear in mind that respondent has never attempted to do business in the United States. The incorporation of the Utah company no doubt used what had become an apt word to catch the ear of him desiring to be insured, and could hardly have dreamed of rivalling or invading any property of respondent. Moreover, the literature used by it in business does not suggest such a purpose, but the contrary purpose of avoiding the possible evil complained of.\nIt seems to me that the presentation of each of such foreign companies so created and named respectively, of a claim to be licensed in Canada, ought rather to be allowed to stand on the like footing and be considered from the like point of view on which the court (and if I might be permitted to say so a very capable court) proceeded in the case of Burgess v. Burgess[5], and which was followed by another strong court thirty\u2014six years later in Turton v. Turton[6].\nThe measure of prosperity that tempts a corporate creature to wander from its place of birth to do business in foreign lands surely has the like attendant inconveniences facing it when asked to change its name, as the son of his father might have to face in taking over the latter's business, if forced to abandon his name, and the like consideration, I submit, ought to be extended to it.\nIndeed, it may be competent for the Minister to deal with such a difficulty in a practical manner as the court did in the case of The Guardian Fire and Life Assur. Co. v. The Guardian & General Ins. Co.[7].\nMoreover, the names here in question are not identical, but if they had been the section in question might be held to constitute an imperative prohibition. In regard to the alternative of either bearing names liable to be confused with others, can either claim a licence?\nThere is no priority given by reason of seniority or otherwise in the section.\nNor is there anything else in the statute very helpful. These licences only last for a year and are renewable, but\nsubject, however, to any qualification or limitation which is considered expedient.\nWho is to determine the matter of expediency? Is it not the Minister? Can he not provide in such a case for a mark of distinction that will suffice. unless in the case of customers exceptionally stupid or unintelligent?\nAnd the mistake liable to occur from such causes would be reciprocal and the only inconvenience worth a moment's consideration would be from the competition created by adding another insurer, or two others, as one reads the section, to those already on the roll.\nThat is, of course, the real grievance, but it enures to the benefit of the public.\nThe monopolistic tendencies of commercial life increase with prosperity and courts as well as legislators should, I submit, be astute to see that when it is the administration of a great Department of State that is in question, as in truth it is herein, the specious and plausible resemblance, of its problems to be solved, to a decided case is not carried too far.\nI forbear expressing any decided opinion upon what the section of the statute may mean in several of these features I point out, beyond the decided opinion that no injunction should be granted in entire disregard of its consideration which has been avoided heretofore in the progress of the case. I have not overlooked the fact that the \"Companies Act\" in England contains a somewhat analogous section enabling the registrar to refuse in cases of conflict of names, and that courts have passed upon the result. One grave question, however, is that the relative positions of the Minister of Finance here and and Registrar of Companies there, are hardly the same, and in any event the section here in question clearly imposes a duty to discharge, possibly decisively, and the other merely enables, knowing that the court can rectify.\nCan the court here rectify? We know the court can advise if asked.\nThere may be another arguable side of the question of the Minister's power.\nIt was attempted, unsuccessfully, it is true, in Steele v. North Metropolitan Railway Co.[8], to enjoin the defendant from petitioning Parliament for relief. In dismissing the application Lord Chelmsford L.C. remarked that judges of great eminence had said the court had power to enjoin an application to Parliament but they had all declined to define the occasion which would justify such interference.\nOn the other hand, in The Queen v. The Registrar of Friendly Societies[9], the court, while declining to interfere with the ruling of a registrar, did not seem to doubt such a jurisdiction existed in a proper case. Grand Junction Waterworks Co. v. Hampton Urban District Council[10], was another of similar character not denying power, but only to be exercised in an extreme case. Another shade of opinion, as it were, arising out of a different set of circumstances, it is true, but in relation to the proper exercise of the power of injunction is there presented, when a specific remedy had been furnished by statute. The judgment of Stirling J. is well worth reading. It seems to furnish food for thought before resorting to an injunction in such a case as this where the Minister seems, impliedly at least, to have been given more power.\nMany of the cases cited by Stirling J. in his judgment should be well considered before interference in such a case as this.\nNorton v. Nichols[11], is one of the cases in which the question of letting plaintiff resort to an action at law instead of granting injunction is dealt with and is valuable as containing, though on an interlocutory motion, the expressions of opinion of eminent equity judges.\nI need not continue on the lines of thought I indicate. I am clear the judgment of the learned trial judge should not have been reversed and an injunction granted in light of the clear enactment existing when the judgment appealed from was pronounced.\nI think the appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the learned trial judge be restored with costs, but without prejudice to the rights of respondent, if any, as events develop, and if the purpose is continued on the part of the Utah company of applying for a Dominion licence.\nAt most the result should be.no higher than in the cases when application for injunction failed and the plaintiff was relegated to a court of law to claim damages.\nANGLIN J.\u2014 For the reasons stated by Mr. Justice Cassels I doubt whether this action is properly con- stituted in the absence of the Guardian Fire Insurance Company (of Utah). The purpose of the plaintiff is to restrain projected activities of this Utah company in British Columbia. It is, I think, quite clear that the defendant Matthew does not represent it for the purpose of this action. His capacity to sue and be sued on its behalf under the power of attorney in evidence would arise only upon the licence sought being granted. It is for the conduct in matters therein specified, of the affairs of the company when so licensed that the power of attorney is furnished as required by the statute. R.S.B.C. 1911, ch. 113, sec. 10 (g). If not a necessary party\u2014as I incline to think it was\u2014the Guardian Fire Insurance Company (of Utah) would certainly have been a proper party; and I think judicial discretion would have been soundly exercised by declining to entertain this action until it had been added as a defendant. Where the injunction sought will injuriously affect the rights of a person or body not before the court it will not ordinarily, and without special circumstances, be granted. Hartlepool Gas & Water Co. v. West Hartlepool Railway Co.[12]. I prefer, however, not to rest a judgment of dismissal of the action on this ground, but rather on another which a little more closely touches the merits of the issue, having regard to the nature of the relief sought\u2014an injunction quia timet.\nIn Attorney-General v. Corporation of Manchester [13], Chitty J. says:\u2014\nThe principle which I think may be properly ana safely extracted from the quia timet authorities is that the plaintiff must shew a strong case of probability that the apprehended mischief will in fact arise.\nWhatever ground the decision of the Judicial Committee[14] (see, however, Farmer's Mutual Hail Insurance Association v. Whittaker[15],) in regard to the validity of sec. 4 (et seq.) of the \"Dominion Insurance Act,\" 1910, ch. 32, may have given the present plaintiff to apprehend injury from the granting of a British Columbia licence to the Utah company, since the enactment of the new \"Dominion Insurance Act\" of 1917 (ch. 29, ss. 4-11) it seems abundantly clear that the granting of a provincial licence (assuming the legislation providing for it to be within the ambit of provincial legislative jurisdiction as defined in John Deere Plow Co. v. Wharton[16], would not enable the Utah company to solicit or transact any business in British Columbia, until it should obtain a licence from the Dominion authorities. So essential is the Dominion licence that without it the transaction of any business by the company is prohibited (7 & 8 Geo. V. (D.), ch. 29, sec. 11), and upon its being granted the right to a provincial licence or payment of the prescribed fee is indisputable (R.S.B.C. 1911, ch. 113, sec. 7). The granting of the British Columbia licence will, therefore, not entail the mischief to avoid which the desired injunction is sought.\nUnder these circumstances the British Columbia registrar might be well advised to refrain from granting the provincial licence until the applicant company has obtained its federal licence. Should the latter licence be refused, or should it be granted to the company under a different or modified name, as is not improbable, a British Columbia licence obtained under the present name might be entirely useless. But I know of no ground for holding that applications for both licences may not be made concurrently or that that for the provincial licence may not precede that for the Dominion licence. For aught that appears it was the Utah company's intention to apply for the necessary Domin-Dominion licence before undertaking to carry on business in British Columbia. It may already have done so. The defendant Matthew, in making the application complained of, has not done anything illegal.\nThe Dominion Act of 1917 was in force when this case was heard by the British Columbia Court of Appeal and should have been taken account of by that court. Since, therefore, in view of that legislation a British Columbia licence, if granted to the Utah company, would be impotent to enable it to transact any business to the prejudice of the plaintiff, I am, with respect, of the opinion that when this action came before the Court of Appeal a case for the granting of the injunction asked did not exist and that it should have been refused. Our statutory duty is to pronounce the judgment which that court should have rendered. Boulevard Heights v. Veilleux [17]. This ground suffices for the disposition of the appeal without considering the other questions dealt with at bar.\nI agree with my brother Cassels that the injunction should also be dissolved as to the defendant Garrett, although he did not appeal against it.\nBRODEUR J.\u2014 I concur in the opinion of the Chief Justice.\nCASSELS J.\u2014 An appeal from the Court of Appeal of British Columbia. The plaintiff, the Guardian Assurance Company, Limited, commenced this action by writ issued on the 27th March, 1917, and the case came on for trial before Mr. Justice Clement. Judgment was rendered on the 26th June, 1917, dismissing the action with costs to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant Matthew.\nThe plaintiff's statement of claim alleges that the plaintiff is a company duly authorised to carry on business in the Dominion of Canada. It alleges that a company called the Guardian Fire Insurance Company, incorporated in Utah, and with power (on obtaining a proper licence) to carry on business in British Columbia, had made application to the defendant Garrett for the issue of a licence under the \"British Columbia Fire Insurance Act.\"\nThe statement of claim further alleges that the Guardian Fire Insurance Company proposes and intends to carry on the business of fire insurance in the Province of British Columbia under the name of the Guardian Fire Insurance Company.\nThe statement of claim asks for an injunction to restrain the defendant Matthew, the agent of the Utah company, from making any application for the licensing of the Utah company and to restrain the defendant Garrett from issuing any licence.\nThe Utah company, namely, the Guardian Fire Insurance Company, were not made defendants to the action.\nIt will be noticed that there is no allegation in the statement of claim that the defendant Garrett intended to issue such a licence as had been applied for. The defendant Garrett filed no defence to the action.\nA mass of evidence was adduced at the trial, a considerable portion of which was inadmissible if the decisions of the House of Lords in trade\u2014mark cases are assumed to be binding upon our courts. For reasons which I give hereafter I do not see that the action could have been properly tried in the absence of the parties who were interested. The action having been dismissed, and, as I think, rightly dismissed by the trial judge, the question does not become one of very great moment were it not for the decision of the Court of Appeal now before this court.\nThe appeal before the Court of Appeal of British Columbia[18], was heard on the 16th and 19th days of November, 1917, and the order of the Court of Appeal bears date the 2nd April, 1918. The formal judgment of the 2nd April, 1918, is beyond what was evidently contemplated by the learned judges. It provides as follows:\u2014\nAnd this court doth further order and adjudge that the respondent Matthew be, and he is, hereby perpetually restrained from applying to the Superintendent of Insurance of the Province of British Columbia, and the respondent the Superintendent of Insurance be, and he is, hereby perpetually restrained from granting any application for the licensing under the \"British Columbia Fire Insurance Act\" of any company under the name of the Guardian Insurance Company or any other name likely to mislead or deceive the public into the belief that the company being licensed as aforesaid is the same as the Guardian Assurance Company, Limited.\nThis seems to me to be rather a sweeping injunction if the judgment were otherwise correct. It not merely restrains the Superintendent of Insurance from granting a licence to the Utah company, the company whose agent the defendant Matthew is, and a company as I have mentioned not a party to the action unless the action against Matthew, the agent, means an action against them, but it restrains the issuing of a licence to any other company that may apply whether the Utah company or not.\nThe defendant Garrett did not appear on the appeal and the judgment of the Court of Appeal orders and adjudges that the appellant's costs of the said action and of this appeal be taxed and paid by the respondent Matthew. The statute of British Columbia, the one in question, is ch. 113, of the Revised Statutes of British Columbia, 1911. It provides by section 4 as follows:\u2014\nNo company shall undertake or solicit, or agree or offer to undertake, any contract within the intent of section 2 of this Act, whether the contract be original or renewed, or accept or agree or negotiate for any premium or other consideration for the contract, or prosecute or maintain any action or proceeding in resepct of the contract, except such actions or proceedings as arise in winding up the affairs of the company, without in each such case having first obtained from the Superintendent and holding a licence under this Act.\nSection 6 provides as follows:\u2014\n6. So soon as a company applying for a licence has deposited with the Superintendent the security hereinafter mentioned, and has other\u2014wise conformed to the requirements of this Act, the Superintendent may issue the licence.\nBy section 10 it is provided that\nBefore the issue of a licence to a company other than a provincial company, such company shall file in the office of the Superintendent.\ncertain documents which are set out.\nSub-section (d) provides for filing:\u2014\nNotice of the place where the head office without the province is situate.\nSub-section (g) provides:\u2014\nA duly executed power of attorney under its common seal, empowering some person therein named and residing in the city or place where the head office of the company in the province is situate, verified in manner satisfactory to the Superintendent, to act as its attorney and to sue and be sued, plead or be impleaded, in any court, and generally on behalf of such company, and within the province, to accept service of process and to receive all lawful notices, and to do all acts and to execute all deeds and other instruments relating to the matters within the scope of the power of attorney and of the company to give to its attorney; provided that whenever the company has by power of attorney under the seal of the company appointed a general agent for Canada, and has thereby authorised such general agent to appoint other agents in the various provinces of Canada, then, after filing with the Superintendent a copy of said power duly certified by a notary public to be a true copy thereof, other powers of attorney executed by the said general agent for Canada, under his seal, in the presence of a witness, verified in manner satisfactory to the Superintendent, shall be deemed sufficiently executed by the company for all the purposes of this Act. Section 11 of the Act is as follows:\u2014\n11. Such power of attorney shall declare at what place in the province the chief agency, head office, or office of the attorney of the company is or is to be established, and shall expressly authorise the attorney to receive service of process in all actions, suits and proceedings against the company in the province in respect of any liabilities incurred by the company therein; and shall declare that service of process for or in respect of such liabilities thereat, or on the attorney, or any adult person in the employ of the company at the said office, shall be legal and binding on the company to all intents and purposes whatsoever.\nI do not think that, on the proper construction of this statute, it was sufficient to have made the defendant Matthew the sole party. He is constituted the agent of the company for the purposes set out in the Act, but that does not, to my mind, get rid of the necessity in an action of this nature of having the company before the court.\nIt has been argued that an injunction may be applied for against an agent of the company, and for this proposition, Kerr on Injunctions (5th ed., p. 377), and the case of Upmann v. Elkan[19], are cited. This case was an action based upon a trade mark, and against a fraudulent mark on cigars, viz., the trade mark of the plaintiff, a resident of Cuba. Even in that case it will be noticed that the consignees to whom the cigars were consigned were, on their names being disclosed, added as parties to the action.\nIn Bowstead's Laws of Agency (5th ed., pages 445 & 446) will be found a number of cases, the nearest of which is the case of Nireaha Tamaki v. Baker[20], but in that case it is expressly stated that the defendant was not the agent for the Crown.\nIn cases of tort the plaintiff can, of course, sue an agent who is a joint tort feasor, but that is not the case in question in this action. There is no suggestion of any fraud on the part of Matthew or in fact on the part of the Utah company.\nI fail to see by what process of reasoning an incorporated company with a status to carry on business can be restrained from applying for a licence; and I also fail to see how the registrar can be restrained from entertaining such an application. If he were of opinion that the licence should not be granted he would probably have refused it.\nThe case which seems to be greatly relied upon, viz., Hendriks v. Montague[21], is a case of a different character. In that case the company was not incorporated, and the facts were different.\nI think the remarks of Mr. Henderson K.C. in his argument before this court, that the facts in the Sun Life Case, viz., Saunders v. Sun Life Assur. Co. of Canada[22], are applicable and should be followed, are well founded. In that case the effect of Hendricks v. Montague[23], is discussed. The appellants in the Hendriks Case [24] were represented by Mr. Chitty Q.C. and Mr. H. W. Horn. Mr. Chitty, it is needless to remark, was an eminent counsel\u2014and on page 643 will be found his remarks as follows:\u2014\nThe Master of the Rolls was under a misapprehension in thinking that our motion was founded on the 20th section of the \"Companies Act,\" 1862. That is not the case. We only referred to the section as a statutory embodiment of the law on the subject. If we were applying under the Act, it would not be necessary to come to this court, as the registrar would take care of us.\nIt seems to me the case should have been left to the registrar to deal with, and I utterly fail to understand how jurisdiction can exist to restrain a company duly incorporated with power to carry on business in British Columbia from applying for a licence. On the question of suing an agent in place of the principal, reference is made to Archibald v. The King[25], recently decided by this court. This case does not, to my mind, maintain the proposition. That case proceeded upon the ground that the municipal council not having chosen to pass a by-law in regard to the issuance of a licence, the clerk was bound to issue the licence. The Chief Justice, at page 51, so treats it, Mr. Justice Idington, at page 52, and Mr. Justice Anglin, at page 53. It is no authority for the proposition that in a case of the nature of the one in appeal an agent can be sued alone.\nOn the question of what is necessary to prove in the so-called passing off cases, the case in the Privy Council of the Standard Ideal Co. v. The Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co.[26], may be looked at.\nI am of opinion that the appeal in this case should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored. Having come to this conclusion the case might rest there, but I think there is another reason why the Court of Appeal in British Columbia should not have granted the injunction.\nIn the case of the Boulevard Heights, Limited v. Veilleux[27], the question arose as to the effect of a curative statute on the right of the appellant. It is material in the case before us to keep in mind the dates.\nAs I have pointed out, the case was not argued in the Court of Appeal for British Columbia prior to the 16th November, 1917, and the order in appeal is dated the 2nd April, 1918. Between the date of the trial judgment and the hearing in appeal, the law affecting the rights of the Utah company was changed. This is by the \"Insurance Act\" (ch. 29 of 7 & 8 Geo. V.), which was assented to on the 20th September, 1917. In considering whether or not the court should not have taken cognizance of this statute, it will be seen that the facts in the Boulevard Heights Case[28] are dissimilar. At page 188 of the report, Mr. Justice Idington refers to the fact:\u2014\nThe Act was amended after judgment was given herein by the Court of Appeal, and the amendment, it is urged, does away with his right therein. Whatever might be said in the case of such an amendment as appears, enacted before the hearing in appeal, cannot, I think, help the appellant now.\nThat judgment was right when given. We can only give the judgment which the court below appealed from should have given. To go further would be to exceed our jurisdiction.\nMr. Justice Duff, at pages 191 and 192, quoting Quilter v. Mapleson[29] puts it as follows:\u2014\nIf we are governed by these amendments in the decision of this appeal, then the respondent must fail in so far as his case rests upon the illegality of the agreement of sale.\nThere can be no doubt, I think, that if these amendments had been enacted before the hearing of the appeal by the Appellate Division of Alberta, that court would have been governed by them in the disposition of the appeal.\nMr. Justice Anglin, at page 193, puts it:\u2014\nThe amending statute of 1915, although made applicable to pending litigation, is not declaratory of the law as it stood at the time of the contract in question or at any subsequent period anterior to its enactment. It became law only after the judgment of the Appellate Division in this case had been delivered. This court is bound by statute to render the judgment which the court appealed from should have given\u2014of course upon the law as it was when that court delivered judgment, etc.\nMr. Justice Brodeur, at page 196, states:\u2014\nAt the time the court below was considering this case, the statute now invoked had not been passed. It could not be then acted upon by that court. Our duty is to render the judgment which the court below should have rendered. In this case, as I have stated, the \"Dominion Insurance Act\" came into force prior to the hearing of the appeal in British Columbia.\nIn the case of Attorney-General for the Dominion of Canada v. Attorney General of Alberta[30], which was decided by the Board of the Privy Council, Lord Haldane, who delivered the judgment of the Board, states:\u2014\nThe second question is, in substance, whether the Dominion Parliament has jurisdiction to require a foreign company to take out a licence from the Dominion Minister, even in a case where the company desires to carry on its business only within the limits of a single province. To this question their Lordships' reply is that in such a case it would be within the power of the Parliament of Canada, by properly framed legislation, to impose such a restriction. It appears to them that such a power is given by the heads in s. 91, which refer to the regulation of trade and commerce and to aliens.\nThe Dominion statute relating to insurance referred to, namely, ch. 29, 7 & 8 Geo. V., was enacted, and by the interpretation \"Minister\" means the Minister of Finance. \"Company\" includes any foreign company for the purpose of carrying on the business of insurance. \"Foreign company\" means a company incorporated under the laws of any foreign country for the purpose of carrying on the business of insurance, and having the faculty or capacity under its Act or other instrument of incorporation to carry on such business throughout Canada.\nBy the admissions in the present case the Utah company has power to carry on business in British Columbia, and I think that it should be assumed that they also have the faculty or capacity to carry on business throughout Canada.\nBy the statute, section 4, it is provided that it\nshall be competent to the Minister to grant to any company which shall have complied with the requirements of this Act preliminary to the granting of a licence, a licence authorising the company to carry on its business of insurance on any specified part thereof, subject to the provisions of this Act and to the terms of the licence.\nSub-sec. (b) provides that\nin the case of any other company, throughout Canada or in any part of Canada, comprising more than one province which may be specified in the licence.\nSection 6 provides:\u2014\nBefore issuing a licence to a company, the Minister must be satisfied that the corporate name of the company is not that of any other known company incorporated or unincorporated, or any name liable to be confounded therewith or otherwise on public grounds objectionable.\nThere is a prohibition preventing a company doing business without this licence. Section 11 legislates as to this.\nThe effect of the licence is provided for by sub-sec. 2 of sec. 4, which reads as follows:\u2014\n2. Any company other than a Canadian company which may obtain from the Minister a licence or a renewal of a licence shall thereupon and thereby become and be deemed to be a company incorporated under the laws of Canada with power to carry on throughout Canada, or in such part or parts of Canada as may be specified in the licence, the various branches or kinds of insurance which the licence may authorise.\nThis is a wide provision.\nAt the time the appeal was taken to the Court of Appeal in British Columbia the Utah company had not obtained a licence under the British Columbia Act. The licence has to be obtained from the Dominion. Had the Minister of Finance issued the licence no legislation in British Columbia preventing them from carrying on business would have been valid. See John Deere Plough Case[31].\nIt seems to me that the Court of Appeal should have been guided by the fact that when the appeal was heard the law was changed. The requirement on the part of the Utah company to obtain a licence from the registrar in British Columbia ceased to exist. The forum to determine the question whether a licence should be granted or not was the Minister of Finance for the Dominion, and I fail to see what jurisdiction the courts would have for interfering with the express statutory power which is given to him to grant or refuse.\nI think the appeal should be allowed with costs, payable to the defendant Matthew by the plaintiff and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nThe defendant Garrett did not appear on the appeal, and a curious result would happen if the judgment were held to be in force as against him, while the decision of the court is that the action should be dismissed on the grounds stated. The nearest authority I can find is Smith v. Cropper[32], in which a case of an analogous character came up before the House of Lords. It was a patent action. The patent had been declared valid. One or other of the defendants failed to appeal. The appellants succeeded and the patent was declared void. The Lords decided that it would be an anomaly to have a judgment declaring the patent valid as against one defendant, and invalid against the other defendant, and the rest of the world.\nI think, in this case, the judgment of the Appellate Court must be set aside in toto both as regards Matthew and Garrett.\nGarrett is not entitled to costs as he did not appear in the Court of Appeal or in this court.\nAppeal allowed without costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Cameron & Cameron.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Bodwell & Lawson.\n[1] 40 D.L.R. 455; [1918] 2 W.W.R. 405, sub.nom.

It was stipulated that \"the value of this contract\" would \"be from $25,000 to $35,000,\" and that \"our shipping instructions, invoicing instructions, etc., given on July 10th, 1915,\" would \"hold good.\" The letter of July 10th, 1915, contained an express reference to a standard drill price list, in use by the whole drill trade of North America.\nHeld, that the respondent had the right to establish by parol evidence that the discount mentioned in his letter meant, according to the usage of trade, discount off the standard drill prices and so to prove that the contract in writing contained all essential terms.\nHeld also, that, according to the terms of the agreement, the respondent was bound to purchase goods to an amount of $25,000, with the right to order an additional amount of $10,000 which the appellant could not refuse to supply, the option being entirely with the respondent.\nPer Davies C.J. and Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\u2014The written agreement between the parties was intended not to be a mere option revocable until acted upon, but an actual agreement entailing mutual obligations.\nPer Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\u2014While the proof of a contract, within Art. 1235 C.C, must as a matter of procedure be made according to the lex fori, its validity depends upon the lex loci contractus.\nPer Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\u2014The laws of the Province of Ontario and those of the Province of Quebec as to the requirement of writing in the case of contracts such as in this case differ in their effect. Per Anglin, Brodeur and Mignault JJ.\u2014The Supreme Court takes judicial notice of the statutory or other laws prevailing in Provinces of Canada other than that in which the action or proceeding under appeal to it has been instituted. Logan v. Lee, (39 Can. S.C.R. 311), followed.\nJudgment of the Court of Review [Q.R. 54 S.C. 208], affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec, sitting in review at Montreal[1], affirming the judgment of the trial court and maintaining the plaintiff's action with costs.\nThe material facts of the case are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nW. N. Tilley K.C. for the appellant.\nEug. Lafleur K.C. and Weldon for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice.\u2014This action was one brought in the Superior Court of the Province of Quebec by the plaintiff, respondent, Francis Hankin, against the defendant, appellant, to recover damages alleged to have been sustained by him owing to the refusal of the defendant to carry out an alleged contract made by him with plaintiff to manufacture and deliver to plaintiff a stipulated quantity of \"twist drills of cast steel.\"\nThe Superior Court sustained the plaintiff's action and awarded the plaintiff $10,032.31 as damages, which judgment was confirmed \"in all things\" by the Court of Review and from which latter judgment this appeal is taken.\nFrom the evidence at the trial, it appeared that the appellant, defendant, issued to the trade periodically a catalogue accompanied by a standard twist drill price list which is a list in use by all manufacturers of twist drills in the United States and Canada. On this list the gross prices remain unchanged from year to year. As net prices are constantly fluctuating, they are quoted by way of discounts of greater or less amount from these standard gross prices. This manner of quoting, the plaintiff contended and the trial judge found, was well established in the trade so that dealers, when buying or selling, quote merely the kinds or sizes of the drills referred to and the rate or rates of discount which is understood as referring to the standard list and thus establish the prices agreed on.\nPlaintiff, through his manager Hill, had, several times before the contract in question here, entered into contracts with defendant for the purchase of drills, the negotiations being made \"and concluded either with Coulter, the president, or with Horton, who styled himself variously as \"assistant to the president\" or the \"manager,\" or as \"acting for the president.\"\nOne of these earlier contracts was still in force and partially completed in August, 1915, when the contract now in question was made.\nOn August 21st, 1915, plaintiff's manager, Mr. Hill, went to Ingersoll and entered into negotiations with Mr. Horton for the purchase of cast steel twist drills of the net value of from $25,000 to $35,000. The negotiations were closed at the same meeting and a written contract was at once prepared in the form of a letter from plaintiff to defendant signed by Mr. Hill for plaintiff, marked \"accepted\" at the foot and signed by the defendant company per Mr. Horton. This contract is the basis of plaintiff's suit and is in the following terms:\u2014\nIngersoll, Ontario, Aug. 21, 1915.\nThe John Morrow Screw & Nut Coy. Ltd.\nIngersoll, Ont.\nGentlemen:\nAs per my conversation with your Mr. Horton this morning you will enter our contract as follows: Best quality Cast Steel Twist Drills, neither Drills, Packages or Cases to bear any other mark excepting size.\nThe value of this contract to be from twenty-five thousand ($25,000) to thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000) net.

Montreal.\nTerms of Payment\u2014Spot cash against invoice with original Inland Bill of Lading attached.\nOur Shipping instructions, Invoicing instructions, &c., given on July 10th, 1915, to hold good unless modified by us later.\nYours truly,\nFrancis Hankin & Co.\nPer A. H. Hill.\nAccepted\nJohn Morrow Screw & Nut Co. Limited,\nHorton,\nFor President and Manager.\nThe letter of July 10th, 1915, referred to at the close of the above letter or contract, embodied the terms of one of the earlier contracts between the parties for the purchase and sale of drills and contained with the shipping and invoicing instructions an express reference to the standard twist drill price list on which all discounts are placed.\nAfter plaintiff sent in his first order or specifications within the stipulated three weeks, defendant began expressing its fears that it would not be able to \"live up\" to the contract and asking plaintiff to consent to cancel it, which plaintiff refused to do, whereupon, defendant, by its letter of October 15th, formally declared it would not carry the contract out.\nPlaintiff thereupon invited tenders from other manufacturers, for the same quantities and kinds of drills, and eventually closed a contract with the Cleveland Twist Drill Company for the kinds and quantities the defendant had undertaken to supply. The defendant was kept advised of the calls for tenders and of the Cleveland company's quotations and . was formally put in default again by the plaintiff before closing with this latter company.\nThe amount paid by plaintiff to the Cleveland company for the kind and quantity of drills the plaintiff had contracted to supply was $10,032.31 above that which the contract, if binding, with the defendant provided for and this amount is the damages claimed by him and adjudged by the court.\nMr. Tilley for the appellant contended first that the alleged contract was an offer or option merely and was withdrawn, but I really do not think that such a construction is at all reasonable if it is once held that the contract is in other respects valid.\nHe further submitted that Horton had no authority to enter into the contract, but I am also of opinion that under the evidence there is no reasonable doubt of his authority to do so. It may be observed that Horton himself was not called as a witness and the only evidence given on defendant's part was that of the president himself which fell far short in the face of the proved facts of shewing want of authority on Horton's part. I think it clearly shewed that the company always recognized Horton, at any rate in the president's absence, and held him out as having full authority to transact such business as was involved in the entering into of such contracts as the one in question.\nThere remained his main contention that the contract was one required by the Statute of Frauds to be in writing and that oral evidence of the bargain to supply what was wanting in the written instrument could not be given. Both parties, he said, agreed that there was no substantial difference between the law of Quebec and that of Ontario on the subject. The \"prices\" to be paid under the alleged contract were not stated in it nor was there any reference in it to the \"standard list of prices\" from which the prices of each class of articles stipulated for in the contract could be ascertained.\nBut I do not think such absence is necessarily fatal provided it can be supplied either by another document to which direct reference is made in the contract so that the two can be read together and so constitute a complete memorandum, or in the absence of direct reference in one to the other, if the two documents can be connected together by reasonable inference.\nIn the case of Doran v. McKinnon[2], I had to examine fully the authorities on the point and to express my conclusion from them and it was as above stated.\nApplying this rule to the case before us we have the following facts proved: That in the twist drill trade there is only one price list on the whole North American continent; when either buyers or sellers quote discounts on drills in their orders or acceptances of orders, they have this price list in their minds and both parties understand that, when they refer to discounts on prices, they mean discounts on the gross prices given in the standard drill price list\u2014necessarily in use by all manufacturers of twist drills and all dealers in the same. This is made abundantly clear by this uncontradicted evidence of Mr. Hill.\nThe discounts quoted in the contract above set out manifestly refer to some amounts or prices. The letter of July 10th, 1915, referred to in the last paragraph of the contract, does mention the standard list along with the prices on which the discounts were to be made. The result is that the standard list of prices from which the discounts mentioned in the contract are to be deducted should and must be connected together by reasonable inference as having necessarily been in the mind of both parties to the contract when entered into and could not possibly have reference to anything else and that being so it is sufficient under the authorities to satisfy the statute.\nAs to the contention with respect to the meaning of the words \"inch sizes\" which I remark were not \"inch size\" merely, I think in the connection in which they were used they were trade terms known and well understood in and by the trade and that the weight of testimony as to their meaning was strongly in favour of the contention that \"inch sizes\" included drills in fractions of an inch or more than an inch. In the respondent's factum it is stated and was not challenged on the argument that\nof the three kinds of drills described in the contract as of \"inch sizes\" the first two were known as jobbers drills.\nThe price list shews and Mr. Young, a witness called by appellant, swore that jobbers drills were only listed in \"fractional\" sizes and run up to only half an inch in diameter. If, therefore, appellant's interpretation of the meaning of the term is the correct one he was offering and agreeing to sell jobbers drills of one inch in diameter, a thing which it did not manufacture and which did not exist in the trade.\nIt must be remembered that this objection was never raised until the trial, when the defendant applied to amend his plea so as to cover it. I think the learned trial judge correctly found the trade usage of the words to be that they covered fractional sizes. Mr. Tilley contended with respect to the damages that in any event they could only be estimated on the failure of the defendant to deliver the $25,000 value of the goods up to which the plaintiff bound himself to order; and did not cover the other ten thousand in value which was only an option given to the plaintiff; a minimum and a maximum figure was stated. The plaintiff was bound to order $25,000. He had the right to order another $10,000, but there was no right on the vendor's part to refuse to supply the $35,000 value if ordered, the option was one entirely with the purchaser.\nThe defendant repudiated the contract absolutely on the 16th October and in a letter of that date suggested that plaintiff purchase the drills\" in the United States. The plaintiff replied on the 19th saying that in order to protect his interests he would proceed to purchase the drills elsewhere, charging the difference to defendant.\nHe called for tenders for from $25,000 to $35,000 in value of drills and notified the defendant of the result of the tenders in letter of 27th October.\nLater, on 16th November, he again wrote defendant as follows:\u2014\nIn reference to our letter of 27th October, we find that in covering for only $25,000 to $35,000 of drills with Cleveland Twist Drill Company, on account of the increased price which we have had to pay this will not enable us to purchase the same quantity of drills as would be the case against your contract. We have therefore covered for an extra ten thousand to fifteen thousand and desire you to be notified of the fact.\nIn other words, plaintiff substantially notified the defendant that he had exercised his option up to the $35,000 and that as the defendant had definitely and absolutely repudiated the contract he would go into the market and purchase up to that figure for the best price he could and hold the defendant responsible for any loss he would sustain. Under these circumstances I think the assessment of the plaintiff's damages was made on a correct basis and the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nIdington J.\u2014When the terms used in the alleged contract have been, as they were, duly and correctly interpreted, we ought, I submit, to find it quite intelligible and answering all the requirements of the Statute of Frauds.\nBut if it is attempted to so extend that as to incorporate something which is not obviously intended to be incorporated therewith, a difficulty arises in the way of him making the attempt, but not in our finding a contract.\nThere is a contracting letter of a date anterior to this contract which is referred to in the last sentence thereof. So far as same can, clearly and reasonably, be held to have been indicated thereby as the subject of incorporation, I see no difficulty in doing so. I refer to the \"shipping instructions,\" \"invoicing instructions,\" &c.\nThe \"&c.\", may, not unreasonably, be taken to mean the like kind of terms and thereby include the sentence in the letter referred to, and that falling therein under the heading \"Re invoicing\" \"Drills to be billed at 80, 10, 3\u00bd of your standard lists,\" and thus make clear that it was the appellant's standard lists of all sorts of inch sizes whether single or multiples or fractions thereof, which were had in view in contracting.\nWhen that is done appellant says confusion is produced thereby of such a nature that you cannot find a definite contract, or at least one such as necessary to find in order to cover or lay a foundation for assessing a great part of the damages in question.\nThe sizes of the drills named in the contract falling under the phrase \"inch sizes\" being of doubtful import led to the introduction of evidence of experts and I cannot say there is error in doing so or in that accepted by the learned trial judge. Indeed, if that evidence is admissible, which did not seem to be seriously questioned, I should say it is quite unnecessary to raise such issues as started upon the question of inch sizes unless to lead the court into the wilderness of confusion and succeed thereby.\nFor my own part I incline to think that the question so raised is of no consequence when we find in law that the measure of damages is the difference between the price or prices agreed upon and the market price at the time when the buyer was entitled to get delivery, and that seems to have been the same proportionate rise, or so nearly the same, in all the classes of tools in question, that the result of the breach of contract would be the same if measured by any selection the respondent saw fit to make.\nIt is not his buying or bargain that is the measure of damages, though that may be some evidence of market price and in some circumstances he may be bound to avert or minimize loss.\nHis power of selection under such a contract as this of course gives, or is liable to give, rise to confusion of thought, and had there been in fact a substantial deviation of the percentage of rise in the respective market values of the different classes of goods in the list from which the respondent was entitled to select, a difficult question might have arisen. But in regard to drills up to an inch and a half sizes at least, there would seem to have been no difference of percentage of rise in any class and respondent bought quite enough below that margin to fulfil his right to damages on the $35,000 limit of his bargain, without coming into the field of variation of percentages of rise and thus is eliminated any question turning upon the multiple of inches.\nThere was a contract definitely binding respondent to buy at least up to $25,000 worth, and the appellant to sell not only that much but also up to $35,000 worth if respondent should so select.\nIt seems at first blush that it is unfair to have the seller bound to such an extent when the buyer is not.\nIf the market accidentally goes one way there is a possibility of the one party to a contract suffering thereby, having to bear a heavier load than the other party might have to bear in case of the market going the other way.\nThat, however, is the result which the parties agreed to observe and in the light of which they must be held to have deliberately bargained to meet the consequences. The vendor in consideration of a supposed certainty of anticipated profit, coupled with a wider profitable possibility, saw fit to bind itself and so end all question.\nThere are numerous cases to be found in Blackburn on Sales, at pages 236-244, illustrating incidentally the law on the subject.\nAs to the alleged want of authority on the part of Horton, I should have hardly thought it arguable in light of all that had transpired between the parties thereto before and after the making of the alleged contract so clearly recognizing his ostensible authority.\nThe questions of a contract, and of the measure of damages being . determined against the appellant, there seems, therefore, no alternative but a dismissal of the appeal with costs.\nAnglin J.\u2014The defendants appeal from a judgment of the Court of Review affirming a judgment of the Superior Court holding them liable in damages to the extent of $10,032.31 for breach of contract. The grounds of appeal are that the alleged contract was not such in fact but a mere revocable option; that it was not \"good\" because of the omission from the writing evidencing it of the element of prices; that, although the plaintiff is claiming damages for failure to supply goods of sizes of fractional parts of an inch, \"inch sizes\" only are specified in the letter of August 21st, and they do not include sizes of fractional parts of an inch, and the price list relied upon and put in evidence contains no prices for sizes of an inch or multiple thereof; and that the agent of the defendants, who signed the document relied on, exceeded his authority.\nUpon the whole evidence I have no doubt that the plaintiff's letter of the 21st of August, 1915, with the defendant's acceptance upon it, was intended by the parties not to be a mere option revocable until acted upon, but to be an actual agreement entailing mutual obligations. Those obligations were that the plaintiff on the one hand would order not less than $25,000 worth of goods of the descriptions therein set forth and that the defendants on the other would supply goods so to be ordered, up to, but not exceeding, the value of $35,000. The plaintiff was to send in specifications of the quantities of each of the classes of goods set forth that he might require in sufficient time to enable the defendants\nto ship the whole lot before the end of March, 1916.\nThe prices, subject to the discounts specified, were to be those stated in the \"standard drill price list,\" which the evidence shews is used by the whole drill trade of North America. The consideration for the defendants assuming an obligation to furnish such drills as might be ordered, within the limits specified, was the plaintiff's undertaking to order, within a period capable of ascertainment, at least $25,000 worth of such drills.\nI have so far dealt with the case apart from any difficulty presented by the 17th section of the Statute of Frauds. While the proof of a contract within Art. 1235, C.C. must as a matter of procedure be made according to the lex fori, its validity depends upon the lex loci contractus, which in this case is Ontario. Mr. Tilley's contention that the laws of Ontario and Quebec in regard to the requirement of writing in the case of contracts such as that under consideration are the same in effect is not quite correct, although article 1235 C.C. is no doubt founded on the Statute of Frauds. Munn v. Berger[3]. Under the 17th section of the Statute of Frauds, an absence of the prescribed memorandum, if it does not affect the validity of the contract itself (Leroux v. Brown[4]), presents the . same obstacle to the enforcement of it by action as arises under the 4th section. Maddison v. Alderson[5]. Under article 1235 C.C., the question would appear to be purely one of evidence and the Quebec courts, quite logically, do not require a defendant to plead a mere absence of evidence which the law obliges the plaintiff to supply. He may ore tenus object to the admissibility of parol evidence when offered by the plaintiff. Article 110 of the Code of Civil Procedure is not regarded as applicable. English and Ontario practice is to the contrary. English Rule 211, o. 19, r. 15; Ont. Con. Rule (1915) No. 143.\nAnother difference is suggested by decisions of the Quebec courts (as to the soundness of which it is of course quite unnecessary now to express an opinion), that an admission of the contract by the defendant either in his pleadings or in giving evidence will satisfy article 1235 C.C. Guay v. Guay[6].\nA judicial admission is complete proof against the party making it.\nArticle 1245 C.C. See too Sheppard v. Perry[7].\nA plaintiff, in an English or Ontario court, cannot avail himself of a like admission against a defendant who sets up the statute as a defence. Lucas v. Dixon[8]. Still another difference arises from the use of the words \"accepted or received\" in article 1235 C.C., in lieu of the words of section 17 of the English statute: \"Accept * * * and actually receive.\" Mr. Justice Fournier discusses this important departure in Munn v. Berger[9].\nBut a defence of invalidity according to foreign law must be pleaded under each system alike (Lafleur, Conflict of Laws, 23). Here the only plea is that their acceptance of the plaintiff's letter of the 21st of August, directing the booking of his contract in the terms therein stated, does not by the law of Ontario constitute a valid contract enforceable against the defendants. Two professional gentlemen called as expert witnesses for the defence based their opinions that the contract was invalid under Ontario law\u2014or rather that there was no contract\u2014solely upon absence of mutuality of obligation. They regarded the document sued upon as a mere option. They were neither asked for, nor did they give, evidence as to the 17th section of the Statute of Frauds. The professional gentleman called by the plaintiff in rebuttal upheld the contrary view. Merely incidentally he said on cross-examination:\u2014\nA contract for the sale of goods does not require to be in writing. It can be oral. (No doubt he meant, in cases within the 17th section of the statute, if it be not pleaded or if its alternative requirements be fulfilled.) He added that the element of price missing from the letter in question was sufficiently supplied by implied reference and by the evidence explanatory of the meaning of the discounts stated, which was received subject only to an objection based neither on the requirements of the Statute of Frauds nor on those of article. 1235 C.C. There was no attempt to meet this evidence by calling testimony in sur-rebuttal. The learned trial judge apparently did not regard the validity of the contract under the 17th section of the Statute of Frauds as being an issue. He treated the omission of direct reference to the standard price list from the letter as raising an issue of contract or no contract independently of and apart from any question as to the sufficiency of the written evidence, and he found upon it, in my opinion quite rightly, against the defendants. He makes no allusion to the sufficiency or insufficiency of the letter of August 21st to satisfy the 17th section of the Statute of Frauds; nor is that question touched upon in the judgment of the Court of Review.\nYet in this court counsel for the appellants chiefly relied upon the absence of a reference to the standard drill price list in the letter of August 21st as affording his clients a defence under the 17th section of the Statute of Frauds. Without so deciding I shall assume that that defence was sufficiently pleaded to meet the requirements of Quebec procedure, although, in Ontario, it would be clearly otherwise, and, since counsel for the plaintiff did not object, I shall also assume that it is open to the appellants to invoke this defence in this court notwithstanding the apparent failure to do so at the trial.' Upon the evidence before it, the Superior Court, being bound to treat the construction and effect of the 17th section of the Statute of Frauds as a matter of fact to be established by evidence, could not have done otherwise than hold that its requirements had been satisfied. Mr. Hamilton Cassels so deposed and his testimony remained uncontradicted. The same is true of the Court of Review. See cases collected in Beauchamp, Rep. de Jur. Can., vol. 2, col; 2067, Nos. 326-7. Although we are required to render the judgment which the court appealed from should have rendered (\"Supreme Court Act,\" section 51), it is the settled jurisprudence of this court that it\nis bound to follow the rule laid down by the House of Lords in the case of Cooper v. Cooper[10], in 1888, and to take judicial notice of the statutory or other laws prevailing in every province and territory in Canada, suo motu, even in cases where such statutes or laws may not have been proved in evidence in the courts below and although it might happen that the views as to what the law might be as entertained by members of the court might be in absolute contradiction of any evidence upon those points adduced in the courts below.\nLogan v. Lee[11]. This view was tacitly acted upon in Garland v. O'Reilly[12]. This conception of the functions of this court as \"an appellate tribunal for the whole Dominion\" is in harmony with the Imperial Act of 1859, 22 & 23 Vict. ch. 63, noted by Mr. Lafleur at page 34 of his work. See too Bremer v. Freeman[13].\nIt was in my opinion open to the plaintiff to establish by parol evidence, as he did, that the discounts stated in his letters of the 21st of August (meaningless in themselves) according to the usage of the trade meant and could only mean discounts off the standard drill prices according to the list in common use throughout North America and that both the parties must have so understood. The case seems to me to fall clearly within the principle of the decision in Spicer v. Cooper[14], where parol evidence was held admissible to shew that a sale of fourteen pockets of Kent Hops at 100s. meant at 100s. per cwt. according to the usage of the hop trade.\nIn Newell v. Radford[15], Bovill C.J. says, at p. 54:\u2014\nIt has always been held that you may prove what the parties would have understood to be the meaning of the words used in the memorandum and that for this purpose parol evidence of the surrounding circumstances is admissible.\nByles J. says at p. 55:\u2014\nEvidence has been held admissible to settle the meaning of the price or of the quantity of goods sold mentioned in the memorandum.\nIn Macdonald v. Longbottom[16], parol evidence was admitted to shew that \"your\" wool meant wool which the plaintiff had purchased as well as wool clipped from his own sheep. In Hutchison v. Bowker[17], Parke B. says:\u2014\nIf there are peculiar expressions used in a contract which have, in particular places or trades, known meanings attached to them, it is for the jury to say what the meaning of these expressions was.\nOf course the jury must act on evidence. Alexander v. Vanderzee[18], Ashforth v. Redford[19]. See also cases collected in Benjamin on Sales, 5th ed., p. 236. In Blackburn on Sales, 3rd ed., the rule is thus stated at p. 51:\u2014\nThe general rule seems to be, that all the facts are admissible which tend to shew the sense the words bear with reference to the surrounding circumstances concerning which the words were used, but that such facts as only tend to shew that the writer intended to use words bearing a particular sense are to be rejected.\nSee too Addison on Contracts (11th ed.), pp. 69 & 70. I prefer to rest my conclusion that the letter of August 21st sufficiently stated the terms of the contract between the parties in regard to prices on this ground rather than on any other implied reference in it to the standard drill price list, which I consider dubious, to say the least.\nUpon the weight of evidence I am convinced that \"inch sizes\" mentioned in the contract include fractions as well as multiples of an inch\u2014just as \"millimeter sizes\" admittedly include fractions of a millimeter.\nI have no doubt that the contract in question was within the ostensible, if not within the actual, authority of the defendant's assistant manager, Horton.\nThe question of damages presents some difficulty owing to the non-specification of definite quantities in the contract. But id cerium est quod certum reddi potest. The plaintiff has established that, but for the defendant's repudiation, he would in due course have specified under his contract with them the drills which he ordered in the American market. The orders in respect of which loss is claimed do not exceed the $35,000 limit placed by the contract upon the defendant's obligation. The evidence disclosed that the plaintiff took reasonable steps to minimize his loss. I find no ground for disturbing the assessment of damages.\nThe appeal, in my opinion, fails and must be dismissed with costs.\nBrodeur J.\u2014I had prepared some notes with regard to this case but I find, after having read the opinion of my brother Anglin, that our views coincide. I would be then of opinion that the appeal should be dismissed for the reasons given by my brother Anglin. Mignault J.\u2014I have read the opinion of my brother Anglin and I concur in his reasons for the dismissal of the appeal.\nThe parties undoubtedly looked upon the letter of the 21st August, 1915, written by the respondent and accepted by the appellant, as forming a contract, and, in its letters seeking to be relieved from the obligations it had assumed, the appellant treated it as such. The opinion of the learned trial judge, not printed in the case, but filed at the hearing before this court, as well as a careful examination of the record, have convinced me that the grounds urged by Mr. Tilley in his argument before us were not contended for in the court below. It is true that learned counsel of the Ontario Bar were called by the appellant at the trial to support its plea that,\nby the law of Ontario, even if the said letter had been accepted by the appellant, the same does not constitute a valid contract enforceable against the defendant.\nBut the learned counsel based their opinion on what they considered a lack of mutuality, while admitting that if, subsequently to the letter, the respondent had specified certain goods, before there had been any revocation, there would have been a contract \"pro tanto.\" I must, with deference, think that the objection of lack of mutuality was not well taken. Assuming that the respondent had the right, and had not in any manner lost this right, to specify the goods which the appellant had agreed to supply on specification, I fail to see how the latter could escape from its obligation to supply the goods by repudiating the whole contract before any specification had been made.\nI also do not think that the letter of August 21st can be regarded as imposing no obligation on the respondent to take any goods. Properly construed, it obliged him to purchase at least $25,000 worth of cast steel twist drills, with the right to take more up to $35,000. This, if accepted by the seller, would be a valid contract. The question whether any property passed is immaterial, for the contract would be valid even if the goods did not exist but had to be manufactured at a future date.\nThe objections of Mr. Tilley were very ably urged, but they appeared to me somewhat technical. Undoubtedly an order could be made subject to a standard price list, and I think that this was done in the present case. Of course, it is essential that a price be sufficiently agreed upon to constitute a valid contract of sale, but if, construing the contract according to the usages of trade, the prices were to be those determined by a standard price list in use in this trade, and were so understood by the parties, and if, moreover, as the evidence shews, the list of discounts mentioned in the letter, according to the common understanding of persons dealing in these articles, determined the price to be paid, I cannot believe that the element of price was absent in the agreement made by the parties. The appellant, in its letters to the respondent, never claimed that the contract was not understandable, but merely pleaded its inability to complete deliveries within the time fixed. The contention now made that the contract is meaningless seems in every way an afterthought.\nI am clearly of opinion that the appellant cannot challenge the authority of Mr. Horton, who accepted the letter \"for president and manager.\" The contract was not an unusual one, and this defence of lack of authority merely impresses me as shewing the anxiety of the appellant to escape from a contract which it repented having made. The effect of article 1235 of the Quebec Civil Code, on which Mr. Tilley relied, is well demonstrated by my brother Anglin. The whole question under this article is one of proof and not of validity of contract. My brother Anglin has also dealt with the effect of the Statute of Frauds under the Ontario law and I feel I can add nothing to his discussion of this question.\nPerhaps I might add that, as the question came before the Superior Court, art. 1235 C.C. would have stood clearly in way of the respondent had he not produced a writing sufficient, under the terms of that article, to prove the contract alleged by him. I do not care to lay down any general rule on the question whether the proof of a foreign contract is, as a matter of procedure, governed by the lex fori, or by the lex loci contractus. But I do think that such a provision as article 1235 is one which a Quebec court must follow when it is sought to make evidence of any of the matters mentioned by it, quite irrespective of the locality where the contract, warranty, promise or acknowledgment was made. In this sense, and I do not wish to be understood as otherwise dealing with the subject of conflict of laws, the lex fori prevails over the lex loci contractus.\nMr. Tilley also relied on the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of Reg. v. Demers[20]. In my opinion, this decision is clearly distinguishable from the one appealed from. Demers had undertaken to print certain public documents at certain specified rates. The contract imposed no obligation on the Crown to pay Demers for work not given him for execution, nor was there anything in the contract binding the Government to give him all or any of the printing work referred to in the agreement, the Government being free to give the whole work, or such part as it might see fit, to any other printer. Their Lordships did not hold the contract invalid, as is contended in the present case; on the contrary, they were of the opinion that for all work given to Demers on the footing of the contract the Government was undoubtedly bound to pay according to the agreed tariff, but they dismissed the claim made by Demers for damages because no printing work had been given him after a certain date.\nIn the present case the agreement of the parties properly construed was for the sale of certain goods to be specified by the respondent, the latter, in my opinion, being bound to take goods up to the amount of at least $25,000 with the right to order an additional amount of $10,000. The contract mentioned that the specifications were to commence about three weeks from its date and that shipment of the whole lot was to be made before the end of March, 1906. I cannot agree with the contention that there was not here a valid contract binding on both parties according to its terms.\nOn the whole, my opinion is that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Atwater, Surveyer & Bond.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Weldon & Harris.\n[1] Q.R. 54 S.C. 208.\n[2] 53 Can.

Some years later, the appellant took an action to set aside the deed as null and void.\nHeld that the deed of transfer was really one of gratuitous donation.\nHeld, also, Davies C.J. and Brodeur J. dissenting, that the donation, being made to the wife herself and accepted by her alone, without marital authorization never had any legal existence and the sum given did not fall into the community. The donation could not be treated as made to the community, which is not a juridical person apart from the persons of the two spouses, and the wife therefore could not be deemed to have acted as mandatary of her husband, head of the community.\nPer Anglin J.\u2014The requirement of the law, in the Province of Quebec, that an instrument should be in authentic form does not import that the authority of an agent to execute it must be evidenced in the same manner.\nPer Davies C.J., Anglin and Brodeur JJ.\u2014The proof of a mandate, made by parol testimony at the trial without objection, cannot subsequently be set aside in a court of appeal.

(dissenting)\u2014A donation made to a wife common as to property can be accepted by her alone as mandatary of her husband, head of the community.\nJudgment of the Court of King's Bench (Q.R. 27 K.B. 88), reversed, Davies C.J. and Brodeur J. dissenting. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King's Bench, appeal side, Province of Quebec[1], reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, District of Montreal[2], and dismissing the plaintiff's action.\nThe appellant sold his lands to one Caron for $90,000, of which $21,000 was paid in cash, $11,000 was payable to the Cr\u00e9dit Foncier Franco-Canadien, and the balance was payable to himself. Later on, by a deed of transfer, \"pour bonnes et valables consid\u00e9rations,\" he allotted to his daughter, the respondent's wife, a sum of $5,000.11 out of the balance of the price of sale. In the deed, the wife was erroneously described as separate as to property. The wife accepted alone, the husband not appearing in the deed to authorise her. She died a few years later, after having made her will by which she instituted the respondent her universal legatee. Two years after, the respondent signed a notarial deed of acceptance of the transfer which had been made to his wife and had that deed registered in the lands which were mortgaged for the payment of the sum so transferred. The appellant, later on, took the present action to have declared null the gift made to her daughter and claimed the radiation of the registration of the deed of acceptance by the respondent. The Superior Court maintained the action; but, on appeal, it was held that a gift made to a wife common as to property falls into the community and that the acceptance by the wife alone was legal, as made on behalf of her husband and as his mandatary acting under special mandate proved by parol evidence of the husband given at the trial without objection. Paul St. Germain K. C. for the appellant.\nThibaudeau Rinfret K.C. and R. Genest for the respondent.\nThe Chief Justice (dissenting)\u2014I concur with Brodeur J.\nIdington J.\u2014I concur with Mignault J.\nAnglin J.\u2014The facts of this case sufficiently appear in the opinions delivered in the provincial courts[3]. I am not disposed to differ from the view taken by the learned trial judge and the judges of the Court of King's Bench that, looking at the substance of the transaction in question, the donation by the appellant to his daughter should be deemed gratuitous.\nNotwithstanding that, as a result of their marriage contract not providing otherwise (art. 1271 C.C.), legal community of property existed between the defendant and his wife, in the deed of cession, which the wife's father seeks in this action to have declared void, his daughter is described as \"s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens.\" The plaintiff, however, does not claim that the deed should be set aside on the ground of error (arts. 991 and 992 C.C.). Indeed, he does not even allege mistake. Neither does he aver that he intended to make the money donated to his daughter her separate property (propre), as he might have done by a distinct stipulation (art. 1272 (1) C.C.). Nor does he pretend that he made the donation under the belief that she would enjoy the money as her separate property. He was a party to his daughter's marriage contract, which bears date the 14th November, 1907, and contains a provision that a certain donation of money thereby made by him to her should be propre to her. All he says in his evidence on this aspect of the case is that he does not know whether his daughter was or was not married under the system of community of property\u2014 he does not recollect her marriage contract, i.e., at the time of his examination in October, 1916. He does not pretend that he had forgotten it when he made the deed of cession in December, 1911. Under these circumstances the plaintiff should, in my opinion, be taken to have known when he executed that deed that community of property existed between his daughter and the plaintiff and, since, under that regime, in the absence of a contrary provision, any movable property acquired by either of the spouses during coverture falls into the community (art. 1272 C.C.), he must be taken to have intended in giving $5,000 to his daughter to augment the community property. From the fact that if the wife were separate as to property the donation of this money to her would admittedly be void (art. 183 C.C.) for lack of marital authorisation to accept it, which must be in writing or evidenced by the husband's execution of the deed (arts. 177 and 763 C.C.)\u2014there is no question here of judicial authorisation\u2014there arises a presumption that it was not intended to go to her in this character\u2014ut res magis valeat. Speaking generally, every one is presumed to know the law; I made an effort to review the authorities on this latter presumption in Montreal Investment Company v. Sarault[4], and refer to my judgment in that case\u2014of course, merely for convenience\u2014and no one should be presumed to intend his deed to be a nullity. It must, therefore, I think, be assumed that the plaintiff knew and intended that the $5,000 in question should fall into the community. If these presumptions be rebuttable, there is no evidence of any contrary intention in the record to rebut them.\nThe invalidity under art. 183 C.C. is absolute and may be taken advantage of by any person interested, whereas under the corresponding article of the Code Napoleon (No. 225) it is relative and can be set up only by the wife, the husband or their heirs. D.P. 97, 1, 449 and note.\nOn this state of facts there arises an interesting question, viz., whether a gift of movable property made to a married woman subject to the regime of community can be validly accepted by her husband alone acting either personally or by an agent (who may be his wife, art. 1708 C.C.), or whether the acceptance must be by the married woman, either in person, or by agent, on her own behalf.\nThe theory put forward by the respondent, which has found favour in the Court of King's Bench, is that the acceptance by Emma Robin (Pesant) was on behalf of her husband and as his mandatary acting under special mandate proved by parol testimony of the husband given at the trial without objection. He also relies on a general mandate arising from the existence of the community and the wife's proven habit of controlling the menage. Inasmuch as the acceptance of property cannot be regarded as a matter of administration (art. 177 C.C. so indicates) a general mandate, express or implied, would seem insufficient (art. 1703 C.C.). I incline to think that the finding that a special mandate was proved should not be disturbed. The efficacy of parol evidence on such a question received without objection is not open to question in this court. Schwersenski v. Vineberg[5]; Gervais v. McCarthy[6]. I am also inclined to agree with the respondent in upholding the view of the Court of King's Bench that, although the acceptance itself must be in authentic form (art. 776 C.C.), when it is executed by procuration the mandate therefor need not be so. Art. 933 C.N. is not reproduced in the Civil Code of Quebec. Under English law an agent who executes an instrument required to be under seal must be appointed by deed; Steiglitz v. Egginton[7]; Berkeley v. Hardy[8]; although the authority of an agent who signs a writing exacted by the Statute of Frauds may be oral. Clinan v. Cooke[9]. Compare Carruthers v. Schmidt[10]. The contention of the appellant as to the necessity for appointment by notarial instrument of a mandatary who is to execute a document required to be in notarial form assimilates the latter to the English deed under seal. But the Court of King's Bench, upwards of twenty years ago, decided that the appointment of an agent to execute a conventional hypothec, required by art. 2040 C.C. to be in notarial form, need not be made by notarial instrument. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Pr\u00eats, etc. v. Lachance[11]. An appeal to this court was quashed for lack of jurisdiction[12]. The principle of this decision of the Court of King's Bench is directly in point. It determines that a requirement of the law that an instrument should be in authentic form does not import that the authority of an agent to execute it must be evidenced in the same manner. As Lacoste C.J. points out, the French authors are divided in their opinions on this question and the French courts have now definitely adopted a contrary view. See too Langelier, Cours de Droit Civil, vol. VI., p. 277. But the late Chief Justice of the King's Bench tells us that in Quebec the authentic form of mandate has never been required. This decision of the highest court in the province has stood unquestioned for twenty-two years. Many authentic acts have doubtless been executed on the faith of it by procuration not so evidenced. Confusion would be introduced and many titles possibly upset were we now to overrule it. In my opinion we should not do so. Dunlop & Sons v. Balfour Williamson & Co.[13].\nInasmuch as the acceptance by the wife, if regarded as given on her own behalf, would be inefficacious for lack of marital authority in writing (arts. 177 and 183 C.C.), if her acceptance as mandatary of her husband would render the gift valid I would incline on the evidence in the record to give it that construction. Upon the testimony given by him it is not open to the respondent to contend for any other. We are thus squarely confronted with the question whether acceptance by the husband alone suffices to maintain the gift.\nA passage in Laurent (vol. XII., No. 244, which he bases on Pothier, Coutume d'Orleans, Introd. au titre XV., No. 35) would seem to indicate that it would. See, too, Furgole, Question IV., \"Donations,\" t. VI., p. 27. But in my opinion this view cannot be supported:\nMais cette doctrine qui pouvait se justifier sous le r\u00e9gime de l'ordonnance, qui admettait l'acceptation de la donation en vertu d'un pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral (Furgole sur 1 art. 5 de l'ordon. de 1731; Ronssilhe, Jurisp. de Donations No. 284) serait inadmissible aujourd'hui * * * Dans tous les cas le mari seul ne peut pas accepter pour sa femme * * * Le mari en effet n'est pas donataire et n'a point, par cons\u00e9quent, qualit\u00e9 pour accepter. Pan. Fr. \"Donations.\" No. 3838. Compare arts. 177 and 763 of the Quebec Civil Code with arts. 217 and 934 of the Code Napoleon.\nTo permit the husband alone to accept a donation made to his wife would involve the mistaken idea that the law prescribes marital authorisation solely for his benefit and protection, and consequently that he alone can set up its absence (art. 183 C.C. in terms precludes this view); that he might give the required authorisation subsequently (which is contrary to the spirit, if not to the letter of art. 177: Langelier, Cours de Droit Civil, vol. 1, p. 316); and that he may compel an acceptance by the wife which the Code merely empowers him to authorise\u2014Merlin Rep. vbo. \"Authorisation Maritale,\" sec. 6, par. 3, No. 2; De Lorimier, Bibl. du Code Civil, vol. 2, pp. 182-3.\nLe mari ne peut accepter la donation seul, sous quelque r\u00e9gime que les \u00e9poux soient mari\u00e9s * * * soit m\u00eame qu il s'agisse d'une donation mobili\u00e8re,\" 18 Fuzier-Herman, vbo. \"Donation Entre Vifs,\" 362-365; 20 Demolombe 159; Beltjens, Code Civil Beige, art. 934, No. 3; 3 Troplong \"Des Donations entre Vifs,\" No. 1122; 2 Arntz, Droit Civil No. 1862.\nIt may be urged that Demolombe, Troplong and Arntz rest their opinions, that the view of Pothier and Furgole, based on the Coutume d'Orleans and the Ordonnance of 1731, that a husband living in community, by virtue of his general marital authority, may, without his wife's concurrence, accept for her a donation made to her, cannot prevail under the Code Napoleon, on the presence in that Code of art. 933, which, as already stated, is without counterpart in the Quebec Civil Code. The argument deduced by these writers from art. 933, however, is that its requirements shew that the general mandate of the husband arising from his marital control under the community system cannot be invoked to uphold the acceptance by him of a donation made to his wife; a special mandate is necessary. But since, as has already been indicated, acceptance of property is not an act of administration and the Quebec Civil Code expressly provides that the authority conferred by a general mandate is restricted to acts of administration (art. 1703 C.C.), the absence from the Quebec Code of an article couched in terms similar to those of art. 933 C.N. does not seem to me to detract materially from the weight that should be given in Quebec to the opinions of the writers I have cited as to the necessity for acceptance by the wife or her specially authorised mandatary.\nThe Court of King's Bench appears to have proceeded on the assumption that the husband, in accepting, would do so as head of the community. This necessarily implies that the community exists as a juridical person apart from the persons of the two spouses. That, I think with deference, is a fundamental error. Laurent himself, with what seems to me unaccountable inconsistency, recognises that the community (the only regime to which he would extend the doctrine enunciated in No. 244 of his XII. volume, Supp. 1902, vol. 4, No. 123) is neither a civil nor a moral juridical person. Vol. XXL, Nos. 189, 210, 250. He concludes the latter number in these words:\u2014\nLa loi consid\u00e8re donc la communaut\u00e9, non comme une personne, mais comme une masse de biens, un fonds social.\nHuc, in his IX. volume, at p. 85, says:\u2014\nCette soci\u00e9t\u00e9, en l'absence d'un texte formel, ne constitue pas une personne juridique distincte de la personne des conjoints. Si la loi emploie l'expression en apparence abstraite, de communaut\u00e9, c'est simplement pour d\u00e9signer les \u00e9poux eux-m\u00eames, consid\u00e9r\u00e9d comme associ\u00e9s, par opposition aux \u00e9po\u00fax envisag\u00e9s individuellement.\nBaudry-Lacantinerie, \"Manage,\" vol. 1, Nos. 249-250, writes to the same effect. The authorities are collected by this author in Note 1, p. 259, 3 ed. He concludes (No. 250) in these words:\u2014 En somme, la v\u00e9ritable notion de la communaut\u00e9 nous parait \u00eatre qu'elle constitue une copropri\u00e9t\u00e9 entre \u00e9poux, soumise \u00e0 des r\u00e8gies particuli\u00e8res.\nSee, too, III Dalloz Codes Ann. 1905, Art. 1339, Nos. 4 and 5. One cannot act as agent for or representative of a non-existent person. If, therefore, the husband has authority to accept a gift to his wife it must be not as head of and on behalf of the community which has no existence as a person, and therefore cannot have an agent or representative, but as the mandatary of his wife and on her behalf. Citing Colmet de Santerre, vol. VI., No. 65, Huc, in his 9th volume (No. 157), says:\u2014\nCe qui est vrai, c'est que le r\u00e9gime en communaut\u00e9 est combin\u00e9 de telle mani\u00e8re que le mari charg\u00e9 par la femme de faire prosp\u00e9rer les affaires communes, est cens\u00e9, dans ce but, recevoir de celle-ci des pouvoirs presque illimit\u00e9s.\nBut, since acceptance is not an act of administration, the general mandate would not cover it; a special mandate would be necessary. Art. 1703 C.C. Compare art. 181 C.C.\nIt is not pretended, however, that there was in fact any such acceptance by the wife through the agency of her husband or that she was deputed to act as sub-mandatary of her husband and as such to accept for herself\u2014if, indeed, such a situation as that of a donee ex facie accepting in her own name and on her own behalf, but in reality as sub-mandatary of her own agent, would be possible or conceivable, or if the requirement by art. 177 of an authorisation in writing could be thus circumvented.\nBut what are the limits of the husband's rights as agent of his wife in respect to the community property? They are impliedly defined by art. 1292 C.C. They are rights of administration, alienation (onerous), hypothecation and donation inter vivos. These rights all appertain to property already in the community. They do not extend to the acquisition of property by the wife which, when acquired, will fall into the community by operation of law. Acceptance is not administration (art. 177 C.C.). Since without acceptance a donation is not complete (arts. 755 and 776 C.C.), until there has been a valid acceptance of it the property which is its subject cannot be vested in the wife. Upon being so vested eo instanti it, no doubt, falls into the community. But until so vested it cannot be subject to community control. The fallacy therefore\u2014if I may say so with respect\u2014underlying the judgment of the Court of King's Bench is double. It consists (1) in ascribing to the husband the power as head of the community to contract with regard to property not yet in the community, and (2), in assuming the existence of the community as a distinct juridical person for which the husband may act as mandatary.\nI am, for these reasons, of the opinion that the donation required acceptance by the wife on her own behalf in the form prescribed by art. 776 given with the authorisation of her husband evidenced either by his execution of the deed itself, or otherwise in writing (art. 177 C.C.), and that for lack of such authorisation the intended gift fails under art. 183 C.C.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs in this court and in the Court of King's Bench, and would restore the judgment of the learned trial judge.\nBrodeur J. (dissenting).\u2014Il s'agit dans cette cause de la validit\u00e9 d'une donation mobili\u00e8re faite par l'appelant le 4 d\u00e9cembre 1911 \u00e0 sa fille mari\u00e9e sous le r\u00e9gime de la communaut\u00e9.\nLe p\u00e8re, qui est le demandeur-appelant, pr\u00e9tend que la donation est nulle parce que sa fille n'\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9e par son mari \u00e0 accepter la donation. Le mari, qui est le d\u00e9fendeur-intim\u00e9, all\u00e8gue, au contraire, que la donation est valable, et que sa femme, en acceptant la donation, a agi comme son mandataire.\nL'acte de donation, en d\u00e9crivant Emma Pesant, l'\u00e9pouse du d\u00e9fendeur-intim\u00e9, comme une femme s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens, \u00e9tait incorrect; car elle s'\u00e9tait mari\u00e9e sous le r\u00e9gime de la communaut\u00e9 de biens; et, dans son contrat de mariage, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait le 14 novembre 1907, son p\u00e8re, le demandeur-appelant, avait comparu \u00e0 Pacte; et il savait, lui aussi, qu'elle \u00e9tait commune en biens, vu qu'il lui avait fait une donation mobili\u00e8re qu'il avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9e \u00eatre un propre de communaut\u00e9.\nEmma Pesant est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e le 23 juillet 1913, laissant un testament par lequel elle instituait son mari son l\u00e9gataire universel. Des difficult\u00e9s survinrent alors entre l'appelant et l'intim\u00e9 au sujet de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de certains tributs mortuaires qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faits \u00e0 la mort de Dame Emma Pesant; et, le 4 d\u00e9cembre 1913, l'appelant donnait avis aux d\u00e9biteurs de la somme donn\u00e9e que cette donation \u00e9tait nulle.\nLe 2 juin 1915, l'intim\u00e9, Robin, vu l'attitude de l'appelant, lui a fait signifier une d\u00e9claration disant que sa femme avait accept\u00e9 la donation avec le consentement, l'autorisation, le mandat et suivant les instructions de son mari, le chef de la communaut\u00e9; que cela \u00e9tait bien connu du p\u00e8re; que, de plus, en autant qu'il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire, il confirmait et ratifiait les actes de son \u00e9pouse.\nJoseph Pesant, le p\u00e8re, institue maintenant la pr\u00e9sente action pour faire d\u00e9clarer nulle cette donation, en all\u00e9guant qu'elle est ill\u00e9gale, vu que la femme n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e par son mari \u00e0 l'accepter; et il demande \u00e9galement \u00e0 faire mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 la d\u00e9claration faite par le mari dans son prot\u00eat du 2 juin 1915. Le d\u00e9fendeur plaide, en substance, que l'acceptation faite par sa femme \u00e9tait valide et invoque comme moyens de d\u00e9fense ceux indiqu\u00e9s dans son acte de confirmation et d'acceptation.\nL'intim\u00e9 a aussi pr\u00e9tendu que l'acte en question \u00e9tait un acte \u00e0 titre on\u00e9reux; mais la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que cet acte constituait une donation; et sur ce point la Cour d'Appel est du m\u00eame avis; je crois que sur cette question ces jugements sont bien fond\u00e9s.\nSur la validit\u00e9 de la donation, la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure[14], a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la donation, n'ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e par la femme autoris\u00e9e de son mari, \u00e9tait nulle. La Cour d'Appel[15], au contraire, en est venue \u00e0 la conclusion que la femme a agi au contrat comme mandataire de son mari et que l'acceptation ainsi faite rendait la donation valable.\nPar l'article 177 du code civil une femme ne peut accepter une donation sans le concours du mari dans l'acte ou sans son consentement par \u00e9crit.\nCette disposition de la loi s'applique aussi bien \u00e0 la femme commune en biens qu'\u00e0 celle qui s'est mari\u00e9e sous le r\u00e9gime de la s\u00e9paration de biens. La question qui se pose dans cette cause-ci est de savoir si une donation faite \u00e0 la femme commune en biens peut \u00eatre accept\u00e9e par le mari seul, ou bien accept\u00e9e par la femme comme mandataire du mari.\nLa question que je viens de poser demande \u00e0 \u00eatre r\u00e9solue dans la pr\u00e9sente cause parce que la donation est apparemment nulle, vu qu'elle est faite nomm\u00e9ment \u00e0 la femme, qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e par cette derni\u00e8re et que le mari n'a pas comparu \u00e0 l'acte et ne para\u00eet pas avoir donn\u00e9 son consentement par \u00e9crit: et alors si nous prenons l'acte de donation lui-m\u00eame il para\u00eetrait \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue nul, parce que l'acceptation n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par la femme autoris\u00e9e de son mari.\nMais le mari dit: Nous \u00e9tions en communaut\u00e9 de biens, ma femme et moi. Je lui ai donn\u00e9 mandat d'accepter la donation pour moi, chef de la communaut\u00e9; et alors l'acceptation que ma femme a faite comme ma mandataire a rendu la donation valable.\nL'autorisation exig\u00e9e par l'article 177 doit \u00eatre faite par \u00e9crit.\nLe mandat, au contraire, peut exister sans qu'il y ait d'\u00e9crit. La preuve du mandat peut \u00eatre parfois difficile \u00e0 faire. Cependant s' il y a un commencement de preuve par \u00e9crit de la part de la partie adverse, ou s'il y a un aveu de sa part, ou encore, si la preuve testimoniale en a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite sans aucune objection, le mandat doit \u00eatre tenu pour avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9galement prouv\u00e9.\nDans la cause actuelle, le mandat que le mari all\u00e9guait avoir donn\u00e9 \u00e0 sa femme n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 par \u00e9crit. Mais le mari en a fait la preuve testimoniale, \u00e0 laquelle aucune objection n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, et \u00e0 raison des d\u00e9cisions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues par cette cour dans les causes de Schwersenski v. Vineberg[16], et de Gervais v. McCarthy[17], le mandat est, donc prouv\u00e9.\nNous avons donc dans la pr\u00e9sente cause la preuve du mandat.\nReste cependant \u00e0 d\u00e9cider une question bien importante, celle de savoir si la donation, ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 la femme, le mari, comme chef de la communaut\u00e9, pouvait accepter pour sa femme.\nPothier, dans son introduction au titre des donations, no. 35, dit:\u2014 Le mari ayant le bail, gouvernement et administration des biens et de la personne de sa femme, il s'ensuit qu'il peut pour sa femme accepter une donation faite \u00e0 sa femme.\nCette opinion de Pothier \u00e9tait, dans l'ancien droit, \u00e9galement entretenue par Furgole, \"Donations,\" seconde \u00e9dition, p. 29. Furgole, dans son commentaire sur l'ordonnance de 1731, nous dit qu'il y avait dans la jurisprudence divergence d'opinions sur la question de savoir si le mari pouvait accepter une donation faite \u00e0 la femme. Les parlements de Toulouse et de Dijon optaient pour la n\u00e9gative: le parlement de Bordeaux \u00e9tait d'opinion que de telles acceptations \u00e9taient valables.\nFurgole consid\u00e8re que la jurisprudence du parlement de Bordeaux paraissait tr\u00e8s \u00e9quitable et conforme aux maximes du droit romain, et il ajoutait:\u2014\nA tout cela il faut joindre cette r\u00e8gle, que suivant la Loi Maritus 21, Cod. de Procurator, le mari est procureur naturel et l\u00e9gal de sa femme, sans qu'il ait besoin d'aucun mandat; de l\u00e0 on peut inf\u00e9rer que l'acceptation faite par le mari, de la donation faite \u00e0 sa femme absente, est suffisante pour rendre la donation parfaite, m\u00eame pour les biens paraphernaux; car s'il s'agissait des biens dotaux, il n'y aurait aucun doute \u00e0 cause de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat personnel du mari; il ne nous semble pas non plus qu'il y en ait lorsque la femme est en la puissance de son mari, parce que cette puissance ne doit pas avoir moins d'effet que celle du tuteur ou du curateur.\nEt il ajoute:\u2014\nCela para\u00eet encore mieux fond\u00e9 et plus raisonnable dans les pays o\u00f9 la communaut\u00e9 des biens est en usage, parce que le mari devant profiter de la moiti\u00e9 de la lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9, comme \u00e9tant un acquet qui entre dans la communaut\u00e9, en acceptant la donation pour sa femme, il est cens\u00e9 le faire comme associ\u00e9, non-seulement pour la portion qui doit lui revenir, mais encore pour le tout, parce que la qualit\u00e9 d'associ\u00e9 lui donne le droit de stipuler et d'accepter tous les contrats favorables \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9; car c'est une maxime \u00e9tablie par les lois et les auteurs, que chaque associ\u00e9 a un mandat tacite par la nature du contrat, et par la volont\u00e9 des autres associ\u00e9s, pour faire l'avantage de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9: ce qui est encore plus indubitable dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 conjugale, dont le mari est le ma\u00eetre.\nLaurent, vol. 3, p. 145, est \u00e9galement de l'avis de Pothier et de Furgole. Apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il ne faut pas confondre l'autorisation avec le mandat, il ajoute:\u2014\nIl importe donc beaucoup de distinguer quand il y a autorisation et quand il y a mandat. Ce ne sont pas les termes qui d\u00e9cident la question. Il est possible que le mari se soit servi du mot autorisation alors qu'il donne un v\u00e9ritable mandat \u00e0 sa femme. Il faut voir si Pacte juridique concerne les droits de la femme ou les droits du mari. Dans le premier cas, la femme doit \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e; dans le second, elle ne peut agir qu'en vertu d'un mandat: La question de savoir s'il s'agit des droits de la femme ou des droits du mari d\u00e9pend des conventions matrimoniales. Supposons que les \u00e9poux soient mari\u00e9s sous le r\u00e9gime de la communaut\u00e9 l\u00e9gale. Il va sans dire que si le mari donne pouvoir \u00e0 la femme d'agir pour ses biens propres ou pour les biens de la communaut\u00e9, il y a mandat et non autorisation. De l\u00e0 suit que si le pouvoir concerne l'administration des biens de la femme, il y a encore mandat; car sous le r\u00e9gime de la communaut\u00e9, c'est le mari qui administre les biens de la femme.\nLaurent est encore plus explicite dans son douzi\u00e8me volume, Trait\u00e9 des Donations, no. 244, p. 309, o\u00f9, discutant la question de savoir si le mari peut accepter au nom de sa femme, il dit:\u2014\nEn principe, il est certain que le mari n'a aucune qualit\u00e9 pour acqu\u00e9rir au nom de sa femme, ni pour l'obliger. Mais les conventions matrimoniales ne peuvent-elles pas lui donner ce pouvoir? Pothier suppose que les \u00e9poux se sont mari\u00e9s sous le r\u00e9gime de la communaut\u00e9; sous ce r\u00e9gime, les donations mobili\u00e8res, de m\u00eame que les successions mobili\u00e8res, tombent dans l'actif de la communaut\u00e9; le mari, comme chef de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, est cessionnaire des droits de la femme; l'on admet qu'en cette qualit\u00e9 il peut accepter les successions mobili\u00e8res \u00e9chues \u00e0 la femme, bien qu'il ne soit pas h\u00e9ritier; par la m\u00eame raison, il faut lui reconna\u00eetre le pouvoir d'accepter les donations mobili\u00e8res, bien qu'il ne soit pas donataire.\nJe reconnais qu'il y a divergence d'opinions parmi les auteurs qui ont \u00e9crit sur le Code Napol\u00e9on. Ainsi, par exemple: Demolombe, vol. 20, no. 159; Troplong, vol. 3, des Donations entre vifs, no. 1122; Fuzier-Herman, vol. 18, vbo. Donations entre vifs, pp. 362 & 363; Beltjens, Code Civil Belge, art. 934, no. 3; Arntz, vol. 2, Droit Civil, no. 1862; Pandectes fran\u00e7aises, vbo. Donations, no. 3838, sont d'opinion que le mari ne peut accepter pour sa femme une donation mobili\u00e8re qui est faite \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re.\nIl est bon de remarquer cependant \u00e0 ce sujet que le dernier ouvrage que nous ayons sur ce sujet est celui de Dalloz: R\u00e9pertoire pratique, o\u00f9 il est dit, au no. 189, vbo. Donations entre vifs, apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le mari seul ne peut accepter pour sa femme:\u2014\nToutefois si les \u00e9poux \u00e9taient mari\u00e9s sous le r\u00e9gime de la communaut\u00e9 l\u00e9gale, le mari aurait qualit\u00e9 pour accepter sans le concours de la femme des donations mobili\u00e8res faites \u00e0 celle-ci.\nJe vois que Demolombe et quelques-uns des auteurs qui n'acceptent pas l'opinion de Pothier se basent sur l'article 933 du Code Napol\u00e9on pour d\u00e9clarer que le mari ne peut pas accepter une donation faite \u00e0 sa femme. Cet article 933 d\u00e9clare que si le donataire est majeur l'acceptation doit \u00eatre faite par lui, ou, en son nom, par la personne fond\u00e9e de sa procuration portant pouvoir d'accepter la donation faite, ou un pouvoir g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d'accepter les donations qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 ou qui pourraient \u00eatre faites. Ces auteurs trouvent dans cette disposition de la loi relative au pouvoir d'accepter les donations une disposition contraire \u00e0 l'Ordonnance des Donations de 1731 et au vieux droit fran\u00e7ais: et alors ils en arrivent \u00e0 la conclusion qu'\u00e0 raison de cette diff\u00e9rence entre le Code Napol\u00e9on et l'ancien droit, le droit du mari d'accepter une donation faite \u00e0 sa femme n'existait plus sous le Code Napol\u00e9on.\nJe n'entreprendrai pas de discuter cette question au point de vue du Code Napol\u00e9on, car ce ne sont pas les dispositions de ce code que nous avons \u00e0 appliquer dans notre droit. Les ouvrages des commentateurs de ce code sont tr\u00e8s utiles en autant qu'ils peuvent expliquer quelque partie ambigue ou douteuse du code Civil de Qu\u00e9bec; mais ils ne sont certainement pas des guides s\u00fbrs dans l'interpr\u00e9tation de notre code lorsque leurs arguments sont bas\u00e9s sur des dispositions formelles du code Napol\u00e9on qui ne se trouvent pas dans notre loi. Il vaut bien mieux, sous ce rapport, suivre les anciens auteurs lorsque la loi sur la mati\u00e8re ne para\u00eet pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e.\nHerse v. Dufaux[18].\nOr, l'article 933 sur lequel se base Demolombe et d'autres auteurs n'a pas d'article correspondant dans notre code.\nVoir Beauchamp, Code civil annot\u00e9, 3\u00e8me vol. p. 1549; Sharpe, Civil Code, vol. 2, p. 823.\nDe plus, les deux codes diff\u00e8rent sur un autre point tr\u00e8s important. Ainsi le code Napol\u00e9on dit \u00e0 l'article 932 que la donation devra \u00eatre accept\u00e9e \"en termes expr\u00e8s.\" L'article 788 de notre code dit, au contraire:\nIl n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que l'acceptation d'une donation soit en termes expr\u00e8s; elle peut s'inf\u00e9rer de l'acte ou des circonstances.\nCes deux textes de la loi sont absolument diff\u00e9rents, comme on le voit. Et alors peut-on suivre avec certitude les commentateurs du Code Napol\u00e9on sur cette question d'acceptation, puisque, tandis que le Code Napol\u00e9on exige que l'acceptation soit faite en termes expr\u00e8s, notre code \u00e9nonce, au contraire, le principe que l'acceptation peut s'inf\u00e9rer des circonstances?\nIl vaut bien mieux alors, sous ce rapport, suivre l'opinion des auteurs qui ont \u00e9crit sous l'ancien droit; et il est av\u00e9r\u00e9 que sous l'ancien droit la donation pouvait \u00eatre accept\u00e9e par le mari seul.\nPersonne ne devrait contester l'opinion de Pothier. Les codificateurs, bien loin d'\u00e9carter cette opinion de Pothier, semblent l'avoir accept\u00e9e, puisque l'article 177 de notre code civil est bas\u00e9 sur Pothier lui-m\u00eame. Rapports des codificateurs, vol. 1er, p. 298. Alors, dans les circonstances, je suis d'opinion qu'on doit suivre Pothier de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux auteurs modernes qui ont eu \u00e0 commenter des articles du Code Napol\u00e9on qui ne se trouvent pas dans le n\u00f4tre ou qui en diff\u00e8rent.\nPeut-on pr\u00e9tendre, en outre, que le principe de la puissance maritale a \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9 dans le cas actuel?\nLa femme ne peut pas m\u00eame accepter une donation sans l'autorisation de son mari, parce que l'incapacit\u00e9 de la femme d\u00e9rive manifestement de l'\u00e9tat de mariage et qu'elle est incapable de contracter ni m\u00eame de recevoir une donation sans la volont\u00e9 expresse de son mari. Si la femme mari\u00e9e ne peut pas recevoir une donation entre vifs sans l'autorisation de son mari, c'est que le mari a un int\u00e9r\u00eat moral \u00e0 examiner la source et le motif de la lib\u00e9ralit\u00e9 faite \u00e0 sa femme.\nOr, dans le cas actuel, nous sommes en pr\u00e9sence d'un p\u00e8re qui veut mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 une donation en pr\u00e9tendant que sa fille mari\u00e9e n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e; et, d'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, nous avons le mari qui veut maintenir cette donation-l\u00e0 en disant que sa femme avait agi avec son consentement et son autorisation: que, de fait, elle \u00e9tait sa mandataire dans les circonstances.\nLa position pourrait \u00eatre diff\u00e9rente si le mari pr\u00e9tendait qu'il n'a pas donn\u00e9 d'autorisation; mais, au contraire, il pr\u00e9tend que sa femme n'a pas agi en violation de la puissance maritale qu'il a sur elle mais qu'elle a, au contraire, en tout point respect\u00e9 cette puissance.\nJ'en suis donc venu \u00e0 la conclusion que la donation a \u00e9t\u00e9 validement accept\u00e9e par la femme mandataire de son mari et le jugement de la Cour d'Appel doit \u00eatre confirm\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens. Mignault J.\u2014Avec toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence possible je ne puis me convaincre que le jugement de la Cour d'Appel ait fait une application exacte des principes du droit qui r\u00e9gissent la capacit\u00e9 de la femme sous puissance de mari. Au contraire, je suis d'opinion que ce jugement confond deux choses qui pourtant sont tr\u00e8s distinctes; les conditions de validit\u00e9 d'un contrat et les effets de ce contrat lorsqu'il est valide. Ainsi, il est hors de doute que, sous le r\u00e9gime de communaut\u00e9 de biens, les donations mobili\u00e8res faites \u00e0 la femme tombent dans la communaut\u00e9 (art. 1272 C.C.); c'est l\u00e0 l'effet du contrat de donation fait au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la femme commune. Mais pour que cet effet se produise, il faut que la donation elle-m\u00eame soit valide; si elle est nulle elle ne produira aucun effet et la communaut\u00e9 n'en tirera aucun b\u00e9n\u00e9fice, car, suivant l'axiome de droit, quod nullum est nullum producit effectum.\nLa confusion d'id\u00e9es dont je viens de parler me semble bien apparente quand on lit les motifs du jugement dont est appel. Je les cite textuellement:\u2014\nConsidering that the deed of cession or transfer from the plaintiff respondent, to Napoleon Pesant and others made on December 4, 1911, before Mtre. Leclerc, notary, though purporting to transfer the sum of $5,000 to the said late Dame Emma Pesant would, by law, upon the same being duly executed, have had the effect of vesting the said sum in the said matrimonial community of property and in the said defendant, appellant, as head of the said community, and not in the said Emma Pesant;\nConsidering that the said cession or transfer was consequently not a gift of the said sum to the said Emma Pesant; and that she was not a contracting or accepting party to the said deed of cession or transfer, but merely the mandatary of her husband, the appellant, and did not need to be assisted by the latter or authorised by him otherwise than as a mandatary.\nEn d'autres termes, on dit: la donation d'une somme d'argent \u00e0 la femme commune a l'effet de faire tomber cette somme dans la communaut\u00e9; donc la donation n'est pas une donation \u00e0 la femme, et cette derni\u00e8re n'est pas partie contractante \u00e0 l'acte de donation et n'y figure que comme mandataire de son mari, chef de la communaut\u00e9.\nJe ne puis m'emp\u00eacher d'opposer un non sequitur absolu \u00e0 ce raisonnement. Le premier motif du jugement aurait d\u00fb, il me semble, conduire \u00e0 une toute autre conclusion, car, en disant que la donation d'une somme d'argent \u00e0 la femme commune a l'effet de faire tomber dans la communaut\u00e9 la somme donn\u00e9e, le jugement ajoute le qualificatif \"upon the same being duly executed.\" L\u00e0, en effet, est toute la question. Pour que la donation produise cet effet, il faut qu'elle soit \"duly executed.\" Si la donation \u00e9tait nulle pour vice de forme, nul ne pr\u00e9tendrait que la somme donn\u00e9e tomberait dans la communaut\u00e9, car la donation n'existerait m\u00eame pas. Or, si la donation n'est pas validement accept\u00e9e par le donataire\u2014et la femme commune ou s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens, peu importe, ne peut accepter une donation qu'avec le concours du mari dans l'acte ou son consentement par \u00e9crit (art. 177, 763 C.C.)\u2014la donation est nulle, ou plutot elle n'a jamais exist\u00e9, et il va sans dire qu'elle ne peut produire aucun effet, et que la somme qu'on voulait donner ne tombera pas dans la communaut\u00e9.\nInvoquer dans ces circonstances les principes qui r\u00e9gissent le mandat, quand il s'agit, au contraire, des r\u00e8gles de validit\u00e9 de la donation entre vifs, c'est augmenter la confusion d'id\u00e9es. Ou bien il s'agit d'une donation faite \u00e0 la femme mari\u00e9e, et alors cette donation n'existera qu'\u00e0 la condition que la femme l'ait accept\u00e9e avec le concours de son mari dans l'acte ou son consentement par \u00e9crit, sauf les cas o\u00f9 l'autorisation judiciaire peut suppl\u00e9er celle du mari; ou bien il s'agit d'une donation au mari, et alors il va sans dire que ce dernier peut l'accepter personnellement ou par procureur. L'effet que produira la donation dans l'un ou l'autre cas n'a rien \u00e0 faire dans cette question de validit\u00e9 du contrat.\nLa donation dont il s'agit a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 la femme ou bien au mari, car on ne peut concevoir une donation faite \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9, cette communaut\u00e9 n'\u00e9tant pas une personne morale ou juridique, mais simplement une masse de biens ou un patrimoine? Voy. Baudry-Lacantinerie, Contrat de Mariage, tome 1er, nos. 249 & 250.\nJe suis d'opinion que cette donation\u2014et comme le Juge Mercier, en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure[19], et le Juge Cross, en Cour d'Appel[20], je crois que l'acte de cession et transport constitue une v\u00e9ritable donation\u2014 est une donation faite \u00e0 la femme. L'appelant avait consenti, avec son fils Napol\u00e9on, un acte par lequel, en vue d'une promesse de vente qu'il avait donn\u00e9e, il s'obligeait, si la vente se r\u00e9alisait, \u00e0 attribuer une partie du prix \u00e0 Napol\u00e9on Pesant, \u00e0 Eva Pesant et \u00e0 Dame Emma Pesant (la femme de l'intim\u00e9), ses enfants. La vente s'\u00e9tant faite, l'appelant, par l'acte dont la validit\u00e9 partielle est en question, a\nc\u00e9d\u00e9, quitt\u00e9 et transport\u00e9 \u00e0 ses enfants\nNapol\u00e9on, Eva et Emma,\nles sommes suivantes stipul\u00e9es payables au dit c\u00e9dant,\net l'acte \u00e9num\u00e8re ces sommes, et, en ce qui concerne Emma, il dit:\u2014\n\u00e0 la dite Dame Emma Pesant dit Sanscartier la somme de $5,000.11.\nM\u00eame Emma Pesant est d\u00e9crite \u00e0 l'acte comme\n\u00e9pouse s\u00e9par\u00e9e de biens de Charles Robin,\nmais je n'attache pas plus d'importance qu'il ne faut \u00e0 cette d\u00e9signation erron\u00e9e, car je ne puis douter que la cession ou transport, ou la donation, car c'est une donation, a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 Emma Pesant, et, cette derni\u00e8re n'y figure et n'a pr\u00e9tendu l'accepter que comme donataire.\nSi donc Emma Pesant est donataire, elle ne pouvait validement accepter qu'avec le concours de son mari dans l'acte ou son consentement par \u00e9crit, et comme elle a accept\u00e9 sans ce concours ou ce consentement, la donation est nulle \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, et nulle d'une nullit\u00e9 que rien ne peut couvrir (art. 183 C.C.); et, par cons\u00e9quent, l'acte ne produit aucun effet ni quant \u00e0 elle ni quant \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 de biens entre elle et son mari.\nL'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9tendu accepter cette donation apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de sa femme. Il suffit de dire que, m\u00eame s'il pouvait accepter une donation faite \u00e0 sa femme, cette acceptation ne pouvait se faire apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de la femme donataire (art. 794 C.C.).\nDepuis que l'opinion qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crite, j'a eu l'avantage de lire la savante discussion de mon coll\u00e8gue, l'honorable juge Brodeur, mais j'ai le regret de ne pouvoir me rendre \u00e0 sa mani\u00e8re de voir. La question de savoir si le mari peut accepter une donation pour sa femme suppose n\u00e9cessairement que la donation a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 la femme, mais que le mari a accept\u00e9 cette donation comme procureur de sa femme. Dans cette hypoth\u00e8se, la femme est bien partie contractante \u00e0 l'acte, mais elle y est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par son mari, et mon honorable coll\u00e8gue invoque l'autorit\u00e9 de Pothier et de Furgole pour soutenir que le mari\nayant le bail, gouvernement et administration des biens et de la personne de sa femme, il s'ensuit qu'il peut, pour sa femme, accepter une donation faite \u00e0 sa femme\n(Pothier, Introd. au titre des Donations de la Coutume d'Orl\u00e9ans, no. 35). Telle n'est cependant pas l'esp\u00e8ce que l'on pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 cette cour pour d\u00e9cision. On ne pr\u00e9tend pas que le mari a accept\u00e9 une donation faite \u00e0 sa femme, comme mandataire de cette derni\u00e8re, mais que la femme aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 le mandataire de son mari pour accepter la donation en son nom, et partant que le mari et non la femme aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 le donataire. Le jugement de la Cour d'Appel[21], dit en toutes lettres:\u2014\nthat the said cession or transfer was consequently not a gift of the said sum to the said Emma Pesant; and that she was not a contracting or accepting party to the said deed of cession or transfer, but merely the mandatary of her husband.\nIl n'est donc pas n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9cider si le mari peut accepter une donation faite \u00e0 sa femme, comme procureur de cette derni\u00e8re.\nDans les circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce, je n'ai pas non plus \u00e0 exprimer une opinion sur la question purement th\u00e9orique, suivant moi, de savoir si la femme peut accepter, comme mandataire, une donation faite \u00e0 son mari. Pothier, dans le passage cit\u00e9, semble croire que non, car il dit:\u2014\nUne femme ne pourrait pas accepter pour son mari une donation faite \u00e0 son mari.\nCette opinion comporterait probablement des r\u00e9serves, mais, encore une fois, elle n'exige pas une solution dans cette cause, car je suis d'avis que la donation a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 la femme et non au mari, et on ne pr\u00e9tend pas que ce dernier l'a accept\u00e9e comme mandataire de sa femme.\nJe ne puis qu'ajouter qu'\u00e0 tous \u00e9gards il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de donner effet aux articles du code civil qui r\u00e9gissent la capacit\u00e9 de la femme mari\u00e9e de donner ou accepter, ali\u00e9ner ou disposer entre vifs ou autrement contracter (art. 177 C.C.; voy. aussi l'article 763 C.C.). Ces dispositions sont d'ordre publie, et le d\u00e9faut d'autorisation maritale comporte une nullit\u00e9 que rien ne peut couvrir (art. 183 C.C.). La volont\u00e9 du l\u00e9gislateur est formelle et c'est le devoir des tribunaux de s'incliner devant elle.\nPour ces motifs je suis d'opinion de maintenir l'appel, avec les d\u00e9pens de cette cour et de la cour d'appel, et de r\u00e9tablir le jugement de la cour sup\u00e9rieure.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Deguire & Nantel.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Perron, Taschereau, Rinfret, Vall\u00e9e & Genest.\n[1] Q.R. 27 K.B. 88.\n[2] 23 R. de J. 211.\n[3] Q.R. 27 K.B. 88; 23 R. de J. 211.\n[4] 57 Can.

On the trial both issues were submitted to a jury. In charging the jury the trial judge said: \"One or both of these defences may be true, but they cannot both be true. If he were mentally incompetent, then the question of misrepresentation would not arise at all.\" The jury returned a general verdict for the plaintiff. The defendant moved to set aside the verdict and for judgment dismissing the action, and alternatively for a new trial on grounds of misdirection. The trial judge gave judgment in accordance with the verdict and the Court of Appeal affirmed this judgment.\nOn appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, the judgment of the Court of Appeal was reversed and a new trial was ordered, with costs of this court and of the Court of Appeal, the costs of the trial to abide by the result.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nC.

The representative of the appellant was the first locator of certain timber claims; and having found on a tree the words \"Clyde River,\" he made his application for a timber license on that river. Later on, the respondent staked the same timber limits, calling the same river as \"Swede River,\" the name under which it was known in the locality.

The third judgment creditor obtained, on the face of the document, no interest in such agreement, following which an appeal by the judgment debtors was discontinued.

After the appellant had done about $50,000 worth of work, the construction was suspended owing to the respondent's lack of funds, and $5,000 had then been paid to the appellant by the respondent.

C. APPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division[1], reversing the judgment of Walsh J. at the trial[2], and dismissing the appellant's (plaintiff's) action with costs.\nThe defendant, respondent, the Canadian Anthracite Coal Company, Limited, was the owner of large coal areas in the Canmore District in this province, of which the defendant the Canmore Coal Company, Limited, was the lessee. The plaintiff, appellant, was a shareholder in both of these companies. The individual defendants, respondents, were directors, some of them, of one of these companies, and some of them, of the other, and some of them of both. By agreement dated the 15th of September, 1916, the former company agreed to buy from the defendant, respondent, the Georgetown Collieries, Limited, a rival concern operating in the same district, all of the assets of that company, for the sum of $100,000 plus the cost price of all its supplies and stock in trade. This agreement has been executed by the Anthracite Coal Company, but the execution of it by the Georgetown company was prevented by an injunction in this action restraining it from doing so, and it is for that reason still unexecuted by it. $2,500 has been paid for the supplies, but the payment of anything further under the contract was stopped by the same injunction. The plaintiff, appellant, sought a declaration that this agreement was \"unlawful, illegal and ultra vires\" an injunction restraining each of the defendant, respondent, companies from entering into \"any other agreement, arrangement, conspiracy or combine with the defendant the Georgetown Collieries, Limited, forbidden by section 498 of the Criminal Code,\" from paying over any moneys under the impeached agreement or from doing any further act or thing in the carrying out of the same, and an accounting by the individual defendants for any moneys of either the Anthracite company or the Canmore company, paid to the Georgetown company under the same and judgment against them for all moneys so paid.\nThe action was tried by Mr. Justice Walsh, who dismissed the action at the close of the plaintiff's case as against the defendants, respondents, the Georgetown Collieries, Limited. He, however, after hearing the evidence of the defence, directed judgment to be entered and a formal judgment was entered accordingly, declaring that the arrangements between the other two companies for the purchase by them of the coal deposits of the Georgetown Collieries, Limited, are illegal, tending to unduly prevent or lessen competition in the production, sale and supply of an article which may be the subject of trade or commerce as provided in section 498 of the Criminal Code, but not otherwise in contravention of the said section, and also declaring that the directors of the Canmore Coal Company, Limited, are liable to the said company for any moneys paid by that company in respect of the agreement in question. A reference was ordered to ascertain the amounts and the judgment ordered the defendants, Thorp, Neale, Thorne, Weyerhaeuser, and Ingram, to repay the amount so found, to the said company; otherwise the action was dismissed and no injunction was granted.\nFrom this judgment the plaintiff appealed and the defendants, Thorp, Ingram, and Neale, and the two first-mentioned companies cross-appealed. The Appellate Division held that the provisions of section 498 of the Criminal Code are clearly intended to apply to agreements among persons who remain in a particular business as to the method and plan by which they will carry it on and as to regulations and rules among themselves so as to lessen competition in the sale, etc., of any article of commerce, and not to an arrangement to buy out and out the property of a competitor, consequently the Appellate Division dismissed the appeal of the present appellant, allowed the cross-appeal of the present respondent and dismissed the action with costs.\nOn appeal by the plaintiff to the Supreme Court of Canada, the court, after hearing counsel for all parties, reserved judgment, and, at a subsequent date dismissed the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nChrysler K.C. and Bennett K.C. for the appellant.\nA.
