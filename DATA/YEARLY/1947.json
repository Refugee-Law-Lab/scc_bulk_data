Hudson J. died before the delivery of the judgment.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nRevenue\u2014Income\u2014Lumbering business\u2014Claim for allowance for exhaustion of timber limits\u2014Discretion of the Minister of National Revenue\u2014Income War Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 97, s. 5(1)(a), as amended by 1940 (Dom.) 2nd session, c. 84, s. 10.\nThe appellant company carries on a lumbering business in Alberta and, when making its income tax return for 1941, claimed an allowance for exhaustion of three timber limits, for which licences had been granted by the province. The appellant\u2019s claim was disallowed by the Minister of National Revenue; and the Exchequer Court of Canada affirmed the Minister\u2019s decision. Section 5 (1)(a) of the Income War Tax Act, as amended in 1940, provides that \u201cthe Minister in determining the income derived from * * * timber limits may make such an allowance for the exhaustion of the * * * timber limits as he may deem just and fair * * *\u201d; while, in the Revised Statutes, paragraph (a), contained the words \u201cshall make\u201d instead of \u201cmay make.\u201d\nHeld: The appellant company has no statutory right to the allowance claimed by it under section 5(1)(a).\u2014That section gives the Minister a discretion not merely as to the amount but also as to whether any allowance for exhaustion should be made. Moreover, it is significant that Parliament, by the amendment in 1940, changed the imperative word \u201cshall\u201d as contained in the Revised Statutes to the permissive word \u201cmay\u201d. Pioneer Laundry and Dry Cleaners Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue [1940] A.C. 127, ref.\nJudgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada ([1946] Ex. C.R. 211) affirmed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], affirming the decision of the Minister of National Revenue disallowing a claim by the appellant company for an allowance for exhaustion of timber limits.\nS. Bruce Smith K.C. for the appellant.\nG. W. Auxier and J. G. McEntyre for the respondent.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Taschereau JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin J.:\u2014The appellant in this appeal against a decision of the Exchequer Court of Canada, D. R. Fraser and Company Limited, complains that the Minister of National Revenue has made no allowance for the exhaustion of its timber limits in connection with its income tax for the year 1941 and bases its claim to such allowance upon section 5, subsection 1(a) of the Income War Tax Act, R.S.C. 1927, chapter 97, which since the amendment by section 10 of chapter 34 of the Second Session of 1940 reads as follows:\n5. \u201cIncome\u201d as hereinbefore defined shall for the purposes of this Act be subject to the following exemptions and deductions:\n(a) The Minister, in determining the income derived from mining and from oil and gas wells and timber limits, may make such an allowance for the exhaustion of the mines, wells and timber limits as he may deem just and fair, and in the case of leases of mines, oil and gas wells and timber limits the lessor and lessee shall each be entitled to deduct a part of the allowance for exhaustion as they agree and in case the lessor and lessee do not agree the Minister shall have full power to apportion the deduction between them and his determination shall be conclusive ; In the Revised Statutes, paragraph (a) read as follows:\n(a) Such reasonable amount as the Minister, in his discretion may ; allow for depreciation, and the Minister in determining the income derived from mining and from oil and gas wells and timber limits shall make such an allowance for the exhaustion of the mines, wells and timber limits as he may deem just and fair;\nThe effect of this clause as to depreciation was considered by the Judicial Committee in Pioneer Laundry and Dry Cleaners Limited v. Minister of National Revenue[2], but immediately after this decision, the part relating to depreciation was removed from paragraph (a) and inserted in section 6 where it is provided that a deduction shall not be allowed in respect of\n(n) depreciation except such amount as the Minister in his discretion may allow, etc. * * *\nWe are not concerned in this appeal with depreciation but with exhaustion and it is significant that Parliament, by the amendment in 1940, instead of the provision in the original clause that the Minister shall make such an allowance for the exhaustion of the mines, wells and timber limits as he may deem just and fair, enacted that he may make such an allowance. I cannot read the change otherwise than as giving the Minister a discretion not merely as to the amount but also as to whether any allowance for exhaustion should be made.\nIn the present case it has been determined by the Minister through his deputy that no such allowance should be made and the Court is not free, even if it so desired, to make one. The appellant complains that allowances have been made in the cases of mines, oil and gas wells, for all saw-logs scaled in the area generally described as west of the Cascade Range of mountains or all saw-logs scaled that go to the salt water of the Pacific, or commonly referred to as the coastal logging area, and also in the case of pulp companies. I have no doubt that the Minister is not required to make an allowance for all classes and the fact that it was thought advisable to provide for allowances in the two last named categories does not give the Court jurisdiction to replace the exercise of the Minister\u2019s discretion with its own. On the face of it many reasons might be advanced for treating mines and gas and oil wells differently from timber limits where there is a natural growth of the trees that are not felled.\nIn this view of the matter it is unnecessary to consider the arguments that were advanced as to whether the appellant who now holds licences from the province of Alberta is a lessee. The reasons for judgment of the Judicial Committee in Minister of National Revenue v. Wright\u2019s Canadian Ropes Limited[3] are now at hand, but there is nothing in them that is of assistance in determining the present appeal which should be dismissed with costs.\nRand J.:\u2014The appellant carries on a lumbering business in the province of Alberta. It holds three agreements with the Government of the province, granting the right to cut lumber of certain dimensions on described areas of land. The company is vested with the right of possession of the lands, subject to reservations which, in my opinion, do not affect the substance of that possession; title to the timber passes upon severance, and the company is entitled to any trees severed by third persons and the value of those growing on portions of the limits withdrawn and put to other uses. Various directive powers are retained by the province designed to enable the Government to bring about the most efficient utilization of the timber. The term is one year, but subject to the fulfilment of its conditions, the agreements are renewable from year to year while the quantity remains commercially valuable, indefinitely as to two and until 1950 as to the third.\nA great deal of discussion took place before Cameron J. as well as this Court as to the precise interest created by the agreement. But the specific rights and powers granted seem to me to be sufficient to enable us to deal with it in relation to the questions raised. Although title to the timber passes only on severance, and apart from possession, with the limitation of tree dimensions in cutting and the periods over which the rights extend, it is, I think, impossible to say that the appellant has not some interest in the growth of the trees and so in the land. The income of the company is clearly derived from \u201ctimber limits\u201d, but whether the relation to the Crown is that of lessor and lessee is not an essential feature of the controversy.\nThat question is whether the company has a right to an allowance for exhaustion or depletion under section 5(1) (a) of the Income War Tax Act:\n5. (1) \u201cIncome\u201d as hereinbefore defined shall for the purposes of this Act be subject to the following exemptions and deductions:\u2014\n(a) The Minister in determining the income derived from mining and from oil and gas wells and timber limits may make such an allowance for the exhaustion of the mines, wells and timber limits as he may deem just and fair, and in the case of leases of mines, oil and gas wells and timber limits the lessor and lessee shall each be entitled to deduct a part of the allowance for exhaustion, as they agree and in case the lessor and lessee do not agree the Minister shall have full power to apportion the deduction between them and his determination shall be conclusive;\nThe decision or allowance, under this language, is distributive not only as to the general groups enumerated, but also to classes within the group. In dealing with enterprise of such dimensions, the right or administrative power created can only mean that Parliament had in mind a flexible applicability; any other intention must have been indicated by language of specific limitation.\nThe Crown\u2019s position is, first, that the grant of an allowance lies entirely within the discretion of the Minister, and alternatively, that deductions sufficient to satisfy any right given by the statute have already been claimed and allowed in income returns submitted.\nI think it necessary, at the outset, to clarify the conception of what is intended by the paragraph. The company in its business acquires timber limits for the purpose of their operation, terminating in the sale of milled lumber. It does not purchase either the land or the standing timber outright, but it holds an interest through the agreements mentioned. For that, as to two of the berths, it has paid, first, what is known as the price of the berth, a sum generally competitive, for the grant of the interest; then, what are called \u201ctimber dues\u201d, in this case a charge of so much on each 1,000 feet board measure of the lumber produced; and finally, ground rent, taxes, fire rates, etc. The third was acquired under competitive bidding of dues payable, plus the last items. For the operation itself, there are the disbursements for mills, plant, roadways, bridges, wages and other usual expenses. Accounting principle which allocates outlays to capital and operation, conceives capital in two forms, fixed and working or circulating. So far as fixed assets may be partially consumed or worn out during the operation, the principle of depreciation applies and excludes that element of capital from net income; obsolescence similarly takes care of wastage in operating value. Ordinary working capital is kept intact by return from gross income. There remains what may be called consumable or wasting capital.\nHere the distinction between capital and assets becomes material. Capital is essentially the funds brought together for the purpose of setting the enterprise under way; but in dealing with depreciation, depletion or obsolescence, the attention is directed primarily to the asset or property by which it is represented. In relation to these elements of accounting, however, the asset must be regarded in terms of its capital value. Normally that value is cost and is conceived as distributed throughout the property; and for depletion we must look to the property in the aspect of that value unless by the terms of the statute or by the discretion of the Minister some other basis is prescribed or allowed.\nIn the present case, admittedly the company has recovered by way of deductions from its income all of the outlay, capital and operating, which it has put into the business. What is contended is that it has a valuable asset in the standing timber; that the capital employed in the operations and allowed was deductible as expense necessary to earning the income; and that the right to depletion is in respect of the remaining asset over and above any capital investment.\nThe express language of the statute throws little light on what is intended. Section 6 (1), paragraphs (a) and (6) are as follows:\n6. (1) In computing the amount of the profits or gains to be assessed, a deduction shall not be allowed in respect of\n(a) disbursements or expenses not wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income;\n(b) any outlay, loss or replacement of capital or any payment on account of capital or any depreciation, depletion or obsolescence, except as otherwise provided in this Act;\nThe implication of (a) seems to be that all disbursements or expenses \u201cwholly, exclusively and necessarily\u201d laid out or expended to earn the income are deductible items; and (6) appears to deal only with fixed capital assets; and it is not wholly clear whether the deductions in this case were claimed or allowed under 6 (a) or 5 (1) (a).\nUnder accounting theory, depreciation and obsolescence in fixed assets may, perhaps, be looked upon as value used up \u201cwholly, exclusively and necessarily\u201d in the earning of the income and so expenses to be taken into the account; but they are not mathematically measurable and resort is necessary to such standards as will approximate the averages in experience. For that reason, allowances for these two items must be brought within some judgment and hence we have them removed from the general field of expense and made subject to the Minister\u2019s determination.\nA further complexity arises in enterprise in which investment takes not only the ordinary and commercial risks, but also risks of physical speculation. Large sums of money are spent in sinking mining pits and building plants or drilling oil or gas wells; but the recoverable quantities of these substances are in fact largely unknown. Virtually the total funds of a company may be committed exclusively to a venture of uncertain production and length of life. On what basis can there be assurance of the recovery of outlay in such case \u201cwholly, exclusively and necessarily\u201d made before a net gain can be said to have been reached? It is this desideratum that the allowance for exhaustion is, I think, intended to supply. It calls for judgment of experience; and considering the unknown factors in the complication of actual operations in the mining industry, and the different accounting methods or measures by which the object in view might be attained, any award made by the Minister \u201cas just and fair\u201d on that broad basis of fact would be unchallengeable.\nWe have thus three items of necessary expense, depreciation, obsolescence and exhaustion placed in the discretionary judgment of the Minister; and with the general operating expense, they constitute the debit to be made against gross income before profit is reached. But just as clearly, if they are in fact included as general expense, they cannot be duplicated under these special deductions.\nNow, Parliament might have in mind the extension of such an allowance beyond capital value as a means of stimulating enterprise in these fields; that for the risk of investing $100,000 in a gold mine, in addition to the provision of return of the investment, and as a bonus to the industry, a measure of further exemption from taxation in the net profit should be made. This would place on the Minister the duty of administering the Act for a purpose foreign to its main object. No doubt the economic health of these particular industries is sensitive to a tax on income; but having regard to the purpose and structure of the Act, the allowance to be given is not, in my opinion, intended to conflict with the principle of taxation of the net gains. If that were not so, I should expect to see the statutory language clear and precise.\nThe evidence on discovery of Mr. Elliot, representing the respondent, particularly where he indicates the considerations presented to the Department by the mining interests, does not support the appellant\u2019s contention. What these interests were seeking was security against the failure of an operation to return the funds committed to its hazard, but that has nothing to do theoretically with the making of allowances out of what is otherwise admittedly net income.\nIt is, therefore, sufficient to say that whatever the effect of depletion allowance may, in particular cases, be, it nevertheless is designed only to enable the Minister broadly in time, factors and basis, to afford assurance of the recovery of investment committed to the risk undertaken. But what is to be the basis of returnable value? For instance, cost may be inapplicable to property demised: special considerations might affect it in mining ventures, and, as in the United States, place it either at the fair market value at the time of discovery, or a value ultimately ascertained by a percentage of gross return. But, apart from the latter, where there has in fact been a return of basic value or investment, the warrant for allowance has been removed. If here the measure, under the statute, is to be taken to be cost, then without more the case for the appellant disappears.\nEven conceding an absolute right to an allowance, it is necessarily bound by the limitation of value spread evenly over the asset as a whole; and since the statute does not prescribe the basis, the Minister must be free in any case to adopt one reasonably designed to carry out the purpose intended. On this assumption, I take the word \u201cmay\u201d to include a discretion in that choice; and that the basis of actual capital investment may be used by him in any case is, I think, beyond doubt. Ordinarily the increments of return would attach to every unit of asset and value, but here the whole has been recovered by relation to part only of the asset.\nIt is objected that in a case of logging operations in British Columbia, an allowance for exhaustion was made and it is urged that the statute implies an equality of treatment to all operators which has here been denied. But the evidence falls far short of establishing a similarity of conditions sufficient to raise the question of equality; and as the lumber industry as a whole is not a single unit for discretionary treatment, no foundation for the complaint has been laid.\nThe appeal should, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nEstey J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment in the Exchequer Court of Canada affirming the Minister\u2019s decision refusing an allowance for exhaustion of timber limits in the appellant\u2019s 1941 income tax assessment.\nThe appellant carries on the business of logging and general milling in the province of Alberta. In the 1941 tax year it cut timber upon three timber limits under licences from the Government of Alberta and numbered respectively 1161, 1727 and 6722. The appellant has been a licensee of timber limit no. 1161 since 1904, and of no. 1727 since 1912, at first in association with others but in the year 1941 and for years prior thereto it was the sole licensee. In 1940 the appellant became the licensee of timber limit no. 6722. These licences are from year to year with a right in the licensee, upon compliance with the conditions specified, to renew from year to year (now by 1939 S. A., c. 10, s. 49 (e) not renewable after the tenth year). These licences give to the licensee exclusive possession of the premises and the property in timber as and when cut.\nIn 1941 the appellant claimed as a deduction in determining its income tax an allowance for the exhaustion of these timber limits under section 5(1) (a) of the Income War Tax Act, 1927 R.S.C., c. 97, which the Minister disallowed. Section 5 (1) (a) reads as follows:\n5. \u201cIncome\u201d as hereinbefore defined shall for the purposes of this Act be subject to the following exemptions and deductions:\u2014\n(a) The Minister in determining the income derived from mining and from oil and gas wells and timber limits may make such an allowance for the exhaustion of the mines, wells and timber limits as he may deem just and fair, and in the case of leases of mines, oil and gas wells and timber limits the lessor and lessee shall each be entitled to deduct a part of the allowance for exhaustion as they agree and in case the lessor and lessee do not agree the Minister shall have full power to apportion the deduction between them and his determination shall be conclusive.\nThe Minister affirmed his disallowance as follows:\nThe Honourable the Minister of National Revenue having duly considered the facts as set forth in the notice of appeal, and matters thereto relating, hereby affirms the said assessment on the ground that the taxpayer is not entitled to an allowance under the provisions of subsection (a) of section 5 of the Income War Tax Act for the exhaustion of timber limits owned by the Crown in right of the province of Alberta on which the taxpayer has been licensed to cut timber. Therefore on these and related grounds and by reason of other provisions of the Income War Tax Act and Excess Profits Tax Act the said assessment is affirmed.\nAt the trial the Crown set up a further reason for this disallowance by amending its defence as follows:\n17. That in the years prior to the taxation year 1941 the Minister has allowed to the Appellant amounts for exhaustion which have enabled the Appellant to recover, free of income tax, its entire cost of any timber licences or permits held by it, and in making the said allowances the Minister has exercised the discretionary power vested in him by the provisions of section 5 1 (a) of the Income War Tax Act.\nThe learned trial judge found as follows:\nAs I have found, the appellant is not the owner of the timber being exhausted, and has no depletable interest therein. In addition, it has already benefited by deductions from its income over a period of years of all costs which could possibly be called capital costs (as well as all costs of operation) and, therefore, by such deductions, has been allowed to keep its capital investment intact. And while, apparently, the appellant had never previously claimed these deductions as depletion under section 5 (1) (a), but rather by way of depreciation or as disbursements or expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income, they were in fact allowed. The result was that the appellant was eventually able to write off its full capital investment.\nThe appellant does not dispute these findings of fact but submits that under section 6 (a) it was entitled to deduct the costs of acquiring timber as disbursements or expenses wholly, exclusively and necessarily laid out or expended for the purpose of earning the income. Further, that the allowance for the exhaustion of timber limits under section 5 (1) (a) is an allowance unrelated to costs or to the nature of its holdings in the land; that under this section if the income is derived from timber limits, then in the determination of the assessment an exhaustion allowance must be made. This it suggests is supported in the view that lumbering is an extractive industry, short-lived and hazardous both from an economic and operating point of view and therefore:\n* * * Parliament, probably because of these hazardous conditions and the short life of the ordinary extractive industry made this extra allowance for exhaustion over and above and completely unrelated to cost of the product or substance and the land from which it is extracted.\nThe record in this case justifies the conclusion that Parliament had in mind some such considerations and concluded that the ordinary methods of determining depreciation (which prior to the amendment was in the same section) and other appropriate allowances were not always adequate to deal with the investments in a business subject to such risks as lumber, but it must not be overlooked that section 5 is dealing with exemptions and deductions, and there is no suggestion that the allowance is to be treated as other than a deduction or an exemption.\nThe language of the section supports the appellant\u2019s contention that its interest in the land as lessee, licensee or otherwise (except in cases of leases where provision is made for apportionment) is not the material consideration but rather that its income is derived from timber limits which is here admitted.\nThe appellant\u2019s contention then is that when its income is derived as it is here in 1941 from timber limits it has a statutory right to an exhaustion allowance under section 5 (1) (a), or as its counsel otherwise states his contention:\n* * * the Minister had an administrative duty of a quasi judicial character to make a reasonable allowance for the exhaustion of timber limits to those who derive their income from timber limits.\nThis submission is made upon the authority of the Privy Council decision in Pioneer Laundry & Dry Cleaners Limited v. Minister of National Revenue[4], where Lord Thankerton stated at p. 136:\nThe taxpayer has a statutory right to an allowance in respect of depreciation during the accounting year on which the assessment in dispute is based. The Minister has a duty to fix a reasonable amount in respect of that allowance * * *\nThat decision was made under section 5 (1) (a) prior to the amendment thereof in 1940. The section prior to that amendment read:\n5. \u201cIncome\u201d as hereinbefore defined shall for the purposes of this Act be subject to the following exemptions and deductions:\n(a) Such reasonable amount as the Minister, in his discretion, may allow for depreciation, and the Minister in determining the income derived from mining and from oil and gas wells and timber limits shall make such an allowance for the exhaustion of the mines, wells and timber limits as he may deem just and fair; * * *\nAs amended by 1940 Dom., c. 34, s. 10, the section reads in part as follows:\n10. Paragraph (a) of subsection one of section five of the said Act, as amended by section four of chapter twelve of the statutes of 1928, is repealed and the following substituted therefor:\n(a) The Minister, in determining the income derived from mining and from oil and gas wells and timber limits may make such an allowance for the exhaustion of the mines, wells and timber limits as he may deem just and fai,...\nThis 1940 amendment deleted the provision relative to depreciation from this section and as amended placed it in section 6 (n). That part with respect to timber limits was left in section 5 (1) (a) but the word \u201cshall\u201d, where it appears before the phrase \u201cmake such an allowance\u201d, was changed to \u201cmay\u201d. The section, therefore, as it now reads gives to the taxpayer no statutory right to an allowance as it did with respect to a reasonable amount (with reference to depreciation), but leaves the question of \u201can allowance for the exhaustion\u201d to be dealt with by the Minister. The Minister first decides whether he may make \u201csuch an allowance\u201d for the exhaustion of the timber limits and if he so decides, then he must fix an amount that \u201che may deem just and fair\u201d. The effect of this amendment is that the Minister may, not that he must, make such an allowance and therefore there is no absolute statutory right to an exhaustion allowance. The fact that the permissive word \u201cmay\u201d is used would justify this conclusion under section 37 (24) of the Interpretation Act, 1927 R.S.C., c. 1, but in this instance it is emphasized by the fact that Parliament changed the imperative word \u201cshall\u201d to the permissive \u201cmay\u201d. Conger v. Kennedy,[5]; Corporation of the City of Ottawa v. Hunter,[6].\nIt was suggested that the concluding words of section 5 (1) (a) \u201chis determination shall be conclusive\u201d meant that the Minister\u2019s determination should be final. It would appear rather that these words relate only to a disagreement which may arise between the lessor and the lessee, in which case the Minister makes the apportionment and \u201chis determination shall be conclusive\u201d. It does not refer back to the earlier part of the section dealing with the granting or refusing of an allowance.\nThe nature and character of the duties imposed upon the Minister under this section 5 (1) (a) would appear to be unchanged by the amendment. They remain, as stated by Lord Thankerton in Pioneer Laundry & Dry Cleaners Limited v. Minister of National Revenue[7]:\n* * * so far from the decision of the Minister being purely administrative and final, a right of appeal is conferred on a dissatisfied taxpayer; but it Is equally clear that the Court would not interfere with the decision, unless, as Davis J. states, \u201cIt was manifestly against sound and fundamental principles.\u201d\nIf, therefore, granting as the respondent contends, the Minister now has discretion to make or refuse an allowance, the question still remains, did he in exercising that discretion violate sound and fundamental principles?\nThe amended statement of defence set out that the Minister in determining the assessment for income tax in the year 1941 refused an exhaustion allowance because the appellant had, by virtue of previous allowances, been allowed free of income tax its entire cost of any timber licences or permits. In the exercise of his discretion the Minister therefore decided that no further exhaustion allowance should be made in 1941. Counsel for the respondent contended that these allowances prior to 1941 could not have been made under any of the provisions of section 6 but only under those of section 5 (1) (a). The learned trial judge intimated that these allowances were claimed under section 6 but in fact, and this is not disputed, these amounts were allowed, and as the learned judge found:\n* * * it has already benefited by deductions from its income over a period of years of all costs which could possibly be called capital costs (as well as all costs of operation) and, therefore, by such deductions, has been allowed to keep its capital investment intact.\nIt seems that even if these allowances were made under section 6, it is nevertheless open to the Minister in the exercise of his discretion to conclude, after giving to the parties every opportunity to present their views (which he did in this case), that in a given case the taxpayer has received so much by way of either depreciation or exhaustion allowances that no further exhaustion allowance should be made. Certainly the record here indicates that there is at least this relation between depreciation and exhaustion that they are both deductions or allowances with respect to capital investments and that in exercising his discretion with respect to an exhaustion allowance the Minister may take into consideration all allowances already made in relation thereto. As previously-intimated, it is the hazardous nature of the industry that makes these determinations so difficult and therefore the whole matter is left in the discretion of the Minister. The statute therefore under section 5 (1) (a) imposes no obligation upon the Minister to make an exhaustion allowance and it would seem that in arriving at his decision he may take into account any facts or circumstances certainly related to the capital investment in order to arrive at his decision.\nThis exhaustion allowance being a matter entirely in the discretion of the Minister, and he having arrived at his conclusions as above indicated, I am not prepared to say that he violated any sound and fundamental principles. The other or alternative basis suggested in the Minister\u2019s affirmation of the disallowance, that he had refused the allowance because the appellant was not the owner of the timber limits, raises questions of an entirely different character with regard to which in exercising his discretion it is not necessary to here determine.\nIn the course of argument it was suggested that the Minister in refusing the exhaustion allowance in 1941 acted in an arbitrary if not a discriminatory manner. In support of this it was pointed out that he had made such allowances in other extractive industries, such as coal mines and the mines of precious metals and even to lumber interests in the Cascades. It is surely a notorious fact that conditions with respect to both mining and lumbering vary materially in different parts of Canada. This fact, together with the difficulty in determining what the allowance should be in any given case, no doubt caused Parliament to leave the problem to be dealt with by the Minister and in a way that he could exercise his discretion either with respect to different extractive industries, to geographical divisions or individual cases. The fact that those engaged in the lumbering industry in the Cascades area or in any other area are treated on a basis different from those operating in Alberta or some other part does not in any way suggest discrimination but merely corroborates what has been established in this case, that the great differences with respect to the operation of the industry in different parts are such as may justify a variation in the allowances, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary it cannot be concluded that the decisions arrived at are either arbitrary or discriminatory.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Smith, Cl\u00e9ment, Parlee & Whittaker.\nSolicitor for the respondent: W.

Bender, [1947] S.C.R. 172\nDate: 1947-02-04\nHis Majesty The King Appellant;\nand\nGermain Bender (Suppliant) Respondent.\n1946: October 7; 1947: February 4.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin, Taschereau, Kellock and Estey JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nCrown\u2014Workmen\u2019s Compensation\u2014Negligence\u2014Employee of the Crown (Dom.) awarded compensation, in accordance with provisions of Government Employees Compensation Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 30, as amended in 1931, c. 9), by Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission of Province of Quebec for injuries suffered in Quebec\u2014Right of employee further to claim damages against the Crown under s. 19(c) of Exchequer Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 34)\u2014Whether such right affected by provisions of Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of Quebec\u2014 Whether doctrine of election applies.\nAn- employee of the Crown (Dom.) who has, under the Government Employees Compensation Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 30, as amended in 1931, c. 9), claimed and received compensation for personal injuries by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment is not thereby barred from pursuing a claim for damages against the Crown for such injuries under s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 34).\nThe said enactments are not repugnant to each other; they deal with two entirely different matters; s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act applies only where negligence is shown; while the Government Employees Compensation Act applies whether or not negligence on anyone\u2019s part is proved; the right thereunder arises, not out of tort, but out of the workman\u2019s statutory contract.\nIn the present case, the accident occurred in the province of Quebec, and, in accordance with provisions of said Government Employees Compensation Act, compensation was awarded by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission of Quebec. S. 15 of the Quebec Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (R.S.Q. 1941, c. 160) enacts in effect that the only recourse of a workman against his employer by reason of accident to him by reason of or in the course of his work for such employer is for compensation under that Act.\nHeld: Said s. 15 of said Quebec Act is not (nor is s. 13(1) of that Act nor art. 1056(a) of the Civil Code) made applicable by the provisions of s. 3(1) of said Government Employees Compensation Act. What was determined by the Quebec Commission was the amount of compensation the right to which was given by said s. 3(1) of said Dominion Act, and not the resulting effects upon other rights against the Crown given by a different Dominion Act. Said s. 15 of the Quebec Act is not incorporated in the Government Employees Compensation Act. (Per Kellock J.: While it is true that the \u201cliability\u201d is to be determined under provincial law, yet once the case is brought within the class where liability exists^ the reference to the provincial Act is exhausted and such a provision as that in said s. 15 is not made applicable). Cases affirming the proposition that the law of the province in which an accident occurred is applicable in determining the Crown\u2019s liability under s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act have no application in determining whether a claim made and allowed under the Government Employees Compensation Act deprives a claimant of his remedy under the Exchequer Court Act. The two enactments deal with entirely different matters and separate and distinct rights are conferred.\nAn alternative contention by the Crown that, assuming that claims under both Acts existed, the claimant was put to his election, and, having claimed and received compensation under one Act, he had waived any right he might have under the other, was rejected. While there was but the one injury, the causes of action were different and the doctrine of election, did not apply.\nJudgment in the Exchequer Court, [1946] Ex. C.R. 529, on a question of law, affirmed.\nAPPEAL by the Grown from the judgment of Thorson J., President of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1], holding, on a question of law argued before trial of the action, that an employee of the Crown, who has, under the Government Employees Compensation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 30 (as amended in 1931, c. 9), claimed and received compensation for injuries arising out of and in the course of his employment is not thereby barred from pursuing his claim for damages for such injuries under s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act.\nThe suppliant was employed in the province of Quebec by the Inspection Board of the United Kingdom and Canada, the employees of which were, by Order in Council, brought under the provisions of the said Government Employees Compensation Act. The accident causing the injuries occurred on June 7, 1941, in the province of Quebec, and the suppliant was awarded compensation, in accordance with provisions of the said Government Employees Compensation Act by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission of the Province of Quebec. In the present action the suppliant claimed damages against the Crown (under s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act), alleging that his injuries were the result of negligence of officers or servants of the Crown. The present question of law was, in effect, whether, assuming the acts or omissions alleged in the petition of right to be established, a petition of right lay.\nL. A. Pouliot, K.C. and C. Stein for the appellant.\nFernand Choguette, K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin, Taschereau and Estey JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014In this appeal from a judgment of the Exchequer Court answering affirmatively a question of law set down for disposition before the trial of the action, it is necessary to notice what that question of law was and the amendments made in the Exchequer Court to it and to the petition of right. But first, for a proper understanding of the matter, the substance of the allegations in the petition of right which, of course, must be taken as established, should be set forth.\nWhile in the employment of the Inspection Board of the United Kingdom and Canada, the suppliant was injured on June 7, 1941, in the Province of Quebec. Paragraphs 3 and 13 of the petition of right originally read as follows:\n3. Que votre requ\u00e9rant se trouvait ainsi \u00e0 l\u2019emploi tant du Conseil d\u2019Inspection du Royaume-Uni et du Canada (Inspection Board of the United Kingdom and Canada) que du Minist\u00e8re des Munitions et Approvisionnements (Munitions and Supply Department) et du Gouvernement de Sa Majest\u00e9 pour le Canada;\n13. Que cette compensation est d\u00e9risoire en comparaison des dommages subis par votre requ\u00e9rant qui a ainsi perdu son avenir et son int\u00e9grit\u00e9 physique, \u201calors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait au service de Sa Majest\u00e9 et de la D\u00e9fense Nationale de son pays:\u201d\nOn the argument of the question of law in the Exchequer Court, the petition of right was amended by striking out paragraph 3, and that part of paragraph 13 which appears in quotation marks. Paragraph 9 also was amended by inserting the words \u201cserviteurs ou employ\u00e9s\u201d in lieu of the word \u201cpr\u00e9pos\u00e9s\u201d in the following sentence: \u201cQue cet accident est attribuable \u00e0 la n\u00e9gligence grossi\u00e8re et inexcusable des pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s de Sa Majest\u00e9\u201d. It results from these amendments that what is alleged is that the suppliant was employed by the Inspection Board and, while in its employment, was injured through the negligence of the servants or employees of His Majesty,\u2014the claim being made under section 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act as i amended in 1938:\n19. The Exchequer Court shall also have exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine the following matters:\n(c) Every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment.\nAlthough it is not alleged that the suppliant claimed compensation through the Quebec Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, there is an award by the latter, dated June 17, 1942, granting the suppliant a monthly sum of $54.16 and another award, dated July 21, 1943, granting him an additional monthly sum of $15.00 down to May 7, 1944. On the other hand, the allegation by the suppliant in his petition of right is merely that he had received $50.00 per month with an additional sum of $30.00 to pay for the services of a nurse., As a matter of fact it was only by Order of the Governor General in Council, P.C. 37\/1038, dated February 9, 1942, that the provisions of the Government Employees Compensation Act, R.S.C. 1927, chap. 30, as amended, was made to apply to each of certain persons (including the suppliant) \u201cwho has been, is now, or may hereafter be employed by the Inspection Board during the period of their employment in Canada to the same extent and in like manner as if each such person was an \u2018employee\u2019 as defined in the said Act\u201d. It was further provided by the Order in Council that, as to such persons, it should be deemed to have come into force and operation as and from November 6, 1940. It will be recalled that the suppliant was injured on June 7, 1941. While the petition of right was filed May 23, 1942, that is before either of the two awards made by the Quebec Board, it alleges that the $50.00 per month and the sum of $30.00 were paid through the intervention of the Quebec Board.\nWe were told that in the Exchequer Court the point was argued as to whether the claim advanced is against a different party to the suppliant\u2019s employer,\u2014a distinction being drawn between the Inspection Board and His Majesty the King. However, in the reasons for judgment, after directing that the question of law be amended by striking out the references therein to Exhibits D-3, D-4 and D-5 and adding the necessary reference to Exhibit D-3a, and identifying the compensation received by reference to Exhibits D-6 and D-7, it is stated:\nIn effect, the question of law is whether the suppliant, having claimed and received compensation for his injuries under the Government Employees Compensation Act, R.S.C. 1927, chap. 30, as amended in 1931, can have any claim for damages for such injuries under section 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, chap. 34, as amended in 1938.\nFurthermore, in the formal order it is recited that the action came on before the Court \u201con the argument on the question of law as to whether the suppliant, an employee of the Crown, who has claimed and received compensation,\u201d etc.\nUnder these circumstances, it should be assumed for the purpose of this appeal, but for that purpose only, that the suppliant was an employee of the Crown and that he claimed and received compensation under the Government Employees Compensation Act. In that situation it has been decided in the Exchequer Court that, notwithstanding the latter circumstance, a petition of right for damages lies under section 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act. With that conclusion I agree.\nSubsection 1 of section 3 of the Government Employees Compensation Act, R.S.C. 1927, chapter 30, as amended by chapter 9 of the 1931 Statutes, reads as follows:\n3(1). An employee who is caused personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment, and the dependents of an employee whose death results from such an accident, shall, notwithstanding the nature or class of such employment, be entitled to receive compensation at the same rate as is provided for an employee, or a dependent of a deceased employee, of a person other than His Majesty under the law of the province in which the accident occurred for determining compensation in cases of employees other than of His Majesty, and the liability for and the amount of such compensation shall be determined subject to the above provisions under such law, and in the same manner and by the same board, officers or authority as that established by such law for determining compensation in cases of employees other than of His Majesty, or by such other board, officers or authority, or by such court as the Governor in Council shall from time to time direct: Provided that the benefits of this Act shall apply to an employee on the Government railways who is caused personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment, and the dependents of such an employee whose death results from such an accident, to such an extent and such an extent only as the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of the province in which the accident occurred would apply to a person in the employ of a railway company or the dependents of such persons under like circumstances.\nAs we have seen, by virtue of the provisions of Order in Council PC. 37\/1038, dated February 9, 1942, this subsection applied to the suppliant because he had been employed by the Inspection Board. Assuming as I do that he claimed and received compensation under the Government Employees Compensation Act, it must also be taken as established that he had been caused personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment. The payment of such compensation is not dependent upon the injury having been caused by negligence. The Government Employees Compensation Act was first enacted in 1918 by chapter 15, at which time the forerunner of paragraph (c) of section 19 of the Exchequer Court Act (as enacted by chap. 33 of the 1917 Statutes) read as follows:\n(c) Every claim against the Crown arising out of any death or injury to the person or to property resulting from the negligence of any officer or servant of the Crown while acting within the scope of his duties or employment upon any public work.\nThe amendment made in 1938 to the Exchequer Court Act struck out the words at the end \u201cupon any public work\u201d.\nIt cannot be ascertained from the petition of right whether the negligence of the Crown\u2019s servants or employees complained of occurred while they were upon any public work, nor does it appear whether these officers or servants were members of the naval, military or air forces of His Majesty in right of Canada so as to fall within section 50A of the Exchequer Court Act as enacted in 1943 by chapter 25. It can make no difference, however, whether the applicable provision of the Exchequer Court Act be taken to have been enacted before or after the first Government Employees Compensation Act of 1918. At whatever stage the two enactments are compared, it is clear that they are dealing with two entirely different matters, since the Exchequer Court Act applies only where negligence is shown, while the Government Employees Compensation Act applies whether negligence on any one\u2019s part is proved or not. The appellant contends that since section 3 of the Government Employees Compensation Act provides that the suppliant is thereby\nentitled to receive compensation at the same rate as is provided * * * under the law of the province in which the accident occurred * * * and the liability for and the amount of such compensation shall be determined subject to the above provisions under such law,\nsections 13(1) and 15 of the Quebec Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, R.S.Q. 1941, chapter 160, and Article 1056(a) of the Quebec Civil Code are made applicable. These enactments read as follows:\nQuebec Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act:\n13(1). No action before any court of justice shall lie for the recovery of the compensation whether it is payable by the employer individually or out of the accident fund, but all claims for compensation payable by the employer or out of the accident fund shall be heard and determined exclusively by the Commission, whose decision shall be final.\n15. Accidents happening on or after the 1st of September, 1931, shall be governed by the provisions of this act and the compensation under this act shall be in lieu of all rights, recourses and rights of action, of any nature whatsoever, of the workman, of the members of his family, or his dependents against the employer of such workman by reason of any such accident happening to him on or after the said 1st day of September, 1931, by reason of or in the course of his work for such employer, and no action in respect thereof shall lie in any court of justice.\nArticle 1056(a) of the Quebec Civil Code:\nNo recourse provided for under the provisions of this chapter shall lie, in the case of an accident contemplated by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, 1931, except to the extent permitted by such Act.\nThe article of the Code does not advance the matter beyond the situation under the Quebec Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, but it is alleged that section 15 of the latter does not deal with a consequential matter but determines the essential nature of the compensation payable under that Act and the liability imposed thereby. On the basis of that argument, it is contended that the decision of this Court in Ching v. Canadian Pacific Railway Company[2] is not applicable. It was there decided that an employee of the Dominion, having received compensation under the Government Employees Compensation Act through the intervention of the Alberta Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, could still claim damages against a third party, whose employees had negligently caused the injury complained of. It is pointed out at page 458 that the important words of subsection 1 of section 3 of the Dominion Act are \u201cand the liability for and the amount of such compensation shall be determined * * * in the same manner and by the same board\u201d and it is stated that\nit is the liability of the Dominion Government to pay and the amount of the compensation, the right to which is given earlier in the section, which are to be determined; not the resulting effects upon collateral rights against third parties.\nIn the present case, where, for the purpose of the present appeal, the right claimed is against the same party, it should also be held that what was determined by the Quebec Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board was the amount of the compensation the right to which is given earlier in subsection 1 of section 3 of the Government Employees Compensation Act, and not the resulting effects upon other rights against the Crown given by a different Dominion statute. Section 15 of the Quebec Act is not incorporated in the Dominion Government Employees Compensation Act.\nSuch cases as Ryder v. The King[3], The King v. Armstrong[4], and The King v. DesRosiers[5], affirming the proposition that the law of the province in which an accident occurred is applicable in determining the Crown\u2019s liability under section 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act, have no application in determining whether a claim made and allowed under the Government Employees Compensation Act deprives a claimant of his remedy under the Exchequer Court Act. The two enactments are dealing with entirely different matters since, as Viscount Haldane pointed out in connection with the British Columbia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act in Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board v. Canadian Pacific Ry. Co.[6], the right under the Compensation Act arises, not out of tort, but out of the workman\u2019s statutory contract. Separate and distinct rights are conferred and the present claim is not barred.\nAn alternative submission by the appellant was that, assuming that claims under both Acts did exist, the suppliant was put to his election, and having claimed and received compensation under one Act, he had waived any right he might have under the other. However, while there is but the one injury, the causes of action are different and the doctrine of election does not apply.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs and without prejudice to the right of the suppliant to contend that he was employed by a party other than the Crown.\nKellock J.\u2014This is an appeal from a judgment or order of the Exchequer Court, dated 2nd August, 1946, determining a question of law which, shortly stated, may be said to be whether or not the respondent is entitled to maintain this action for damages for personal injuries under section 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act, in view of the fact that he has been awarded, and is in receipt of compensation in respect of these injuries under the Government Employees Compensation Act, R.S.C, ch. 30, as amended by 21-22 Geo. V., ch. 9.\nThe Petition of Right which, for the purpose of the above question, must be taken as admitted, alleges that the respondent was on the 7th June, 1941, in the employ of the Inspection Board of the United Kingdom and of Canada and that on that date he sustained the injuries complained of through the negligence of servants of the appellant. It is further alleged that in respect of these injuries the respondent was awarded certain compensation by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board of the Province of Quebec, payable in instalments, but that such payments were entirely inadequate to compensate the respondent. It appears from the award of the Board that the respondent was totally and permanently disabled as a result of the injury complained of. The question of law came before the learned President of the Exchequer Court, who held that the award and payment of compensation did not disentitle the respondent to maintain the action.\nIn support of the appeal it is argued in the first place that payment of compensation under the Government Employees Compensation Act in respect of an accident in the Province of Quebec is in lieu of all rights, recourse and rights of action of any nature whatsoever against His Majesty by reason of the accident in respect of which compensation was paid. This contention is based upon the view that section 15 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of Quebec, being Ch. 160, R.S. 1941, which is to the above effect, is made applicable in the circumstances by the provisions of section 3 of the Dominion Act. The relevant portions of section 3 as enacted by the amending statute of 1931 are as follows:\n3. (1) An employee who is caused personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment * * * shall, notwithstanding the nature or class of such employment, be entitled to receive compensation at the same rate as is provided for an employee * * * of a person other than His Majesty under the law of the province in which the accident occurred for determining compensation in cases of employees other than of His Majesty, and the liability for and the amount of such compensation shall be determined subject to the above provisions under such law, and in the same manner and by the same board, officers or authority as that established by such law for determining compensation in cases of employees other than of His Majesty * * *\n\u201cEmployee\u201d, as defined in section 2, includes persons in the service of His Majesty who are paid a direct wage or salary by or on behalf of His Majesty, with certain exceptions not applicable in the case at bar. Some discussion arose during the argument as to whether or not the respondent was in fact a servant of His Majesty, but as the question of law was dealt with below upon the basis that he was, the appeal should be similarly dealt with, leaving it open to the parties to raise the question at the trial if such question is otherwise open.\nAs provided by section 3, an employee of His Majesty suffering injury by accident is entitled to receive compensation at the same rate as an employee of a person other than His Majesty would be entitled to receive under the law of the province in which the accident occurred (in the case at bar, in the province of Quebec); and the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board of the province is to determine the liability for, and the amount of such compensation. Such determination is to be made under the provincial law in the same manner as is established by such law for the determination of cases of employees other than of His Majesty. The phrase \u201csubject to the above provisions\u201d in subsection (1) of section 3 refers to the condition laid down in the early part of the subsection, that the personal injury must be injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment.\nSection 15 of the provincial Act provides that the compensation \u201cunder this Act\u201d is to be in lieu of all other rights of action of the workman against his employer, but I see nothing in the Dominion Act which incorporates or makes this provision of the provincial Act applicable to a claim for compensation arising under the terms of the Dominion Act. It is true that the \u201cliability\u201d is to be determined under provincial law. No doubt, if an employer other than His Majesty would have no liability to pay compensation, e.g., \u201cwhere the injury is attributable solely to the serious and wilful misconduct of the workman\u201d (section 3(1)(b)), neither would the Crown in similar circumstances be liable to pay compensation to its employee. But once the case is brought within the class where liability exists, the reference to the provincial Act is exhausted and such a provision as that in section 15 is not made applicable. While the decision of this Court in Ching v. Canadian Pacific Railway Company[7] does not specifically cover the question arising in the present case, the principle of that decision is in accord with the view above expressed. At page 458 Rand J., in delivering the judgment of the Court, said: \u201cIt is the liability of the Dominion Government to pay and the amount of the compensation, the right to which is given earlier in the section\u201d, which are to be found by reference to provincial legislation \u201cunencumbered by a referential incorporation of provisions of the provincial Act dealing with consequential matters\u201d.\nSubsection 1 of section 13 of the provincial Act is also appealed to by appellant but, in my opinion, that section has no application. The present proceeding is not an action for the recovery of compensation within the meaning of that subsection. Much the same may be said of section 1056(a) of the Civil Code.\nAppellant contends further that under section 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act the result contended for is attained and that the law of Quebec which is to be applied in determining the liability of the Crown includes all provisions of provincial legislation which would provide a defence to a private employer with respect to a claim for compensation under the provisions of the provincial Act. Ryder v. The King[8] and similar authorities are cited. This argument is not, in my opinion, well founded. While it is true that by the law of Quebec a workman entitled to \u201cworkmen\u2019s compensation\u201d is not, because of the provisions of the provincial legislation already discussed, entitled to any other remedy against his employer, the respondent here is not affected. He is not entitled to \u201cworkmen\u2019s compensation\u201d under the provincial law but under the Dominion statute and., for the reasons already given, the provisions of the provincial legislation which would bar a workman claiming compensation thereunder do not apply.\nIt is further argued that the Government Employees Compensation Act is a special Act covering pro tanto the same ground as the provisions of the general Act, i.e., section 19(c), and, as Parliament cannot have intended that a person injured should be compensated twice, the provisions of the special statute derogate from those of the general. In the first place it is to be observed that an affirmative statute does not repeal an earlier affirmative statute unless the statutes are repugnant to each other: Foster\u2019s Case[9], approved in Garnett v. Bradley[10]. In West Ham Churchwardens v. Fourth City Mutual Building Society[11], A.L. Smith, J. said:\nThe test of whether there has been a repeal by implication by subsequent legislation is this: Are the provisions of a later Act so inconsistent with, or repugnant to, the provisions of an earlier Act that the two cannot stand together?\nIn the case at bar the statutes are not so repugnant.\nIt may well be that it is not the necessary result of the concurrent operation of the two statutes that, in a case such as the present, the respondent will be paid twice in respect of the same injury. In Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co.[12], which arose under the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of British Columbia, it was held that the right to compensation under the statute was the result of a statutory condition of the contract of employment providing for a scheme of insurance. See also Trim v. Kelly[13], per Lord Haldane, L.C., at 675-6. If this insurance here in question is to be regarded as an indemnity against loss of wages and other expense which the injured workman incurs by reason of his injury, it may be that the appellant, being at one and the same time the tort-feaser and the person liable to pay the compensation, may be entitled to have the benefit of the compensation paid in case of any damages for which it may be liable. If the compensation is not to be regarded as in the nature of an indemnity, then on the principle of such cases as Bradburn v. Great Western Railway[14]; Dalby v. India, etc., Co.[15]; Millard v. Toronto R. W. Co.[16]; Tubb v. Lief[17], the respondent will be entitled to compensation and damages. It is not necessary to decide the point on this appeal. I mention this aspect only in connection with the argument that if both statutes stand it will follow as of course that the respondent will recover both the compensation and also damages in full.\nIt is finally contended on behalf of the Crown that the respondent is obliged to elect as between his right to compensation and the present action and, having claimed compensation, is bound by his choice. In support of this contention, appellant refers to Wright v. London General Omnibus Company[18]. I do not think this case has any application to the case at bar. In Wright\u2019s case the matter was governed by the particular statute there in question, where the remedies open to the plaintiff were expressly stated to be in the alternative. The other authorities to which appellant refers are also not in point. Election is defined in Wharton\u2019s Law Lexicon, 12 Ed., page 317, as: \u201cthe obligation imposed upon a person to choose between two inconsistent or alternative rights or claims.\u201d I see nothing in the legislation here in question casting any obligation upon the respondent to choose as between his right to compensation arising out of his contract with his employer and the right under a statute giving him in common with all other persons injured by the negligence of a servant of the Crown a right of action to recover the damages sustained by reason of such negligence; Campbell v. Bowes (1); Zimmerman v. Harding (2). The fact that the Crown happens to be the employer and also the wrongdoer does not affect the question.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs (without prejudice to right of suppliant to contend that he was employed by a party other than the Crown).\nSolicitor for the appellant: F.

While riding, in performance of his duties, on the foot board on the front of an engine on the Board\u2019s terminal railway in Vancouver British Columbia he was injured by being struck by a gate negligently left by respondent\u2019s servants open and projecting on to said railway. Under provisions of The National Harbours Board Act (Dom., 1936, c. 42) and the Government Employees Compensation Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 30 and amendments) C when so injured became entitled to receive compensation from the Crown, to be determined under provisions of the latter Act and in accordance with such provisions he was awarded sums by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board of British Columbia. For the sums so awarded, which were paid or set aside for payment by the Crown (through said Compensation Board) to C, the Crown sued respondent.\nHeld: The Crown\u2019s action failed on the ground of remoteness; in law, its payment to C under its statutory obligation was not a loss suffered as a direct consequence of respondent\u2019s negligence. Also the Crown could not recover in this case on the basis of an action per quod servitium amisit, as neither the action as framed nor evidence in the case supported a claim on that basis. (Appeal from judgment in the Exchequer Court, [1946] Ex. C.R. 375, dismissed.)\nAPPEAL by the Attorney-General of Canada from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Sidney Smith, Deputy Judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada [1] dismissing the action brought by His Majesty the King on the information of the Attorney General of Canada against the present respondent in which the Crown claimed the sum of $13839077, being the amount which the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board of British Columbia, in accordance with provisions of The National Harbours Board Act (Dom., 1936, c. 42) and the Government Employees Compensation Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 30, and amendments thereto), determined to be the amount of compensation to which one Christian a switchman in the employ of the National Harbours Board (which is, by statute, an agent of the Crown in the right of the Dominion of Canada), became entitled because of injury suffered by him while acting in the course of his employment. The injury was caused when the said Christian, while riding upon the foot board on the front of an engine on the National Harbour Board\u2019s terminal railway at Vancouver, British Columbia, was struck by a gate which as found by the trial Judge, was left negligently by the respondent\u2019s servants ajar and projecting over the said railway. The trial Judge\u2019s dismissal of the action was on grounds as follows:\nWhat is here sought is the recovery of monies which by an Act of the Dominion Parliament the Crown is made liable to pay to its injured servant * * * such an action will not lie. The compensation cannot be regarded as legal damages for it is not the proximate and direct result of the act complained of * * * The liability of the Crown (Dominion) to pay the compensation arises from an independent intervening cause, namely an Act of the Dominion Parliament, which lies wholly outside the common law of the province * * * The compensation in question is compensation to an injured, servant, payable by the Crown and is in no sense compensation in the form of damages to the Crown for the loss to His Majesty of a servant\u2019s services. Nor is it claimed as such.\nF. A. Sheppard K.C. and W. R. Jackett for the appellant.\nC. F. H. Carson K.C. and D. I. McNeill K.C. for the respondent.\nKerwin J.\u2014On January 15, 1942, Hubert William Christian a switchman in the employ of the National Harbours Board while engaged in the performance of his duties on the National Harbours Board Terminal Railway main line in the Province of British Columbia was injured as a result of the negligence of the servants of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company. By The National Harbours Board Act, 1936, chapter 42, the Board was created a body corporate and politic and declared to be the agent of His Majesty in His right of the Dominion of Canada. By subsection 2 of section 4 the Government Employees Compensation Act, R.S.C. 1927, chapter 30, is made to apply to the employees of the Board and by the latter Act, as amended by chapter 9 of the 1931 Statutes, an employee who is caused personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment is entitled to receive compensation at the same rate as is provided for an employee of a person other than His Majesty under the law of the province in which the accident occurred for determining compensation in cases of employees other than of His Majesty. In accordance with these provisions Christian was awarded by the British Columbia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board the sum of $959.76 compensation for lost time $523.50 for medical aid the sum of $150 in cash and for permanent disability, $49.98 per month for life. The first three amounts were paid by the Board and also the monthly sum from October 20, 1942, to the 30th of September 1945, which was the last month before the trial on October 16, 1945. This monthly sum will continue during Christian\u2019s lifetime. Under the procedure adopted by the Board and the Dominion Government a certain sum of money is kept on hand with the Board and it is out of this sum that the first three items were paid.\nBy information in the Exchequer Court, the plaintiff claimed from the respondent the total of these three items (the second of which was stated to be at the time the information was filed $511.20 but which, by the date of the trial had been increased to $523.50). The plaintiff also claimed the sum of $12218.11 which was the amount considered by the Board to be necessary to be set aside to pay the monthly pension for life to a man of Christian\u2019s age thirty-seven. It does not appear whether that particular sum was placed on deposit by the Dominion Government with the Board or whether merely sufficient funds were in their hands to include such a figure. In any event the pension would cease upon Christian\u2019s death.\nThe argument on behalf of the appellant before this Court covered a wide field, including a contention that the plaintiff would at common law have a right to bring an action per quod servitium amisit. This is not such an action. It is not alleged that the plaintiff lost Christian\u2019s services. On the contrary, in paragraph 7 of the information it is stated that:\nBy virtue of the said Government Employees Compensation Act the Plaintiff was obliged to compensate the said Christian for the said injury in am amount to be determined by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board of the Province of British Columbia and the said Board did determine the compensation to be paid to the said Christian in respect of his said injury at the sum of $13,839.07 * * *;\nand in paragraph 8:\nThat the said accident to the said Christian the injury received by him and the damage sustained by the Plaintiff by reason of the obligation so imposed on the Plaintiff to make payment of the aforesaid compensation were caused solely by the negligence of the Defendant * * *\nFurthermore, it appears from Christian\u2019s testimony that at the date of the trial he was employed as a telephone operator with the National Harbours Board and there is no evidence as to what extent the Harbours Board lost his services. It is therefore unnecessary to consider what would happen in an action brought on that basis.\nNor was the claim put on any alleged right that the plaintiff might have under or by virtue of the British Columbia Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act as an employer whose employee had been injured through the negligence of a third party. If it had been, the question of the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court to hear the action might have been raised. Even on the basis of the action as actually framed, the respondent suggested in its factum a doubt as to that Court\u2019s jurisdiction but before us counsel declined to set up or argue such a point and nothing therefore is said upon it.\nReliance was placed by the appellant upon the decision of the Court of Appeal in England in Re Polemis and Furness, Withy and Co. [2], and on Lord Russell of Killowen\u2019s statement in Hay (or Bourhill) v. Young [3]:\nIn considering whether a person owes to another a duty a breach of which will render him liable to that other in damages for negligence it is material to consider what the defendant ought to have contemplated as a reasonable man.\nOpinions in the House of Lords in the latter case differed and no doubt there will be cases when it will be necessary to consider the effect of both decisions but this is not one of them. More to the point is the unanimous judgment of the House of Lords in Liesbosch (Owners of) v. Edison (Owners of) [4], delivered by Lord Wright. It was there held that in assessing the amount of damages payable by the owners of the steamer Edison as solely to blame for the loss of the plaintiff\u2019s dredger, the Liesbosch, any special loss or extra expense due to the financial position of the parties could not be considered because, as it is put at page 460, \u201cthe appellants\u2019 actual loss in so far as it was due to their impecuniosity arose from that impecuniosity as a separate and concurrent cause, extraneous to and distinct in character from the tort.\u201d It is true that the cause referred to was an antecedent cause but in the Hay case [5], Lord Wright speaking for himself alone and referring to the Polemis case [6], after stating that the second point therein decided, not for the first time but merely reiterated that the question of liability is anterior to the question of the measure of the consequences which go with the liability, proceeded: \u201cIt must be understood to be limited however to \u2018direct\u2019 consequences to the particular interest of the plaintiff which is affected. Liesbosch (Owners) v. Edison (Owners) [7] illustrates this limitation.\u201d\nIn the present case, if the plaintiff\u2019s property had suffered damage as a result of the negligence of the respondent\u2019s employees the plaintiff would undoubtedly have a good cause of action but Christian was not the property of the plaintiff. The payment by the plaintiff in accordance with the Government Employees Compensation Act is not a \u201cdirect\u201d consequence to the particular interest of the plaintiff which is affected but is too remote.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs\nTaschereau J.\u2014This is an appeal from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Sidney Smith sitting as a judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada, dismissing with costs the appellant\u2019s action in damages.\nThe appellant was the owner of a terminal railway, known as the National Harbours Board Terminal Railway running east and west and parallel to a spur track leading into the British Columbia Sugar Refinery, in the City. of Vancouver in the Province of British Columbia On the 15th of January, 1942, one Hubert William Christian, who was riding upon the foot board on the front of the engine and who was an employee of the Railway was the victim of a serious accident while in the performance of his duties. As a result of this mishap one of his legs had to be amputated. The accident was caused by a heavy iron gate, owned by the respondent, which hung from a hinged post immediately north of the terminal railway. Swinging clockwise, it hit Christian who was in front of the engine.\nChristian was a servant of the Terminal Railway and by virtue of The National Harbours Board Act, the Government Employees Compensation Act is made applicable to the employees of this railway. Under the provisions of that statute, employees employed by His Majesty the King, and who receive injuries arising out of and in the course of their employment, are entitled to a compensation determined by the provincial Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, and the amount of that award is to be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The relevant part of the Government Employees Compensation Act reads as follows:\nAn employee who is caused personal injury by accident arising out of and. in the course of his employment, and the dependents of an employee whose death results from such an accident, shall, notwithstanding the nature or class of such employment, be entitled to receive compensation at the same rate as is provided for an employee, or a dependent of a deceased employee, of a person other than His Majesty under the law of the province in which the accident occurred for determining compensation in cases of employees other than of His Majesty, and the liability for and the amount of such compensation shall be determined subject to the above provisions under such law, and in the same manner and by the same board officers or authority as that established by such law for determining compensation in cases of employees other than of His Majesty, or by such other board, officers or authority or by such court as the Governor in Council shall from time to time direct: Provided that the benefits of this Act shall apply to an employee on the Government railways who is caused personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment, and the dependents of such an employee whose death results from such an accident to such an extent, and such an extent only, as the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of the province in which the accident occurred would apply to a person in the employ of a railway company or the dependents of such persons under like circumstances.\nAs a result of the injury which he suffered, Christian was paid by His Majesty the King, the present appellant, a compensation in the following amounts:\nPayments on account of total temporary disability, Jan. 15\nto Oct. 20, 1942 ........................................................................\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..$ 959.76\nMedical aid payments .........................................................................................511.20\nPension award for partial permanent disability:\nLump sum .............................................................. $ 150.00\nCapitalized pension per month ($49.98) for life.. 12,2181.11\n12,3681.11\nTotal ............................................................................................................. $13,839.07\nHis Majesty the King on the information of the Attorney General of Canada brought action to recover this amount from the Canadian Pacific Railway but the claim was dismissed in the Exchequer Court. It is alleged that the accident of which Christian was the victim was caused by the negligence of the Company respondent, and it is not disputed that such negligence was the determining cause of the accident. It is also admitted that if Christian had sued the respondent Company for damages, he could have recovered on the ground that his injury was the direct result of the negligence of an employee of the respondent.\nIt is further conceded by the respondent that His Majesty the King, in his capacity of employer, would have a right of action at common law against the respondent, if the servant was so injured as to be unable to perform his service for the appellant. The gist of such an action by the appellant would not then be the injury to the servant but the loss of service to the employer. The right of His Majesty the King to institute a per quod servitium, amisit action under the circumstances of the case could not be successfully denied.\nBut the present action is not an action per quod. The loss of services has not been pleaded and the case has not been fought on that basis. There is no claim that the appellants servant has been so injured as to incapacitate him from performing his service for the appellant. Paragraph 7 of the information filed by the Attorney General is quite unambiguous:\n7. That the said Christian was an employee in the service of the Plaintiff and was paid a direct wage or salary or on behalf of the Plaintiff and was thereby an employee within the meaning of the Government Employees Compensation Act 1927, R.S.C. Cap. 30 as amended by 1931 S.C. Cap. 9, or alternatively was an employee of the National Harbours Board and therefore deemed an employee of the Plaintiff as defined by the Government Employees Compensation Act by reason of the National Harbours Board Act, 1936, S.C. Cap. 42, Sec. 4, S.S. 2, and the said Christian was caused personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of his employment. By virtue of the said Government Employees Compensation Act the Plaintiff was obliged to compensate the said Christian for the said injury in an amount to be determined by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board of the Province of British Columbia and the said Board did determine the compensation to be paid to the said Christian in respect of his said injury at the sum of $13839.07, computed as follows: [itemized amounts].\nIt is because the plaintiff compensated his employee Christian as he was bound to do under the Government Employees Compensation Act, that the present Information has been filed. It is to recoup himself for the disbursements made in the discharge of a statutory obligation, that the appellant seeks to recover from the respondent.\nThe question would be trifling if the amounts paid to Christian by the appellant had been compassionate allowances or pensions, left to the discretion of the employer. The claim for such amounts against the author of the injury would unquestionably fail. But the right to compensation given to the victim of an accident is an accessory to his contract of employment. As the Privy Council said in Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board v. C.P.R. [8], this right \u201carises, not out of tort but out of the Workman\u2019s Statutory contract\u201d. It is a benefit conferred on the employee as a result of his employment. In the case at bar, Christian had a right to claim compensation, and the appellant had the obligation to pay.\nWhen the House of Lords dealt with the Amerika case [9] their Lordships had to consider facts which were different from those which give rise to the present controversy, but the law which was applied is, I think, relevant.\nOne of His Majesty\u2019s submarines was run into and sunk by a steamship, and the crew were drowned. The Commissioners for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom took action against the owners of the ship, and claimed as an item of damage the capitalized amount of the pension\u2019s payable by them to the relatives of the deceased men. It was held that the claim failed and one of the grounds for dismissing it was that the pensions were voluntary payments in the nature of compassionate allowances. Lord Parker of Waddington said at page 42:\nThese pensions and allowances are granted under statutory authority, but it does not appear that their grant formed any part of the contract between the Admiralty and the seamen whose lives have been lost through the respondents\u2019 negligence. They are, it seems, compassionate pensions and allowances only, which, from a legal standpoint, the Admiralty might have granted or withheld at its discretion Under these circumstances they cannot constitute an item of damage\nAnd Lord Sumner, at page 60, also said:\nIn the present case the sums claimed were paid to widows and other dependants of the drowned men under Admiralty Regulations (pars. 1974 A1 and 2011A), which expressly declare that these are compassionate payments, and granted of grace and not of right both in kind and in degree. True that in such cases they are always made and most properly made, but none the less the money claimed was lost to the Exchequer directly because the Crown through its officers was pleased to pay it. In the Amerika case as it appears by the above citations the payments made to the relatives of the victims were voluntary while in the present instance they were the effect of a binding statutory contract. But I do not think that this distinction can influence the final outcome of this case.\nIn the same speech already referred to Lord Parker also said, at page 42:\nBut further, even if the pensions and allowances in question were granted pursuant to contracts between the Admiralty and the deceased seamen, I should still be of opinion that they could not properly constitute an item of damage for loss of service\nAnd dealing with the same point Lord Sumner expressed his views as follows, at page 61:\nHad the present action been brought upon a contract it might well be the case that three payments would have been within the contemplation of the contracting parties, but they are not the natural consequences of the tort which is sued for. Nor would it have assisted the appellants\u2019 case if they could have established that the making of these compassionate allowances by the Crown was in the nature of a contractual obligation. In any case the contract would have been a contract with the deceased man and the damages must be measured by the value of his services which were lost not by the incidents of his remuneration under the terms of his contract of employment. Just as the damages recoverable by an injured man cannot be reduced by the fact that he has effected and recovered upon an accident policy (Bradburn v. Great Western Ry. Co. [10]), and those recovered under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act are not affected by the fact that his life was insured, so conversely a master cannot count as part of his damage by the loss of his employee\u2019s services sums which he has to pay because his contract of employment binds him to pay wages to the servant while alive and a pension to his widow when he is dead. The appeal is enterprising and has been of considerable interest but I think it fails.\nThe action of the Admiralty against the Amerika was not an action per quod, although it was argued as if it were. It was an action to recover the amounts of pensions voluntarily paid to relatives of the victims. But it seems that the language used by their Lordships is clear enough to allow us to conclude that even if these pensions had been paid under a statutory obligation, as in our case, the claim of the Admiralty to recoup itself would fail on the ground of remoteness.\nDamages, in order to be recoverable must be the direct consequences of the fault of the offending party. When the prejudice complained of does not normally flow from the act of the tort feasor or as Pollock (The law of Torts. 13th Ed., pp. 31-32) says, \u201cwhen some new factor intervenes which is unconnected with the original culpable act or default,\u201d liability ceases.\nIn the present case the amounts claimed cannot in my view be regarded as damages in the true legal sense. The obligation imposed upon the employer to compensate his injured employee does not naturally arise from the act of the respondent. The loss sustained by the appellant is attributable to an independent cause, intervening between the tortious act and its logical consequences. It is this new intermediate cause which is the source of the appellant\u2019s obligation. It may be that the negligence of the respondent was the occasion which set in motion the Government Employees Compensation Act, but, as Lord Sumner said in the Amerika case [11], the accident was the \u201ccausa sine qua non\u201d, but it was not the \u201ccausa causans\u201d of the damages which the plaintiff now seeks to recover.\nThe appeal should, I think, be dismissed with costs.\nRand, J.\u2014The Crown puss its claim on four grounds: first that the act of leaving the gate overhanging the harbour property was a trespass, and workmen\u2019s compensation to the injured employee was consequential damage; next, that injury to an employee and the statutory obligation on the Crown to pay compensation must be taken to be within the contemplation of probable consequences of the tortious act and so to create a duty direct to the Crown; the third is a general proposition that if the consequences of a wrongful act of A toward B give rise to damage to C through an obligation in law toward B, a right arises in C to reimbursement from the wrongdoer; and the last is the right of a master to recover for injury to the servant by what is known as a per quod action.\nI think the first two must be rejected on the principle of remoteness both as to liability and damages. The consequences of an act by reason of which a duty of care arises are a chain of occurrences reasonably and probably flowing from the act, affecting general interests, and uniform in scope toward all persons; special interests issuing from legal relations are in general outside of that range; Cattle v. Stockton Waterworks Co. [12]. This exclusion would not be affected by the fact that here the liability to pay compensation arises from a statute; the relation of employer and employee is special, and the inclusion of the injured person within the contemplation of probabilities arises from his right to be on the land, not his being employed by the owner; a fortiori, the resulting statutory obligation is beyond that scope; and these considerations exclude any direct duty on the part of the Pacific Company toward the Crown based on negligence.\nThe object of damages is to repair a person to the extent to which the economy of his life has been prejudiced by the negligent act, but the difficulty lies in the inherent limitations to which an ascertainment of them is subject. Theoretically it involves a prevision in all its vicissitudes of the life with and without the injury. But the estimation becomes rapidly one of conjecture as we pass beyond immediate effects; and in the language used by Blackburn J. in Cattle v. Stockton Waterworks, supra, at p. 457 quoting Coleridge J. in Lumley v. Gye [13],\nCourts of justice should not \u201callow themselves, in the pursuit of perfectly complete remedies for all wrongful acts, to transgress the bounds, which our law in a wise consciousness as I conceive of its limited powers, has imposed on itself, of redressing only the proximate and direct consequences of wrongful acts.\u201d\nAs results of the trespass then the damages claimed come thus under the ban of remoteness.\nThe proposition set forth in the third ground is closely related to that of the second. The difference lies in the exclusion of contemplated consequence in the former and its inclusion in the latter. The former is therefore of an absolute nature.\nBut it is a proposition for which we have been furnished with no authority. As formulated, it was, in my opinion, rejected by the House of Lords in Simpson v. Thomson [14], where at p. 289 Lord Penzance uses these words: But if this be true as to injuries done to chattels, it would seem to be equally so as to injuries to the person. An individual injured by a negligently driven carriage has an action against the owner of it. Would a doctor it may be asked who had contracted to attend him and provide medicines for a fixed sum by the year also have a right of action in respect of the additional cost of attendance and medicine cast upon him by that accident? And yet it cannot be denied that the doctor had an interest in his patient\u2019s safety. In like manner an actor or singer bound for a term to a manager of a theatre is disabled by the wrongful act of a third person to the serious loss of the manager. Can the manager recover damages for that loss from the wrongdoer? Such instances might be indefinitely multiplied, giving rise to rights of action which in modern communities, where every complexity of mutual relation is daily created by contract, might be both numerous and novel.\nand I see no difference in principle between an interest arising by contract and one by statute, where the latter in substance merely adds a beneficial condition to the contract.\nIt was sought to be supported by the case of McFee v. Joss [15]. There the owner of an automobile was by statute under an absolute liability for damage wrongfully caused by the automobile in the hands of a person whom he had permitted to use it. There were, therefore, two distinct rights in the injured person arising out of the same act and covering the same area of damages; there was also a contractual relation between the owner and the wrongdoer in circumstances that would imply an indemnity toward the owner; and as between the two rights on equitable principles that against the wrongdoer was primary. But the scope of liability here is quite different between the corresponding rights: the whole of the damage is recoverable from the tort-feasor, but only a portion by way of compensation; there is no implied indemnity because\u2014a fact sufficient here\u2014the parties are strangers to each other; in the former case the statutory liability made the tortious act of the wrongdoer that of the owner, but the obligation under the Compensation Act arises from injury to the employee, the particular act which brings it about is not attributed to the employer and the liability exists whether that act is tortious or innocent: McMillan v. Canadian Northern Ry. Co. [16].\nThere remains the rule by which a master recovers for injuries inflicted upon his servant. As it has been many times remarked this right is an anomalous survival from social conditions in which the servants belonged to the household and their relation to the master was more of the nature of status than contractual. But with the evolution of individualism the economic and remedial position of the employee has long since changed and as it is to-day as ample to protect his interests as those of the employer. Such an anachronism should, therefore, be held to the precise limits within which it has been established.\nWhat are those limits? I think it clear that they are confined to the value to the master of the services actually lost, and to those incidental outlays such as medical and hospital expenses made by him which naturally follow from personal injury; but they do not include pain and suffering or the impairment of earning capacity.\nNow it will be seen that to a considerable extent these items are common to the damages recoverable by the servant. In the ordinary case where wages are paid as work is done, a direct consequence is the loss of earnings; but in that case the only interest of the master would be the sum by which the service was in fact of a greater value than he was paying for it. That would be the maximum recoverable, and both parties apparently could maintain actions accordingly. It might be that the master has remunerated the servant in advance and in such a case his recovery would exhaust that particular item: Osborn v. Gillett [17], per Bramwell B.:\n[The master] sustained damage which may be real and substantial from the valuable character of the service, prepayment of the wages, or otherwise.\nThen it is altogether probable that the master\u2019s recovery of expenses for necessary care arose from the fact that out of the relationship they would ordinarily be borne by him. The same rule was applied to the parent in relation to his child and the husband to his wife In those cases although in the former the right to recover calls for the fiction of service the husband or father is under a legal or a moral duty toward the physical well-being of wife and child, and, apart from exceptional cases, it is by him that the expenses are incurred. But in the general conditions of modern employment, that is not so. This personal interest of the employee has become dissociated from the employment relationship; his credit supports the services rendered; and he only can include the cost of them in his damages.\nNow the compensation provided under the Government Employees Compensation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 30, neither extends to the whole field of recovery by the servant against the wrongdoer nor does it necessarily exhaust the damages in the particular items of loss to which it is related; but the master\u2019s recovery for compensation paid might result in subjecting the third person to greater damages than the total at common law. Since the compensation is partial or at least is not specifically related to the basis of the claim of the servant the rule proposed would result merely in a distribution of the liability of the guilty person, multiplying actions and complicating the quantum recoverable.\nThe payments to the injured workman under the Dominion Act, for medical and hospital expenses are of moneys provided to reimburse the employee; \u201can employee * * * shall * * * be entitled to receive compensation\u201d including such benefits; and they may, as in many cases they do, form only a portion of the actual expenses to which he may be put or which he may voluntarily incur; if they happen to be paid direct by the Crown to the physician or hospital, they are so dealt with as an administrative convenience and security; and in an action by the employee against the wrongdoer, their payment by the Crown would be excluded from consideration; Bradburn v Great Western Ry. Co. [18].\nThen the compensation for disability may be looked upon as insurance, either indemnity or accident: McMillan v. C. N. Ry. supra [19]; or as an incident of remuneration attributed to past services with or without a continuing engagement to work; but however viewed, its effect is the same and in an action by the employee against the wrongdoer, the payment would be unavailable in reduction of damages On the other hand it could not be recovered direct from the wrongdoer by the employer as insurer; London Assur. Co. v. Sainsbury [20].\nBut neither can it represent damage to the employer from loss of service. The question is what follows as a direct and natural result of that loss? The damage might be absolute or the service be fully supplied by new help, and in each case ordinary measures would be applied. But compensation arises from special terms of employment; it is not referable to nor is it a consequence of the loss of service.\nThis conclusion follows dicta in the case of Admiralty Commissioners v. S.S. Amerika [21] in which the facts were quite similar. One of His Majesty\u2019s warships was run down and sunk by a vessel, against the owners of which the Admiralty brought action. Among the items of damage were pensions paid to the dependents of naval ratings lost. Although the House of Lords held the pensions to be voluntary payments and therefore not recoverable under legal damages both Lord Parker and Lord Sumner went further and expressed the view that even had these been obligatory upon the Government, the result would have been the same; their language is significant and I quote it: Lord Parker:\nBut further, even if the pensions and allowances in question were granted pursuant to contracts between the Admiralty and the deceased seamen, I should still be of opinion that they could not properly constitute an item of damage for loss of service. They would in this case constitute deferred payment for services already rendered and have no possible connection with the future services of which the Admiralty had been deprived.\nLord Sumner:\nJust as the damages recoverable by an injured man cannot be reduced by the fact that he has effected and recovered upon an accident policy\u2014Bradburn v. Great Western, Ry. Co. [22]\u2014and those recovered under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act are not affected by the fact that his life was insured; so conversely a master cannot count as part of his damage by the loss of his employee\u2019s services sums which he has to pay because his contract of employment binds him to pay wages to the servant while alive, and a pension to his widow when he is dead.\nThe master then does not recover because those payments have not, in a legal sense, been caused by the wrong against the servant; the wrong is the occasion of their being made; the cause is the contract; and special terms of the contract are irrelevant to damages for loss of service. The disability benefits are paid out of accumulations actual or constructive; the damages remain the direct loss to the employer consequent upon the deprivation of service. The case of Bradford Corporation v. Webster [23] was pressed on us. There a municipal corporation brought action for injuries caused to a police officer and the damages allowed were based on the increased amount of pension and the acceleration of its payment resulting from the injury. Lawrence J. considered the dicta quoted but declined to follow them; but for the reasons given, I must hold that such damages cannot be recovered in an action of this nature.\nOne of the objects of the many forms of insurance by way of compensation, pensions, etc., of these days is to ease the burden on the individual of consequences attendant upon the increasing hazards of complex social and industrial activities. But it would tend to reverse that policy to extend the established liability of the individual for the benefit of these collective interests. Liability is necessary for the essential standards of social conduct but any enlargement of the field which in general rule our legal experience has mapped out should come from the legislature and not the courts.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nKellock J.\u2014Appellant put its case before us first upon the basis of an action per quod servitvum amisit. The question is as to whether or not there is any evidence upon which damages of the kind recoverable in such an action may be assessed In so far as the claim is confined to lost services, damages are to be assessed upon the value of those services to the master; Bradford Corp. v. Webster [24]; Admiralty Commissioners v. S. S. Amerika [25]. In Osborn v Gillett [26] Bramwell B said:\n* * * the plaintiff lost her services and sustained damage which may be real and substantial from the valuable character of the service prepayment of the wages, or otherwise.\nWhat is claimed in this action is:\n(a) Payments on account of total temporary disability January 15 to October 20 1942\u2014$959.76;\n(b) Medical aid payments\u2014$511.20;\n(c) Pension award for partial permanent disability:\nLump sum\u2014$150.\nCapitalized pension per month ($49.98), for life\u2014$12,218.11. All of these items of alleged damage find their basis in those parts of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of British Columbia, R.S.B.C. 1936, cap. 312, which may be said to be incorporated by reference into the Government Employees Compensation Act R.S.C. 1927, cap. 30. Items (a) and (c) are governed by sections 21 and 20, respectively, of the former statute, which provide as to (a) for payment to the injured workman during temporary total disability of an amount equal to two-thirds of his average earnings, and as to (c) an amount equal to two-thirds of the difference between his average earnings before the accident and the average amount which he earns or is able to earn after the accident, or the amount payable may be based upon the nature and degree of the injury having regard to the workman\u2019s fitness to continue in the employment in which he was injured or to adapt himself to some other suitable employment or business. As to (b) this is based upon section 23, which provides for certain medical hospital and other aid. It is to be remembered that the above benefits are to be considered as being called for under a statutory contract between the workman and the appellant; Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board v. C. P. R. [27].\nIn Clerk and Lindsell on Torts, 9th Ed., 249, the authors state:\nIn the case of an ordinary servant the master may recover not merely the actual damage sustained up to the time of action brought but also in respect of the future service which he is likely to lose. It would seem however that he ought to be limited to the period for which he has a binding contract of service. Any further damage founded on a speculation that the service would continue beyond the agreed time would be too remote.\nIn my opinion, the authorities bear out the text. In the Amerika case [28], Lord Sumner said at p. 55:\nIf the contract of service had already determined before the wrongful act had any disabling effect upon the capacity to serve, as might be the case when a wrongful act is done to a servant who is under notice, I take it likewise that the action would not lie. It is the loss of service which is the gist of the action and loss of service depends upon a right to the service and that depends on the contract between the master and the servant.\nIn Hodsoll v. Stallbrass [29], the plaintiffs\u2019 apprentice, who was serving under articles for a term which had still some time to run, was injured by the defendant\u2019s dog and was permanently disabled so that the plaintiffs lost the benefit of his services for the remainder of the term. It was held that the plaintiffs might recover for the loss of service up to the end of the apprenticeship.\nIn Martinez v. Gerber [30], the action was for loss of service through injury to a traveller of the plaintiffs\u2019 as a result of which it was alleged the plaintiffs had to hire another traveller to whom they were obliged to pay \u00a3200 for expenses and wages. A verdict was returned for \u00a363 damages, and upon a motion in arrest of judgment the verdict was sustained. While it did not appear for how long the injured servant was engaged, the declaration stated that he was at the date of the injury \u201cand from thence hitherto had continued and still was\u2019\u2019 the plaintiffs\u2019 servant. Tindal C. J. at p. 91, said:\nThe declaration alleges that Goss was and still is, the plaintiffs\u2019 servant which is sufficient. There was no necessity to state that he was hired at any wages or salary.\nIn a note added by the reporter it is stated:\nThe damage would be the same whether the services of the disabled servant were gratuitous or paid for, supposing the masters to be obliged to hire another, or to do the work themselves, or to leave it undone. The allegation that Goss was and still is the plaintiffs\u2019 servant shows that whilst paying Gassiot, they were entitled to the services of Goss.\nWhile the plaintiffs were obliged to pay Gassiot, the substituted servant, \u00a3200, they recovered only \u00a363, the value placed by the jury upon the services of Goss of which the master was deprived.\nThese authorities show therefore that in order to recover in an action of this kind the master must have been entitled to future services of the servant. It is the value of those services lost which may be recovered. The quantum is for the jury upon all the evidence.\nI cannot find it alleged or proved in the case at bar that the appellant was entitled to any future service subsequent to the injury of its servant, Christian. For that reason alone there appears to be no basis upon which it is possible to assess any damages under heads (a) and (c) of the claim As to (b) the claim is based upon the class of case of which Dixon v. Bell [31] is an example. There Lord Ellen-borough directed the jury that the plaintiff might recover in this form of action the amount of a surgeon\u2019s bill for attending his son which he had paid but not for physician\u2019s fees for which he was not liable.\nTurning to section 23 of the provincial statute, it appears that the term \u201cmedical aid\u201d covers \u201csuch medical surgical hospital and other treatment, transportation, nursing, medicines, crutches and apparatus, including artificial members, as it may deem reasonably necessary at the time of the injury, and thereafter during the disability to cure and relieve from the effects of the injury\u201d as well as a subsistence allowance during treatment away from home.\nSuch expenditures may well cover a much wider field than would be recoverable at common law, particularly in the case e.g., of a servant under notice or having a short term remaining under his contract of employment. Under the statute, however, even though injured during the last hour of his employment a servant would be entitled to the above benefits provided by section 23 as well as to the other items covered by the other sections. I do not think that a claim for \u201cmedical aid payments $511.20\u201d without more can be said in the circumstances of the present case to be within the category of medical expense recoverable in this particular type of common law action.\nIt may be although for the reason just stated it is not necessary to decide the question, that the only relevancy of such a claim in this type of action is that the value of the right on the part of the servant to such a benefit should together with the value of his right to the other items of compensation included in (a) and (c) above, be considered as part of the servant\u2019s remuneration, and hence as evidence of the value of his services to the master, rather than that the actual amounts paid should themselves constitute recoverable damages. Wages paid to the injured servant and if a substitute is hired, to such substitute may well be of some evidentiary value, although not conclusive, in an inquiry as to the value of the services of the injured servant which are lost to the master. From this standpoint what is stated by Lord Sumner in the Amerika case [32] at p. 61:\nA master cannot count as part of his damage by the loss of his employee\u2019s services sums which he has to pay because his contract of employment binds him to pay wages to the servant while alive and a pension to his widow when he is dead.\nand by Lord Parker, at p. 42:\nBut further even if the pensions and allowances in question were granted pursuant to contracts between the Admiralty and the deceased seamen I should still be of opinion that they could not properly constitute an item of damage for loss of service. They would in this case constitute deferred payment for services already rendered, and have no possible connection with the future services of which the Admiralty had been deprived.\nmay be consistent with what is stated by Lawrence J. in Webster\u2019s case [33] at pp. 144-5:\nA pension may, no doubt, be properly regarded as payment for past services but that fact does not exclude it from consideration in estimating the value of the services lost. But for the injuries the services of the constable would have been as valuable after the date of the injuries as they had been before that time. The cost of the services to the plaintiff Corporation was pay, plus the plaintiffs\u2019 contribution to the pension fund. No ground has been suggested for holding that the services were not worth that which was paid for them. If this be so the services which were lost were worth pay plus right to pension.\nAppellant next rests its case upon the submission that, the gate in question being in such close proximity to appellant\u2019s railway, it must necessarily have been foreseen that negligence in failing to fasten the gate would probably cause damage to appellant which imposed a duty toward the latter the breach of which entitled it to damages. Bourhill (or Hay) v. Young [34]; M\u2019Alister (or Donoghue) v Stevenonn [35] and In re Polemis and Furness, Withy & Co. [36] are cited.\nIn whatever circumstances these authorities may be applicable, they are not, in my opinion, relevant here. Merely because appellant has been obliged to pay under a contract between itself and Christian does not render such payment an item of damage for which the person whose wrongful act injured Christian is liable; Simpson v. Thomson [37], per Lord Penzance at 289-290. The decision in Mowbray v. Merryweather [38], to which appellant also refers was a case of breach of contract.\nIt is also contended that the appellant\u2019s claim may be supported upon trespass to its property, the gate having been allowed to project over it, land Gregory v. Piper [39] is cited. Assuming the trespass, the above case is no authority for the proposition that the amount here claimed may be recovered as damages in trespass. I think the claim fails for remoteness on this ground also.\nAs to the argument founded upon the decision in McFee v. Joss [40], the principle applied in the case is stated by Ferguson, J.A., at p. 584, as follows:\nEveryone is re5ponsible for his own negligence and if another is, by a judgment of a court compelled to pay damages which ought to have been paid by the wrongdoer, such damages may be recovered from the wrongdoer.\nIn that case a person injured by the negligence of the defendant Joss in the operation of an automobile belonging to the plaintiff recovered judgment against the plaintiff by reason of a statutory liability resting upon the latter as owner It was held that as the plaintiff had been compelled to pay damages which the defendant ought to have paid the latter must indemnify the former.\nIn the case at bar no liability rested upon appellant in respect of the tort of the respondent. The appellant\u2019s liability arises by reason of a contract between appellant and Christian but no relationship exists between appellant and respondent and no right to indemnity as between them arises.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nEstey, J.\u2014The appellant, the Crown in the right of the Dominion, operates a railway known as the National Harbours Board Terminal Railway in Vancouver, B.C. An employee of this Terminal Railway, H. W. Christian, while acting in the course of his employment was injured because of the negligence of the agents and servants of the respondent Canadian Pacific Railway Company. Under the provisions of The National Harbours Board Act 1936 S.C. c. 42, and the Government Employees Compensation Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 30, and amendments thereto, Christian when injured became entitled to receive, and has received in part, compensation from the Crown as determined under the provisions of the Government Employees Compensation Act. It is the amount of this compensation as so determined that the Crown in this action seeks to recover from the respondent railway.\nThe learned trial judge in the Exchequer Court dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action on the basis that:\nThe compensation cannot be regarded as legal damages for it is not the proximate and direct result of the act complained of (Halsbury, vol. 10, page 103, para. 130; The Amerika [41] at pp. 53 and 61). The liability of the Crown (Dominion) to pay the compensation arises from an independent intervening cause, namely, an act of the Dominion Parliament which lies wholly outside the common law of the Province. (The Circe [42]). The compensation in question is compensation to an injured. servant, payable by the Crown, and is in no sense compensation in the form of damages to the Crown for the loss to His Majesty of a servant\u2019s services. Nor is it claimed as such.\nUpon this appeal counsel for the appellant submitted four different bases upon which he contended this judgment should be reversed:\nOne: That the Crown as owner of the Terminal Railway premises has a cause of action for the recovery of any damages resulting from the negligent swinging of the gate over its premises. The appellant\u2019s and respondent\u2019s railways are so situated at this point that a gate or swinging bar operated and controlled by the respondent was negligently left in such a condition on the early morning of January 15, 1942, that it extended over and upon appellant\u2019s tracks, as a result of which Christian, in the course of his employment riding upon the front of appellant\u2019s engine, was injured. Counsel supported this contention by cases in which actions were brought for injury through trespass: Gregory v. Piper [43]; Pickering v. Rudd [44]; and for personal injury resulting from property left in a dangerous position Reid v. Linnell [45]. The appellant\u2019s action is rather different. Its position is that its employee, Christian, suffered an injury \u201cby accident arising out of and in the course of his employment\u201d because of which he was entitled to and has been awarded compensation under the Government Employees Compensation Act R.S.C. 1927, c. 30 and amendments thereto. It is for the amount of this compensation that the Crown as appellant claims from the respondent. In order to succeed upon this basis it must be established that the payment of this compensation is a direct consequence of respondent\u2019s negligent conduct. The issue is therefore, is this compensation a direct or a remote consequence?\nAs to the rights or claims that Christian personally as the injured party may have against the respondent we are not concerned. The only issue here is whether the compensation awarded under the provisions of the statute and payable by the Crown to Christian, in the absence of any provision in that statute for subrogation or similar provision, may be recovered from the respondent in an action of this type. It is a statutory obligation and seems rather an unrelated consequence, or in the language of Lord Wright in Liesbosch (Owners of) v. Edison (Owners of) [46], \u201ca separate and concurrent cause extraneous to and distinct in character from the tort\u201d of the respondent The compensation payable under this obligation may be looked upon as Lord Weight regarded the impecuniosity of the party suffering the loss in the case just cited as either \u201ctoo remote\u201d or as \u201can independent cause, though its operative effect was conditioned\u201d upon the employee suffering the injury.\nThe observations of Lord Sumner in Admiralty Commissioners v S.S. Amerika [47] support this view.\nTwo: The second basis is upon much the same ground except that counsel suggests the existence of the statutory obligation was a foreseeable consequence. That injury to some person was a foreseeable consequence is not the point. One must go further and conclude that under the circumstances of this case a reasonable man would have foreseen that the employer was under a statutory obligation to provide compensation to its servant in the event of injury from his negligence. The case of Hay or Bourhill v. Young [48] was cited by the appellant. That case is concerned with foreseeability as a factor in determining liability of the negligent party toward one who suffered personal injury at or near the scene of the accident. That, upon its facts is quite a different case. No case was cited which supports the appellant\u2019s contention and the comments already made under the first submission that the damage was either too remote or resulting from an independent cause, are applicable to this submission.\nThree: That whenever the defendant by negligence imposes an obligation on a third party that third party has an action to recover the damages resulting therefrom. In support of this contention is cited McFee v. Joss [49]. There McFee, the owner of an automobile, rented it to Joss who in driving same negligently collided with a car driven by Watson, Watson recovered damages from McFee under the statute by virtue of the fact that he was the owner of the car. Then McFee recovered judgment against Joss for the amounts he had paid to Watson on the basis that he was entitled to be indemnified by Joss. In that case there was a contract between McFee and Joss and therefore a basis for indemnity. Mr. Justice Ferguson, in writing the judgment of the Appellate Court, quoted a statement of Lord Wrenbury in delivering the opinion of the Privy Council in Eastern Shipping Co. Ltd. v. Quah Beng Kee [50]:\nA right to indemnity generally arises from contract express or implied, but it is not confined to cases of contract. A right to indemnity exists where the relation between the parties is such that either in law or in equity three is an obligation upon the one party to indemnify the other.\nIn this case there is neither a contract nor any relation between the appellant and respondent upon which under the authorities an indemnity might be based.\nOther cases are cited, such as Bradford Corp. v. Webster [51], where the actions are by the master for loss of services. The appellant also cites cases where parents have recovered for expenses incurred on behalf of his (or her) injured infant. One of these is Hall v. Hollander [52]. There the father did not recover in his action for loss of services because the infant was incapable of performing services and he had incurred no expense. It is the dictum of Bayley J. that is stressed:\nIn this case too it was proved that the father did not necessarily incur any expense; if he had done so I am not prepared to say that he could not have recovered upon a declaration describing, as the cause of action, the obligation of the father to incur that expense.\nThis dictum has often been quoted and it has been suggested that where the infant resides at home the rendering of services will be presumed. Such observations have reference to the relationship of parent and child and do not assist in the determination of this general submission, particularly in an action so pleaded and conducted at trial as this one.\nIn the absence of any of the above suggested bases the appellant cannot succeed under this submission.\nFour: The fourth ground is that the action per quod servitium amisit is sufficiently broad and inclusive to permit of the appellant\u2019s recovery in this case. The essential difficulty is that the pleadings make no reference to nor is there evidence adduced which would support a claim for loss of services. Then the damages asked are not on the basis of loss of services but rather \u201cthe damage sustained by the plaintiff by reason of the obligation so imposed on the plaintiff to make payment of the aforesaid compensation\u201d. The claim is therefore confined to the payments made because of the statutory obligation and has no relation to any loss of services which may have been suffered by the appellant as master on account of its employee being injured through the negligence of respondent\u2019s servants and agents. The action as framed is on a basis entirely different from that of loss of services.\nIt therefore follows that the appellant cannot succeed upon this basis, and, as already intimated, there does not appear to be any basis upon which the appellant can recover from the respondent. A question as to the jurisdiction of the Exchequer Court to hear this action was raised. It was not pressed but rather we were asked to deal with the case upon its merits. The question of jurisdiction has not, therefore, been discussed.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: F. P.

MOTION by the Crown, before the Honourable Mr. Justice Taschereau in Chambers, for leave to appeal to this Court under section 1025 Cr. C. from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario granting a new trial to the respondent[1].\nW.B. Common K.C. and C.R. Magone K.C. for the motion.\nJ.J. Robinette K.C. contra.\nTASCHEREAU J.:\u2014The respondent was convicted of murder and sentenced to hang, at the Assizes at Hamilton on the 16th of October, 1946.\nShe appealed to the Court of Appeal of Ontario, and a new trial was granted on two grounds, (1) that the learned trial judge made errors of non-direction and misdirection in his charge to the jury and (2) that certain statements alleged to have been made by the respondent to police officers, while in custody, had been wrongly admitted in evidence against her.\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeal of Ontario having been unanimous[2], the Crown now asks for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada under section 1025 of the Criminal Code. It is of course necessary, before I grant leave, that I should be satisfied that the judgment of the Court of Appeal conflicts with the judgment of any other court of appeal in a like case. If such a conflict cannot be found, it is not within my jurisdiction to grant such a leave.\nCounsel for the appellant have cited many judgments and endeavoured to show that the ruling of the Court of Appeal on the admissibility of the confessions, conflicts with the views adopted by other courts of appeal. No judgments of other courts of appeal have been cited that would conflict with the Court of Appeal of Ontario, on the point that there was non\u2011direction and misdirection by the trial judge, in his charge to the jury.\nI am of opinion that this application must be refused.\nBy the unanimous judgment of the Court of Appeal the respondent has obtained a new trial on two grounds. Even if a conflict could be found on the question of the admissibility of confessions, and this Court came to the conclusion that the Court of Appeal were wrong, the respondent would still be entitled to a new trial on the ground of misdirection. In any event, the appeal of the Crown is bound to be dismissed, and it is not the function of this Court to give advisory opinions on matters which cannot affect the final outcome of the appeal.\nEven if I had any doubts on the matter, they would be cleared by the recent decision of this Court in the case of Ouvrard v. Quebec Paper Box Co. Ltd.[3] where, speaking for the Court, my Lord the Chief Justice said:\nThe appellant, in view of the fact that there has been no dissent and that no conflict is alleged, is unable to ask this Court to reverse the judgment of the court of appeal on this fundamental question, and it means, therefore, that, even assuming there is a conflict on the other points raised in the appeal and even if he should succeed in getting this Court to reverse the judgment of the court of appeal on these other points, the respondent would, nevertheless, remain acquitted. The appeal would be devoid of any possible practical result and the Court would be asked only to pass upon an academic question.\nThe application is dismissed.\nLeave to appeal refused.\n[1] [1947] O.R. 105; [1947] 2 D.L.R. 213.\n[2] [1947] O.R. 105; [1947] 2 D.L.R. 213.\n[3] [1945] S.C.R. 1, at 9.\n",

Section 3 of The Jury Act of Alberta provides that \"* * * any inhabitant of the province of Alberta over twenty-five and under sixty years of age * * * shall be liable to serve as a juror in all civil and criminal cases tried by a jury * * *\".\nHeld that persons outside of the age limits prescribed in section 3 are neither qualified nor liable to serve as jurors.\u2014The Jury Act, in that respect, must be taken to be a code intended to embody the law of the constitution of the jury and section 3 by a necessary implication prescribes the qualification of jurors in substitution for that previously existing. Mulcahy v. The Queen (L.R. 3 H.L. 306) dist. APPEAL from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1], on a Reference to the Court as to the interpretation of The Jury Act of that province, and more specially of section 3 of that Act.\nH. J. Wilson, K.C. for the Attorney General of Alberta.\nJohn J. Connolly, appointed by the Attorney General of Alberta.\nThe judgment of Kerwin, Taschereau, Rand, Kellock and Estey J.J. was delivered by\nRAND J.:\u2014This reference raises a question of interpretation of The Jury Act of Alberta, R.S.A. 1922, c. 74. The precise issue is whether persons under 25 and over 60 years of age are competent to serve as jurors, although not bound to do so.\nSection 3 of the Act is the controlling provision and, under the heading \"Liability to serve as juror\", is in these words:\n3. Subject to the exemptions and disqualifications hereinafter mentioned, any inhabitant of the province of Alberta over twenty-five and under sixty years of age, being a natural born or naturalized subject of His Majesty, shall be liable to serve as a juror in all civil and criminal cases tried by a jury in the judicial district or sub-judicial district in which he or she resides.\nPrior to the enactment of chapter 74 the matter was governed by the Northwest Territories Act, section 71 of which was as follows:\n71. Persons required as jurors for a trial shall be summoned by a judge from among such male persons as he thinks suitable in that behalf; and the jury required on such trial shall be called from among the persons so summoned as such jurors and shall be sworn by the judge who presides at the trial.\nBy the general rule at common law, disregarding special cases where aliens were concerned, all male natural born subjects over the age of 21 years, (liberi) probi et legales homines, (Comyn, Challenge A3) were qualified to act as jurors subject to exemptions and challenges. It will be seen, therefore, that section 3 makes an important change by extending the class liable to include women. What, then, are the qualifications of a woman, and where are they to be found? Only in section 3 is there any language from which they may be inferred, the language imposing the conditions of liability; the characteristics : prescribed for that, including the ages mentioned, must, therefore, be the qualifications for the additional class. If that is so and as all men and women liable are designated by the word \"inhabitant\", how can the implication necessary to women be withheld from application to men? Mr. Wilson sought support from the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act passed by the province in 1930, but that can be of no assistance in the interpretation of an enactment of 1921.\nThe statute contains a number of references to qualification, disqualification and liability for service, and that the distinction between these terms was in the mind of the draughtsman is obvious. For instance: Section 5: \"shall be compelled to serve\". Section 6: \"qualified to serve\". Section 7: \"compelled to serve\" * * * \"qualified persons\". Section 8: \"a separate list * * * of persons liable to be returned as jurors\". Section 4: \"shall be exempt from being returned and from serving\". Section 14, form A: \"List of persons liable to be returned and to serve as jurors\". Section 15: \"qualification of the jurors\". Section 17: \"qualification, exemption and disqualification\". Section 36: \"qualification, exemption or disqualification\".\nThese provisions make it clear that the persons to be returned on the sheriff's list are those only who are liable to serve as jurors. The names of persons outside of the prescribed ages should never appear on the list, and it is only persons properly listed who are to be summoned. But it is argued that the judgment in Mulcahy v. The Queen[2], concludes the question. As is generally the case, however, where the question is on a statute, that decision is not in pari materia. In Mulcahy(1) the statute, it is true, directed the sheriff to return only the names of those qualified by the Act, but the qualification prescribed for persons between the ages of 21 and 60 was a property qualification which modified the existing law in that respect, and the affirmative provision was that all persons between the ages mentioned so qualified should be liable to jury service. This was treated as implying that persons over 60 years of age, qualified as to property, presumably by existing law, would be entitled to claim exemption, in contrast to being liable, but not be subject to challenge. It was the distinction between exemption and disqualification. Here, the terms of qualification are those of the conditions of liability, while there each was dealt with separately.\nThe exemption which is suggested for persons between 21 and 25 years of age and over 60 is an implied personal privilege by reason of age alone. Such a privilege was unknown at common law or even under the Statute of Westminster 2, 13 Edw. 1, c. 38; and any reason why there should be attributed to the legislature as an implication from doubtful language the intention to deem a man of 24 years of age to be qualified as a juror, but to sit only if he pleases while his neighbour of 25 should be bound to that duty, has not been made evident to me.\nI take the Act in these respects to be a code intended to embody the law of the constitution of the jury; that section 3 by a necessary implication prescribes the qualification of jurors in substitution for that previously existing; and that person's outside of the prescribed age limits are neither qualified nor liable.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal without costs.\nAppeal dismissed without costs.\n[1] [1946] 2 W.W.R. 271.\n[2] (1868) L.R. 3 H.L. 306.\n",

City of Toronto ([1939] S.C.R. 271) aff.\nMOTION for leave to appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Superior Court for the district of Montreal, in the province of Quebec, Gibsone J., quashing a writ of certiorari issued against the respondents and affirming a judgment of a Recorder of the city of Montreal, which found the appellant guilty of violating a by-law of that city.\nW. G. How for the motion.\nA. Berthiaume K.C. contra.\nThe Court:\u2014This is a motion for leave to appeal to this Court from the judgment of the Superior Court of Montreal. Leave to appeal has already been refused by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side. It is argued on behalf of the applicant that notwithstanding that no right of appeal to the Court of King\u2019s Bench exists from the judgment of the Superior Court, nonetheless this court may grant leave.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada is a statutory court with limited jurisdiction and if it has authority to grant the leave sought, such authority must be found within the terms of the statute. By Geo. VI, c. 42, the Act was amended and the following is now section 37, subsection 3;\nSave as provided by this section, but subject to section forty-four, no appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court except from the highest court of final resort having jurisdiction in the province in which the proceedings were originally instituted.\nIt is not suggested by the applicant that the present motion comes within the terms of section 37 itself and it is admitted that section 44 has no application. Accordingly, by the plain words of the remainder of the subsection there is no appeal except from the \u201chighest court of final resort having jurisdiction in the province\u201d. It is plain from subsection 2 of the section that the \u201chighest court of final resort\u201d having jurisdiction in the province is, in the province of Quebec, the Court of King\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side. Accordingly this court is prohibited from exercising any appellate jurisdiction in an appeal which does not come from the Court of King\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side.\nIt is contended on behalf of the applicant that it is contemplated by section 36 that an appeal lies from a provincial court of original jurisdiction where, for the purposes of the particular proceeding in question, there is no further appeal. Even if there were any ambiguity in the language of that section (and we think there is not) such ambiguity would be resolved by the express language of section 37, subsection 3. In our opinion all that section 36 does is to make it immaterial whether \u201cthe highest court of final resort\u201d has appellate or original jurisdiction, or both. In either event there is to be no appeal except from such highest court and not merely from a court which may be the court of last resort in any particular proceeding.\nThe question of the jurisdiction of this court in a matter such as this has already been determined adversely to the applicant\u2019s contention by the Privy Council in James Bay Railway Company v. Armstrong 1. Their Lordships in dealing with a similar argument there said:\nNow, unquestionably, the Court of Appeal in Ontario is the highest court of last resort having jurisdiction in the province. The High Court is not. It was argued that in this particular case the High Court becomes \u201cthe highest court of last resort\u201d when no appeal lies from it to the Court of Appeal, and it is placed by statute for the purpose in hand on an equal footing with the Court of Appeal. But their Lordships think that that result cannot be attained without unduly straining the words of the statute, and that, except in certain specified cases within which the present case does not come, an appeal to the Supreme Court lies only from the Court of Appeal.\nSince the amendment of the Supreme Court Act in 1937, already referred to, this court has decided the same point in a similar sense in International Metal Industries Limited v. The Corporation of the city of Toronto 2.\nThe application must therefore be dismissed with costs.\nLeave to appeal refused.\n1 [1909] A.C. 624, at 631.\n2 [1939] S.C.R. 271.\n",

S was awarded compensation for herself and her infant son by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board of British Columbia under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, c. 312. She brought the present action (by petition of right) for the benefit of herself and her son under the Families\u2019 Compensation Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, c, 93, claiming damages against the Crown by virtue of ss. 19 (c) and 50A of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 34 (as amended in 1938, c. 28, and 1943, c. 25). S. 11 of said Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act provide for cases where an accident happens in such circumstances as entitle the workman or his dependents \u201cto an action against some person other than his employer\u201d, and subs. 3 thereof provides in effect that, if a workman or dependent claims compensation from said Board, the Board shall be subrogated to the rights of the workman or dependent as against such other person. In the present action the Board was a co-suppliant, pleading its statutory right of subrogation, and also an equitable assignment in writing from S to it.\nHeld: The claiming and acceptance by S of compensation under said Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act did not bar her right to recover, nor affect the amount recoverable, from the Crown in the present action. S. 11(3) of that Act only affected rights as between the dependents and the Board. The direction by the Exchequer Court that the amount it awarded as damages to S should be payable to the Board and the amount it awarded as damages to her son should be paid into court to abide the Court\u2019s order, with liberty to the Board to apply for a declaration as to its rights, was unobjectionable.\nJudgment in the Exchequer Court, [1945] Ex. C.R. 250, affirmed. APPEAL by the Crown from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Sidney Smith, Deputy Judge of the Exchequer Court of Canada [1], in favour of the suppliants against the Crown (in right of the Dominion of Canada) for damages.\nThe action was brought (by petition of right) for damages by reason of the death through accident of Bertram, Snell who was, at the time of the accident, working in the course of his employment as a servant of one Dines, in the province of British Columbia. The accident was caused by negligence of a member of the Canadian military forces while acting within the scope of his duties or employment. The action was brought on behalf of the widow of the deceased and her infant son, under the Families\u2019 Compensation Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, c. 93, and amendments thereto. Prior to the action the widow had claimed and been awarded compensation for herself and her son by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board of British Columbia under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, c. 312. The said Board was a co-suppliant in the action, pleading that it was subrogated, pursuant to provisions of s. 11 of the said Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, to the claims of the dependents, and also pleading an equitable assignment in writing from the widow to it.\nOn behalf of the Crown it was alleged that in consequence of the election by the widow to claim compensation, and payment to and acceptance by her of the monthly award of the Board for herself and her son as compensation for the death of her husband, she had suffered no loss or damage in law which would entitle her to maintain an action against the Crown under s. 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 24 (an alternative submission in the present appeal was that she had no claim except to the extent that the award to her under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act had not fully compensated her); that she had assigned her right of action and, as a result, was not entitled to maintain an action; that the provisions of the said Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act were not applicable to the Crown and that the suppliant Board could acquire no right of action against the Crown by subrogation under that Act.\nThe contentions of the parties are further stated in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported.\nBy the formal judgment in the Exchequer Court it was ordered that the suppliants were entitled to recover from the Crown, as damages suffered by the widow the sum of $13,500 payable to the Board and by them to be dealt with in due course, and as damages suffered by the son the sum of $3,500 to be paid into court to the credit of the suppliants to abide the order of the Court, and that the Board be at liberty to apply to the Court for a declaration that the Board is by subrogation entitled to the said sum of $3,500 and to payment out to them of said sum.\nW. R. Jackett for the appellant.\nF. A. Sheppard, K.C. for the respondents.\nKerwin, J.\u2014On September 29, 1943, Bertram Snell died in consequence of a collision between two motor trucks on a highway in the Province of British Columbia. The collision was occasioned by the negligence of Sapper Neufeld, a member of the military forces of His Majesty in the right of Canada, which negligence occurred while Neufeld was acting within the scope of his duties or employment. At the time, Snell was engaged in the course of his employment in driving a truck of his employer, one Dines, and the collision occurred between that truck and one owned by the Dominion Crown and driven by Neufeld. This Court has not had occasion to pass upon the judgment of the Exchequer Court in McArthur v. The King [2], where it was decided that a member of the Non-Permanent Active Militia of Canada on active service was not an officer or servant of the Crown within section 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act, and it is not now necessary to do so as section 50A of that Act, as enacted by chapter 25 of the Statutes of 1943, provides:\n50A. For the purpose of determining liability in any action or other proceeding by or against His Majesty, a person who was at any time since the twenty-fourth day of June, one thousand nine hundred and thirty-eight, a member of the naval, military or air forces of His Majesty in right of Canada shall be deemed to have been at such time a servant of the Crown.\nFor another reason the date, June 24, 1938, is of importance, as it was then that chapter 28 of the statutes of that year was assented to, by which section 19(c) was repealed and re-enacted but with the omission of the words \u201con any public work\u201d at the end thereof.\nIt has been authoritatively determined that section 19(c) not only conferred jurisdiction upon the Exchequer Court to adjudicate the classes of claims described but also that in such cases liability is imposed upon the Crown to respond in damages for the negligence of its officers or servants where, in like circumstances, such a liability would rest upon a subject corporation or individual according to the law of the province in which the claim arose as that law existed at the time when the Exchequer Court Act began to operate: Canadian National Railway Co. v. Saint John Motor Line Limited [3]. Prior to June 24, 1938, even if Neufeld were an officer or servant of the Crown, a petition of right for, such an occurrence as the one here in question could not have succeeded, since the negligence was not committed during Neufeld\u2019s presence on a public work: The King v. Dubois [4]; The King v. Moscovitz [5]. June 24, 1938, must, therefore, be taken as the date as of which the question must be determined whether in like circumstances a liability would rest upon a subject. At that time there was in force in British Columbia the Families\u2019 Compensation Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, chapter 93, whereby an action for damages for the death of Snell might be brought against the wrongdoer by and in the name of the widow for the benefit of herself and infant son. There was also in force the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, chapter 312.\nA petition of right was accordingly brought against the Crown by the widow for damages for Snell\u2019s death. The accident having happened in such circumstances as entitled a workman\u2019s dependent to an action against some person other than the workman\u2019s employer, and the widow having claimed under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board of British Columbia established thereby is, by virtue of subsection 3 of section 11, \u201csubrogated to the rights of the workman or dependent as against such other person for the whole or any outstanding part of the claim of the workman or dependent against such other person.\u201d The Board also took an equitable assignment in writing from the widow. The Board was joined as a co-suppliant, not as a necessary party,\u2014since the claim is that of the widow on behalf of herself and her infant son\u2014but as a proper party.\nThe dispute of the claim is founded upon the facts that the widow had a right to claim compensation under the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act although she might choose not to exercise it; that she did make such a claim; that the Board ordered that certain monthly sums be paid to her for herself and for the son; and that these sums have been and are being paid. Although it is doubtful if the point is open on the pleadings, it was also argued that even if these circumstances did not defeat the present claim, the compensation awarded under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act should lessen pro tanto the sum awarded by the trial judge.\nIf the appellant\u2019s arguments were sound, they would apply as well between subjects as between the Crown and subject. It is well settled that it is only pecuniary loss for which compensation is to be paid under Lord Campbell\u2019s Act and legislation similar thereto, such as the British Columbia Families\u2019 Compensation Act, and that any pecuniary advantage a dependent has received from the death must be set off against her probable loss. In Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Jennings (1), the Privy Council decided, in an action under the Ontario Fatal Accidents Act as it then stood, that while the total amount of a life insurance policy need not as a matter of law be deducted from what would otherwise be payable as the pecuniary loss contemplated by the Act, the receipt of the insurance money was a proper circumstance to be taken into consideration. This has since been changed by statute in Ontario but not in British Columbia. In litigation between subjects, an action by the dependent of a workman whose (1) (1888) 13 App. Cas. 800. death was caused by a third party would not be defeated by reason merely of the dependent\u2019s right to claim compensation under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. If the dependent had claimed compensation, the Board, by subsection 3 of section 11, would have been \u201csubrogated to the rights of the workman or dependent as against such other person for the whole or any outstanding part of the claim of the workman or dependent against such other person.\u201d It is not necessary to determine precisely to what the words \u201cor any outstanding part\u201d refer, but I am satisfied that they would not apply so as to reduce the claim of the dependent against a subject wrongdoer. The Board is subrogated to the dependent\u2019s rights against the third party and the Board\u2019s rights would not be defeated or curtailed by anything done by the dependent. That is, as between subjects, it seems clear that the wrongdoer could not successfully contend that the legislature intended that the receipt by a dependent of compensation under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act should be deducted from the sum otherwise payable under the Families\u2019 Compensation Act. If that were so, the subrogation of the Board to the dependent\u2019s rights would be illusory. Liability to the same extent attaches to the Crown.\nMrs. Snell is therefore entitled on behalf of herself and her infant son to damages. No question was raised as to the amounts allowed by the trial judge and nothing is said, therefore, as to the manner of their compilation. The petition of right being carried on at the instance of the Board, even if it were not a party, the judgment would still be in favour of the widow and infant. As between the Board and the widow and her son, the former is entitled to the amounts awarded and I think there is ample power in the Exchequer Court to direct, as has been done in this case, that the damages suffered by the widow should be payable to the Board, and that the damages suffered by the infant should be paid into Court for the benefit of all the suppliants to abide the order of the Court, with liberty to the Board to apply for a declaration that it is entitled by subrogation to the same sum and to payment out to the Board thereof.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. The judgment of Taschereau and Estey JJ., was delivered by\nEstey J.\u2014The late husband of the respondent, Bessie May Snell, was killed in a collision between a truck driven by himself, in the course of his employment, and an army vehicle driven by a soldier. Mrs. Snell applied for and received compensation under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, c. 312.\nThis action is brought by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board of British Columbia and Mrs. Snell against the Crown in the right of the Dominion. The Board pleads an equitable assignment from Mrs. Snell to it and its right to subrogation under section 11(3) of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\nThe pleadings admit that the late Mr. Snell\u2019s death was caused by the negligence of the driver of the army vehicle and therefore that Mrs. Snell had an action against the Crown in the right of the Dominion by virtue of her position under the Families\u2019 Compensation Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, c. 93, and her consequent rights tinder section 19(c) and section 50A of the Exchequer Court Act, R.S.C. 1927, e. 34, as amended 1938 S.C., c. 28, and 1943 S.C., c. 25.\nThe Crown, however, contends that so far as Mrs. Snell is concerned, having received compensation under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, she has either suffered no pecuniary loss, or alternatively has been fully compensated therefor and therefore has no cause of action, or in the further alternative that she is entitled to only the difference between what she has been awarded under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and what may be found to be full compensation.\nSo far as the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board is concerned, the Crown sets up a number of defences which may be summarized thus: that the Board suffered no pecuniary damage; the assignment is ineffective as against the Crown; and section 11(3) of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act does not give any remedy to the Board against the Crown in the right of the Dominion.\nAn examination of Mrs. Snell\u2019s position under the provincial Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and under the sections of the Exchequer Court Act already referred to indicates that she had both a claim under the provincial Act and under the Exchequer Court Act. The contention here is that, having exercised her right and having accepted compensation under provincial legislation, that election on her part has barred her right to recover from the Crown in the right of the Dominion, if not completely, then to the extent that she has recovered compensation under that Act.\nThe position of one who elects under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of Ontario was determined by this Court in Toronto Railway Company v. Button [6], where Mr. Justice Duff (later Chief Justice) stated at p. 421 :\nIf he elects to claim compensation, the employer becomes subrogated to the claimant\u2019s rights against the third person; in other words, he becomes entitled to enjoy the benefit of them and may enforce them in the name of the claimant. But all this is intended to be and is a disposition as to the rights of the employer and the claimant inter se.\nAnd at p. 422:\nIt follows, of course, that the transactions between the Board and the plaintiff are transactions to which for the purpose of this litigation the appellant company is a stranger and that they do not afford any answer to the respondent\u2019s claim in the action.\nThe material provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of British Columbia here under consideration are to the same effect as those of the Ontario Act in Toronto Railway Company v. Hutton, supra. It follows, therefore, that the position of the party whose negligence caused the injury is unaffected by the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\nThe compensation under the statute is in no way a settlement of Mrs. Snell\u2019s claim for damages arising out of the negligence of the appellant. The basis for the compensation under the statute, that of \u201cinjury by accident arising out of and in the course of employment\u201d, is a much wider and different basis from that of a claim founded in negligence. A computation of the claim is also, as set out in the statute, quite different from that which would be followed in a negligence action. Moreover, the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act provides in effect that the claim of Mrs. Snell at common law for damages continues and may be enforced. It therefore follows that the contention of the Crown that whatever damages Mrs. Snell may have suffered have been recovered and because thereof she has no further claim, is not tenable.\nThe statute does provide that, in the event of the party entitled to compensation accepting same, the Board is subrogated to or stands in the position of the party receiving compensation as against the party whose negligence caused the action. These are matters entirely between the party entitled to compensation and the Board. In this case both of these are parties to the action. It therefore becomes unnecessary to determine certain of the issues raised had the action been brought in the name of the Board only.\nBoth were parties to the action as framed and tried in the Exchequer Court. There the learned trial judge in his judgment directed how the funds received should be dealt with as between the Board, Mrs. Snell and her infant son. If the appeal otherwise failed, this disposition of the funds was not objected to.\nThe appeal should be dismissed and the judgment of the Exchequer Court affirmed.\nRand J.\u2014In this case, the Dominion Crown, liable for the tort of its servant, claims a deduction from damages recoverable by the widow and child under the Families\u2019 Compensation Act of British Columbia, of the sums payable to them under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. The contention is that the death statute is intended merely to maintain to the dependents the benefits they would have received if death had not ensued the accident, and that there must be taken into account all benefits that arise to them by reason of the death.\nThere is no doubt a distinction has been established between the effect on damages of such benefits in the case of injuries not causing death and those that result fatally. In Bradburn v. Great Western Ry. Co. [7], the court excluded evidence of moneys received under a policy of accident insurance, on the ground concisely stated by Pigott, B. in these words:\nHe does not receive that sum of money because of the accident, but because he has made a contract providing for the contingency; an accident must occur to entitle him to it, but it is not the accident, but his contract, which is the cause of his receiving it. A different rule in death cases was first applied by Lord Campbell in Hicks v. Newport, etc., Ry. Co. [8], where he directed the jury to deduct from the aggregate sum found the amount of accident insurance accruing to the persons claiming. In Grand Trunk Ry. Co. v. Jennings [9], a further distinction was recognized between life and accident insurance, and it was held that the former should be regarded only to the extent that its payment may have been accelerated. This seems to rest on the view that the benefit of the accident insurance was a legal consequence of the act of the wrongdoer, that as death might never happen from accident, the act brought about, in a legal sense, not only the loss but the mitigation; but that in an insurance against death alone, only time separates the beneficiary from the benefit. The ruling as to accident insurance has been superseded, however, by an amendment to the English Act passed in 1908.\nThe question, then, is whether the rule applies to such a right as that to compensation under the Workmen\u2019s Act, and in my opinion it does not.\nSection 11 of that Act is as follows:\n11. (1) Where an accident happens to a workman in the course of his employment in such circumstances as entitle him or his dependents to an action against some person other than his employer, the workman or his dependents, if entitled to compensation under this Part, may claim such compensation or may bring such action.\n(2) If the workman or his dependents bring such action and less is recovered and collected than the amount of the compensation to which the workman or dependents would be entitled under this Part, the workman or dependents shall be entitled to compensation under this Part to the extent of the amount of the difference.\n(3) If any such workman or dependent makes an application to the Board claiming compensation under this Part, the Board shall be subrogated to the rights of the workman or dependent as against such other person for the whole or any outstanding part of the claim of the workman or dependent against such other person.\n(4) In any case within the provisions of subsection (1), neither the workman nor his dependents nor the employer of the workman shall have any right of action in respect of the accident against an employer in any industry within the scope of this Part; and in any such case where it appears to the satisfaction of the Board that a workman of an employer in any class is injured owing to the negligence of an employer or of the workman of an employer in another class within the scope of this Part, the Board may direct that the compensation awarded in such case shall be charged against the last-mentioned class. It will be seen that the section deals specifically with the right of dependents under the Families\u2019 Act so as to create in effect a quasi indemnity and to subrogate the Board to the rights of the dependents when they have accepted compensation. But it is obvious that if such moneys can be deducted from the amount recoverable on the tort, the subrogation would be nullified. It would in fact reverse the plain purpose of the section and place upon the compensation fund pro tanto a primary liability. In the result, the Board at most would be entitled only to the excess of the claim against the wrongdoer over the compensation, the portion which equitably belongs to the dependents. The intention is clearly to preserve in full the cause of action, including damages, against the wrongdoer and to create a legal right in the Board to enforce it in the name of the dependents for the benefit of the compensation fund. Now the insurances held deductible were absolute in obligation; but the section, by importing that quality of indemnity, invests the right to compensation with a character outside of the category of benefits within the rule.\nThe Board is a co-petitioner and the judgment provides for the payment to it of the moneys recovered for the benefit of the widow. In the case of the child, the direction is to pay the sum recovered into Court with liberty to the Board to apply for a declaration of interest.\nThe effect of the statutory subrogation, a matter solely between the dependent and the Board, is to constitute the dependent a trustee of the right of action for the Board. The petitioners are, therefore, trustee and cestui que trust.\nWhether or not that relationship raises in the Board an equitable right against the Crown, I do not find necessary to decide. The defence in this respect alleges simply that the Workman\u2019s Act is not applicable to the Crown, and that the Board \u201ccan acquire no right of action against the respondent by subrogation under the said Act\u201d, which I take to mean can create no legal right and to deny the competency of provincial legislation to affect a claim against the Crown given by a Dominion Act. But that leaves untouched the question whether the Crown is bound to recognize the beneficial ownership of such a claim. There is no doubt that many petitions of right have been presented and determined in chancery without challenge to the jurisdiction of the court to entertain them. The consideration that the remedies used by equity to enforce its decrees could not, by their nature, operate against the Crown is not present in a relation which permits the coercion of the court to be exercised upon a private person. The question is examined in chapter 11 of Clode on Petition of Right, where the instances in which petitions have been actually dealt with are enumerated. In an analogous case, In re Rolt [10], the petitioners were the assignees of a bankrupt contractor with the Crown, and I see no ground in principle why an interest of this nature should not be admitted against the Crown where it can be made effectual by a remedy operating upon the trustee: The Queen v. Smith [11], Strong J., at p. 66:\nHad the proof borne out this case, and had it appeared that the assignment was so limited, the suppliants would have been undoubtedly entitled to recover in respect of work actually performed by the original contractors, for such an equitable assignment would have been entirely free from objection, either upon the general law, or upon any provision contained in the contract, and the record would have been properly framed for relief upon such a state of facts.\nIts convenience is obvious; to the Crown, the result is indifferent; it conforms to the equitable rule of concluding all features of. a controversy in the one proceeding; and it secures the interest of a semi-public body.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nKellock J.\u2014The contention of the Crown is that the dependents of the deceased, being entitled to compensation under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, have no right of action under section 19(c) of the Exchequer Court Act, and alternatively, have no claim except to the extent that the amount awarded under the Compensation Act has not fully compensated them in respect of their claim under the Families\u2019 Compensation Act. It is further submitted in any event that the respondent Board has no claim at all under section 19(c) and that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is ineffective to give it any. It is, of course, well settled that the damage awarded under statutes of the nature of the Families\u2019 Compensation Act are limited to the pecuniary benefit which the dependents might reasonably have expected from the continuance of the life of the deceased. By reason of the provisions of section 19(c), the Crown becomes liable to pay such damages when the death has been caused in circumstances such as are here admittedly present.\nTurning to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, section 11 is as follows:\n(1) Where an accident happens to a workman in the course of his employment in such circumstances as entitle him or his dependents to an action against some person other than his employer, the workman or his dependents, if entitled to compensation under this Part, may claim such compensation or may bring such action.\n(2) If the workman or his dependents bring such action and less is recovered and collected than the amount of the compensation to which the workman or dependents would be entitled under this Part, the workman or dependents shall be entitled to compensation under this Part to the extent of the amount of the difference.\n(3) If any such workman or dependent makes an application to the Board claiming compensation under this Part, the Board shall be subrogated to the rights of the workman or dependent as against such other person for the whole or any outstanding part of the claim of the workman or dependent against such other person.\nIt is the submission of the Crown that the compensation provided by the above section is full compensation equivalent by the law of the province to the pecuniary value of the support the widow and her son would have received from the deceased and that consequently no loss has been sustained. The Crown further says that if the award is not by law full compensation, the Crown is liable only for any deficiency. The contention in effect is that the provision by way of Workmen\u2019s Compensation operates in ease of the tort-feasor. The Crown further says that section 11(3) cannot confer any right upon the respondents as against the Crown.\nIt is said in answer by the respondents that while it is true that provincial legislation may not bind the Crown in the right of the Dominion ex proprio vigore, nonetheless the Crown may not take the benefit of the provisions entitling the dependents to compensation without reference to the terms upon which compensation is awarded, namely, the statutory subrogation of the Board to the rights of the dependents as against the wrong-doer.\nIt is said that where statutory rights are in question, as distinct from common law rights, Crooke\u2019s Case [12] is authority for the view that if the Crown, in order to establish rights it claims, must invoke the very statute which conditions those rights, the Crown is bound by the derogation, and reference is made to Re Excelsior Electric Dairy Machinery Ltd. [13] and to Attorney General for British Columbia v. Royal Bank of Canada [14], per Macdonald, J. A., at 294 and 297.\nI do not find it necessary to pass upon the soundness of this contention, as I think the respondents are entitled to succeed upon the basis of their further contention, namely, that the relevant sections of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act are to be construed as affecting inter se the rights of the dependents and the Board only; Toronto Railway Company v. Hutton [15]; and has no effect upon the liability of the Crown under section 19(c) to the person injured or his dependents.\nIn Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board v. Canadian Pacific Railway Co. [16], it was held that the rights given by section 8 of the then Act, 6 Geo. V, Cap. 77, constituted a statutory contract made with the workman for his benefit and for the benefit of members of his family dependent upon him. I think the principle of this decision is not limited to a case within section 8 where the accident happens outside the province, but applies equally to cases in which the accident takes place within the province. The relevant provisions of the statute here in question, R.S.B.C, cap. 312, are not materially different from the Act of 1916.\nHutton\u2019s case[17] was decided under the Ontario statute of which the corresponding provisions are not in essence dissimilar from those of the British Columbia statute. It was held in that case that an election to claim compensation under the Act did not bar the claim of the injured workman against the tort-feasor. In the language of Mignault J., with whom the Chief Justice and Brodeur J. agreed, at p. 426, the subrogation effected by the statute \u201cgives the * * * Board the control of the action\u201d, but does not divest the right of action from the workman or his dependents. The main contention of the appellant, therefore, in my opinion, fails.\nThe formal judgment directs recovery by both the Board and Bessie May Snell, payment to be made to the Board. It is objected that:\n(a) the provincial legislation is incompetent to give the Board any right of action in its own name against appellant, and that,\n(b) the assignment by Bessie May Snell to the Board is equally ineffective, as the right of action is ex delicto and therefore not the subject of assignment.\nMignault J., in dealing with a similar contention in Hutton\u2019s case (1), said at pp. 427-428:\n* * * the appellant appears to me to be without interest to complain of this modification of the judgment. By paying the damages according to the judgment it will be discharged from any possible claim either by the respondent or by the Board.\nIn the present case, as in Hutton\u2019s case [18], the essential ground of the appeal and of the defence to the action was that the election of the respondent Snell to claim compensation barred the action. In my opinion, what happens with respect to the proceeds of the judgment as between the respondents in view of the discharge involved in payment, is a matter which, at this stage of the action, does not concern the appellant.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: F.

C\u2014Sections 72, 292(c), 800, 1016 Cr. C.\nA jury, upon an indictment for attempted rape, returned a verdict of assault upon a female, causing actual bodily harm. Upon an appeal by the accused, the Court of Appeal held that an indictment for attempted rape did not include the offence for which he was found guilty, and the Court then substituted a conviction for common assault. The Crown appealed to this Court, asking that the substituted conviction be changed to that of indecent assault.\nHeld that the appeal should be dismissed.\nPer the Chief Justice and Kerwin, Kellock and Estey JJ.:\u2014The offence of indecent assault may be included in a count of attempted rape under section 951 Cr. C; but, in this case, it was not open to the appellate court, in view of the finding of the jury, to substitute a conviction of indecent assault.\nPer The Chief Justice and Estey JJ.:\u2014The jury, in finding the accused not guilty as charged on the count of attempted rape, negatived the existence of the element of indecency and in effect found the accused not guilty of indecent assault. Therefore, the appellate court, so far as substituting one conviction for another under section 1016 (2) Cr. C, had no other course open to it than to substitute that of common assault.\nPer Kerwin and Kellock JJ.:\u2014Section 1016 (2) Cr. C. requires it to appear to the Court of Appeal on the actual finding that the jury \u201cmust\u201d have been satisfied of facts which proved the respondent guilty of indecent assault.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1947] O.R. 1) affirmed.\nAPPEAL by the Crown, upon leave to appeal granted under section 1025 Cr.

B. Common K.C. for the appellant.\nVera L. Parsons K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the Chief Justice and of Estey J. was delivered by\nEstey J.:\u2014The accused was indicted for attempted rape under section 300 of the Criminal Code. The learned trial judge instructed the jury that included in the count of attempted rape were the other offences of indecent assault, assault on a female occasioning actual bodily harm (sec. 292(c)), and common assault.\nThe jury returned a verdict of assault on a female occasioning actual bodily harm.\nUpon an appeal by the accused the appellate court in Ontario held that an indictment for attempted rape did not include the offence of assault on a female occasioning actual bodily harm within the meaning of section 951. The learned judges of that court then substituted under sec. 1016(2) a verdict of common assault and imposed sentence of one year in reformatory.\nThe accused does not appeal but the Crown appeals to this court and asks that the substituted verdict of common assault be changed to that of indecent assault.\nLeave to appeal was granted to the Crown on the basis that Rex v. Stewart (1) in which the Appellate Division in Alberta held that the offence of indecent assault is by virtue of the provisions of section 951 included in a count of attempted rape and, therefore, is in conflict with the decision of the appellate court of Ontario in this case.\nThe commission of the offence of rape includes an act of indecency, as stated by my Lord the Chief Justice in Wright v. The King 2:\nNo doubt in a crime such as the one (rape) under consideration, the initial step might be stated to be an indecent assault, followed by the subsequent step which might be described as an attempt to rape * * *\nSection 72 of the Criminal Code defines an attempt:\nEvery one who, having an intent to commit an offence, does or omits an act for the purpose of accomplishing his object, is guilty of an attempt to commit the offence intended whether under the circumstances it was possible to commit such offence or not.\nThis section requires that one to be guilty of an attempt must intend to commit the completed offence and to have done some act toward the accomplishment of that objective. That act must be beyond preparation and go so far toward the commission of the completed offence that but for some intervention he is prevented or desists from the completion thereof.\nActs remotely leading towards the commission of the offence are not to be considered as attempts to commit it but acts immediately connected with it are. Parke B. in Reg. v. Eagleton3, quoted by Lord Reading C.J. in Rex v. Robinson 4.\nIt is the existence of both the intent and the act in such a relationship that the former may be regarded as the cause of the latter. The intent unaccompanied by the act does not constitute a criminal offence.\nIn the early case of Rex v. Scofield 5, Lord Mansfield stated at p. 403:\nSo long as an act rests in bare intention, it is not punishable by our laws: but immediately when an act is done, the law judges, not only of the act done, but of the intent with which it is done; and, if it is coupled with an unlawful and malicious intent, though the act itself would otherwise have been innocent, the intent being criminal, the act becomes criminal and punishable.\nThis case is commented upon in Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, 6th Ed. p. 305:\nIt is a rule, laid down by Lord Mansfield, and which has been said to comprise all the principles of previous decisions upon this subject, that so long as an act rests in bare intention, it is not punishable by our laws; but when an act is done, the law judges not only of the act itself, but of the intent with which it was done; and if the act be coupled with an unlawful and malicious intent, though in itself the act would otherwise have been innocent, yet, the intent being criminal, the act likewise becomes criminal and punishable.\nIt appears from the foregoing that the intent may determine the criminal quality of the act. There is present in the offence of rape the intent to commit an indecent act. The same intent is required in the offence of attempted rape. In the latter that intent may be found from the nature of the act or from the conduct of the accused immediately associated with the commission of that act or indeed both. If such an intent be not present the offence of attempted rape is not committed. The act cannot be dissociated from the intent as evidence which caused the accused to do such act. In Rex v. Louie Chong6, the magistrate found the accused guilty of indecent assault and stated a case for the opinion of the appellate division in Ontario as to whether he was justified in finding the accused guilty of indecent assault, where the accused in taking hold of the girl did so in a manner that did not import indecency. At the same time, however, he offered her money to go with him for an immoral purpose. The judgment of the court written by Middleton J. affirmed the magistrate\u2019s conviction. His Lordship in delivering the judgment stated:\nIt appears to me that an act in itself ambiguous may be interpreted by the surrounding circumstances and by words spoken at the time the act is committed * * *. It is in each case a question of fact whether the thing which was done, in the circumstances in which it was done, was done indecently. If it was, an indecent assault has been committed.\nHis spoken words which were part of his conduct evidenced the intention of the accused and determined the criminal quality of his act.\nIt would, therefore, appear that a count charging an attempt to commit rape would include the offence of indecent assault under section 951.\nThough the offence of indecent assault is included in a count of attempted rape under section 951 it was not in this case, because of the finding of the jury, open to the appellate court to substitute a verdict of indecent assault. Section 951 provides that the\naccused may be convicted of any offence so included which is proved, although the whole offence charged is not proved * * *\nThe learned trial judge explained to the jury the ingredients essential to find the accused guilty upon one or other of the four counts. Those of attempted rape and indecent assault require a finding of indecency, while that of actual bodily harm to a female does not. The jury in finding the accused not guilty as charged on the count of attempted rape negatived the existence of the element of indecency and, therefore, in effect found the accused not guilty of indecent assault.\nWhere an indictment contained three counts: (1) that the accused did unlawfully kill, under section 268; (2) grievous bodily harm, sec. 284; and (3) wanton or furious driving, sec. 285, the jury found the accused guilty of wanton or furious driving. Chief Justice Anglin stated at p. 47:\nIn a case such as that at bar, that the jury had found that neither the whole offence charged in count No. 1 nor the whole offence charged in count No. 2 had been proved, is an intendment which we must make in support of the verdict.\nAnd at p. 48:\nIt was within the province of the jury to find that the offence charged in the third count was satisfactorily proven, but that, for reasons which we can only surmise and as to the validity or the adequacy of which we are not at liberty to inquire some essential element of each of the offences charged in the first and second counts respectively was, in their view, not established beyond reasonable doubt. Barton v. The King7.\nThe jury in finding the accused guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm to a female negatived the existence of the element of indecency essential to the finding of a verdict of indecent assault. Therefore, the appellate court could not conclude \u201cthat the jury * * * must have been satisfied of the facts which proved him guilty of\u201d indecent assault as required by section 1016(2) before it can substitute a verdict of guilty of that other offence. Rex v. Hayes and Pallante8; Rex v. Collins9.\nIn a case where the accused was found guilty of murder this court so satisfied was in a position to and did reduce the verdict to one of manslaughter. At p. 350 Chief Justice Duff:\nThe finding makes it clear that the jury must have been satisfied of the facts necessary to constitute manslaughter, and we are, consequently, of opinion that the Court of Appeal would have authority under s. 1016 to substitute a verdict of manslaughter for the verdict of the jury and to pronounce sentence upon the prisoner. Rex v. Hopper10; Manchuk v. The King11.\nThe learned judges in the appellate court, because of the verdict of the jury, so far as substituting one verdict for another under section 1016(2), had no other course open to them than to substitute that of common assault.\nThe appeal should be dismissed. The judgment of Kerwin and Kellock J.J. was delivered by\nKellock J.:\u2014This is an appeal by the Attorney General of Ontario, pursuant to leave granted under section 1025 (1) of the Criminal Code, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dated December 13, 1946.\nThe present respondent was charged with attempted rape and on his trial before Schroeder J. and a jury was convicted of \u201cassault upon a female occasioning actual bodily harm\u201d. The learned trial judge had charged the jury that they might convict as charged, or of indecent assault, or assault upon a female occasioning actual bodily harm or common assault or not guilty.\nThe respondent appealed in writing to the Court of Appeal and on the hearing of the appeal the court raised the question whether it was competent for the jury to return the verdict they had returned. It was held that such a verdict was not open to the jury and the court substituted a conviction of common assault, being of opinion that the jury by their verdict, in view of the learned judge\u2019s charge, had negatived indecent assault. Roach J.A., who delivered the judgment of the court, expressed disagreement with the decision of the appellate division of Alberta in Rex v. Stewart12, by which it was held that, on a charge of attempting to have carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of fourteen, the accused might be convicted of indecent assault, under section 951 (1).\nThe Attorney General now appeals on the ground that the Court of Appeal was in error in holding that indecent assault is not an included offence in a charge of attempted rape. He asks that a conviction for indecent assault be substituted. We are not called upon otherwise to consider the judgment in appeal. Counsel for the respondent agrees with the submission of the appellant that the Court of Appeal was in error in the view taken with respect to indecent assault being included in the charge of the indictment here in question.\nIf common assault be an included offence in a charge of attempted rape as held by the Court of Appeal, and there can be no question but that such an assault would be an act within section 72, then such an act, though in itself ambiguous, may, interpreted by the surrounding circumstances, including words spoken at the time, amount to indecent assault; Rex v. Louie Chong13. It is not necessary that the act constituting the assault be in itself indecent in its nature. If the assault, coupled with the intention required by section 72, is of such a nature as to constitute an attempt within the rule as laid down in Rex v. Robinson14, such assault must necessarily be indecent; Rex v. Louie Chong13. In other words, the crime of attempted rape progresses from assault through indecent assault to the complete crime. If the facts of the suppositious case referred to by Roach J.A. amount to the offence of attempted rape, the assault itself necessarily becomes indecent. This would appear to have been the view of the majority in Wright v. The King15.\nHowever, I agree with the Court of Appeal in the view that it was not open to that court, in view of the learned trial judge\u2019s charge and the verdict of the jury, to substitute a conviction for indecent assault. Section 1016 (2) requires it to appear to the Court of Appeal on the actual finding that the jury \u201cmust\u201d have been satisfied of facts which proved the respondent guilty of indecent asault. The highest that Mr. Common puts his argument, and properly so, is that:\nIt is quite possible that the jury might be under the erroneous impression that a conviction for assault occasioning actual bodily harm on a female was more serious than that of indecent assault.\nThat is not sufficient. I do not think that the Court of Appeal were required, in the circumstances here present, to come to the conclusion the statute requires.\nI would accordingly dismiss the appeal.\nTaschereau J.:\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] [1945] Ex.

C.\u2014Sections 72, 292(c), 300, 1016 Cr. C.\nA jury, upon an indictment for attempted rape, returned a verdict of assault upon a female, causing actual bodily harm. Upon an appeal by the accused, the Court of Appeal held that an indictment for attempted rape did not include the offence for which he was found guilty, and the Court then substituted a conviction for common assault. The Crown appealed to this Court, asking that the substituted conviction be changed to that of indecent assault.\nHeld that the appeal should be dismissed.\nPer the Chief Justice and Kerwin, Kellock and Estey JJ.:\u2014The offence of indecent assault may be included in a count of attempted rape under section 951 Cr. C.; but, in this case, it was not open to the appellate court, in view of the finding of the jury, to substitute a conviction of indecent assault.\nPer The Chief Justice and Estey JJ.:\u2014The jury, in finding the accused not guilty as charged on the count of attempted rape, negatived the existence of the element of indecency and in effect found the accused not guilty of indecent assault. Therefore, the appellate court, so far as substituting one conviction for another under section 1016 (2) Cr. C., had no other course open to it than to substitute that of common assault.\nPer Kerwin and Kellock JJ.:\u2014Section 1016 (2) Cr. C. requires it to appear to the Court of Appeal on the actual finding that the jury \u201cmust\u201d have been satisfied of facts which proved the respondent guilty of indecent assault.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1947] O.R. 1) affirmed.\nAPPEAL by the Crown, upon leave to appeal granted under section 1025 Cr. C., from a judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], allowing in part an appeal by the respondent from a conviction of having committed an assault upon a female causing bodily harm and substituting a conviction of common assault.\nW.B. Common K.C. for the appellant.\nVera L. Parsons K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of the Chief Justice and of Estey J. was delivered by\nESTEY J.:\u2014The accused was indicted for attempted rape under section 300 of the Criminal Code. The learned trial judge instructed the jury that included in the count of attempted rape were the other offences of indecent assault, assault on a female occasioning actual bodily harm (sec. 292(c)), and common assault.\nThe jury returned a verdict of assault on a female occasioning actual bodily harm.\nUpon an appeal by the accused the appellate court in Ontario held that an indictment for attempted rape did not include the offence of assault on a female occasioning actual bodily harm within the meaning of section 951. The learned judges of that court then substituted under sec. 1016(2) a verdict of common assault and imposed sentence of one year in reformatory.\nThe accused does not appeal but the Crown appeals to this court and asks that the substituted verdict of common assault be changed to that of indecent assault.\nLeave to appeal was granted to the Crown on the basis that Rex v. Stewart[2] in which the Appellate Division in Alberta held that the offence of indecent assault is by virtue of the provisions of section 951 included in a count of attempted rape and, therefore, is in conflict with the decision of the appellate court of Ontario in this case.\nThe commission of the offence of rape includes an act of indecency, as stated by my Lord the Chief Justice in Wright v. The King[3]:\nNo doubt in a crime such as the one (rape) under consideration, the initial step might be stated to be an indecent assault, followed by the subsequent step which might be described as an attempt to rape * * *\nSection 72 of the Criminal Code defines an attempt:\nEvery one who, having an intent to commit an offence, does or omits an act for the purpose of accomplishing his object, is guilty of an attempt to commit the offence intended whether under the circumstances it was possible to commit such offence or not.\nThis section requires that one to be guilty of an attempt must intend to commit the completed offence and to have done some act toward the accomplishment of that objective. That act must be beyond preparation and go so far toward the commission of the completed offence that but for some intervention he is prevented or desists from the completion thereof.\nActs remotely leading towards the commission of the offence are not to be considered as attempts to commit it but acts immediately connected with it are. Parke B. in Reg. v. Eagleton[4], quoted by Lord Reading C.J. in Rex v. Robinson[5].\nIt is the existence of both the intent and the act in such a relationship that the former may be regarded as the cause of the latter. The intent unaccompanied by the act does not constitute a criminal offence.\nIn the early case of Rex v. Scofield[6], Lord Mansfield stated at p. 403:\nSo long as an act rests in bare intention, it is not punishable by our laws: but immediately when an act is done, the law judges, not only of the act done, but of the intent with which it is done; and, if it is coupled with an unlawful and malicious intent, though the act itself would otherwise have been innocent, the intent being criminal, the act becomes criminal and punishable.\nThis case is commented upon in Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, 6th Ed. p. 305:\nIt is a rule, laid down by Lord Mansfield, and which has been said to comprise all the principles of previous decisions upon this subject, that so long as an act rests in bare intention, it is not punishable by our laws; but when an act is done, the law judges not only of the act itself, but of the intent with which it was done; and if the act be coupled with an unlawful and malicious intent, though in itself the act would otherwise have been innocent, yet, the intent being criminal, the act likewise becomes criminal and punishable.\nIt appears from the foregoing that the intent may determine the criminal quality of the act. There is present in the offence of rape the intent to commit an indecent act. The same intent is required in the offence of attempted rape. In the latter that intent may be found from the nature of the act or from the conduct of the accused immediately associated with the commission of that act or indeed both. If such an intent be not present the offence of attempted rape is not committed. The act cannot be dissociated from the intent as evidence which caused the accused to do such act. In Rex v. Louie Chong[7], the magistrate found the accused guilty of indecent assault and stated a case for the opinion of the appellate division in Ontario as to whether he was justified in finding the accused guilty of indecent assault, where the accused in taking hold of the girl did so in a manner that did not import indecency. At the same time, however, he offered her money to go with him for an immoral purpose. The judgment of the court written by Middleton J. affirmed the magistrate\u2019s conviction. His Lordship in delivering the judgment stated:\nIt appears to me that an act in itself ambiguous may be interpreted by the surrounding circumstances and by words spoken at the time the act is committed * * *. It is in each case a question of fact whether the thing which was done, in the circumstances in which it was done, was done indecently. If it was, an indecent assault has been committed.\nHis spoken words which were part of his conduct evidenced the intention of the accused and determined the criminal quality of his act.\nIt would, therefore, appear that a count charging an attempt to commit rape would include the offence of indecent assault under section 951.\nThough the offence of indecent assault is included in a count of attempted rape under section 951 it was not in this case, because of the finding of the jury, open to the appellate court to substitute a verdict of indecent assault. Section 951 provides that the\naccused may be convicted of any offence so included which is proved, although the whole offence charged is not proved * * *\nThe learned trial judge explained to the jury the ingredients essential to find the accused guilty upon one or other of the four counts. Those of attempted rape and indecent assault require a finding of indecency, while that of actual bodily harm to a female does not. The jury in finding the accused not guilty as charged on the count of attempted rape negatived the existence of the element of indecency and, therefore, in effect found the accused not guilty of indecent assault.\nWhere an indictment contained three counts:1 that the accused did unlawfully kill, under section 268; (2) grievous bodily harm, sec. 284; and (3) wanton or furious driving, sec. 285, the jury found the accused guilty of wanton or furious driving. Chief Justice Anglin stated at p. 47:\nIn a case such as that at bar, that the jury had found that neither the whole offence charged in count No. 1 nor the whole offence charged in count No. 2 had been proved, is an intendment which we must make in support of the verdict.\nAnd at p. 48:\nIt was within the province of the jury to find that the offence charged in the third count was satisfactorily proven, but that, for reasons which we can only surmise and as to the validity or the adequacy of which we are not at liberty to inquire some essential element of each of the offences charged in the first and second counts respectively was, in their view, not established beyond reasonable doubt. Barton v. The King[8].\nThe jury in finding the accused guilty of assault occasioning actual bodily harm to a female negatived the existence of the element of indecency essential to the finding of a verdict of indecent assault. Therefore, the appellate court could not conclude \u201cthat the jury * * * must have been satisfied of the facts which proved him guilty of\u201d indecent assault as required by section 1016(2) before it can substitute a verdict of guilty of that other offence. Rex v. Hayes and Pallante[9]; Rex v. Collins[10].\nIn a case where the accused was found guilty of murder this court so satisfied was in a position to and did reduce the verdict to one of manslaughter. At p. 350 Chief Justice Duff:\nThe finding makes it clear that the jury must have been satisfied of the facts necessary to constitute manslaughter, and we are, consequently, of opinion that the Court of Appeal would have authority under s. 1016 to substitute a verdict of manslaughter for the verdict of the jury and to pronounce sentence upon the prisoner. Rex v. Hopper[11]; Manchuk v. The King[12].\nThe learned judges in the appellate court, because of the verdict of the jury, so far as substituting one verdict for another under section 1016(2), had no other course open to them than to substitute that of common assault.\nThe appeal should be dismissed. The judgment of Kerwin and Kellock J.J. was delivered by\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014This is an appeal by the Attorney General of Ontario, pursuant to leave granted under section 1025 (1) of the Criminal Code, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dated December 13, 1946.\nThe present respondent was charged with attempted rape and on his trial before Schroeder J. and a jury was convicted of \u201cassault upon a female occasioning actual bodily harm\u201d. The learned trial judge had charged the jury that they might convict as charged, or of indecent assault, or assault upon a female occasioning actual bodily harm or common assault or not guilty.\nThe respondent appealed in writing to the Court of Appeal and on the hearing of the appeal the court raised the question whether it was competent for the jury to return the verdict they had returned. It was held that such a verdict was not open to the jury and the court substituted a conviction of common assault, being of opinion that the jury by their verdict, in view of the learned judge\u2019s charge, had negatived indecent assault. Roach J.A., who delivered the judgment of the court, expressed disagreement with the decision of the appellate division of Alberta in Rex v. Stewart[13], by which it was held that, on a charge of attempting to have carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of fourteen, the accused might be convicted of indecent assault, under section 95113.\nThe Attorney General now appeals on the ground that the Court of Appeal was in error in holding that indecent assault is not an included offence in a charge of attempted rape. He asks that a conviction for indecent assault be substituted. We are not called upon otherwise to consider the judgment in appeal. Counsel for the respondent agrees with the submission of the appellant that the Court of Appeal was in error in the view taken with respect to indecent assault being included in the charge of the indictment here in question.\nIf common assault be an included offence in a charge of attempted rape as held by the Court of Appeal, and there can be no question but that such an assault would be an act within section 72, then such an act, though in itself ambiguous, may, interpreted by the surrounding circumstances, including words spoken at the time, amount to indecent assault; Rex v. Louie Chong[14]. It is not necessary that the act constituting the assault be in itself indecent in its nature. If the assault, coupled with the intention required by section 72, is of such a nature as to constitute an attempt within the rule as laid down in Rex v. Robinson[15], such assault must necessarily be indecent; Rex v. Louie Chong14. In other words, the crime of attempted rape progresses from assault through indecent assault to the complete crime. If the facts of the suppositious case referred to by Roach J.A. amount to the offence of attempted rape, the assault itself necessarily becomes indecent. This would appear to have been the view of the majority in Wright v. The King[16].\nHowever, I agree with the Court of Appeal in the view that it was not open to that court, in view of the learned trial judge\u2019s charge and the verdict of the jury, to substitute a conviction for indecent assault. Section 101615 requires it to appear to the Court of Appeal on the actual finding that the jury \u201cmust\u201d have been satisfied of facts which proved the respondent guilty of indecent asault. The highest that Mr. Common puts his argument, and properly so, is that:\nIt is quite possible that the jury might be under the erroneous impression that a conviction for assault occasioning actual bodily harm on a female was more serious than that of indecent assault.\nThat is not sufficient. I do not think that the Court of Appeal were required, in the circumstances here present, to come to the conclusion the statute requires.\nI would accordingly dismiss the appeal.\nTASCHEREAU J.:\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] [1947] O.R. 1.\n[2] (1938) 71 C.C.C. 206; [1938] 3 W.W.R. 631.\n[3] [1945] S.C.R. 319, at 322.\n[4] (1855) Dears, 515, at 538.\n[5] [1915] 2 K.B. 342, at 348.\n[6] (1786) Caldecott\u2019s Rep. 397.\n[7] (1914) 23 C.C.C. 250.\n[8] [1929] S.C.R. 42.\n[9] (1942) 77 C.C.C. 195; [1942] O.R. 52.\n[10] (1922) 17 Cr.

Hudson J. also was present at the hearing, but he died before the delivery of judgment.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN\nCo-operative handling and marketing of wheat\u2014Saskatchewan Co-operative Wheat Producers Ltd.\u2014Contracts between company and members \u2014Rights of members\u2014Deductions by company, from returns from sale of wheat, for its activities and towards acquiring handling facilities \u2014Claims for repayment, for interest, or for declaration as to rights\u2014 Alleged breach of trust\u2014Claim that interest on claimant\u2019s deductions should be paid before payment of patronage dividends to later shareholders.\nSaskatchewan Co-operative Wheat Producers Limited, referred to infra as the \u201cassociation\u201d, was incorporated in 1923 under the Companies Act, Sask., and its incorporation was confirmed by statute (Sask.) in 1924, c. 66, The main object was the co-operative handling and marketing of wheat for its members, grain growers in the province, each member buying a share for $1. Saskatchewan Pool Elevators Limited, referred to infra as the \u201cElevator Co.,\u201d was incorporated in 1925 under said Companies Act for purpose of acquiring elevator facilities and handling grain delivered to the association; its capital stock was owned by the association and the directors of each company were the same persons.\nAppellant delivered wheat to the association. Deliveries during 1924, 1925, 1926 and 1927 were under contract of December 27, 1923. Another contract was made on February 7, 1927, for deliveries for the five years following; but after the crop year of 1929-30, appellant (as were all others who had signed contracts) was released from his obligation to deliver wheat under it. Appellant ceased farming in 1938.\nSaid contracts provided (as did contracts with other grain growers) for deductions by the association, from gross returns from sale of wheat, of expenses, of a \u201ccommercial reserve\u201d to be used for purposes and activities of the association, and of an \u201celevator deduction\u201d towards acquiring facilities for handling grain.\nUnder said contracts the association deducted \u201ccommercial reserves\u201d and \u201celevator deductions\u201d, crediting the amounts thereof in appellant\u2019s account. The last of said deductions were made out of the proceeds of the 1928 crop. Appellant claimed repayment of amounts so deducted, and interest thereon, or, alternatively, a judgment declaring his rights.\nOn July 16, 1925, the directors of the association passed a resolution that elevator deductions should bear interest at 6 per cent. This was followed by statements forwarded from time to time by the association to the growers, showing the amount of elevator deductions and interest thereon, but stating that \u201cthe crediting of interest during the present contract, as well as the payment of interest on the certificates, is conditioned on the Pool Elevators having sufficient earnings, after taking care of expenses and depreciation, to provide for same.\u201d\nIn 1929 the association issued two certificates, one setting out commercial reserves and the other setting out elevator deductions, taken under said contract of 1923. These certificates were under seal, and, as recommended by the directors, were approved by resolution of November 26, 1928, at the annual meeting of the association delegates. They were delivered to the growers who had signed said contract of 1923, and contained the following (the rate of interest mentioned on commercial reserves and elevator deductions being 5 and 6 per cent, respectively): \u201cInterest from September 1, 1928, will be paid annually at the rate of * * * on the sums represented by this certificate which shall from time to time remain unpaid, provided, however, that the Company reserves the right to declare that a lower or other rate of interest, or no interest, shall be payable in any year or years, all interest payments shall be non-cumulative in effect.\u201d\nInterest was paid, on elevator deductions, from September 1, 1925, to August 31, 1930, and on commercial reserves, from. September 1, 1927, to August 31, 1930. (In each case, interest for the year ending August 31, 1930, was not paid until 1941). Also it was stated in evidence that on the elevator deductions interest of 3 per cent, was paid for 1943 and would be paid for the next year.\nOn September 17, 1931, the directors passed a resolution, referring to said certificates and to the association\u2019s indebtedness to the Government (hereinafter mentioned)., that, as it must use all available funds in order to pay said indebtedness, in future no interest be declared or paid to the holders of such certificates, but that all interest earned by the moneys represented thereby be retained for the purpose of reducing said indebtedness or for any other proper association activity.\nUp to and including the crop year 1929-30, the association, when receiving the wheat, made an advance on account of the price to the grower. In 1929-30 this advance was followed by such a drop in the price of wheat that the advance was more than what was ultimately realized. The overpayment to the growers was treated as a loss to the association, which arranged for the Saskatchewan Government to pay its debts to the banks and accept repayment in amortized instalment payments, the last of which is payable in 1951. The assets of the association and the Elevator Company were given as security, as set out in statutes, 1931, c. 90, and 1932, c. 77. By s. 3 of the latter Act, \u201cno person who * * * has or may hereafter acquire any right, title or interest in any elevator deduction or commercial reserve * * * shall be entitled to demand repayment of money which has been placed in any such deduction or reserve or to bring or continue action to enforce any right or interest in respect of such money or deductions or reserves, or any earnings thereof * *,\u201d until the Government has been paid in full.\nAfter the crop year 1929-30, the association abandoned the compulsory pool which it had operated, notified growers of release from their obligation to deliver wheat, and operated a voluntary pool, rendering the same services as theretofore to those growers who desired it, and it entered into business of buying and warehousing grain.\n\u201cPatronage dividends\u201d were paid to growers prior to 1930, and again in 1940 and in subsequent years. From 1940 these patronage dividends have been paid, to shareholders delivering wheat to the association, part in cash and part credited to their deduction accounts. The part so credited has been utilized by the association in arranging for repayments in certain cases, under which appellant, as having ceased farming, would qualify to benefit. Appellant contended that, with surplus funds available, interest should be paid on the commercial reserves and elevator deductions before payment of patronage dividends, which, he contended, were, in breach or repudiation of trust, being paid to later shareholders who had made no contribution to the deductions now in question but were getting the benefit of the facilities provided by these deductions and receiving patronage dividends on the same basis as those who became shareholders under the contracts of 1923 and 1927.\nHeld: Appellant\u2019s claims for repayment of deductions and for interest were barred at this time by said s. 3 of c. 77, 1932. Also his action failed for further reasons as follows:\nPer Kerwin and Estey JJ.: The contracts with appellant contained no covenant to repay the deductions. The association received and utilized them within the terms of the contracts. There was no breach of covenant or of trust.\nThe contracts contained no covenant to pay interest. As to the certificates, the proviso therein should not be disregarded as repugnant. Its language qualified, rather than destroyed, the covenant. That interpretation is the natural and reasonable one, and also accords with the conduct of the parties (which may be looked at to assist in construction). The resolutions of the association for payments of interest were mere expressions of intention.\nThe association\u2019s method of paying patronage dividends without having first paid interest now claimed did not violate any trust. Its abandonment of the compulsory pool and its subsequent steps and operations were within its powers and at the same time maintained for those growers who desired it, through the voluntary pool, all the rights and advantages under their contracts. The commercial reserves and elevator deductions have been used within the. terms of the contracts under which appellant authorized them.\nThere being no breach by the association, and in view of its policies adopted and its unquestioned good faith, no purpose would be served in directing a declaratory judgment, which could only be effective after the provincial government has been paid in full. This, according to the terms of agreement with that government, would not be until 1951, while under the association\u2019s present policy appellant may have received his repayments before that time.\nPer Rand and Kellock JJ.: The association was a corporate body with a nominal authorized capital, its effective capital being intended to be provided by the deductions under the contracts. That effective capital was committed to it for certain purposes and impressed with certain contractual and equitable duties; but administrative control over the funds for the purposes of the association was a condition of and a restriction upon each contributor\u2019s interest in the association, which interest was a fractional share in the subsidiary capitalization representing for this purpose the whole of the assets, the amount not being fixed, but fluctuating from time to time as the association\u2019s needs might require. The dealing with such interests consistently with the co-operative scheme was designed from time to time to maintain ownership of them in the hands of persons who were active participants in the association\u2019s business, and it was desirable as a policy that the interest of a contributor who had ceased to market his product through the association be taken over for transfer to a person participating. The interest of a contributor was not that of a debt. There was no failure of the primary purposes to which the money was to be applied; and no suggested breach of contractual or equitable obligation would amount to such a failure or give rise to any right to rescind the original transaction by winding up or otherwise; the relief in any such case would be confined to such modes of compelling a corporation to adhere to the objects for which it was created as might be open to the interested members.\nThe contributions were made without express stipulation as to interest. The fundamental object of the enterprise would require that any distribution of interest must be only out of net returns; such limitation lies initially on any provision for interest. Assuming, but not deciding, that the certificates were an obligation rather than a declaration of intention, yet the mode of exercising the power reserved therein, consistently with the matter in which it appears, must be taken to be informal and, since it is not required to be communicated to the contributor, of a purely internal character; at most the certificate sets a standard of return to which the association should adhere but on which decision is not intended to be brought within a formal rigidity; the essential fact is the recognition of an obligation to distribute grounded in the circumstances of the contributions. The revocation need not be specific for each year or for a term of years. The circumstances in which the resolution of September 17, 1931, was passed were such as to preclude a distribution of interest; the resolution was simply a declaration that, until otherwise decided, no payments would be made; and it was a proper exercise of the reserved power.\nIn all the circumstances, including the fact that appellant was merely one of a class with identical interests in the association, a declaration defining his interest should not be made.\nAppeal from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, [1946] 1 W.W.R. 97, dismissed. APPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan[1] allowing (Gordon J.A. dissenting) the defendants\u2019 appeal from the judgment of Bigelow J.[2] which declared that the defendant Saskatchewan Co-operative Wheat Producers Limited became a trustee for the plaintiff of the deductions made from his grain for commercial reserve deductions, being $94.99, and the amount of the elevator deductions, being $158.03, and that the plaintiff had effectively terminated the trust so declared, and that the plaintiff was entitled to payment by the defendant Saskatchewan Co-operative Wheat Producers Limited of the amount of the said deductions when the claims of the Province of Saskatchewan under the Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1932, c. 77, and 1933, c. 80, are satisfied, together with interest on said deductions (at 5 per cent and 6 per cent respectively, per annum) from September 1, 1930; and ordered that the plaintiff have liberty at any later date to apply for an injunction restraining the defendants from paying further patronage dividends until the plaintiff\u2019s claim is paid.\nThe Court of Appeal allowed the defendants\u2019 appeal and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action. (Gordon J.A., dissenting, would have declared that the defendant Saskatchewan Co-operative Wheat Producers Limited held the deductions in question in trust for the plaintiff, that it committed a breach of trust which justified the plaintiff in determining that trust, and that it was bound to pay interest to the plaintiff annually at said rates provided that such interest was earned.)\nSpecial leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was granted by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan.\nG. H. Yule K.C. and H. M. Hughes K.C. for the appellant.\nR. H. Milliken K.C. and E. C. Leslie K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Estey JJ. was delivered by Estey J.\u2014The appellant, Robert Barnes, was a farmer and wheat grower in the Rush Lake District in Saskatchewan until he retired in 1938 and moved to Winnipeg. The respondent, the Saskatchewan Co-operative Wheat Producers Limited, hereinafter referred to as the Association and commonly known as the Pool, was incorporated in 1923 under the Companies Act of the Province of Saskatchewan and confirmed by statute in 1924 (1924 S.S., c. 66, and amendments thereto).\nThe respondent Saskatchewan Pool Elevators Limited, hereinafter referred to as the Elevator Company, was incorporated in 1925 under the Saskatchewan Companies Act for the purpose of acquiring elevator facilities and handling grain delivered to the Association. All the capital stock of the Elevator Company has been at all times and now is owned by the Association and the directors of the Association and the Elevator Company always have been and are the same persons. It is a totally owned and controlled subsidiary of the Association.\nIn 1923 the appellant was one of a large number of wheat growers in Saskatchewan who entered into contracts with the Association, in the main for the co-operative handling and marketing of wheat.\nThe first contract with the appellant was dated the 27th day of December, 1923, and under this and a subsequent contract, dated the 7th day of February, 1927, he delivered wheat to the respondent from the year 1924 until he (as were all others who had signed contracts) was released from his obligation to deliver wheat after the crop year of 1929-30.\nThe appellant claims the repayment from the Association of certain amounts deducted from the selling price of his wheat under the terms of these contracts and known as commercial reserves and elevator deductions; interest thereon at the rate of 5 per cent and 6 per cent respectively from September 1, 1930; or in the alternative a declaratory judgment setting forth the rights of the plaintiff with respect to these commercial reserves and elevator deductions.\nUnder the first contract the appellant purchased a share of the capital stock of the Association for $1.00. Since then he has been and is a shareholder of the Association. In this action, however, he bases his claim upon his con- tracts rather than upon his position as a shareholder and therefore his rights must be determined as fixed by the contracts between himself and the Association.\nThe first contract, dated the 27th of December, 1923, provided for the taking of the commercial reserves and the elevator deductions in the following terms:\n(a) Commercial Reserves\n8. (d) To pay or retain and deduct from the gross returns from the sale of the wheat delivered to it by the Growers the amount necessary to cover all brokerage, advertising, taxes, tolls, freights, elevator charges, insurance interest, legal expenses, operating costs and) expenses, and all other proper charges, such as salaries, fixed charges and general expenses of the Association and, in addition, the Association may deduct such percentage, not exceeding one per cent (1%) of the gross selling price of the wheat as it shall deem desirable as a commercial reserve to be used for any of the purposes or activities of the Association.\n(b) Elevator Deductions\n8. (f) To deduct from the gross returns from the sale of all wheat handled by the Association for Growers who have executed this agreement or an agreement similar in terms a sum out of each Grower\u2019s proper proportion thereof, not exceeding two cents (2c.) per bushel and to invest the same for and on behalf of the Association in acquiring either by construction, purchase, lease or otherwise such facilities for handling grain as the Directors of the Association may deem advisable or in the capital stock or shares of any company or association formed for the purpose of so erecting, constructing or acquiring such facilities and to sell or otherwise dispose of any such investment and re-invest the proceeds thereof in like manner.\nBefore the completion of this contract and under date of February 7, 1927, the appellant and the Association entered into a second contract covering the years 1928 to 1932 inclusive. The authority to deduct the commercial reserve is provided for in this second contract in para. 6(d) in identical language as in para. 8(d) of the first contract except that after the word \u201cused\u201d the words \u201cin the conclusive discretion of the Association\u201d are inserted.\nThe elevator deductions are provided for under para. 6(e) of the second contract in language much to the same effect as para. 8(f), except that it contains these words:\n* * * to hold and retain the same for such period as the Directors of the Association may deem advisable, either with or without paying interest thereon; * * *\nThis is the only reference to the payment of interest with respect to these funds in either of these contracts. Under the first contract the Association deducted commercial reserves from Barnes in the sum of $67.38, and under the second contract $27.61, a total of $94.99. The elevator deductions under the first contract totalled $110.56 and under the second contract $47.47, or a total of $158.03, or a total deduction under both contracts of $253.02. As these deductions were made the Association credited the amounts thereof in Barnes\u2019 account. The last deductions under the contracts were made out of the proceeds of the 1928 crop.\nSimilar amounts were deducted from all growers, and thereby the Association realized commercial reserves in the sum of $6,567,851.17, and elevator deductions in the sum of $12,188,060.07, a total of $18,755,911.24.\nCommercial reserves were used for the purposes and activities of the Association, and the elevator deductions were utilized to purchase the capital stock of the elevator company.\nIf, as the appellant contends, these commercial reserves and elevator deductions were received and applied by the Association, subject to a trust, for the benefit of the growers who signed the contracts, the terms of the trust must be found within these contracts. They contain neither a covenant for payment of interest thereon nor for repayment of the principal. The evidence establishes, and it is not contended otherwise, that the Association has received and utilized these funds within the terms of the contracts and its own powers as incorporated. There is no breach of covenant or of trust under these contracts alleged with respect to these deductions nor does the record disclose any. The appellant\u2019s claim for repayment thereof must fail.\nThe appellant submits that he is entitled to interest upon these two funds. This claim is not founded upon any covenant or term in the contract of the 27th of December, 1923, or that of the 7th of February, 1927, but upon subsequent events. In fact, the only reference to interest in either of these contracts is that in the contract dated February 7\/1927, where in para. 6(e) it is provided that with respect to elevator deductions these may be retained \u201cfor such period as the Directors of the Association may deem advisable, either with or without paying interest thereon.\u201d\nIt would appear that, while the Association did not obligate itself to pay interest under these two contracts, as early as July 16, 1925, it did entertain an intention to pay interest. Upon that date the directors passed a resolution that elevator deductions should \u201cbear interest at the rate of six per cent (6%) and that interest date from the date of the final payment\u201d. This resolution of July 16, 1925, was followed by statements issued and forwarded from time to time by the Association to the growers showing the amount of the elevator deductions and interest thereon. These statements contained the following:\nThe crediting of interest during the present contract, as well as the payment of interest on the certificates, is conditional on the Pool Elevators having sufficient earnings, after taking care of expenses and depreciation, to provide for same.\nInterest was paid upon elevator deductions from September 1, 1925, to August 31, 1930, (the payment for year ending August 31, 1930, not made until 1941).\nThe first contract covered the crops up to and including that of 1927. In 1929 the Association issued two certificates, one setting out commercial reserves and the other elevator deductions taken under the first contract. These certificates were under the seal of the Association and as recommended by the directors were approved by a resolution passed November 26, 1928, at the annual meeting of the Association delegates. They were delivered to the growers who had signed the contract of December 27, 1923, and bind the Association. These elevator deduction certificates contained the following:\nInterest from September 1, 1928, will be paid annually at the rate of Six (6) per cent per annum on the sums represented by this Certificate which shall from time to time remain unpaid!, provided however, that the Company reserves the right to declare that a lower or other rate of interest, or no interest, shall be payable in any year or years, all interest payments shall be non-cumulative in effect.\nThe identical language appears in the certificate evidencing commercial reserves except that the rate of interest is 5 per cent instead of 6 per cent. This is the first mention of interest on commercial reserves, but Mr. Robertson stated it was decided to pay interest on them in 1928 and that interest was paid thereon from September 1, 1927, to August 31, 1930. Deductions under the contract dated February 7, 1927, were taken only in the crop year 1927-28 and no certificates were issued covering same.\nThese certificates contain an obligation on the part of the Association to pay interest from September 1, 1928, with a proviso that the Association may declare that a lower rate or no interest shall be payable \u201cin any year or years\u201d. The appellant submits that the proviso in effect destroys the covenant to pay interest and is therefore repugnant and should be disregarded.\nIt would appear, however, that the language used in the proviso qualifies rather than destroys the covenant. In appreciation of the possibility of reduced earnings the Association reserved the right by this proviso to \u201cin any years or years\u201d reduce the rate or provide that no interest should be paid. Not only does such an interpretation appear the natural and reasonable construction, but it is in fact in accord with the conduct of the Association. These certificates were issued in 1929. The Association had paid interest on the elevator deductions since September 1, 1925 and on commercial reserves from September 1, 1927, and continued to do so until August 31, 1929. The heavy loss incurred by the overpayment in 1929-30 and the subsequent indebtedness to the government made any payment of interest impracticable if not impossible. When in 1941 the financial position of the Association permitted, interest was paid for the year ending August 31, 1930. It was also stated in evidence that interest on the elevator deductions of 3 per cent was paid for 1943 and would be paid for the next year. This payment is subject to the suggestion that it was prompted by the commencement of this action, but it should also be noted that the financial position of the Association had considerably improved. Moreover, the appellant took no exception to, nor made any inquiry with respect to any of these steps. In fact, it would appear that throughout he left the question of the paying of interest entirely a matter for the Association. He made no mention of interest until his last letter to the Association dated August 31, 1943, before the commencement of this action.\nSuch conduct may be looked at to assist in the construction of this resolution: Chapman v. Bluck[3], where Tindal, C.J., stated at p. 193:\n* * * there is no better way of seeing what they intended than seeing what they did, under the instrument in dispute.\nand Park, J., at p. 195:\nThe intention of the parties must be collected from the language of the instrument, and may be elucidated by the conduct they have pursued.\nSee also Watcham v. East Africa Protectorate[4], and Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax[5].\nThis construction is supported both by the language of the resolution and the conduct of the parties, and is to be preferred to that suggested by the appellant, in that it avoids any application of the rule as to repugnancy. Git v. Forbes[6], where Duff J. (later Chief Justice), whose conclusions were supported by the Privy Council (Forbes v. Git[7]), stated:\nThe rule as to repugnancy, therefore, is obviously a rule to be applied only in the last resort and when there is no reasonable way of reconciling the two passages and bringing them into harmony with some intention to be collected from the deed as a whole.\nIn fact, interest at 6 per cent was paid on elevator deductions on the basis of the resolution of July 16, 1925, to August 31, 1930, and interest at 5 per cent on commercial reserves from September 1, 1927, to August 31, 1930. Interest was therefore paid in accordance with the terms of these certificates from September 1, 1928, until August 31, 1930.\nCounsel for the appellant submits that a resolution passed by the Board of Directors on September 17, 1931, and the consequent non-payment of interest constitutes a breach of the Association\u2019s obligations to pay interest under these two certificates. This resolution reads as follows:\nResolutions passed by the Pool Board Sept. 17, 1931:\nWhereas elevator deduction certificates and commercial reserve certificates have been issued to all persons from whom elevator deductions and commercial reserve deductions have been taken from the proceeds of the sale of wheat and (or) coarse grains delivered to the Company during the years 1924 to 1927 both inclusive; and\nWhereas such certificates provide for the Company paying interest thereon; and\nWhereas large sums of money are owing by the Company to the Government of Saskatchewan in connection with the sale of the 1929 crop; and\nWhereas the Company must use all available funds in order to repay such sums of money;\nTherefore, be it resolved that in future no interest be declared or paid to the holders of any such elevator deduction certificates and (or) commercial reserve certificates, but that all interest earned by the moneys represented by such certificates be retained by the Company for the purpose of reducing its said indebtedness to the Government of Saskatchewan or for any other proper Company activity.\u2014Carried.\nThis resolution was passed when the financial position of the Association was such that it was indebted to the provincial government for over $22,000,000, as security for which had been pledged assets of both of the respondents, and when, as Mr. Robertson stated:\nIt was necessary for us to secure a guarantee of our bank line of credit from the Dominion Government in 1931 in order to be able to operate.\nBoth in the recitals and in the operative part of this resolution reference is made to the indebtedness to the Government of Saskatchewan. This indebtedness was created by an overpayment to the growers in 1929-30. Up to and including the crop year 1929-30, the Association received the wheat and coincident therewith made an initial payment or an advance on account of the price to the grower. Then as his agent it pooled and sold the wheat and paid to the grower the balance of the price in subsequent payments as funds permitted. This practice is provided for in para. 16 of the contract. In 1929-30 the initial advance was followed by such a drop in the price of wheat that the advance per bushel was more than that ultimately realized, with the result that in making its initial payment or advance the Association overpaid the growers to the extent of $13,305,654.98. In this emergency the Association arranged with the government to pay its indebtedness to the bank and accept repayment thereof \u201cin nineteen equal amortized payments, principal and interest\u201d, which totalled over $22,000,000. The last instalment is payable in 1951, and at the time of the trial, while all payments had been made up to date, there was still a balance owing of about $7,700,000. The assets of both of the respondents were given as security therefor, as set out in the Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1931, c. 90, and 1932, c. 77. Under section 3 of the latter statute:\n* * * no person who * * * has or may hereafter acquire any right, title or interest in any elevator deduction or commercial reserve * * * shall be entitled to demand repayment of money which has been placed in any such deduction or reserve or to bring or continue action to enforce any right or interest in respect of such money or deductions or reserves, or any earnings thereof * * *\nThis section constitutes a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s action except in so far as he asks a declaratory judgment and an injunction.\nIt is provided in para. 17 of the Articles of the Association \u201cthe business of the Company shall be managed by the Directors\u201d. No question is raised as to the authority of the directors to pass this resolution of September 17, 1931.\nThe operative portion of this resolution, when read in the light of the recitals, is intended, and should be so construed, to cover the period of financial need created by the overpayment of 1929-30 and now evidenced by its indebtedness to the government and repayable as already stated. The depression had greatly reduced the price of wheat. A perusal of these agreements and statutes will indicate the depressed condition of the wheat market and the uncertainty with regard to the future. Under these circumstances it was evident that all available sources of revenue would be required for some time to pay the government and the necessary costs of operations. The directors, under the certificates and para. 17 of the Articles of the Association, had authority to provide for nonpayment of interest \u201cin any year or years\u201d. That authority did not require that they specify the years; they might have done so, but the fact that they did not does not constitute an excess of authority nor invalidate the resolution.\nThe last phrase in the resolution, \u201cor for any other proper Company activity\u201d, evidences their further caution in that these revenues might be required, or it might be more convenient at a given, moment to use them in some other activity of the Association other than for the payment of the government indebtedness. Without the addition of these words it might be contended that the resolution restricted them entirely to payment of the government.\nAny other construction of this resolution would involve a distinct change in policy on the part of the Association with respect to the payment of interest, which was not intended, as evidenced by the payment in 1941 of the interest due as of September 1, 1930, and as stated upon this point by Mr. Robertson:\nThe policy has always been the same since the inception of the organization.\nImmediately after the overpayment, consideration was given to the collection of it from the growers to whom it was paid. That was not done; rather it was decided to treat it as a company loss.\nThere were no certificates and therefore no convenant to pay interest on the deductions under the contract of February 7, 1927. The appellant\u2019s essential difficulty in his claim for interest is that when he signed the contracts in 1923 and 1927 he did not then see to it that there was a provision included for the payment of interest. It is true that the Association through its resolutions provided for the payment of interest, but these are, to one who claims on a contract, mere expressions of intention. The Association has been very careful in its communications with the growers and in the phrasing of the certificates not to unqualifiedly obligate itself to pay interest.\nThe appellant\u2019s further contention is that, with surplus funds available, interest should be paid upon the commercial reserves and elevator deductions before payment of patronage dividends. His position is stated as follows:\nThe Appellant\u2019s complaint is not that to pay patronage dividends is not proper, but to pay them as they have been paid without making provisions for performance of the promise of the trustee to pay interest, and to divert monies to pay patronage dividends without paying interest, is a breach of trust or what may be more accurately described as a repudiation of trust.\nIf there be a trust it is, as Mr. Justice MacDonald states, by virtue of the contracts dated December 27, 1923, and February 7, 1927, and whatever trust their terms may create, with respect to these funds, they do not impose any obligation upon the Association to pay interest. The certificates cover only the deductions under the first contract (December 27, 1923). They do not create a trust but only a promise to pay subject to a proviso already discussed. The absence of any unqualified obligation to pay interest disposes of the appellant\u2019s contention, but as he suggests that his investment is being \u201cwiped out\u201d and asks for a declaration as to his rights, it should be pointed out what the Association is now doing with regard to these funds.\nNotwithstanding the absence of any covenant to pay interest or to repay the principal, the Association has been providing for repayment of the principal to certain of its members, including now those who find themselves in a position similar to that of the appellant. In recent years the Association has realized substantial surpluses, out of which it has transferred to the patronage dividend account the following amounts:\n1939-40 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. $ 500,000\n1940-41 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 900,000\n1941-42 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 1,030,000\n1942-43 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. 1,800,000\nOut of this patronage dividend account, in 1940 and since, have been paid (a) patronage dividends and (b) in 1944 during the currency of this litigation, payment of 3 per cent on elevator deductions. These patronage dividends or, as the Association prefers, excess profits refunds, were paid to the growers prior to 1930 and were then discontinued until 1940.\nFrom and after 1940 these patronage dividends have been paid to the shareholders delivering wheat to the Association, part in cash and part credited to their deduction accounts. This part so credited has been utilized by the Association to make repayments to (a) estates of deceased members, (b) growers who have ceased farming, (c) growers who are totally disabled but may still have an interest in delivering grain, and (d) growers who have reached the age of 70 years, or such lower age as the Board may from time to time determine. In 1940, $2,559,217.44, representing the accumulated credits of growers for patronage dividends covering the period 1930 to 1938 inclusive, was paid to the growers. In addition, an amount of $290,065.66 was retained for the purchase of deduction certificates, making a total distribution during the fiscal year ending July 31, 1940, of $2,849,283.10. Then in the three following years the distribution was as follows:\nPaid out in cash\nas part of\nPatronage Dividend\nto Growers\nRetained\nto purchase\nCertificates\n1940-41 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n$239,981.01\n$239,703.12\n1941-42 \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n441,350.34\n433,650.73\n1942-43\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n510,365.32\n463,271.58\nAt the trial, Mr. Barnes\u2019 age was given as being over 70 and he therefore qualifies for repayment under both (b) and (d) of the foregoing heads.\nThis method enables the Association to pay out the deductions taken from those who have ceased to be growers and to transfer the amounts thereof to the deduction accounts of those who are currently growers. The Association under this method works toward the end that those who are currently growers and shareholders provide the capital. The financial position of the Association during the years 1930 to 1940 made impracticable, if not impossible, the payment of patronage dividends.\nUnder this plan the Association is not violating any trust or obligation that it has assumed with respect to these deductions, and therefore does not subject itself to any liability.\nOne of the appellant\u2019s main complaints seems to be that those who purchased shares since 1932 and made no contribution to the deductions are getting the benefit of the facilities provided by these deductions and receiving patronage dividends on the same basis as those who became shareholders under the contracts of 1923 and 1927. When the compulsory pool was abandoned, no further contracts were entered into. In order to maintain and to increase its volume of business, the Association decided to offer shares to growers not already members at $1 per share. Some 24,800 growers purchased these shares. It is true that they then made no contribution to these deductions, but since 1940 they have contributed toward the purchase of these deductions, as above explained, through a retention of a portion of their patronage dividends and for which they received credit in their respective deduction accounts. It possibly would have been done earlier had the Association realized sufficient surplus to declare a patronage dividend. In any event, the Association has again acted within its powers and without creating a breach of any obligation it owed to the appellant.\nThe appellant further contends that these deductions were taken subject to an undertaking that the wheat would be handled by the Association in a pool in which it would act as agent on behalf of the growers, and that since 1929-30 it has not done so and is therefore in breach of its contract. It is clear that at the time the contracts of 1923 and 1927 were executed, the Association intended and covenanted to operate a compulsory pool in which it would act as agent for the grower. The experience of 1929-30 caused the Association to abandon the compulsory pool and as a consequence notified the growers that they were released from their obligations to deliver wheat under the contract. The Association then decided to operate a voluntary pool, rendering the same services as contracted for in the compulsory pool to those growers who desired it. This it did from 1931 in the years that \u201cthe Canadian Wheat Board did not function. That is the Wheat Board operates as a pool of course.\u201d\nAt the same time the Association entered into the business of buying and warehousing grain delivered by its shareholders, and further, as required by the Grain Act, it received grain from non-members so far as its facilities permitted. The Association in making this change acted well within its powers under its Act of Incorporation, and at the same time maintained for those growers who desired it, through the voluntary pool, all the rights and advantages under their contracts.\nThe appellant does not suggest that he was denied any rights under his contracts of December 27, 1923, or February 7, 1927, nor that he, either at the time or now, objects to the Association having adopted this additional method of handling grain. In fact, after he was advised that he was not obligated to deliver wheat to the Association, he continued to do so, but the evidence does not disclose whether the Association purchased or stored the grain or whether it was pooled.\nThese commercial reserves and elevator deductions have been used within the terms, of the contracts under which the appellant authorized their deduction and retention without any covenant to pay interest or to repay the principal. The subsequent steps taken by the Association, and already detailed, do not provide a basis upon which the appellant can claim either of these.\nThe Association, however, has as a matter of policy commenced making repayments of the principal, on the basis already discussed, to certain groups of which the appellant is one. These payments are made to the members within these groups in the order of the reception of their respective applications and in any year up to the amount of the funds available.\nUnder the circumstances of this case, there being no breach on the part of the Association and it having adopted the policy just mentioned, and the good faith of the Association not questioned, there would appear to be no purpose to be served in directing a declaratory judgment which, as the appellant concedes, could only be effective after the provincial government has been paid in full. This, according to the terms of the agreement with that government, would not be until 1951, while under the present policy of the Association the appellant may have received his repayment before that date.\nThe appellant cited a number of cases including Grainger v. Order of Canadian Home Circles[8]. There the company imposed upon the plaintiff substantial changes in the contract. Some of these changes were validly made, but so far as they were not, a declaratory judgment was directed setting forth the plaintiff\u2019s rights. A breach of contract was in that case proved. In the case at bar no breach has been established, and no case has been cited that goes so far as to direct a declaratory judgment against a party carrying on within the limits of its contractual rights.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. The judgment of Rand and Kellock jj. was delivered by\nRand j.\u2014The incorporation of the co-operative company in 1923 and its confirmation by statute in 1924 had as its object the establishment of co-operative selling of the principal product of Saskatchewan, wheat. Prior to that time the business of marketing grain was carried out as a separate private enterprise; and it can be gathered from the material before us, what is a basic inference from the co-operative principle, that elimination of the intermediate profit was the sine qua non of the organization.\nThe mode of introducing that feature into the mechanism adopted makes it important to examine closely the constitution of the company incorporated to achieve the purposes in view. There was the general authorization to carry on the business of co-operative collecting, buying, handling, marketing and selling the product in all of its ramifications. But a business of the scope envisaged required obviously a substantial capital, and it is the manner in which capital was to be raised and dealt with that constitutes, for the purposes of this appeal, the controlling consideration of the enactment.\nThe share capital, originally $100,000, later $200,000, was divided into the same number of shares of the value of $1 each. Members were to be grain growers in the province, and originally were required to bind themselves by contract to market all their wheat through the company. Power was given to limit the holding of a member to one share, and that was done by clause 4a of the Articles. Section 6 specifically forbade the declaration or payment to the shareholders of any dividend. Clause 24 of the Articles provided:\n24. * * * The Directors may, subject to the terms of the Grower\u2019s contract, deduct such sums for elevator purposes as they deem advisable and may invest on behalf of the Company, such deductions, either in the purchase of elevator facilities or in the stock of a company or companies to be formed or hereto formed, for the purpose of acquiring such facilities.\nSections 13 and 14 of the Act were as follows:\n13. In the event of the company going into liquidation or being wound up, voluntarily or otherwise, the assets of the company in liquidation shall, after the payment of all just debts, claims, costs and expenses, be distributed among such persons, their successors or assigns, whether members of the company or not, who have delivered to the company a commodity or commodities for sale by the company, pro rata, in proportion to the amount retained by the company from the proceeds of the sale of such commodity or commodities, and shown to be standing to the credit of such persons on the books of the company at the time of the commencement of such winding up or liquidation.\n14. No transfer sale or assignment of or charge on the interest of any person in any moneys deducted by the company from the proceeds of any commodity or commodities handled by the company, or the interest of any person in any security or property in which the same may have been invested, or in the proceeds of any such investment, shall be valid until approved by the company, in a manner to be determined by the company, who shall have an absolute discretion as to the granting of such approval, and until such approval the company shall not be required to recognize any such transfer, sale assignment or charge in any way whatsoever.\nThe share capital was obviously not designed to raise the necessary funds, and the method of doing that is implied by clause 24 of the Articles. Under the original contracts which bound the member to an exclusive marketing for a period of five years, there were the following provisions dealing with deductions and related matters:\n8. The Grower hereby appoints the Association his sole and exclusive agent * * *\n* * * *\n(d) To pay or retain and deduct from the gross returns from the sale of the wheat delivered to it by the Growers the amount necessary to cover all brokerage, advertising, taxes, tolls, freights, elevator charges, insurance interest, legal expenses, operating costs and expenses, and all other proper charges, such as salaries, fixed charges and general expenses of the Association and, in addition, the Association may deduct such percentage, not exceeding one per cent (1%) of the gross selling price of the wheat as it shall deem desirable as a commercial reserve to be used for any of the purposes or activities of the Association.\n* * * *\n(f) To deduct from the gross returns from the sale of all wheat handled by the Association for Growers who have executed this agreement or an agreement similar in terms a sum out of each Grower\u2019s proper proportion thereof, not exceeding two cents (2c) per bushel and to invest the same for and on behalf of the Association in acquiring either by construction, purchase, lease or otherwise such facilities for handling grain as the Directors of the Association may deem advisable or in the capital stock or shares of any company or association formed for the purpose of so erecting, constructing or acquiring such facilities and to sell or otherwise dispose of any such investment and re-invest the proceeds thereof in like manner.\n* * * *\n17. The Grower covenants and agrees to, and hereby does irrevocably apply for one (1) share out of the Ordinary Shares in the capital stock of the Association and agrees to pay to the Association the par value thereof, namely, the sum of One Dollar ($1.00). The Association covenants and agrees to accept the said application and to allot to the Grower one (1) share of stock out of the Ordinary Shares in the capital stock of the Association, provided the signatures required by paragraph 1 hereof are obtained within the time therein set out. Should such signatures be not so obtained the Grower agrees that the said sum of $1.00 shall be a contribution to the Association for the purposes set out in paragraph 18 hereof.\n18. The Grower covenants and agrees to pay the further sum of Two Dollars ($2.00) to defray the expenses of organization, including the expenses of and of formation of the committee known as The Wheat Pool Organization Committee to carry on field service and educational work and other proper activities of the Association.\nPower to distribute money, proceeds or investments was contained in section 4(cc) of the Act:\n(cc) To pay or recoup to, reimburse for or distribute to, any person or persons who have entered into a marketing contract with the company, any moneys contributed directly or indirectly to the company by them, or deducted or withheld from the proceeds of any grain sold by them through the company or the proceeds of any such moneys or any investment thereof. All such payments or distributions, as far as practicable, to be made on the basis of the same proportion in which they were contributed by such persons respectively; such payment or distribution to be made in whole or in part at such times and place and in such manner as in the absolute discretion of the company may seem expedient; provided any or all of such contributions, deductions, or the proceeds or earnings thereof may be withheld or retained with or without paying interest thereon and may be invested or reinvested in any company, corporation or business, whether operated upon a profit, non-profit, patronage dividend basis or otherwise. The provisions of this clause shall be construed and read as if they had been in force since the first day of January, 1929.\nClause 10 of the Articles dealt with the case of a member ceasing to be under contract or making default in its performance, and power was given the directors to forfeit the share held by him. A proviso declared\nthat upon such forfeiture any surplus of reserves or elevator or other deductions standing to the credit of such member, shall thereupon be valued by the Directors of the Company and settlement made with such defaulting member. The decision of the Board of Directors as to the value of the interest of such member in such surpluses, reserves or other deductions shall be final.\nIn the case of death or bankruptcy of a member, clause 11 provided that the representative \u201cshall be entitled to the same distribution and other advantages\u201d as if he were the registered holder of the share.\nBy clause 19 the business was to be conducted in such manner and on such a basis that so far as possible no profit should be taken from, charged to or exacted against any member on the marketing of any grain for him by the company, pursuant to a contract between them.\nAt the end of the first contract period, which covered the crop years from 1923 to 1927 inclusive, there was issued to each contract holder, from whom elevator deductions had been made, a certificate under the seal of the company in these terms:\nELEVATOR DEDUCTIONS\nCERTIFICATE\nThis is to Certify that R. Barnes, 166-007 of Rush Lake in the Province of Saskatchewan has been credited on the books of Saskatchewan Co-operative Wheat Producers Limited, with the sums shown on the attached coupons, which sums represent the Elevator Deductions made in accordance with the terms of the contract between the said Company and its grower members, from the returns of the sale of wheat and other grains delivered prior to July 21st, 1928; particulars of which Deductions are shown for each year on coupons attached.\nInterest from September 1st, 1928, will be paid annually at the rate of Six (6) per cent per annum on the sums represented by this Certificate which shall from time to time remain unpaid, provided however, that the Company reserves the right to declare that a lower or other rate of interest, or no interest, shall be payable in any year or years, all interest payments shall be non-cumulative in effect.\nThe Company may, in accordance with the terms of the said contract, retain the said sums or may repay all or any part of the said sum or sums upon any interest due date, by giving notice of its intention so to do, in at least two daily newspapers to be published in the province of Saskatchewan, or by letter addressed to the holder thereof at his last address appearing on the books of the company and interest on the sums to be so repaid shall cease to accrue from the date for payment fixed in such notice, or the company may at its option in lieu of payment, allot to the holder of such certificate shares of stock in any company in which the company may have invested the said moneys, to an amount equal to the principal sum then remaining unpaid, provided, that if the holder hereof shall cease to be a member of the company by reason of the forfeiture of the share of such member as provided by article 10 of the Articles of Association of the Company, the sums then standing to the credit of such holders as evidenced by this Certificate shall be valued and paid by the directors as provided by the aforesaid article 10.\nNo portion of the sums represented by this Certificate shall be paid without the delivery to the Company of the coupon covering the sum intended to be paid, or in the case of the final coupon payment without the delivery of such coupon accompanied by this Certificate.\nThe amount set forth herein is subject to income tax deductions (if any).\nNo transfer or assignment of this Certificate or any portion thereof shall be valid unless and until approved by the Company in such manner and subject to such conditions as the Company may determine. A similar certificate was issued to cover the commercial reserve deductions.\nThe question raised in this appeal is whether the appellant, from whose returns both elevator and reserve deductions were made, is entitled to a declaratory judgment that, as for a breach of trust or otherwise, the principal sums or interest on them or both are now owing to him. Admittedly his right to recover is in any case barred at this time by section 3, chapter 77, of the Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1932.\nWhat was set up was a corporate body with a nominal authorized capital, the effective capital of which, both fixed and working, was intended to be provided by the deductions under the contracts. This meant an informal within the formal capitalization.\nThe former, as to the elevator deductions, has been invested by the company in fixed assets. The handling facilities are owned largely by the elevator company of which the parent company holds all of the capital stock; and that stock is seen to be the converted form of the original contributions. The commercial reserves were to be held and applied generally to the purposes of the company, including working capital for subsidiaries.\nWhat, then, is the relation of the individual contributor to the company? The clue to that lies, mainly, I think, in the provision of section 13 for the mode of distribution of assets on liquidation. That section treats the contributions as the basic capital and each contributor as having an \u201cinterest\u201d in the company. That interest is recognized throughout the Act, and I think it clear that it is a fractional share in the subsidiary capitalization representing for this purpose the whole of the company\u2019s assets. The amount is not fixed, but from time to time fluctuates as the needs of the company may require. Theoretically, the operations on the co-operative basis would never yield a profit; but they would take into account all appropriate accounting charges, including that on the capital which furnished the means for carrying them on.\nThe effective capital was thus committed to the company for certain purposes and impressed with certain contractual and equitable duties; but it was committed permanently to those purposes and duties. Should the original purposes fail, the company would be wound up and the distribution of assets made under section 13 of the Act; but administrative control over the funds for the purposes of the organization was a condition of and a restriction upon the interest created.\nThe dealing with those interests consistently with the co-operative scheme is designed from time to time to maintain ownership of them in the hands of persons who are active participants in the company\u2019s business. If, for instance, a contributor has ceased to market his product through the company, it is desirable as a policy that he cease likewise to have a voice in the company\u2019s affairs and that his interest be taken over for transfer to a person participating; and clauses (dd) and (ee) of section 4 of the statute seem directed to that object:\n(dd) To provide for the expropriation of or taking over of the shares or other interests in the company or in the assets thereof of any person or persons who cease to become holders of contracts with the company and to make provisions for compensation therefor;\n(ee) To make provision that a shareholder who ceases to be a holder of a contract in the company shall not have any right to vote in the affairs of the company;\nThus the entire concern of the company, plant, administration and operations, becomes confined to those who are presently availing themselves of its functions. Paragraph (cc) provides for a partial distribution of money, proceeds or investments, among other cases, as where the informal capital was being reduced because of an excess in deductions or where surplus assets or profits appeared. But the elimination of these interests, except upon a winding-up, could no more be brought about than that of share capital.\nFrom this it follows that the interest of the contributor is not that of a debt, and that it is inaccurate, technically, to speak of the repayment or the recovery of the contributions. If the recital in the certificate that the sums may be repaid on any interest due date, means \u201cin accordance with the terms of the said contract\u201d, it is without foundation in fact; and so far as it purports to declare a power based on a misconception of and inconsistent with the nature of the interest affected, it is ultra vires. There has been no failure of the primary purposes to which the money was to be applied; and no suggested breach of contractual or equitable obligation would amount to such a failure or give rise to any right to rescind the original transaction by winding-up or otherwise. The relief in any such case would be confined to such modes of compelling a corporation to adhere to the objects for which it was created as might be open to the interested members.\nThe contributions were made without express stipulation as to interest: the certificate is claimed to have contractual force only because it is under seal; there is nothing in the Act expressly authorizing its issue; and no question of estoppel can arise.\nThe contention is that the certificate constitutes an obligation by which interest became payable except as the company might for each year declare that none or a reduced percentage would be paid. This presents more complication, but when viewed in the background of the de facto capital structure, the purpose and intention of the language become clearer.\nThe real complaint is that, while since 1930 no return has been made to the contributors; enormous sums are being distributed as patronage dividends by the elevator company. But the latter are part of the operations of the enterprise. The implied contract with those offering grain on co-operative terms is to handle the products at cost. That was the essence of the original purpose to which the contributions were made. It happens that the appellant is no longer farming and is not now enjoying the benefit of this co-operative feature. But he was its beneficiary until retirement; he was likewise one of the recipients of an initial over-advance in 1929, amounting to more than $13,000,000, the settlement of which with the banks and the provincial government has taxed the entire resources of the company and on which there still remains a principal debt of over $5,000,000.\nThe provision for \u201cinterest\u201d reflects the minds of the incorporators. They sought to shun even the appearance in terminology of profits; and in relation to dividends on the capital stock of the elevator company, the resolution of July 8, 1931, speaks of \u201cinterest on capital stock\u201d. What is intended is a limitation in distribution to the equivalent of interest from the returns of the funds committed to the enterprise, but that distribution can be made only out of net returns. To confine interest to available earnings could never defeat the fundamental object of the enterprise; to bind the company to pay interest in any event, might do that, and consequently be ultra the company\u2019s powers. This limitation lies initially, then, on any provision for interest. Whether as to its payment the company is a debtor or under, a trust duty, it is unnecessary to decide.\nWhat then is the effect of the language of the certificate? Is it a declaration of intention or of obligation? Assuming, but not deciding, it to be the latter, in the background of investment as against money lent and the limitation of payment out of net returns, its interpretation takes on another aspect. That\nInterest from September 1st, 1928, will be paid annually at the rate of Six (6) per cent per annum on the sums represented by this Certificate which shall from time to time remain unpaid, provided however, that the Company reserves the right to declare that a lower or other rate of interest, or no interest, shall be payable in any year or years, all interest payments shall be non-cumulative in effect.\nadds nothing to what I should consider the duty of the company toward the holder, except as it might be construed as analogous to a standing declaration which, as each year expires without action under the reservation, gives rise to a right to that year\u2019s interest. But the mode of exercising the reserved power consistently with the matter in which it appears, must be taken to be informal and, since it is not required to be communicated to the contributor, of a purely internal character.\nThis view is strengthened when it is set against the fact that there is no other competing interest in the company for these distributions. At most, the certificate sets a standard of return to which the company should adhere but on which decision is not intended to be brought within a formal rigidity. The essential fact is the recognition of an obligation to distribute grounded in the circumstances of the contributions; and the exclusive appropriation of returns for the benefit of conflicting interests such as patronage dividends would be a violation of that duty. In those circumstances, the contention that the revocation should be specific for each year or for a term of years must be rejected.\nOn July 8, 1931, the elevator company passed the following resolution:\nThat all earnings of Pool Elevators in future years, declared to be available, including interest on capital stock and excess earnings, be used to meet the amount of the overpayment.\nAnd on September 17, 1931, that was followed by one of the company in this language:\nWhereas elevator deduction certificates and commercial reserve certificates have been issued to all persons from whom elevator deductions and commercial reserve deductions have been taken from the proceeds of the sale of wheat and (or) coarse grains delivered to the Company during the years 1924 to 1927 both inclusive; and\nWhereas such certificates provide for the Company paying interest thereon; and\nWhereas large sums of money are owing by the Company to the Government of Saskatchewan in connection with the sale of the 1929 crop; and\nWhereas the Company must use all available funds in order to repay such sums of money;\nTherefore be it resolved that in future no interest be declared or paid to the holders of any such elevator deduction certificates and (or) commercial reserve certificates, but that all interest earned by the moneys represented by such certificates be retained by the Company for the purpose of reducing its said indebtedness to the Government of Saskatchewan or for any other proper Company activity.\nIt may be pointed out that the surplus of the company comes substantially from the elevator company, and from the action of the latter it followed, apart from the outstanding debt to the province, that virtually no net would accrue to the company in that period. This would preclude a distribution of interest. The company\u2019s resolution \u201cthat in future no interest be declared * * * all interest earned by the moneys represented by such certificates be retained by the Company\u201d, so far as it might be taken to purport to bind the company for the future, would obviously be of no effect; it is simply a declaration that, until otherwise decided by the company, no payments will be made; and I think it a proper exercise of the reserved power.\nIs the appellant, then, entitled to a declaration defining the interest held by him in the company? In addition to the complication of the arrangement, what must be kept in mind is that he is only one of many thousand grain growers who are members of the company and have made similar contributions. The preamble of the contract recites:\nAnd whereas, this Agreement, although individual in expression, is one of a series either identical or generally similar in terms between the Association and Growers of wheat in the Province of Saskatchewan and shall constitute one contract between the several Growers of wheat in the Province of Saskatchewan signing the same and this Association.\nThe appellant is therefore merely one of a class with identical interests in the company. In all these circumstances, I do not think such a declaration should be made.\nThe appeal must, therefore, be dismissed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Gilbert H.

C.\nThe appellant was charged with the offence of indecent assault upon C, alleged to have taken place at a dental clinic while C was under examination. Complete discrepancy is disclosed between the testimony of the complainant and that of the accused. A witness, B, working in the clinic, gave evidence that he passed the open door of the room upon two occasions, without stating the time and the intervals of time between them, and that he had noticed that the accused was then writing at a table. The magistrate acquitted the accused, and, in his judgment, said that the case was one to be decided entirely on the credibility of the witnesses, that there should be a conviction or a dismissal of the charge whether the evidence of the complainant or that of the accused was accepted; and he added that, if the evidence of B was accepted, \u201cthere must be a dismissal of the charge,\u201d stating later that he was \u201cbound in law to accept his evidence\u201d. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal of the Crown and directed that the accused be retried upon the same charge. Upon an appeal by the accused to this Court,\nHeld that the judgment appealed from should be affirmed.\nPer the Chief Justice and Kellock and Estey JJ.:\u2014The evidence of B does not go so far as to contradict the evidence of the complainant nor corroborate the evidence of the accused upon the points that are material to the determination of the issue; and, even if B\u2019s evidence was believed, it was still necessary for the magistrate to consider all the evidence and the credibility and the weight to be given to the statements made by the respective witnesses. The magistrate has not considered the evidence upon any such basis, but rather has founded his decision upon a misdirection that if B\u2019s evidence was believed \u201cthere must be a dismissal.\u201d Comments as to the issue of credibility of witnesses.\nPer Kerwin J.:\u2014The proposition upon which the magistrate proceeded cannot be supported: he does not state whether he believed the evidence of the complainant or of the accused, and, in proceeding to discuss the evidence of B apart from that of the complainant and accused, he failed to perform the responsibility resting upon him.\nThe appellant also contended that, under s. 1014(2) Cr. C, the Court of Appeal should have dismissed the appeal by the Crown, as \u201cno substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred\u201d.\nPer the Chief Justice and Kellock and Estey JJ.:\u2014The appellate court, when there has been no decision arrived at upon a consideration of the evidence, particularly in a case where the evidence is so restricted to a few facts and where any adjudication must depend so largely upon the credibility and the weight to be given to the evidence of the respective parties, is unable to conclude that, under s. 1014(2) Cr. C., \u201cno substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.\u201d\nPer Kerwin J.:\u2014The appellant\u2019s claim should be dismissed. Effect must be given to the will of Parliament in permitting appeals by the Crown from acquittals (s. 1013(4) Cr. C.) and to the provisions of s. 1014(2) Cr. C. by which, according to s. 1013(5) Cr. C., the powers of a court of appeal are, mutatis mutandis, to be similar to the powers given by the former. Applying those provisions to this case, the proper rule to be followed by the Court of Appeal was that the onus was on the Crown to satisfy the Court that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same if the magistrate had properly directed himself. But, without in any way weakening the salutary rule that an accused is entitled to the benefit of a doubt as to his guilt, when a court of appeal has to apply the provisions of s. 1014(2) Cr. C., it must be concluded in the present case that the magistrate would not necessarily have acquitted the appellant if he had given himself the proper direction.\nRex v. Covert (28 C.C.C. 25), Rex v. Bourgeois (69 C.C.C. 120), Rex v. Probe (79 C.C.C. 289) and Rex v. O\u2019Leary (80 C.C.C. 327) discussed. APPEAL by the accused from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, allowing an appeal by the Attorney General for Ontario against the acquittal by Magistrate James B. Garvin on a charge of indecent assault and directing that the accused be retried upon the same charge.\nG. Arthur Martin K.C. for the appellant.\nW.B. Common K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kellock and Estey JJ. was delivered by\nESTEY J.\u2014The magistrate found the accused not guilty of the offence of indecent assault. The facts material to the offence were deposed to by the complainant and contradicted by the accused. The complainant stated that the offence took place at a dental clinic while she was under an examination by the accused, a qualified dentist in the Dental Corps. A witness Black gave evidence that he was at the time working in the same clinic and that upon two occasions he passed the room where he saw the complainant and the accused. The door of the room was open and upon each occasion he noticed that the accused was writing at a table. Just when or at what intervals of time he passed the room is not disclosed, nor does the evidence disclose either the plan or size of the clinic.\nAt the conclusion of the hearing the magistrate reserved judgment and later acquitted the accused, his judgment reading in part as follows:\nThe case is one that must be decided entirely on the credibility of the witnesses. If the evidence of the complainant is accepted, there must be a conviction. On the other hand, if the evidence of the accused is accepted, there must be a dismissal of the charge. Also, in my judgment, if the evidence of the witness Black is accepted, there must be a dismissal.\nAn examination of the evidence of the witness Black, while relevant in determining the credibility of both the complainant and the accused, is upon the main issue restricted to his observations upon two occasions as he passed the door. It does not go so far as to contradict the evidence of the complainant nor corroborate the evidence of the accused upon the points that are material to the determination of the issue. If therefore Black\u2019s evidence was believed, it was still necessary for the magistrate to consider all of the evidence, the credibility and the weight to be given to the statements made by the respective witnesses and to determine whether the accused was guilty or not guilty.\nIt is clear that the magistrate has not considered the evidence upon any such basis but rather has founded his decision upon a misdirection that if Black\u2019s evidence was believed \u201cthere must be a dismissal.\u201d\nThe appellate court, when there has been no decision arrived at upon a consideration of the evidence, particularly in a case where the evidence is so restricted to a few facts and where any adjudication must depend so largely upon the credibility and the weight to be given to the evidence of the respective parties, is unable to conclude that under section 1014(2) Cr. C. \u201cno substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.\u201d\nIt would appear also that the magistrate misdirected himself relative to the determination of Black\u2019s credibility. He stated:\nIn my judgment the evidence of Black substantially meets all the above tests and I feel that I am bound in law to accept his evidence.\nHe based his statement upon Rex v. Covert[1]. In that case the accused was charged that he did unlawfully keep intoxicating liquor in a place other than a dwelling house. The prosecution adduced evidence that the accused had upon his premises a bar or a counter and was in possession of intoxicating liquor and then relied upon the statutory provision that placed upon the accused the burden of proving that he had not committed the offence. The accused in giving his evidence gave an explanation which, if believed, discharged the statutory burden placed upon him and entitled him to an acquittal. Notwithstanding this and apparently without indicating a reason there for the magistrate found the accused guilty. Mr. Justice Beck, with whom the majority of the court concurred, condemned the decision which he described as made \u201carbitrarily and in disregard of the evidence.\u201d When the learned judge stated: \u201cIt cannot be said without limitation that a judge can refuse to accept evidence,\u201d he no doubt had in mind the failure on the part of the magistrate to act judicially rather than arbitrarily. Certainly the tests he suggests do not deprive the magistrate of any of his powers but would rather seem to emphasize that he discharge his duty and not only determine the question of credibility but indicate that he has done so.\nThe issue of credibility is one of fact and cannot be determined by following a set of rules that it is suggested have the force of law and, in so far as the language of Mr. Justice Beck may be so construed, it cannot be supported upon the authorities. Anglin J. (later Chief Justice) in speaking of credibility stated:\nby that I understand not merely the appreciation of the witnesses\u2019 desire to be truthful but also of their opportunities of knowledge and powers of observation, judgment and memory\u2014in a word, the trustworthiness of their testimony, which may have depended very largely on their demeanour in the witness box and their manner in giving evidence. Reymond v. Township of Bosanquet[2].\nThe foregoing is a general statement and does not purport to be exhaustive. Eminent judges have from time to time indicated certain guides that have been of the greatest assistance, but so far as I have been able to find there has never been an effort made to indicate all the possible factors that might enter into the determination. It is a matter in which so many human characteristics, both the strong and the weak, must be taken into consideration. The general integrity and intelligence of the witness, his powers to observe, his capacity to remember and his accuracy in statement are important. It is also important to determine whether he is honestly endeavouring to tell the truth, whether he is sincere and frank or whether he is biassed, reticent and evasive. All these questions and others may be answered from the observation of the witness\u2019 general conduct and demeanour in determining the question of credibility.\nThe judgment of the appellate court directing a new trial should be affirmed and the appeal dismissed.\nKERWIN J.\u2014The appellant was acquitted by a magistrate of a charge that he did unlawfully indecently assault one Emily Cumming, a female, contrary to section 292 of the Criminal Code. The Attorney General of Ontario appealed to the Court of Appeal for that province against the acquittal on the grounds that the magistrate misdirected himself in stating that he was bound in law to accept the evidence of one Black, a witness at the trial, and that the magistrate was wrong in coming to the conclusion that he could exercise no discretion in weighing the credibility of that evidence. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and directed that the accused be retried upon the same charge.\nIn giving judgment, the magistrate said:\nThe case is one that must be decided entirely on the credibility of the witnesses. If the evidence of the complainant is accepted, there must be a conviction. On the other hand, if the evidence of the accused is accepted, there must be a dismissal of the charge. Also, in my judgment, if the evidence of the witness Black is accepted, there must be a dismissal.\nAfter stating that Black was to some extent an independent witness and that if his evidence was to be accepted, he, the magistrate, did not see how there could be a conviction, he continued:\nI think the evidence of Black should be examined having regard to the principle of law laid down in Rex v. Covert[3].\nThis was a judgment of Beck J. on behalf of the majority in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta and the magistrate quoted therefrom the following paragraphs:\nWe are bound to presume the accused was innocent, until proved guilty; he gave all the available evidence and that evidence, if true, explained away the inference or presumption against him.\nIt will be objected, of course, that the magistrate may have disbelieved entirely the evidence on behalf of the accused, and that it was open to him to do so; but in my opinion it cannot be said without limitation that a judge can refuse to accept evidence. I think he cannot, if the following conditions are fulfilled:\n(1) That the statements of the witness are not in themselves improbable or unreasonable;\n(2) That there is no contradiction of them;\n(3) That the credibility of the witness has not been attacked by evidence against his character;\n(4) That nothing appears in the course of his evidence or of the evidence of any other witness tending to throw discredit upon him; and\n(5) That there is nothing in his demeanour while in Court during the trial to suggest untruthfulness. To permit a trial judge to refuse to accept evidence given under all these conditions would be to permit him to determine the dispute arbitrarily and in disregard of the evidence, which is surely not the spirit of our system of jurisprudence.\nThe Covert case[4] arose in connection with an application by way of certiorari to quash a summary conviction under the Liquor Act of Alberta and was decided before the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Rex v. Nat Bell Liquors Limited[5]. There a number of judgments in various courts were overruled and it was decided that a conviction by a magistrate for a non\u2011indictable offence could not be quashed on certiorari on the ground that the depositions show that there was no evidence to support the conviction. The Covert case4 is mentioned at page 141 of the report.\nWhat the Court of Appeal had before it in the present case was an appeal and the proposition upon which the magistrate proceeded cannot be supported. Nowhere does he say whether he believed the evidence of the complainant or of the accused, and to proceed to discuss the evidence of Black apart from that of the complainant and accused is really to shirk the responsibility resting upon him. Unless, therefore, there is some other valid ground of attack, the order of the Court of Appeal ordering a new trial cannot be impugned.\nIt was contended, however, that, under subsection 2 of section 1014 of the Criminal Code, the Court of Appeal should have dismissed the appeal. This subsection reads:\n2. The court may also dismiss the appeal if, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that on any of the grounds above mentioned the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, it is also of opinion that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.\nWe do not know if the point was argued nor, since no written reasons were delivered, whether it was considered, in the Court of Appeal. The test in applying subsection 2 in the case of an appeal by an accused from a conviction is well known and was reiterated in this Court in Schmidt v. The King[6]. But it is said that on an appeal by an Attorney General from an acquittal a different rule is to be followed and reliance is placed upon two decisions in the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, Rex v. Bourgeois[7], and Rex v. Probe[8]. The effect of these decisions is that upon an appeal by an Attorney General from an acquittal, even if substantial error has been shown, the Court should not grant a new trial where doubt could be entertained by the tribunal of fact as to the guilt of the accused. This conclusion was based upon a consideration of the rule that the accused is entitled to the benefit of a doubt as to his guilt. While not referred to on the argument of this appeal, it was decided in Rex v. O\u2019Leary[9], by the British Columbia Court of Appeal, that when the appellate court was satisfied from the report of the magistrate that he would have convicted in the particular case without corroboration of an accomplice, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had actually occurred because, even if the trial judge had not misdirected himself, he must have reached the same conclusion as he actually did.\nThe first two cases, of course, go much further than the last, and the reasoning upon which they proceeded cannot be justified. The dissenting opinion of Martin J., now Chief Justice of Saskatchewan, in the first case is to be preferred. As he points out, Chief Justice Anglin, speaking for this Court in Belyea v. The King[10], refers to subsection 5 of section 1013 of the Criminal Code as enacted in 1930 by which the procedure upon an appeal by an Attorney General and the powers of the Court of Appeal shall mutatis mutandis, and so far as the same are applicable to appeals upon a question of law alone, be similar to the procedure prescribed and the powers given by sections 1012 to 1021 Cr. C. inclusive. Chief Justice Anglin stated\nthat the effect of the words \u201cmutatis mutandis\u201d is that clause (a) (of subsection 3 of section 1014 Cr. C.) must be made to read, on an appeal (by an Attorney General) being allowed, to\n(a) quash the acquittal and direct a judgment and verdict of conviction to be entered.\nThat in fact was what was done in the Belyea case10.\nThe point with which we are concerned under subsection 2 of section 1014 Cr. C. was apparently not argued in Pitre v. The King[11], so that the remarks at the end of the judgment of Smith J. may properly be considered as obiter dicta but to give to this subsection the meaning ascribed in the judgments in Saskatchewan where a court of appeal has before it an appeal by the Attorney General from a conviction would be to permit an appellate court to encroach upon the field of the tribunal of fact. Without in any way weakening the salutary rule that an accused is entitled to the benefit of a doubt as to his guilt, effect must be given to the will of Parliament in permitting appeals from acquittals and to the provisions of subsection 2 of section 1014 Cr. C. by which, according to the terms of subsection 5 of section 1013 Cr. C., the powers of a court of appeal are mutatis mutandis and so far as the same are applicable to appeals upon a question of law alone, to be similar to the powers given by the former. Applying those provisions to the present case, the proper rule to be followed by the Court of Appeal was that the onus was on the Crown to satisfy the Court that the verdict would not necessarily have been the same if the magistrate had properly directed himself. No doubt there will be circumstances such as arose in Rex v. O\u2019Leary[12] where not only that cannot be shown but the opposite is true, but that situation does not arise here. In the present case it must be concluded that the magistrate would not necessarily have acquitted the appellant if he had given himself the proper direction.\nThe appeal should be dismissed.\nTASCHEREAU J.:\u2014I am of opinion that this appeal should be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\n[1] (1916) 28 C.C.C. 25.\n[2] (1919) 59 Can.

Hudson J. also sat at the hearing, but he died before judgment was delivered.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nTrial\u2014Evidence\u2014Trial, with jury, of actions for damages caused by collision of motor cars\u2014Questions by cross-examining counsel to party as to convictions on previous occasions under Highway Traffic Act\u2014New trial\u2014Right to jury.\nThe actions, tried together, with a jury, were for damages caused by a collision between a motor car owned and driven by appellant and one owned and driven by respondent S. The jury found negligence in each driver contributing to the accident, and apportioned the fault, against said respondent 75 per cent. and against appellant 25 per cent.; and, accordingly, judgments were given for damages, to appellant against said respondent, and to a passenger in the latter\u2019s car, now also a respondent, against appellant. On appeal by said respondents, the Court of Appeal for Ontario ordered a new trial ([1945] 4 D.L.R. 450). That order was now affirmed by this Court on the ground that, at the trial, appellant\u2019s counsel, in cross-examining the respondent driver (and following some explanatory remark by the latter that it was his \u201cfirst occasion in court\u201d, and counsel indicating intention to attack credibility) elicited from him that on certain charges of speeding in previous years he had paid fines; but it was not established that he had himself committed the offences (he might, as owner of a car driven by others, have \u201cincurred penalties\u201d under The Highway Traffic Act, Ont., without having himself \u201cviolated\u201d the Act; he stated that on none of the occasions had he appeared in court); and, assuming evidence as to the convictions was admissible at all, such evidence could only have been adduced if counsel were in a position to show that the witness had himself committed the offences; respondents had met the onus under s. 27(1) of The Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 100 (of showing a \u201csubstantial wrong or miscarriage\u201d). But this Court held that the direction by the Court of Appeal that the new trial should be without a jury should be set aside; as a jury is an eminently proper tribunal for trial of the matters in issue, sufficient ground had not been shown to deprive appellant, by said direction, of that right. (The Court found it unnecessary to decide whether, in view of s. 55 of The Judicature Act, and the authority thereby and by the Rules conferred upon the trial judge, the direction could be supported.) APPEALS from judgments of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], which set aside judgments of Barlow J. on the findings of a jury, and ordered a new trial, to be had before a judge without a jury.\nThere were two actions, tried together before Barlow J. with a jury. They arose out of a collision on February 12, 1944, on Highway No. 2, near Highland Creek, Ontario, between a motor car owned and driven by the appellant and one owned and driven by the respondent Secord. The appellant sued Secord for damages for personal injuries and damage to her car, and the respondent Nasmith, a passenger in Secord\u2019s car, sued the appellant for damages for personal injuries. The jury found negligence on the part of both drivers causing or contributing to the cause of the accident, found the degrees of such negligence to be: respondent Secord 75 per cent., and appellant 25 per cent., and assessed appellant\u2019s total damages at $3,000 and respondent Nasmith\u2019s total damages at $5,000. In accordance with such findings, judgment was given in favour of the appellant for $2,250 against the respondent Secord and judgment was given in favour of the respondent Nasmith for $1,250 against the appellant. The said Secord and Nasmith appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, which gave judgments as above stated (Laidlaw J.A. dissented, except that he would direct a new trial as between Nasmith and the present appellant, but confined to the ascertainment of the quantum of damages sustained by Nasmith). Appellant appealed to this Court.\nD.L. McCarthy K.C. (in one appeal) and J.R. Cartwright K.C. (in the other appeal) for the appellant.\nF.J. Hughes K.C. for the respondent Secord.\nJ.J. Robinette K.C. for the respondent Nasmith.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nKELLOCK J.\u2014These appeals are taken from orders of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, dated 6th July, 1945, which allowed appeals by the respondents from judgments of Barlow J., dated 24th February, 1945, entered pursuant to the verdict of a jury. The two actions arose out of a collision on 12th February, 1944, between automobiles owned and driven by the appellant and the respondent Secord, respectively, the appellant Nasmith being a passenger in the Secord car. The actions were tried together. By the order in appeal a new trial was directed, Laidlaw J.A. dissenting. The view of the majority was that the trial was unsatisfactory by reason of conduct on the part of counsel representing the appellant at the trial and also on the ground that a jury acting judicially and with a proper appreciation of its duties must necessarily have arrived at a greater amount of damages than was awarded Nasmith. The majority were also of the view that the damages, in the absence of other explanation, might also be the result of the conduct of counsel already referred to. Laidlaw J.A. dissented on the ground that no sufficient or any objection had been made at trial and that the present respondents had failed to show any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. While a new trial was directed, that trial was directed to take place without a jury.\nIn our opinion, the appeal should be dismissed but the direction that the new trial shall take place without a jury must be deleted. We do not consider it necessary to deal with all the matters of which the respondents complain with regard to the conduct of the trial. We think it is sufficient to refer to one matter only which, in our opinion, makes it necessary that a new trial should be had.\nImmediately before commencing his cross-examination of the respondent Secord, counsel for the appellant, in the absence of the jury, said, basing himself upon the provisions of section 18(1) of The Evidence Act, R.S.O. 1937, Chap. 119, that he proposed to cross\u2011examine the witness with respect to previous convictions under The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1937, Chap. 288. He said: \u201cI submit I have that right on purely a question of credibility; I am not submitting it on any other ground, it is on the ground of credibility.\u201d And again: \u201cI am not trying to put the convictions in as evidence to show he is a bad driver on previous occasions or because he was convicted of speeding on previous occasions that he was speeding on this occasion, I am submitting it on credibility, * * *\u201d Objection was made by counsel for both respondents and at the conclusion of argument with regard to the point the learned trial judge ruled as follows:\nHis Lordship: Mr. Levinter put his application for leave to introduce by way of cross\u2011examination questions as to previous convictions of the defendant Dr. Secord, on the ground that he is entitled to cross-examine as to those by way of attacking the credibility of the witness; well, that might be so from a certain standpoint, yet in an action of this kind before a jury it would have a very different effect entirely, and for that reason alone, regardless of any other reasons that there may be, I must rule that the questions cannot be asked. If I am wrong and this goes farther, it will have to be corrected elsewhere. Bring the jury back.\nThe cross-examination proceeded and in the course of it the witness, in excusing himself for the way in which he had given some answers on discovery, made the statement: \u201cThis is my first occasion in court. I am not familiar with the proceeding.\u201d The following then occurred:\nMr. Levinter: It is your first occasion in court?\nA. Yes, with the exception of giving expert evidence.\nQ. Have you never been in court before?\nA. No.\nQ. Never in police court before?\nA. No, sir.\nMr. Levinter: Am I entitled to now on the question of credibility?\nHis Lordship: No, I don\u2019t think so.\nMr. Walker: I object to these innuendoes my friend is constantly making.\nMr. Hughes: Do you mind if I say that after Your Lordship\u2019s ruling my friend has directly gone through it; now, My Lord, may I withdraw any objection and let the jury have whatever he has got in his head so that there will be no questions said to the jury afterwards that we endeavoured to keep anything back, let him put it in.\nHis Lordship: Very well.\nCross-examining counsel then elicited from the witness that on certain charges of speeding in 1938, 1939, 1940 and 1943 he paid fines, but the witness said that other persons drove his car as well as himself and he was unable to say whether on any of the occasions he himself had been driving. He also said that on none of the occasions had he appeared in court.\nSomewhat inadvisedly counsel for the respondent Nasmith, who preceded counsel for the appellant, said in the course of his address to the jury:\nBy innuendo he gets it across to you people that this man is a speed fiend, a terrible fellow\u2014just by innuendo\u2014that he is full of convictions, that he must have been in court many times; then my learned friend fortunately brings out, \u201cWell, let us hear all about this\u201d, I had not heard about it, and we find over a period of driving as many miles as he does in a year, we find over the period of those years a certain number of fines for speeding; my friend does not bring forward and indicate who is fined.\nAppellant\u2019s counsel followed in due course and the following occurred:\nMy friend bitterly complains that I brought out these convictions for speeding; gentlemen, I would have laughed, just as you laughed yesterday, if I had brought out that in 1938 he was speeding so much, we all laugh sometimes when these things happen, but you do not have two in 1938, and one in 1939, and you don\u2019t have another in 1940, you don\u2019t have another in 1943\u2014\nHis Lordship: Mr. Levinter, just a moment; you brought that evidence as to credibility and nothing else, now you are using it for exactly the other purpose\u2014\nMr. Levinter: My friend raised it in his argument at great length, and surely I am entitled to respond to my learned friend\u2019s argument.\nHis Lordship: Proceed.\nMr. Levinter: Those are the only times that he was convicted apparently, now was he putting on speed on this occasion?\nBy section 26 of The Highway Traffic Act it is provided that no vehicle shall be driven upon any highway within a city, town or village at a greater speed than thirty miles an hour except in certain special localities, and at fifty miles per hour outside such municipalities. By sub\u2011section (4), any person \u201cwho violates\u201d any of the provisions of the section is rendered liable to certain penalties, including certain fines.\nBy section 46 it is provided that the owner of a motor vehicle shall \u201cincur the penalties\u201d provided for any violation of the Act unless at the time of such violation the motor vehicle was in the possession of some person other than the owner or his chauffeur, without the owner\u2019s consent, and the driver not being the owner is also made liable for such penalties.\nAccordingly, even assuming that a breach of the speed limit laid down by the statute would constitute a \u201ccrime\u201d within the meaning of sub-section (1) of section 18 of The Evidence Act, which we do not consider it necessary to decide, the appellant did not establish, as to any of the convictions, that it was the witness who had \u201cviolated\u201d the statute.\nWe are of the opinion that, assuming evidence as to these convictions was admissible at all, such evidence could only have been adduced if counsel were in a position to show that the witness had himself committed the offences. We think that the withdrawal of objection on the part of counsel for the respondents must be deemed to have proceeded on the assumption that this would be done. On this ground alone we think that the order for a new trial must be affirmed. We do not think it open to the appellant to contend that the course pursued did not have its intended effect. We therefore think that the onus resting upon the respondents under section 27 of The Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1937, Cap. 100, has been met.\nWith respect to the direction that the new trial should be without a jury, we think that, as a jury is an eminently proper tribunal for the trial of the matters that are in issue between the parties, sufficient ground has not been shown to deprive the appellant of that right. Whether, in view of the right to a jury given by section 55 of The Judicature Act, and the authority thereby and by the Rules conferred upon the trial judge, the order in appeal can be supported, need not be decided. There rests with the trial judge sufficient power and authority to conduct the trial as it should be conducted, and, should he see reason to try the action without a jury or to dispense with the jury at any stage, his discretion is not subject to review; Currie v. Motor Union Insurance Co.[2]; Wilson v. Kinnear[3]. We think that the course followed in Reiffenstein v. Dey[4] should be followed here and the direction complained of must therefore be set aside.\nThe appeal will therefore be allowed in part as indicated. The right to a trial by jury is a substantial right, and, as success is divided, we think there should be no costs of this appeal. The costs below will not be interfered\nAppeals allowed in part.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Luxenberg, Levinter, Ciglen & Grossberg (in one action) and Smith, Rae, Greer & Cartwright (in the other action).\nSolicitors for the respondent Secord: Hughes, Agar, Thompson & Amys.\nSolicitors for the respondent Nasmith: David J. Walker.\n[1] [1945] 4 D.L.R. 450.\n[2] (1924) 27 O.W.N. 99.\n[3] (1925) 57 O.L.R. 679.\n[4] (1913) 28 O.L.R. 491, at 498.\n",

The policy was issued upon the joint application of both, the father being mentioned to be the beneficiary. There was a proviso, the father assenting to it, that the son reserved to himself the right to operate at any time a substitution of beneficiary. The policy contained conditions for a clause enumerating change of beneficiary: that it should be effected by notice in writing to the insurance company, with the deposit of the policy in its office, there to be endorsed by the company and that the change would operate only after such endorsement. In 1926, the son obtained two loans from the company on the security of the policy, and the appellant and his son for that purpose transferred to the company the policy, to be returned in reimbursement of the loans. In 1940, the son died and left a will bequeating to his wife all his movables and unmovables, etc., including his insurances. The proceeds of the policy were claimed by the appellant as beneficiary under the policy and by the respondent under the will of her husband. The appellant contended that the substitution of beneficiary had not been effected within the terms of the clause above mentioned and also that there had been already a transfer of the policy to the company as security for the loans. The Superior Court maintained the appellant\u2019s action claiming the amount of the policy; but the appellate court reversed that judgment, holding that the right of the insured to change the beneficiary could be exercised by will. Held, affirming the judgment appealed from, Rand J. dissenting, that the widow respondent was entitled to recover the proceeds of the policy. The conditions of the policy, which the appellant invoked in support of his contentions, were not inserted therein for his own benefit. The first clause, as to conditions for change of beneficiary, was clearly providing for the protection of the insurance company itself, which alone had the right to invoke it, and quoad the appellant, it was res inter alias acta. The second clause has no bearing upon the issue in this case: the transfer of the policy to the insurance company was restricted to the amount of the loans made by it to the insured. The surplus of the proceeds of the policy belonged to the respondent as beneficiary duly substituted by the will of the deceased and could no more be claimed by the appellant who had been legally revoked as beneficiary under the conditions of the policy.\nPer Rand J. dissenting:\u2014The policy notwithstanding the power of revocation is a contract for the benefit of a third person within article 1029 C.C., and, in the absence of a rule either of the Code or the prior law, that article leaves untouched, if it does not indeed exclusively contemplate, powers of revocation provided by or inherent in the contract. In the present contract of insurance, as in any other obligation, underlying particular formalities that may be specified there is assumed a fundamental communication between the parties. As there is no suggestion that the contract here, either expressly or impliedly, contemplates a designation by a testamentary instrument, it must be concluded that a communication between the parties in the lifetime of the insured is a sine qua non of such a modification.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, Appeal side, Province of Quebec reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, E. Fabre Surveyer J. and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action.\nThe appellant claimed the proceeds of a life insurance policy as beneficiary named in the policy itself; while the respondent based her rights on the fact that her husband, by his will, has left her all his property \u201cincluding his assurances\u201d.\nJacques Cartier K.C. for the appellant.\nAndr\u00e9 Sabourin for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin, Taschereau and Estey JJ. was delivered by\u2014\nTaschereau J.\u2014L\u2019appelant, demandeur en premi\u00e8re instance, r\u00e9clame le produit d\u2019une police d\u2019assurance dont il pr\u00e9tend \u00eatre le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire. Sa r\u00e9clamation a \u00e9t\u00e9 admise par la Cour Sup\u00e9rieure, mais la Cour du Banc du Roi a rejet\u00e9 son action. Dans le cours du mois de juillet 1914, la Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, la mise-en-cause, a \u00e9mis une police d\u2019assurance au montant de $5,000 (vingt paiements), \u00e0 la demande conjointe de l\u2019appelant Isa\u00efe Adam et de son fils Joseph Ovila Adam. Aux termes m\u00eames de la police, il est mentionn\u00e9 que le fils est l\u2019assur\u00e9, et que le p\u00e8re sera b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire dans le cas de survie. L\u2019une des clauses les plus importantes de cette police, est qu\u2019avec le consentement du p\u00e8re, le fils s\u2019est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le droit de changer de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire \u00e0 son gr\u00e9, et de d\u00e9terminer par cons\u00e9quent toute autre personne de son choix, comme devant recevoir \u00e0 sa mort le produit de la police. Les conditions relatives au changement de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire sont les suivantes:\u2014\nChangement de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire:\u2014Lorsqu\u2019on s\u2019est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le droit de r\u00e9vocation, l\u2019assur\u00e9 pourra, pendant que la police est en vigueur, s\u2019il n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait aucun transfert de la police tel que stipul\u00e9 ci-apr\u00e8s, d\u00e9signer un nouveau b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire avec ou sans droit r\u00e9serv\u00e9 de r\u00e9vocation, en d\u00e9posant un avis par \u00e9crit au bureau central de la Compagnie, accompagn\u00e9 de la police pour \u00eatre endoss\u00e9e en bonne et due forme. Un tel changement prendra effet sur l\u2019endossement dudit avis sur la police par la Compagnie. Si un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire quelconque, sous une d\u00e9signation soit r\u00e9vocable ou irr\u00e9vocable, meurt avant l\u2019assur\u00e9, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de ce b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire reviendra \u00e0 l\u2019assur\u00e9.\nTel que la police le permet, des avances substantielles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites au fils, \u00e0 m\u00eame les montants accumul\u00e9s. Dans le cours du mois de janvier 1940, le fils est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 apr\u00e8s avoir fait un testament, dont la seule clause importante pour d\u00e9terminer ce litige est la suivante:\u2014\nJe donne et l\u00e8gue \u00e0 mon \u00e9pouse Dame Marie Blanche Ouellette tous les biens, meubles, immeubles, argent, cr\u00e9ances y compris mes assurances et tous autres biens et droits quelconques que je poss\u00e8derai au jour et heure de mon d\u00e9c\u00e8s pour lui appartenir en pleine propri\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 compter de mon d\u00e9c\u00e8s, l\u2019instituant ma l\u00e9gataire universelle en propri\u00e9t\u00e9 mais \u00e0 la condition qu\u2019elle garde viduit\u00e9 et sans aucune obligation de faire inventaire ou donner caution.\nLa compagnie mise-en-cause, requise de payer et par l\u2019appelant qui all\u00e8gue son titre de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, et par l\u2019\u00e9pouse du fils qui invoque le testament, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 entre les mains du Protonotaire la somme de $3,192.30, montant repr\u00e9sentant la valeur de la police, d\u00e9duction faite des avances, au moment du d\u00e9c\u00e8s.\nLa question de savoir si le p\u00e8re, b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire original, peut \u00eatre r\u00e9voqu\u00e9, ne se pr\u00e9sente pas. Evidemment, il s\u2019agit, il est vrai, d\u2019une stipulation en sa faveur, qu\u2019il a accept\u00e9e, et le fils qui a stipul\u00e9 ne pourrait la r\u00e9voquer sans violer les dispositions de l\u2019article 1029 C.C. Mais le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire et l\u2019assur\u00e9 ont tous deux convenu que telle r\u00e9vocation pourrait s\u2019op\u00e9rer par l\u2019unique volont\u00e9 du fils. Le seul probl\u00e8me qui se pose alors est donc de savoir si la r\u00e9vocation a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite l\u00e9galement.\nIl est certain qu\u2019un changement de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire peut s\u2019op\u00e9rer par testament (Arr. 2591 C.C.), et qu\u2019un mari peut attribuer \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices d\u2019une police d\u2019assurance (S.R.Q., 1941, ch. 301, art. 3).\nQuand dans son testament, le fils dit: \u201cJe donne et l\u00e8gue \u00e0 mon pouse * * * y compris mes assurances, etc.,\u201d il emploie, je crois, des mots qui ne laissent pas de doute quant \u00e0 ses intentions, malgr\u00e9 qu\u2019il e\u00fbt d\u2019autres polices d\u2019assurance. Avant que la compagnie mise-en-cause e\u00fbt pay\u00e9, copie du testament lui fut signifi\u00e9e.\nL\u2019appelant soutient que ce changement de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire ne satisfait pas les conditions de la clause pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, parce qu\u2019un avis par \u00e9crit n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au bureau central de la compagnie, accompagn\u00e9 de la police, et parce qu\u2019\u00e9galement il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu un transfert de la police \u00e0 la mise-en-cause pour garantir les avances consenties.\nL\u2019appelant semble croire que ces clauses sont ins\u00e9r\u00e9es dans la police pour son b\u00e9n\u00e9fice \u00e0 lui, et qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u00e9faut par l\u2019assur\u00e9 de remplir une condition de son contrat avec l\u2019assureur, il aura le droit de s\u2019en pr\u00e9valoir. Je crois qu\u2019il fait erreur.\nLa premi\u00e8re de ces deux conditions existe clairement pour la protection de la compagnie elle-m\u00eame. Celle-ci en effet peut seule l\u2019invoquer, mais quoad l\u2019appelant, elle est res, inter alias acta. On con\u00e7oit facilement la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019une pareille clause, et la raison imp\u00e9rieuse pour laquelle l\u2019assureur exige qu\u2019elle soit l\u2019une des conditions de la police. Dans le cas d\u2019exigibilit\u00e9 du montant de la police, c\u2019est le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire qui doit recevoir le paiement, et comment la compagnie saurait-elle \u00e0 qui verser les montants dus, si elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par une clause semblable? Mais si l\u2019avis qui lui est donn\u00e9 n\u2019est pas strictement conforme aux termes de la police, ce n\u2019est s\u00fbrement pas le, b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire original l\u00e9galement r\u00e9voqu\u00e9, et dont les droits sont totalement \u00e9teints, qui peut \u00eatre admis \u00e0 se plaindre. Quant \u00e0 l\u2019autre condition, \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u2019assur\u00e9 ne peut changer de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire s\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait un transfert de la police, elle ne saurait je crois affecter davantage le r\u00e9sultat de cette cause.\nPour garantir des avances faites \u00e0 l\u2019assur\u00e9, la police a en effet \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 la mise-en-cause, mais ce transfert ne vaut que jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence des montants avanc\u00e9s. C\u2019est la police elle-m\u00eame qui le dit. Le surplus \u00e9videment appartient au nouveau b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire d\u00fbment nomm\u00e9, et non pas \u00e0 l\u2019ancien qui est r\u00e9voqu\u00e9. Quand la mise-en-cause stipule \u201cqu\u2019aucun transfert ne sera fait\u201d, cela signifie que la compagnie n\u2019acceptera pas le transfert tant que les avances n\u2019auront pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rembours\u00e9es, mais quand elles le sont, le surplus doit n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre pay\u00e9 au b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire nouveau, qui se trouve investi de tous les droits \u00e9ventuels que peuvent conf\u00e9rer les termes de la police.\nL\u2019appelant, premier b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire, n\u2019avait qu\u2019un droit pr\u00e9caire, qui aurait cependant perdu ce caract\u00e8re pour devenir certain et d\u00e9finitif, si l\u2019assur\u00e9 \u00e9tait mort avant d\u2019exercer \u00e0 son gr\u00e9 son droit incontestable de r\u00e9vocation. Ce droit a \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9 dans le testament, et comme cons\u00e9quence, au moment de l\u2019ouverture de la succession du fils, la r\u00e9vocation et l\u2019attribution \u00e0 un nouveau b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire des avantages de la police, se sont simultan\u00e9ment produites.\nJe crois que l\u2019appelant ne peut pas r\u00e9ussir, et que son appel doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens de toutes les cours.\nRand J. (dissenting): This is a controversy over the proceeds of a life insurance policy. The appellant was the father of the insured and was the beneficiary named in the policy. The respondent is the widow and claims the money under the will of her deceased husband.\nThe policy called for the payment of premiums for twenty years, and there were the usual cash surrender rights. The application, signed by both the father and the son, is incorporated in the policy, and contained the following questions and answers:\n19. Qui va recevoir le montant de la police postul\u00e9e \u00e0 la fin de dotation?\nR. Joseph Oliva Adam.\nDegr\u00e9 de parent\u00e9 vis-\u00e0-vis de la personne propos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019assurance?\nR. L\u2019assur\u00e9 m\u00eame. 20. D\u00e9sirez-vous r\u00e9server le droit de changer de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire en n\u2019importe quel temps, sans le consentement du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire d\u00e9sign\u00e9 ciapr\u00e8s?\nR. Qui.\n21. En cas de d\u00e9c\u00e8s qui sera d\u00e9sign\u00e9 pour recevoir le montant de la police postul\u00e9e?\nR. Isa\u00efe Adam.\nBy the policy, the company promised to pay on the death of the insured to the appellant \u201cb\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire avec droit de r\u00e9vocation\u201d. Change of beneficiary was dealt with in the following manner:\nChangement de beneficiaire.\u2014Lorsqu\u2019on s\u2019est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le droit de r\u00e9vocation, l\u2019assur\u00e9 pourra, pendant que la police est en vigueur, s\u2019il n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait aucun transfert de la police tel que stipul\u00e9 ci-apr\u00e8s, d\u00e9signer un nouveau b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire avec ou sans droit r\u00e9serv\u00e9 de r\u00e9vocation, en d\u00e9posant un avis par \u00e9crit au bureau central de la Compagnie, accompagn\u00e9 de la police pour \u00eatre endoss\u00e9e en bonne et due forme. Un tel changement prendra effet sur l\u2019endossement dudit avis sur la police par la Compagnie. Si un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire quelconque, sous une d\u00e9signation soit r\u00e9vocable ou irr\u00e9vocable, meurt avant l\u2019assur\u00e9, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de ce b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire reviendra \u00e0 l\u2019assur\u00e9.\nProvision was made also, after the insurance had been three years in force, to make loans up to 85 per cent of the cash surrender value, \u201csur transfert et de la remise valable de la police\u201d. Two loans were so made by the insured and his interest in the policy was as required assigned to the company by a document to which the beneficiary likewise was a party. These loans remained unpaid at the time of death.\nThe language of the will which is said to carry the funds to the respondent is this:\ntous les biens, meubles, immeubles, argent, cr\u00e9ances y compris mes assurances et tous autres biens, etc.\nIt is contended that this language is not appropriate to a change of beneficiary, and that it applies rather to insurance payable to the estate of the deceased, of which there were several policies. But for the purpose of the conclusion to which I have come, I will assume the will to purport to substitute the wife for the father as beneficiary, and as no statutory provision is applicable, the question is whether that change has been brought about.\nThe judgment at trial holding against the respondent was reversed on appeal, on the ground that the power to change the beneficiary could be exercised by will. The clause providing the mode for such a change was treated as for the benefit only of the insurer, which the designated beneficiary had no standing to invoke. In the language of Barclay J.:\nSuch a clause was inserted for the protection of the company, and was not intended to confer different rights or more extensive rights upon the beneficiary than he had under the terms of the application. Being of that opinion, I consider that the policy with the stipulated right to revoke at any time was and always remained in the \u201cpatrimoine\u201d of the deceased, the assured, and that he could and did validly change the beneficiary by the terms of his will.\nThe essence of this holding lies in the last four lines, and the decisive question is, what is the legal effect in the circumstances of the language in the policy \u201cb\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire avec droit de r\u00e9vocation\u201d.\nThe consideration of this question must, I think, start with the fact that the policy notwithstanding the power of revocation is a contract for the benefit of a third person within article 1029 of the Civil Code:\nA party in like manner may stipulate for the benefit of a third person, when such is the condition which he makes to another; and he who makes the stipulation cannot revoke it, if the third person has signified his assent to it,\nas interpreted by this Court in Hall\u00e9 vs. Canadian Indemnity Company 1. The Article, by its declaration of the effect of assent, does not assume or imply any particular mode of revocation ; but as the matter is in contract, in the absence of a rule either of the Civil Code or the prior law, the Article leaves untouched, if it does not indeed exclusively contemplate, powers of revocation provided by or inherent in the contract. The designation of a third person, subject to revocation, none the less fixes pro tempore the issue or object of the benefit; and the question becomes whether assent adds anything to the legal relation of the beneficiary to the obligation.\nTo treat the interest of the policy as simply augmenting the patrimoine of the insured, which is in fact to take the contract out of article 1029 C.C., lends itself to a confusion of two conceptions of transfer, that of alienation or transmission and that of a designation that completes a special form of obligation. If the policy should provide for the payment of moneys to the estate of the insured, the contract is not one within article 1029 C.C. because no third person within the meaning of the Article is involved. In such case, the appropriation of that interest by will takes effect as a testamentary transmission of property of the testator: but a person taking by way of designation in the policy, takes as a party to a contract.\nCan a will co-exising with a policy naming a beneficiary change that beneficiary? If the designation remains unrevoked, by the effect of the contract the obligation at the moment of death matures. Conceiving the insurance to be within the patrimoine, a will purporting to deal with it and operating as a transmission becomes effective at the same instant. It is not suggested that the execution of the will itself revokes the designation, and we have both instruments therefore approaching the same moment at which they both become accomplished. Does the will override the contract? During the time of that parallel currency, what is the interest of the beneficiary? If he has any at all, how can it be said that the benefit of the insurance is within the patrimoine? If the power to revoke is all the testator holds, then it is a question not of transmission of patrimoine, but of designation for the purposes of a contract.\nTo the policy, the application of Article 1029 C.C. must I think be given some effect following the assent of the beneficiary. On the view of the Court below, that assent is of no significance; the relation of the beneficiary after is precisely the same as before. The contract ought, then, to be construed with the Article as creating a right in the beneficiary which is subject to revocation only by way of a modification of the contract. In other words, the parties to the contract have reserved to themselves as parties the right to modify the benefit which otherwise would be irrevocable in the third person. But only to that extent is the right of the beneficiary made precarious.\nHow then is a contract or obligation changed by the parties? What is the minimum of act or matter by which it can be said the contract has been modified? For that we must look to the contract itself. Here, as in any other obligation, underlying particular formalities that may be specified, there is assumed a fundamental communication between the parties. They may, of course, agree in advance that any act by either party may signify a change in some feature of the obligation: but in one form or another there must be agreement between them. The company could obviously waive any particular requirements stipulated for its protection, but the essential fact remains that the change must be effected by agreement. As there is no suggestion that the contract here, either expressly or impliedly, contemplates a designation by a testamentary instrument, we are bound to conclude that a communication between the parties in the lifetime of the insured is a sine qua non of such a modification.\nArticle 2591 C.C. does not appear to have any bearing upon the question raised. Its language is:\nA policy of insurance on life or health may pass by transfer, will, or succession, to any person, whether he has an insurable interest or not in the life of the person insured.\nThe subject matter there is insurance for the benefit of the insured, an interest within his patrimoine, and the Article renders it subject to those modes of transfer or transmission which apply to the patrimoine generally. But it must be interpreted and reconciled with article 1029 C.C, and where a contract has created a right in a third person, that right takes the benefit of the insurance outside the scope of article 2591 C.C.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the Superior Court with costs throughout.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Jacques Cartier K.C.\nSolicitor for the respondent: Ivan Sabourin.\n1 [1937] S.C.R. 368.\n",

She died within three months after the account was opened. Prior to A\u2019s death L made no deposits in, or cheques on, the account, nor did she know what deposits or withdrawals were made. When the account was opened, A and L, as required by the bank, executed under seal a document, in the bank\u2019s standard form, addressed to the bank, by which they \u201cfor valuable consideration (receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged)\u201d mutually agreed \u201cjointly and each with the other or others of us\u201d and also with the bank, \u201cthat all moneys now or which may be hereafter deposited to the credit of the said account, and all interest thereon, shall be and continue the joint property of the undersigned with right of survivorship\u201d, and each of them \u201cin order effectually to constitute the said joint deposit account hereby assigns and transfers to all of the undersigned jointly and to the survivor or survivors\u201d of them any and all moneys theretofore, then or thereafter deposited to the credit of the account together with all interest \u201cto be the joint property of the undersigned and the property of the survivor or survivors of them\u201d; each irrevocably authorized the bank to accept from time to time as a sufficient discharge for any sum or sums withdrawn any receipt, cheque, etc., \u201csigned by any one or more of the undersigned without any further signature or consent of the other or others of the undersigned thereto\u201d; they agreed \u201cwith each other and with the said Bank that the death of one or more of the undersigned shall not affect the right of the survivors or any one of them or of the sole survivor to withdraw all of the said moneys and interest\u201d from the bank and to give a valid and effectual discharge or receipt therefor.\nHeld: The moneys in the account at A\u2019s death belonged to her estate. The fact that all the deposits were made by A from her own money raised the presumption of a resulting trust in her favour, and neither the terms of the document nor other circumstances in evidence served to rebut that presumption or to cut down A\u2019s beneficial interest raised in equity under it.\nThe mere fact that the document was under seal did not prevent it being shown that there was no consideration from L.\nThe document should, under the circumstances and in its language, be construed as being for the protection of the bank and to facilitate its dealing with the account.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1946] O.R. 102, reversed, and judgment at trial, [1945] O.R. 652, restored.\nThis Court held that the costs throughout should be paid out of the fund in question. (Per Kellock J.: The proper construction of the document fundamentally affected the rights of the parties and as to that there had been such difference of judicial opinion as to make it plain that there was an important and debatable legal issue: Boyce v. Wasbrough, [1922] 1 A.C. 425, at 435). (Kerwin J. took the view that L should pay the costs in this Court and in the Court of Appeal; that the case was not one where an exception should be made to the general rule that a litigant should pay the costs of carrying an unsuccessful defence to appeal. He would not interfere with the direction at trial that costs of all parties be paid out of the estate, except to provide that they come out of the fund. But he could not treat the case as analogous to the construction of a will or as exhibiting any special circumstances warranting an infraction of the general rule.)\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] allowing the defendant\u2019s appeal from the judgment of Greene J.[2] declaring that the sum of $10,070.80 which, at the time of the death of Georgena Arnott (late of Port Hope, Ontario) was on deposit in the Royal Bank of Canada at Port Hope, Ontario, in a certain \u201cjoint account\u201d in the names of the said Georgena Arnott and the defendant, belonged to and was an asset of the estate of the said Georgena Arnott, deceased, and ought to be distributed according to the terms of her will. The judgment of the Court of Appeal declared that the said sum was the property of the defendant.\nF.A. Brewin and Hugh Powell for the appellants.\nJ.R. Cartwright K.C. for the respondent.\nKERWIN J.\u2014The plaintiffs in this action are four sisters and a brother of the late Mrs. Georgena Arnott, and the defendant, Mrs. Blanche V. Lake, is another sister. The dispute concerns a sum of money on deposit with the Port Hope Branch of the Royal Bank of Canada in Account No. 2047, standing in the names of Georgena Arnott and Blanche V. Lake or the survivor, which sum, when the account was closed, amounted to $10,070.80. Mrs. Arnott died February 27th, 1944, and this sum was transferred by Mrs. Lake, on September 9th, 1944, to her own account. The plaintiffs claim that it is an asset of the estate of Georgena Arnott.\nMrs. Arnott and her husband lived in Port Hope where the latter died December 9th, 1943. At that time Mrs. Arnott was in the Port Hope Hospital, and, while still there, sent for the Manager of the branch of the bank where she and her husband had had a joint account. This account and Account No. 2047, while commonly so described, are strictly not joint accounts, as money might be withdrawn by either of two parties and the survivor. The Manager saw Mrs. Arnott on December 16th, 1943, when she told him that she desired to open an account in the names of herself and her sister, the defendant, Blanche V. Lake. Having already been told by an intermediary of her desire to open a joint account, the Manager had taken with him the Bank\u2019s standard form, which he told Mrs. Arnott it would be necessary for her and her sister to sign. Mrs. Arnott signed it and handed him for deposit to the account the sum of $560, part of the assets of the estate of her husband, all of which had been willed by him to her. The document was sent by the Bank to Mrs. Lake who lives in Toronto, who also signed it and then returned it to the Bank.\nThe document is under seal and reads as follows:\nForm LE 233A\u2014Agreement re Joint Account\nRevised 12-41\nTo The Royal Bank of Canada\nPort Hope, Ontario Branch:\nWe, the undersigned, having opened a Savings Deposit Account with the above-named Branch of the Royal Bank of Canada in our joint names do for valuable consideration (receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged) hereby mutually agree, jointly and each with the other or others of us also with the said The Royal Bank of Canada, that all moneys now or which may be hereafter deposited to the credit of the said account, and all interest thereon, shall be and continue the joint property of the undersigned with right of survivorship; and each of the undersigned in order effectually to constitute the said joint deposit account hereby assigns and transfers to all of the undersigned jointly and to the survivor or survivors of them any and all moneys which may have been heretofore or may now or hereafter be deposited to the credit of the said account together with all interest which may accrue thereon to be the joint property of the undersigned and the property of the survivor or survivors of them.\nEach of the undersigned hereby irrevocably authorizes the said Bank to accept from time to time as a sufficient discharge for any sum or sums withdrawn from the said deposit account any receipt, cheque or other similar document signed by any one or more of the undersigned without any further signature or consent of the other or others of the undersigned thereto.\nIt is understood and agreed by the undersigned with each other and with the said Bank that the death of one or more of the undersigned shall not affect the right of the survivors or any one of them or of the sole survivor to withdraw all of the said moneys and interest from the said Bank and to give a valid and effectual discharge or receipt therefor. Provided, however, that this understanding and Agreement is subject to the requirements of any Succession Duty Act in respect of such moneys and the interest thereon.\nThis Agreement shall be binding upon the heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns of each of the undersigned parties thereto.\nWitness our hands and seals this 16th day of December, A.D. 1943.\nSigned, Sealed and Delivered in the presence of\nHAROLD GORDON JEX GEORGENA ARNOTT (Seal)\nARTHUR J.D. LAKE BLANCHE V. LAKE (Seal).\nThe bank-book for this account, No. 2047, was given to Mrs. Arnott who kept it and drew cheques on the account on the following dates in the amounts set out:\nJanuary 3, 1944.......................................................\n$ 97.00\nJanuary 18, 1944....................................................\n5.75\nFebruary 7, 1944.....................................................\n112.30\nThese cheques were for personal and hospital expenses. In addition to the original deposit of $560, the following deposits were made in the account by Mr. Bonneville, Mrs. Arnott\u2019s solicitor, on her direction:\nFebruary 15, 1944..................................................\n$1,139.26\nFebruary 17,1944...................................................\n6,570.00\nFebruary 24, 1944..................................................\n1,977.83\nAll of these were the proceeds of insurance policies on the life of Mrs. Arnott\u2019s husband. Mrs. Arnott made her last will and testament on December 29, 1943, by which she appointed the defendant and the latter\u2019s husband executors, bequeathed a number of articles to various relatives, including the plaintiffs and defendant, and devised and bequeathed the residue of her estate to her sisters and brother in equal shares. The exact value of the estate is not shown in the evidence, but, from the statement of claim, it would appear that the money on deposit in Account 2047 would account for considerably more than half of the total.\nPrior to December 16, 1943, Mrs. Arnott had told Mrs. Lake on one of the latter\u2019s visits to the hospital that she was going to open a bank account in their joint names, but the amount of money that would be deposited, or the purpose of having the account in the two names, was not mentioned. Nor was the matter discussed thereafter between them except that when Mrs. Lake made another visit to her sister in the hospital, Mrs. Arnott asked her if she had signed the document sent to her by the Bank and was told that she had done so. Mrs. Lake did not know what sums were deposited from time to time or what withdrawals were made. After Mrs. Arnott\u2019s death, when the relatives were meeting with Mr. Bonneville, Mrs. Lake said, according to her own testimony, that she supposed the joint account had been arranged for convenience, while, according to the evidence of some of the others who were present, the word \u201csupposed\u201d had been omitted. While unimportant in my view, the fact is that while Mrs. Lake lived in Toronto, one of the plaintiff sisters lived in Port Hope and another at Cobourg, about seven miles distant. All of the sisters and the brother were on good terms with each other.\nUnder these circumstances, unless the document prepared by the Bank and signed by Mrs. Arnott and Mrs. Lake leads to a different conclusion, the money in question should be held to be an asset of Mrs. Arnott\u2019s estate, as there would be a resulting trust in favour of Mrs. Arnott, since all the moneys deposited to the joint account had belonged to her. It is argued, first, however, that the document by its very terms shows a contrary intention. Particular emphasis is placed upon that part by which the two sisters\nhereby mutually agree, jointly and each with the other or others of us and also with the said The Royal Bank of Canada, that all moneys now or which may be hereafter deposited to the credit of the said account, and all interest thereon, shall be and continue the joint property of the undersigned with right of survivorship; and each of the undersigned in order effectually to constitute the said joint deposit account hereby assigns and transfers to all of the undersigned jointly and to the survivor or survivors of them any and all moneys which may have been heretofore or may now or hereafter be deposited to the credit of the said account together with all interest which may accrue thereon to be the joint property of the undersigned and the property of the survivor or survivors of them.\nIt is said that the agreement that the moneys should be the joint property of the two sisters and the transfer by the terms of the document of all moneys to them jointly and to the survivor distinguishes the present case from In re Mailman[3], and reliance is placed upon a number of decisions, particularly in the Ontario courts. The principle applicable to a case of this nature is set forth in the Mailman case3, where most of the earlier decisions are referred to. It was there decided that the form prepared by the Bank and used by the parties did not rebut the presumption of a resulting trust. The document in that case is quite different from the one before us but, while it is true that the legal property in the chose in action was vested in Mrs. Arnott and Mrs. Lake and is now vested in Mrs. Lake, equity raises an equitable interest in Mrs. Arnott by virtue of the doctrine of resulting trusts, and there is nothing in the document to cut down that equitable interest. The language is no more absolute or unequivocal than in a deed of land or a transfer of shares of stock by the owner to the joint names of the transferor and transferee. \u201cIn fact\u201d, as pointed out in the second edition of Hanbury\u2019s Modern Equity, page 213, \u201ccases of transfer by one person into the joint names of himself and a stranger are in no way different from purchases by one person in the joint names of himself and a stranger, in which cases the presumption most certainly arises.\u201d\nIt was next argued that, the document being under seal, consideration for the transfer was thereby imported. That means no more than that a deed requires no consideration to support it, and, notwithstanding this general rule, a deed is always impeachable for fraud. No fraud is suggested here nor is the plea of non est factum advanced on behalf of the appellants. The old law, before the coming into force of the Law of Property Act, 1925, in England, is set forth in all the textbooks and a convenient statement appears in the second edition of Norton on Deeds, page 410: \u201cwhere A conveys the whole fee simple by a conveyance operating at common law, without consideration, there is a resulting use to him in fee simple, unless uses are declared.\u201d The doctrine of resulting trusts has been raised up, as is pointed out in Maitland\u2019s Equity, at page 79, in analogy to the law of resulting uses. It is not necessary to go into the moot point discussed by Maitland at the page indicated, but these matters are mentioned to show that the mere fact of the document in question being under seal does not prevent the appellants from showing that there was no consideration. That, they have done, and the resulting trust follows. It would, I think, be unfortunate if the appellants could not succeed in this case where Mrs. Arnott executed a document prepared by a bank for its own protecton and without regard to the real intention of any one signing it.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the judgment at the trial restored by which it was declared that the sum of $10,070.80, which was on deposit in the Royal Bank of Canada at Port Hope in Account No. 2047, belonged to and was an asset of the estate of Georgena Arnott, deceased, formerly of the Town of Port Hope, and ought to be distributed according to the terms of her last will and testament. In my view, the respondent should pay the appellants their costs in the Court of Appeal and in this Court and an exception should not be made to the general rule that a litigant should pay the costs of carrying an unsuccessful defence to appeal. The trial judge, although deciding in favour of the present appellants, directed that the costs of all parties be paid out of the estate, and I would not interfere with that direction,\u2014except to provide that the costs should come out of the fund. However, I am unable to treat the case as analagous to the construction of a will or as exhibiting any special circumstances that would warrant an infraction of the general rule.\nTASCHEREAU J.\u2014Georgena Arnott died in Port Hope, Ontario, on the 27th of February, 1944. Under the terms of her will, the appellants and the respondent were made residuary legatees, and the respondent was also appointed co-executor with her husband, Arthur Lake.\nThe late Georgena Arnott lived all her life in Port Hope, and shortly before her husband\u2019s death, which occurred on December the 8th, 1943, she had become seriously ill, and had been taken to a hospital where she was confined until she died.\nIn December, 1943, while in the hospital, she had expressed the wish to open a joint savings account with her sister, the respondent, Mrs. Blanche V. Lake, and for that purpose the manager of the Royal Bank, Mr. Freeman, went to see her. During the interview which took place between Mrs. Arnott and the manager of the bank, and at which was present a personal friend, Mr. H.G. Jex, Mrs. Arnott then signed the following document:\nAgreement re Joint Account\nTo The Royal Bank of Canada,\nPort Hope, Ontario Branch:\nWe, the undersigned, having opened a Savings Deposit Account with the above named Branch of the Royal Bank of Canada in our joint names do for valuable consideration (receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged) hereby mutually agree, jointly and each with the other or others of us also with the said The Royal Bank of Canada, that all moneys now or which may be hereafter deposited to the credit of the said account, and all interest thereon, shall be and continue the joint property of the undersigned with right of survivorship; and each of the undersigned in order effectually to constitute the said joint deposit account hereby assigns and transfers to all of the undersigned jointly and to the survivor or survivors of them any and all moneys which may have been heretofore or may now or hereafter be deposited to the credit of the said account together with all interest which may accrue thereon to be the joint property of the undersigned and the property of the survivor or survivors of them.\nEach of the undersigned hereby irrevocably authorizes the said Bank to accept from time to time as a sufficient discharge for any sum or sums withdrawn from the said deposit account any receipt, cheque or other similar document signed by any one or more of the undersigned without any further signature or consent of the other or others of the undersigned thereto.\nIt is understood and agreed by the undersigned with each other and with the said Bank that the death of one or more of the undersigned shall not affect the right of the survivors or any one of them or of the sole survivor to withdraw all of the said moneys and interest from the said Bank and to give a valid and effectual discharge or receipt therefor. Provided, however, that this understanding and Agreement is subject to the requirements of any Succession Duty Act in respect of such moneys and the interest thereon.\nThis Agreement shall be binding upon the heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns of each of the undersigned parties thereto.\nWITNESS our hands and seals this 16th day of December, A.D.). 1943.\nSIGNED, SEALED AND\nDELIVERED in the\npresence of\nHarold Gordon Jex Georgena Arnott\n(Seal)\nArthur J.D. Lake Blanche V. Lake\n(Seal)\nThe document was sent by the bank manager to Toronto, where it was signed and returned by Mrs. Lake. During the months of January and February of 1944, the initial deposit of $560 was increased by Mrs. Arnott personally and, when she died, there was in the joint account a sum of $10,070.80.\nThe appellants asked for a declaration that this sum of $10,070.80 belongs to, and is an asset of, the estate of the late Georgena Arnott and ought to be distributed according to her last will, that is to say, to the residuary legatees.\nMr. Justice Greene, who heard the case, granted the order, but the Court of Appeal unanimously came to the conclusion that the money was the sole property of the respondent. The appellants claim that Mrs. Lake, the survivor of the joint account, took only the legal interest in the account, and that there was a resulting trust of the beneficial interest in favour of the estate. The respondent\u2019s contention is that the moneys are her property beneficially.\nThis agreement expressly provides that \u201call moneys deposited to the credit of the account shall be the joint property of the undersigned\u201d, that there is \u201cright of survivorship\u201d, that there is assignment or transfer to \u201call the undersigned jointly and to the survivor or survivors, of them, of all moneys in the account to be joint property of the undersigned and property of the survivor or survivors of them\u201d.\nIn view of this language, it is not disputed by the appellants that there has been an effective assignment to Mrs. Lake and that the execution by both of them of the bank agreement gave to Mrs. Lake as the survivor upon the death of Mrs. Arnott a legal title to the debt of the bank created by the opening of the account, but it is argued that the position in equity is otherwise, and that, in order to have the beneficial interest transferred to the donee, there must be satisfactory affirmative proof of intention on the part of the donor to do so. It is therefore submitted that, the document being silent on that point and there being no evidence of a beneficial or equitable ownership in favour of Mrs. Lake, as distinguished from the legal property, the doctrine of resulting trust must apply.\nThe law is well settled, I think, that when a person transfers his own money into his own name jointly with that of another person, except in cases with which we are not concerned, then there is prima facie a resulting trust for the transferor. This presumption, of course, is a presump- tion of law which is rebuttable by oral or written evidence or other circumstances tending to show there was in fact an intention of giving beneficially to the transferee.\nOne of the leading cases on the matter is undoubtedly the case of Dyer v. Dyer[4], reported and annotated in White & Tudor\u2019s \u201cLeading Cases in Equity\u201d, 9th Ed., at page 749. Eyre, C.B., who delivered the judgment of the Court, said:\nThe clear result of all the cases, without a single exception, is that the trust of a legal estate, whether freehold, copyhold, or leasehold; whether taken in the names of the purchasers and others jointly, or in the names of others without that of the purchaser; whether in one name or several; whether jointly or successive\u2014results to the man who advances the purchase-money.\nCommenting on the principle enunciated by Chief Baron Eyre, the authors say at page 756, that it \u201capplies to personal as well as real estate\u201d, and at page 763 they state:\nIt is clear that a voluntary transfer of stock into the names of the transferor and a stranger makes that stranger a trustee by implication for the transferor. In Standing v. Bowring[5], the plaintiff transferred Consols into the joint names of herself and her godson, to whom she was not in loco parentis. It was held that there was prima facie a resulting trust, which was, however, displaced by evidence of intention.\nAnd at the same page (763) we also find:\nAll resulting trusts which arise simply from equitable presumption, may be rebutted by parol evidence: thus it may be shown that it was the intention, at the time of the purchase, of the person who advanced the purchase-money, that the person to whom the property was conveyed or transferred either solely or jointly with such person should take beneficially[6]. And the person who paid the money cannot alter such intention at a subsequent period[7].\nIn 33 Halsbury, 2nd Ed., page 149, we find:\nWhere a person purchases property in the name of another or in the name of himself and another jointly, or gratuitously transfers property to another or himself and another jointly, then, unless there is some further intimation or indication of an intention at the time to benefit the other person, the property is, as a rule, deemed in equity to be held on a resulting trust for the purchaser or transferor. There is a resulting trust even where the transfer is into the joint names of the transferor and an infant to whom the transferor does not stand in loco parentis, and the mere fact that an infant cannot since 1925 be validly appointed a trustee does not affect the presumption.\nOn the same point, Underhill in Law of Trusts & Trustees, 8th Ed., page 158, says:\nWhen real or personal property is vested in a purchaser along with others, or in another or others alone, and whether jointly or successively, a resulting trust will be presumed in favour of the person who is proved (by parol or other evidence) to have paid the purchase-money in the character of purchaser.\n(2) This presumption may be rebutted\u2014\n(a) by parol or other evidence that the purchaser intended to benefit the others; or\n(b) by the fact that the person in whom the property was vested was the lawful wife or child of the purchaser, or was some person towards whom he stood in loco parentis, or was trustee of a settlement by which he previously settled property.\nFurther authorities on the same subject may be found in Modern Equity, Hanbury, 3rd Ed., page 180, and following.\nIn Russell v. Scott[8], it was held that there was a presumption of a resulting trust in favour of an aunt who had opened a joint account with her nephew but, at the death of the aunt, the nephew was allowed to claim the balance of the account, because it was found that the presumption of any resulting trust in favour of the donor and her estate of the balance of the moneys had been rebutted.\nAll these authorities, as well as many others which it would be superfluous to cite here, clearly indicate that a mere gratuitous transfer of property, real or personal, although it may convey the legal title, will not benefit the transferee unless there is some other indication to show such an intent, and the property will be deemed in equity to be held on a resulting trust for the transferor.\nThe respondent has cited the Mailman case[9] in support of her contentions. The facts in that case were somewhat different from those with which we have now to deal. Particularly, the agreement signed by the parties to open the joint account was not drafted in the same terms. It read as follows: AGREEMENT\nJOINT DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS\nTo the Bank of Nova Scotia,\nCaledonia, Queens Co., N.S.\nThe undersigned, having opened a deposit account with you in their joint names, hereby agree with you and with each other that, except only in the case of some other lawful claim before repayment, all moneys from time to time deposited to the said account and interest, may be withdrawn by any one of the undersigned, or his or her attorney or agent, and each of the undersigned hereby irrevocably authorizes the said bank to accept from time to time as a sufficient acquittance for any amounts withdrawn from said account, any receipt, cheque, or other document signed by any one of the undersigned, his or her agent, without any further signature or consent.\nThe death of one or more of the undersigned shall in no way affect the right of the survivors, or any one of them, to withdraw all moneys deposited in the said account, as aforesaid.\nDated at Caledonia, Queens Co., N.S., this 30th day of September, 1935.\nWitness(es)\nL.G. Irving Hannah Mailman\nL.G. Irving George B. Mailman.\nIt was found by this Court that this document contained no references expressed or implied to the ownership of the money when deposited, or to any previous agreement having been entered into between the parties concernnig the opening of the account. The Court reached the conclusion that the sole purpose and effect of the document was to authorize the bank to accept from time to time, as a sufficient acquittance for any amount withdrawn from the deposit account, any receipt, cheque or document signed by either. There was nothing to show that the intention of Mrs. Mailman who had opened the account with her husband, was other than the one presumed by the law, that is to say, there was no evidence of intention of creating a joint tenancy. The document as construed by the majority of the Court did not make the husband the beneficial owner of the money that he was authorized to withdraw and for which he was accountable to his wife or her estate.\nThe Court, however, held at page 376 as follows:\nThe deposit money having admittedly been owned by Mrs. Mailman when it was placed in the joint account, and the presumption of law unquestionably being that she did not intend to create a joint tenancy in favour of her husband, the decisive question is: Is there evidence upon which it can reasonably be held that her intention was other than that which the law presumes it to have been? It is obvious that if there is any such evidence there are but two sources in which it can be sought, viz.: the signed bank deposit agreement form and the appellant\u2019s own deposition before the Registrar of Probate.\nIn the present case, it is submitted that the document itself contains all that is required to support the proposition that Mrs. Lake, the respondent, took beneficially, and that, therefore, the presumption of a resulting trust has been negatived.\nWith this proposition I am unable to agree, and I have come to the conclusion that, although the legal interest has passed to Mrs. Lake, she did not take beneficially, and a resulting trust has been created in favour of the transferor and her estate.\nNothing in the document defeats the presumption, and the evidence adduced, far from rebutting it, destroys all possible suggestion that the transferor ever intended that Mrs. Lake would receive beneficially. Of course, the document, which is under seal, may be considered as conclusive, and I do not propose to vary its terms, but the terms themselves do not warrant the conclusion that the Court is now asked to draw.\nThe words \u201cshall be the joint property of the undersigned\u201d or \u201cright of survivorship\u201d and \u201call moneys in the account to be joint property of the undersigned\u201d are indeed apt words to convey a legal title to the fund, but not to convey the whole fund beneficially. Something more than a mere transfer is required to destroy the presumption of a resulting trust and an intimation of such an intent must appear in the document itself, or as a result of evidence which reveals the intention to benefit the transferee.\nMrs. Arnott when she signed the agreement did not read it. She was merely told by the manager of the bank: \u201cIt will be necessary for you to sign one of our standard forms for the operation of a joint account\u201d. She furnished all the money that went in the account, kept the pass-book, and she was the only person who drew cheques on the account. Being ill in the hospital, she obviously relied on her sister\u2019s judgment whom she later appointed her executor, to look after her affairs and thought it convenient to have an account opened upon which her sister could sign cheques, if she, Mrs. Arnott, became incapacitated.\nThe fact that Mrs. Arnott made a will ten days after the opening of the account and in which she treated all her sisters and brother alike, makes it improbable that she would deprive the will of all its effect by making a gift inter vivos of practically all her estate to one sister. Mrs. Lake, the respondent, was never told that there was any intention that she would take the residue of the account beneficially, and moreover, after the death of her sister she said that she supposed that the account had been opened \u201cfor convenience only\u201d.\nAll these facts show that Mrs. Arnott never intended to give beneficially to her sister and I am, therefore, of opinion that the presumption of a resulting trust has not been destroyed.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment of Mr. Justice Greene. The costs throughout of all parities, including the costs of the motion before Mr. Justice Hope on November 13, 1944, should be paid out of the fund.\nRAND J.\u2014This appeal raises the question of the beneficial interest in a bank account opened by the testatrix, Mrs. Arnott, in her own name and that of the respondent in the following circumstances. The testatrix was a sister of the parties to this proceeding. Shortly before the death of her husband on December 8, 1943, she had been seized with serious illness and taken to a hospital in Port Hope. Under his will, of which she was the sole beneficiary, she came into property consisting of a home and approximately $10,000 insurance money. On the 16th of December she had the local manager of the Royal Bank attend her at the hospital for the purpose of the account. Her words to him were few and simple: \u201cI want to open a joint account in your bank with my sister, Mrs. Blanche V. Lake\u201d, and thereupon handed him $560 in cash. His reply was that \u201cit will be necessary for you to sign one of our standard forms for the operation of a joint account\u201d and \u201cto give us a specimen of your signature\u201d: he had brought both forms with him and they were thereupon signed by the testatrix without the former being read over to her. On the same day, that document was forwarded to the respondent at Toronto with a letter stating \u201cyour sister wishes to place her savings account at this place in your joint names which we have done\u201d and requesting her to \u201csign the enclosed form at the bottom below Mrs. Arnott\u2019s signature, and also supply us with a specimen of your signature on our Form LE 411, a copy of which we enclose.\u201d Mrs. Lake accordingly signed and returned both forms. Subsequently, deposits of the insurance cheques and three withdrawals for expenses were made by the testatrix who retained the account book.\nOn the 15th of December, Mrs. Arnott had called in a solicitor and had given him instructions for a will. We do not have this in evidence, but apparently it was revoked by a later will executed on the 29th day of December under which, apart from a few minor specific bequests, her estate was distributed equally between her sisters and brother. Although her health temporarily improved, she continued in the hospital until her death on the 27th of February, 1944. A few days later, at the reading of her will, the first mention of the joint account to the family was made by Mrs. Lake who remarked in relation to it, \u201cI suppose it was for convenience\u201d.\nThe document, executed under the seals of both Mrs. Arnott and Mrs. Lake, is in these words:\nTo The Royal Bank of Canada,\nPort Hope, Ontario Branch:\nWe, the undersigned, having opened a Savings Deposit Account with the above named Branch of the Royal Bank of Canada in our joint names do for valuable consideration (receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged) hereby mutually agree, jointly and each with the other or others of us and also with the said The Royal Bank of Canada, that all moneys now or which may be hereafter deposited to the credit of the said account, and all interest thereon, shall be and continue the joint property of the undersigned with right of survivorship; and each of the undersigned in order effectually to constitute the said joint deposit account hereby assigns and transfers to all the undersigned jointly and to the survivor or survivors of them any and all moneys which may have been heretofore or may now or hereafter be deposited to the credit of the said account together with all interest which may accrue thereon to be the joint property of the undersigned and the property of the survivor or survivors of them.\nEach of the undersigned hereby irrevocably authorizes the said Bank to accept from time to time as a sufficient discharge for any sum or sums withdrawn from the said deposit account any receipt, cheque or other similar document signed by any one or more of the undersigned without any further signature or consent of the other or others of the undersigned thereto.\nIt is understood and agreed by the undersigned with each other and with the said Bank that the death of one or more of the undersigned shall not affect the right of the survivors or any one of them or of the sole survivor to withdraw all of the said moneys and interest from the said Bank and to give a valid and effectual discharge or receipt therefor. Provided, however, that this understanding and Agreement is subject to the requirements of any Succession Duty Act in respect of such moneys and the interest thereon.\nApart from the document, I see nothing in the facts to indicate any intention on the part of the testatrix to transfer to her sister a beneficial interest in the funds. The presumption arising upon such a voluntary transfer of property into another title or legal power, without more, is that of a resulting trust to the donor, and the burden is on those asserting a beneficial transfer to establish that fact. That this elderly lady, facing all the possibilities of the future, intended to make an immediate gift of one-half of all her insurance money or a gift on her death of what then remained, to the sister, is an inference wholly unwarranted. Admittedly there was no special reason for a preference to this sister, and the equal division in the will would make such a gift all the more inexplicable. It is scarcely to be questioned, therefore, that the opening of the account was solely for the convenience of Mrs. Arnott, and that she at all times intended to preserve her beneficial ownership of the moneys deposited in it.\nBut it has been held by the Court of Appeal that the language of the agreement is conclusive that a joint tenancy in beneficial as well as legal interest was created and that evidence of a different intention is inadmissible because it would contradict that language; and it is necessary to decide whether or not that view is sound.\nA careful examination of its language makes it perfectly clear to me that what was intended by all parties was the creation of a relationship to the bank in such terms as would preclude any challenge to the irrevocable authority of either of the depositors to deal with the account in unqualified fashion and as if she were the sole owner of the funds; that an estoppel should be raised that would remove the possibility of controversy between the depositors or persons representing them involving the bank. They agree \u201cjointly\u201d\u2014necessarily with the bank\u2014and \u201ceach with the other or others of us and also with the\u201d bank: each agrees directly with the bank and with the other as to the bank; the undertaking with the bank is that the funds \u201cshall be and continue\u201d joint property with survivorship, regardless obviously of the amount that either may have withdrawn and regardless of any individual interest thus affected; from day to day the balance was to continue to be the \u201cjoint property\u201d, a title by estoppel imposed on the fluctuating account whatever at any moment it might be. \u201cIn order effectually to constitute the joint deposit\u201d, formal assignments are made by each to the joint and surviving interest; an irrevocable authority in either to discharge the bank from its obligation is created; and the survivor is declared in absolute authority over what remains. These are all constituent elements of a conclusive relation to the bank; whatever the interest in the money of the depositors inter se, these were the terms interposed between them and the bank. They, therefore, do not set up a joint tenancy, a title characterized by an immediate beneficial interest of a moiety in each of the owners; and no one has suggested the category of ownership into which they fit. Whatever else may be the effect of the deposit, as to the account, the terms, among other things, create a body of irrevocable powers and commitments vis-a-vis the bank; but once these powers have been exercised, the terms are exhausted and to questions of ownership of funds dehors the bank they are irrelevant.\nThis accords with the actual intent of the testatrix toward her sister in relation to the agreement; it was necessary for the purposes of the bank; she did not intend its language to touch any interest in the money as between them; what she wanted was a joint account simply and the form was something required by the bank. Neither she nor her sister had in mind to contract with each other; the money was hers to retain or to make a gift of to the sister, but not to bargain about with her. If the language of the document did not, as it does, show the true purpose, the situation would seem to be such as Middleton J. had in mind when in Re Hodgson[10] he said: \u201cunless it is proved that the document is not intended to define the rights of the parties as between themselves and is a mere memorandum defining the rights and duties of the bank\u201d.\nTo hold otherwise would, as the result of the bank\u2019s requirement, deny to a depositor the privilege of opening a joint account for the purpose of convenience: that, in other words, the bank would dictate the terms of beneficial ownership, irrelevant to its protection, as a condition of that form of accommodation. The common sense of the situation is confirmed by the language of the agreement in negativing such a construction.\nIn In re Mailman[11], Crocket J. at p. 378 says:\nEven if one were disposed to regard it as an agreement between the parties themselves as to their respective rights concerning the deposit fund, those rights as already appears, are definitely restricted to the authority of each to withdraw money from the account in the manner stated in the first paragraph. This does not itself necessarily imply the right of the appellant to take the money as his own.\nThere was no clause declaring the property to be joint, but what is significant is the evident hesitation to treat the terms as defining the interests of the depositors inter se, as intended to do more than specify the basis of deposit from the standpoint of the bank.\nI would allow the appeal and restore the judgment at trial. All costs should be paid out of the funds in question.\nKELLOCK J.\u2014Apart from the written document here in question, the evidence does not show that the deceased, Georgena Arnott, intended the respondent to have any beneficial interest in the moneys in the account. All that the deceased said to Mr. Jex was that she \u201cwished to take out a joint savings account with\u201d her sister. All that she said to the Bank manager was: \u201cI want to open a joint account in your bank with my sister, Mrs. Blanche V. Lake\u201d. The manager said to her that \u201cit will be necessary for you to sign one of our standard forms for the operation of a joint account\u201d. This she signed without reading. The respondent, who saw the deceased at the hospital on two occasions after the document was signed, but who had not seen her before the arrangement with the bank was made, was merely asked on one occasion if she had signed the bank document. There was no other conversation between the sisters regarding the account. The respondent expressed herself after the death to the effect that the object of the deceased in connection with the account was \u201cconvenience only\u201d.\nIt is, I think, well settled that in such circumstances, apart from the terms of the document itself, there would be a resulting trust of the beneficial interest in favour of the estate of the deceased; Standing v. Bowring[12]. The question, then, becomes one as to the effect of the document, but the circumstances under which it came into being and that it was the bank which required it for its purposes affects its interpretation.\nIt may first be observed that the transaction which produced the document was the purchase by Mrs. Arnott of a contract with the bank. The document, which is signed by the sisters under seal, evidences the contract with the bank, an agreement between Mrs. Arnott and the respondent as well as an assignment by each.\nIn effect the two sisters agree with the bank and with each other that all deposits \u201cshall be and continue to be the joint property of the sisters with right of survivorship\u201d. Each of the sisters in order effectually to constitute the said joint deposit account assigns to themselves jointly and to the survivor or survivors. There are further provisions for withdrawl on the cheque of either and that death shall not affect the right of the survivor \u201cto withdraw\u201d the moneys and to give a discharge to the bank. There is also a provision that the contents shall be binding upon the heirs, executors, administrators and assigns of each of the sisters.\nThe recital as to the existence of valuable consideration and the fact of execution under seal may be at once disposed of. That the agreement and assignment were in fact voluntary and that all moneys in the account were provided by the deceased may be proved notwithstanding; Walrond v. Walrond[13]; Kekewich v. Manning[14]; Glesby v. Mitchell[15]. The mere transfer into the joint names or purchase in joint names is sufficient to constitute joint ownership with its attendant right of survivorship. As put in Williams on Personal Property, 18th Ed., p. 518:\nIf personal property, whether in possession or in action, be given to A and B simply, they will be joint owners * * *. As a further consequence of the unity of joint ownership, the important right of survivorship, which distinguishes a joint tenancy of real estate, belongs also to a joint ownership of personal property.\nAnd again at p. 520:\nIf, however, the persons are simply made joint owners, the law will be sufficient of itself to carry the property to the survivor. And it is now by no means unusual to vest personal estate in two or more persons, as joint owners, simply by conveying it to them without further words.\nIn such a case where the consideration is furnished wholly by one there is, as Standing v. Bowring[16], shows, a resulting trust for him if the other is a stranger.\nWhere it is expressly stated in the instrument that the property is to be joint, as in Weese v. Weese[17], and Re Reid[18], it is nonetheless always a question \u201cwhether the document was intended to embody the rights of the\u201d (parties) or was a memorandum defining the rights and duties of the bank; Stadder v. Canadian Bank of Commerce[19]; re Hodgson[20].\nIn In re Jackson[21], moneys to which three sisters were entitled as tenants in common were invested in mortgages in each of which there was a joint account clause by which it was declared that the mortgage money belonged to the mortgagees on joint account in equity as well as at law and that they and the survivors and survivor of them should remain entitled in equity as well as at law to the mortgage money and the interest and that the receipt of the survivors or survivor of them or of the executors or administrators of such survivor, or their or his assigns, should be an effectual discharge for the same and every part thereof respectively.\nHad the joint account clause not been inserted in the mortgages the three sisters would have been entitled as tenants in common to the mortgage moneys. The evidence showed that the clause had been inserted by the solicitor who prepared the documents without special instructions in order to facilitate any subsequent dealing with or discharge of the mortgage debt and security and not with the object of vesting the beneficial interest in the surviving sister or sisters to the exclusion of the predeceasing sister or sisters. There was evidence also that in connection with one of the mortgages the effect of the clause had been explained to the mortgagees. But it was held that it was a question of intention and that, notwithstanding the clause, the sisters had intended a tenancy in common.\nSo far as the evidence in the case at bar goes, there is no evidence that the deceased intended the beneficial interest to go to the respondent. As to the language in the document, which it is contended has that effect, the deceased was ignorant of this as she had never read it. In my opinion, the document is to be construed as not intended to affect the beneficial title as between the sisters at all, but merely to facilitate the bank in its dealing with the account. The decision in In re Mailman[22] does not decide anything in conflict with this.\nI would therefore allow the appeal. With respect to costs, I think that the rule applied in Boyce v. Wasbrough[23] may, with propriety, be extended to the circumstances of this case. The proper construction of the document of December 16, 1943, fundamentally affects the rights of the parties and as to that there has been such difference of judicial opinion \u201cas to make it plain that there was in fact a legal issue to be debated both important and debatable\u201d. I think, therefore, that the costs of all parties throughout should, as between party and party, be paid out of the fund which is the subject matter of the litigation.\nAppeal allowed.

The claim was dismissed in the Exchequer Court, [1946] Ex. C.R. 387, and appeal was now brought to this Court.\nAppellant claimed that its \u201cdeep seam\u201d operation was undertaken entirely as a war or national emergency measure and to assist the coal administrator in increasing production that at all times material it was carried on at a loss. Appellant\u2019s \u201cstrip\u201d operation made a profit exceeding said loss. Appellant\u2019s net profit on both operations for the period in question fell below its \u201cstandard profits\u201d fixed under the Excess Profits Tax Act, by $44,209.30, which sum it claimed.\nAmong the facts were the following: At the Board\u2019s first meeting (in December, 1942), it recommended \u201cthat in the first instance assistance be made available in the form of accountable advances based on estimated needs\u201d, as \u201cin most cases it would be inadvisable if not dangerous to withhold assistance until\u201d audited annual statements were available and studied or until an inspector\u2019s report could be made. Forms were prepared for the purpose of obtaining information as to production, costs, revenue, etc., and on the back were instructions and the Board\u2019s plan or formula. On January 6, 1943, the Chairman of the Board, answering appellant\u2019s letter setting out increased costs due to an increased wage rate (authorized by the National War Labour Board), stated that the matter would be \u201clooked after\u201d as soon as the formula for making accountable advances had been decided. On January 29, 1943, the Executive Secretary of the Board wrote to appellant that the Board had \u201capproved a plan whereby operators who are operating at a loss may be reimbursed\u201d and enclosed forms \u201cF-4\u201d to be completed and forwarded, on which was the Board\u2019s plan or formula, stating, inter alia, that \u201cthe maximum amount of subsidy paid is regulated\u201d by the lesser of (a) profits not to exceed \u201cstandard profits\u201d as ascertained under the Excess Profits Tax Act or (b) such amount of net taxable profits as shall be equal to 15 cents per net ton of coal produced or sold. Appellant completed and forwarded the forms, and on February 11, 1943, the Executive Secretary of the Board wrote to appellant that in the light of the statements therein and the seasonal nature of appellant\u2019s operations, \u201cany question of subsidy should be deferred\u201d until returns were received for the current financial year and until clarification of the situation in respect to standard profits, that in the meantime monthly submissions of forms should be continued, and that with respect to sales, \u201cuntil a rate of subsidy, if any, is actually set no change need be made in your billing, and if a subsidy becomes payable\u201d, a back claim for additional amounts could be made. Appellant, besides forms covering certain months, sent, later, forms for the six months period now in question, covering, separately, the strip and deep seam operations. Appended to the minutes of a meeting of the Board on July 29, 1943, was a list of operators \u201creceiving or authorized to receive F-4 assistance not authorized by individual minutes\u201d, which list included appellant, but with no amount set opposite its name. Though information on the forms was available to the Board before that date, it had not examined or \u201cprocessed\u201d the form statements. On December 9, 1943, in reply to a letter from appellant to the Executive Secretary of the Board, the Assistant Accountant, for the Accountant, of the Board, wrote that \u201cwe may assure you that the [Board] has authorized subsidy on your operations from the 1st of October, 1942\u201d, and, \u201cto facilitate the computation of the correct amount of subsidy to which you are entitled\u201d, requiring a certified consolidated return. On March 3, 1944, the Chairman of the Board wrote to appellant that, \u201cafter making a careful review of the circumstances surrounding your claim for subsidy assistance, we have arrived at the conclusion that it would not be possible to justify a recommendation\u201d for it.\nHeld: The appeal should be dismissed. On the documents and facts in evidence, no contract or other ground for allowance of the claim was established.\nPer the Chief Justice and Taschereau and Estey JJ.:\nThe deep seam operation was, on the evidence, undertaken by appellant entirely of its own volition, and it was not shown that it was at any time continued in consideration of a promise that a subsidy would be paid. Though information as to the \u201cstripping\u201d and \u201cdeep seam\u201d operations was asked for and supplied separately, yet (at least for the period in question) there was no suggestion that they would be treated separately in determining any question of subsidy. Appellant was not \u201coperating at a loss\u201d within the Board\u2019s said letter of January 29, 1943, and, on the basis of that letter, did not qualify for a subsidy.\nThe statement in said letter of December 9, 1943, in the absence of evidence establishing either actual authority from the Board or that the writer was held out as one apparently having authority to make such communication, should not be accepted as an admission binding upon the Board.\nThe Board\u2019s decisions would, as the evidence indicated, be recorded in the minutes of the Board, and could be adduced in evidence by production of the minutes or (under provision in said Order in Council) of a document signed by its Chairman. As to said list appended to the minutes of July 29, 1943, it was clear that no decision had been arrived at by the Board as to a subsidy to appellant; and no other minutes were produced mentioning appellant. The Board accepted appellant as an operator entitled to be considered for a subsidy. The Board\u2019s conduct was not that of a party contracting, but rather that of one endeavouring to determine whether appellant was, on the basis of the Order in Council and the plan, entitled to receive a subsidy. Appellant was throughout supplying information asked for with the intent and purpose of convincing the Board of its right to a subsidy under the Order in Council and plan. The essential elements of a contract were not present.\nPer Kerwin J.: The facts afforded no basis for appellant\u2019s claim. Clearly, on the evidence, there was no contract; and there was nothing in said Order in Council, the minutes of the Board, or the actions of any of its responsible officers, upon which appellant might base a claim to a subsidy based upon a statute or anything similar thereto.\nPer Rand J.: The opening of the deep seam was initiated by appellant and carried on until at least the early part of 1943 voluntarily and for its own purposes, with no inducing action by the Government or the then Fuel Administrator beyond the general exhortation for a country-wide increase in production. The statement in said letter of January 29, 1943, that the Board had approved a plan whereby \u201coperators who are operating at a loss\u201d might be reimbursed, meant, both in the plain and ordinary meaning of the language and when construed with the references in the context, a loss on total operations. There was nothing in the documents that could fairly be said to have misled appellant into believing that the general plan included the subsidizing of isolated operations. It did not appear that the operation of the deep seam during the period in question was ever involved in any bargain in which its continued operation was conditioned on payment of subsidy, or that the Board throughout was not restricting subsidy to the results of appellant\u2019s operations as a whole. As to a claim based (with contract, including any basis of estoppel, excluded) on compliance with conditions of an obligatory subsidy\u2014the conditions, by their very terms, involved the Board\u2019s discretion, which could be exercised only after operating results became known and on. an appreciation of all circumstances: a dis-91786\u20141\u00bd creation which became executed only when the subsidy was in fact paid; a contention that increased output in response to the Board\u2019s appeal would ipso facto guarantee to any company producing it a return of either standard profits or 15 cents per ton was wholly inconsistent with what the Board laid down. As to inclusion of appellant\u2019s name on said list of July 29, 1943\u2014the correspondence makes it clear that there was a lack of co-ordination between the different departments of the Board; and the inference that appellant\u2019s operations had not been finally considered is confirmed by the absence of any amount for subsidy opposite its name; the entry was therefore, in fact, provisional; it is relevant to the period in question only as it might evidence recognition by the Board that the conditions on which it ordinarily acted were present; but it actually made its finding to the contrary, and the discretionary nature of its reserved power permitted it to do that.\nAPPEAL by the suppliant from the judgment of His Honour J. C. A. Cameron, Deputy Judge (now puisne Judge) of the Exchequer Court of Canada[1] dismissing its claim against the Crown for payment of a subsidy in respect to the suppliant\u2019s coal mining for the period from October 1, 1942, to March 31, 1943.\nA.

Both were continued throughout the period material to this litigation.\nBy Order in Council P.C. 3117, dated October 18, 1939, approval was given to the appointment by the Wartime Prices and Trade Board of a coal administrator. Later when a national emergency in the production of coal developed, an Order in Council, PC. 10674, dated November, 23, 1942, and passed under the authority of the War Measures Act, established the Emergency Coal Production Board with the coal administrator as chairman. This Order in Council, among other things, provided:\n3. (1) The Board shall be responsible, under the direction of the Minister, for taking all such measures as are necessary or expedient for maintaining and stimulating the production of Canadian coal and for ensuring an adequate and continuous supply thereof for all essential purposes and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, the Board shall have the power and duty, under the direction of the Minister, of\n* * * *\n(e) rendering or procuring such financial assistance in such manner to such coal mine as the Board deems proper, for the purpose of ensuring the maximum or more efficient operation of such mine; provided, however, that in no case shall the net profits of operation exceed standard profits within the meaning of the Excess Profits Tax Act;\nThe other clauses under para. 3(1) gave to the Board power of opening and operating new coal mines, prohibiting or limiting operation and directing production policies with respect to coal mines, but it is not contended that any of these powers were exercised with respect to the appellant\u2019s operations. It is by virtue of the power and duty of the Board under para. 3(1) (e) that the appellant bases its claim.\nThis Order in Council does not provide for a general subsidy payable to all who are engaged in coal mining operations. It goes no further than to provide that:\n* * * the Board shall have the power and duty, under the direction of the Minister, of\n* * * *\n(e) rendering or procuring such financial assistance in such manner to such coal mine as the Board deems proper, for the purpose of ensuring the maximum or more efficient operation of such mine * * *\nThis power is to be exercised as the Board deems proper, or in other words, in the exercise of its discretion toward the attainment of the ends therein specified. The Crown\u2019s position is that upon this basis the appellant\u2019s claim was duly considered and, as a consequence, the chairman of the Board advised the appellant under date of March 3, 1944, that financial assistance or a subsidy on its behalf could not be recommended. The appellant\u2019s main contention is rather that by virtue of interviews and correspondence a contract was concluded between itself and the Board under which it was entitled to a subsidy. Its petition alleges that the deep seam operation was not necessary to the company\u2019s business \u201cbut was undertaken entirely as a war or national emergency measure and for the purpose of assisting the coal administrator in increasing the production of coal;\u201d that such deep seam operation was, at all times material, carried on at a loss; that \u201cat the request of the Board,\u201d it \u201cdid everything in its power to assist the Board in increasing the production of coal and in securing the maximum of production;\u201d and again, that it \u201chad performed the emergency services and maximum production desired and requested by the Government of Canada and the Board;\u201d that for all this \u201cthe Board from time to time acknowledged the high efficiency of the company\u2019s operations and its great assistance in the national emergency.\u201d\nThe evidence supports many of the foregoing allegations but does not establish, nor is there an allegation to the effect, that at any time there was a promise on the part of the Emergency Coal Production Board to pay a subsidy. The Board under this Order in Council was charged with an important responsibility during the days of the war, a responsibility that involved the control of the output of coal throughout the entire Dominion. In the course of its duties it was constantly advising, directing and suggesting to the coal operators throughout Canada and determining in certain cases what, if any, financial assistance on the basis of need was necessary. Under, the circumstances, the Board would from time to time make requests of operators quite apart from any question of subsidy.\nNot only had the appellant\u2019s operations of the deep seam mine commenced but was actually in production in September, 1941, before the creation of the Emergency Coal Production Board by Order in Council P.C. 10674, dated November 23, 1942. In fact, the evidence of Mr. Brodie, president of the appellant company, makes it clear that the undertaking of the deep seam operations was a matter entirely of its own volition.\nQ. You did mine the deep seam, and started operations in May, 1941? A. Yes. Q. And as you stated in your examination for discovery, \u201cIt was purely voluntary on our part in starting this thing?\u201d\nA. It was.\nMoreover, the evidence does not establish that the deep seam operations were at any time continued in consideration of a promise that a subsidy would be paid.\nThe Board held its first meeting on December 7, 8, and 9, 1942, when it decided that because certain mines, in order that their production might be maintained, would require financial assistance, to recommend to the Minister of Finance that \u201cassistance be made available in the form of accountable advances based on estimated needs * * *.\u201d The Board indicates in its minutes that accountable advances were necessary as \u201cin most cases it would be inadvisable if not dangerous to withhold assistance until the audited annual statements of the companies\u201d would be available, or until an Inspector might make a report. No evidence was adduced that the Minister acted upon this recommendation, but in that the Board proceeded upon this basis at all times material, it may be assumed that the Minister did so.\nOn the basis of these minutes, at first form F-4 and later F-4 A were prepared for the purpose of obtaining information with respect to production, employment costs, revenue and disbursements and generally such information as the Board might require for the exercise of its power and duty under Order in Council P.C. 10674. On the back of these forms certain instructions were printed and contain the plan or formula of the Board.\nThe National War Labour Board had in November, 1942, made an order authorizing an increase in wages retroactive to October 1, 1942, in the coal mines. As a consequence of this the appellant, under date of January 4, 1943, made its first request (so far as material to this litigation) for financial assistance. The letter stated that this order had increased its disbursement for wages in both strip and deep seam operations in the sum of $2,660.53, and concluded:\nWe, therefore, would like to know in just what manner this is going to be handled and in what way we are going to be compensated for this additional cost. So far as the record indicates, there had been no promise that they would be compensated for this increase in wages, but it is clear that it might be an item to be considered with respect to the rendering of financial assistance and was so accepted by the Board.\nThe Chairman of the Board replied:\nJanuary 6, 1943.\nVia Air Mail\nDear Mr. Brodie:\nI have your letter of January 4, addressed to Mr. Neate, setting out the increased costs to your Company due to the new wage rate.\nI discussed this matter at the Emergency Coal Production Board meeting this morning and have been asked to say that this matter will be looked after just as soon as the formula for making accountable advances to companies has been decided. This should not take many days.\nYours very truly,\nJ. McG. Stewart\nChairman.\nMr. Brodie, president of the appellant company, was in Ottawa immediately after this exchange of letters and interviewed Mr. Stewart and others associated with the Board. A number of matters were discussed but in the result the question of financial assistance was not advanced further than indicated in Mr. Stewart\u2019s letter of January 6, 1943. Mr. Brodie, relative to that interview, deposed:\nQ. Do you remember this? At that time did the Board say we have got out a formula?\nA. They said we would be taken care of and that the formula was not approved and prepared, but it would follow later.\nQ. Then did you get the formula later?\nA. Yes, we got the form F-4 with certain instructions.\nThe forms F-4 containing the formula were sent to the appellant for the first time with a letter dated January 29, 1943:\nJanuary 29, 1943.\nVia Air Mail\nDear Mr. Brodie:\nOur File 101-6-2\nReferring to your letter of the.4th instant and our reply of the 6th instant in connection with accountable advances, I am instructed to advise you that the Board has approved a plan whereby operators who are operating at a loss may be reimbursed on the basis of standard profits as ascertained under the Excess Profits Act or alternatively to a maximum net profit of 15 cents per net ton before taxation.\nFor the purpose of establishing a basis on which these advances may be calculated, a new form F-4 has been prepared and I enclose a supply for your use. I note that the increased wage scale was, in the case of Western Dominion, approved as of October 1, 1942, and in order to study the effect of such increased wages, I will require a form F-4 for each of the months of October, November and December, 1942, and monthly thereafter as soon after the close of business each month as possible.\nI would request that the form be read carefully with particular attention paid to the instructions shown on the back. Inaccurate or incorrectly prepared forms will only cause unnecessary delay in making subsidy payments.\nIf you will forward the forms for the three months, October, November and December immediately, prompt consideration will be given thereto.\nYours very truly,\nJ. R. Cox,\nExecutive Secretary.\nOn the back or reverse side of form F-4 the printed instructions set out the formula or plan followed by the Board. These read in part as follows:\n1. This production subsidy statement must be completed monthly,\n* * * *\n3. Subsidy may be paid as an accountable advance to the mine operator monthly or quarterly. If a change in wage scales should be authorized by The National War Labour Board, the operator should submit at once a statement showing the effect of such change on his payroll so that the amount of the accountable advance may be adjusted.\n4. The maximum amount of subsidy paid is regulated by the lesser of the amounts indicated hereunder:\n(a) Profits not to exceed \u201cStandard Profits\u201d as ascertained under the provisions of the Excess Profits Tax Act or\n(b) Such amount of net taxable profits as shall be equal to 15 cents per net ton of coal produced or sold.\nThe forms F-4, covering the months of October, November and December, 1942, were completed and forwarded to the Board by the appellant under date of February 5, 1943. These were acknowledged by the Board under date of February 11, 1943, in a letter reading as follows:\nFebruary 11, 1943.\nAttention: Mr. A. E. Turner, Secretary-Treasurer\nDear Sir:\nI have received your letter of February 5 enclosing returns on Form F-4 for your stripping and shaft operations separately for the months of October, November and December, 1942. In the light of these statements and the seasonal nature of your operations, I am of the opinion that any question of subsidy should be deferred until your audited returns are received for your current financial year and also until you have been able to clarify the situation in respect to Standard Profits.\nIn the meantime I think that these returns on Form F-4 should continue to be submitted each month and I attach a further twelve copies of the form. With respect to sales of coal as in Section 2 of the Instructions, until a rate of subsidy, if any, is actually set no change need be made in your billing, and if a subsidy becomes payable, it will be quite simple to make a back claim for the additional amounts.\nYours very truly,\nJ. R. Cox,\nExecutive Secretary.\nThis letter makes it clear that in so far as the Board was concerned \u201cany question of subsidy should be deferred\u201d to the end of the appellant\u2019s current financial year. Moreover, in the concluding paragraph, \u201cuntil a rate of subsidy, if any, is actually set\u201d and \u201cif a subsidy becomes payable\u201d indicates in clear and unmistakable language that at that date there had been no agreement or promise that a subsidy would be paid. This letter was not replied to by the appellant nor was any exception ever taken to the foregoing statements.\nMoreover, under date of April 15, 1943, with its operating statement for the eleven months ending February, 1943, showing a loss on deep seam operations, the appellant wrote to the deputy coal administrator and pointed out its loss and \u201cone item that created a very substantial increase in cost was the award given by the National War Labour Board in November, retroactive to the 1st of October.\u201d This letter, although written after the close of the period in question, was in reference to it. There is no suggestion that any agreement had been made or Was even under consideration at that time. On the basis of that loss caused in part by the increase in wages, the appellant asked an increase in price of certain coal, which was immediately granted and the appellant notified thereof by the deputy coal administrator under date of April 17, 1943.\nWhile the appellant had from time to time sent in forms covering certain months, under date of June 7, 1943, it sent in forms F-4 duly completed for the six months period in question, October 1, 1942, to March 31, 1943, covering both the strip and deep seam operations. By letter dated June 14 the Board requested certain further information, which was forwarded under date of June 21. Separate forms covered the strip and deep seam operations and disclosed that during the six months in question the appellant realized a profit in the stripping operations of $110,497.07, and suffered a loss in the deep seam operations of $82,546.37, or a profit on both operations of $27,950.70. An adjustment made with the Income Tax Department increased this profit to $30,790.70. The $44,209.30 claimed is the difference between this profit of $30,790.70 and the amount of $75,000.00 fixed as the appellant\u2019s standard profit under the Excess Profits Tax Act. The evidence does not support this, nor was it contended that the Board had undertaken to pay that or any other specific amount.\nOn July 29, 1943, the Board held a meeting and appended to its minutes a list of operators entitled:\n20th meeting on Thursday, July 29, 1943\nCompanies receiving or authorized to receive F-4 assistance not authorized by individual minutes.\nThe list included the appellant. The information requested on the forms F-4 was available to the Board before that date but it had not examined or \u201cprocessed\u201d (as stated in the record) these statements (Form F-4). In any event, it is clear that no decision had been arrived at on the part of the Board with respect to the subsidy.\nThe appellant relied particularly upon a letter of December 9, 1943, signed by Mr. A. O. Blouin for A. E. Bradfield, accountant. This letter it alleged constituted an acknowledgment on the part of the Board to pay a subsidy. It was a reply to a short letter from the appellant dated December 3, 1943, enclosing a copy of its letter on September 8, 1943, and asking a reply to the latter. The letter of September 8 read as follows:\nSeptember 8, 1943.\nMr. J. R. Cox,\nExecutive Secretary,\nEmergency Coal Production Board,\n238 Sparks Street,\nOttawa, Canada.\nDear Sir:\nRe: Forms F-4\u2014October, 1942, to March, 1943.\nWe forwarded forms covering the above period to you on June 7 and on July 17 wrote you further advising you of the amount of our standard profits as fixed by the Board of Referees. Since that time we have not heard further from you in this matter.\nWe believe that there is a very substantial amount due us in this connection in respect of the losses of the deep seam mine. We would like to point out that we have incurred very heavy expenses in endeavouring to increase the production of coal from our operations. The funds available from the above would be very useful to us at this time and we would appreciate hearing from you at an early date advising when we may expect this matter to be disposed of.\nYours very truly,\nSecretary-Treasurer.\nThe reply signed by Mr. Blouin dated December 9, 1943, reads as follows:\nDecember 9, 1943.\nAir Mail\nDear Sirs:\nIn reply to your letter of December 3, we may assure you that the Emergency Coal Production Board has authorized subsidy on your operations from the 1st of October, 1942. In order to facilitate the computation of the correct amount of subsidy to which you are entitled, we will require a consolidated F-4A Return for the six months period, October 1 to March 31 (the end of your [fiscal year), certified by your auditor. We would suggest that you also have prepared, at the same time, a consolidated F-4A statement to date from April 1, certified by your auditor. It will then be in order for you to submit monthly F-4A statements for subsidy for subsequent months. Your annual audited statement will then be the basis of final adjustment.\nYou will understand, of course, that separate statements are required for the different operations and that these must be prepared in accordance with the instructions to operators regarding costs.\nYours very truly,\nA. O. Blouin\nfor A. E. Bradfield\nAccountant.\nMr. Neate deposed, as one would expect, that whatever approval for subsidy made by the Board would appear in the minutes. No minutes were produced other than that of the meeting on July 29, 1943, when the appellant was included on the list of. \u201cCompanies receiving or authorized to receive F-4 assistance * * *\nThe Crown submitted that the admission of Mr. Blouin, as contained in this letter written in his capacity of assistant accountant to Mr. Bradfield, that \u201cwe may assure you that the Emergency Coal Production Board has authorized subsidy on your operations from the 1st of October, 1942,\u201d was made -without authority and therefore not binding upon the Board. No evidence was tendered as to Mr. Blouin\u2019s duty or authority other than that he Was assistant accountant to Mr. Bradfield. There is no suggestion that the Board represented or held him out as one authorized to communicate the decisions of the Board, nor that in the ordinary course of his duties he would be called upon to communicate these decisions. The statement, in the absence of evidence establishing either actual authority from, or that he was held out as one apparently having authority to make such communication by the Board, cannot be accepted as an admission binding upon the Board. Bowstead on Agency, 9th Ed., 263; Phipson on Evidence, 8th Ed., 231; Barnett v. South London Tramways Co.[2]; George Whitechurch Ltd. v. Cavanagh[3].\nThe decisions of the Board, as the evidence indicated, would be recorded in the minutes of the Board and adduced in evidence either by the production of these minutes or by a document signed by the chairman, as provided for in the Order in Council P.C. 10674, para. 4(5) of which reads:\n4. (5) In any Court or for any purpose, any document purporting to be signed by the Chairman of the Board shall be conclusive evidence that any statement, order or designation therein recorded was the act of the Board, without proof of the signature or official character of the Chairman.\nThen the appellant pressed that Mr. Neate\u2019s answer constituted an admission that the Board was obligated to pay a subsidy. Mr. Neate deposed:\nQ. Yes. That is what they are getting 25 cents a ton subsidy on, is that correct, during the last year? I think the amount owing, which is not in suit, is over $40,000. When Mr. Blouin wrote his letter in December we were on the subsidy list and were entitled to a subsidy?\nA. Very definitely.\nThe first part of this question relative to the 25 cents per ton and the $40,000 refer to matters not here in issue. If one confines the answer \u201cVery definitely\u201d to the Blouin letter then if Mr. Neate meant the appellant was on the subsidy list the -answer is not only consistent with the other parts of his evidence, but with the conduct of the Board as disclosed in the record. If the answer is construed as an admission that the appellant was entitled to a subsidy, it is clearly contrary to the other parts of Mr. Neate\u2019s evidence where he makes it clear that the policy of the Board was to pay a subsidy only if the company was operating at a loss. It is very difficult, therefore, to determine what is meant or what weight ought to be given to such an answer and, therefore, by itself it does not support any definite conclusion, much less one that is contrary to all the other evidence. Under date of March 3, 1944, Mr. Brunning, as chairman, expressed his views to the appellant:\nVia Air Mail March 3, 1944.\nDear Sirs:\nAfter making a careful review of the circumstances surrounding your claim for subsidy assistance, we have arrived at the conclusion that it would not be possible to justify a recommendation to the Board for subsidy assistance to your project. It will be unnecessary for you to submit F-4A Production Subsidy Statements.\nYour profits for the fiscal years 1942 and 1943 have been substantially higher than for previous fiscal periods. These have been due in some measure to the generous assistance which has already been accorded to you by the Board.\nMay we take this opportunity of thanking you for your co-operation during the period of emergency in the production of coal. We are pleased to advise that this emergency is now past.\nYours very truly,\nE. J. Brunning\nChairman\nEmergency Coal Production Board.\nIt is true that in the deep seam operations the appellant had suffered a loss but had realized such a surplus upon the stripping operations that in the result it made a larger profit than in the previous year. The information relative to these operations was asked for and supplied separately, but throughout the record, at least for the period we are here concerned with, there is no suggestion that they would be treated separately in determining any question of subsidy. The Board\u2019s letter (quoted above) of January 29, 1943, stated:\n* * * the Board has approved a plan whereby operators who are operating at a loss-may be reimbursed * * *\nIt is clear that the appellant was not an operator operating at a loss, and therefore, on the basis of this letter, which basis obtained throughout the period in question, did not qualify for a subsidy.\nThe Board accepted the appellant as a coal operator entitled to be considered for a subsidy. The Board\u2019s conduct is not that of a party contracting but rather that of one who is endeavouring to determine whether the apellant was, on the basis of the Order in Council and the formula or plan, entitled to receive a subsidy. The appellant on its part was throughout obviously supplying all the information asked for with the intent and purpose of convincing the Board that it was entitled to a subsidy under the Order in Council and the formula or plan. When all the information was obtained and the matter considered, the chairman pointed out that, inasmuch as the appellant had realized a profit and therefore it had not incurred a loss upon the whole of its operations, it was not entitled to a subsidy.\nThe essential elements of a contract are not present in this case. May and Butcher, Limited v. The King[4]. Hillas & Co. Ltd. v. Arcos Ltd.[5].\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nKerwin J.\u2014The appellant\u2019s petition of right was rightly dismissed in the Exchequer Court. All the relevant facts are set forth in the judgment of Mr. Justice Cameron and on these facts I have been unable to discover any basis for the claim of the appellant to payment out of the public treasury. The evidence is quite clear that there was no contract between the Crown and the appellant, and I can see nothing in the Order in Council setting up the Emergency Coal Production Board, or in the minutes of that Board, or the actions of any of its responsible officers, upon which the appellant may base a claim to a subsidy based upon:a statute or anything similar thereto. The appellant seems to have thought that because it incurred further expenses and increased the production of coal by its deep seam operations at a loss, it should be entitled to divorce those operations from its strip mining operations upon which it had a profit. As a matter of fact, the appellant secured various financial advantages in connection with both classes of operations, and has not made out a case in which it might be said that, even if strictly not entitled to succeed, there was some equity which should be considered in disposing of the case.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRand J.\u2014The question in this proceeding is whether the appellant coal company is entitled to recover from the Crown a subsidy in respect of coal mined by it during the six months\u2019 period from October 1, 1942, to March 31, 1943. The right is put both on the ground of a contract entered into by the company with the Crown represented by the Emergency Coal Production Board and by compliance with the conditions of regulations having the force of law.\nThe company\u2019s operations during the period in question\nconsisted of strip and deep seam mining. Much of the greater part of the production came from the former, which had been commenced in 1939, and was highly profitable. In the Spring of 1941, the company decided to sink a shaft primarily for the purpose of obtaining a supply of water then urgently needed, but at the same time to open new deposits to meet the growing war demands then foreseen. It was expected that this operation would meet its own depreciation and depletion charges and in time recoup the outlay; but a large deficit resulted instead. For the first year and a half labour shortage contributed to this, but other factors had evidently not been fully appreciated or weighed by the company.\nPrior to November 23, 1942, a Coal Administrator appointed by the Wartime Prices and Trade Board administered generally coal production throughout the Dominion. On that day, by Order in Council P.C. 10674, the Emergency Board was set up to meet, as its name implies, a threatened coal shortage. The powers of the Board included:\n(e) rendering or procuring such financial assistance in such manner to such coal mine as the Board deems proper, for the purpose of ensuring the maximum or more efficient operation of such mine; provided, however, that in no case shall the net profits of operation exceed standard profits within the meaning of the Excess Profits Tax Act;\nOn the 9th of December following, the Board passed minutes of which the following are material here:\nWith a view to maintaining production at certain mines the Chairman was of the opinion that financial aid would be necessary in several instances. After reviewing the financial position of certain mines, the members approved the Chairman\u2019s suggestion that a memorandum should be immediately submitted to the Honourable the Minister of Finance to the following effect:\nThe Board recommends that in the first instance assistance be made available in the form of accountable advances based on estimated needs; and that payments be made by Commodity Prices Stabilization Corporation Limited on the recommendation of the Board. In most cases it would be inadvisable if not dangerous to withhold assistance until the audited annual statements of the companies can be made available and studied or until the report of a Mines Inspector or other authority can be made. The Board further recommends that the following principles be followed in making settlements with companies to which accountable advances may be made:\n(a) That the amounts and terms of payment of accountable advances be reviewed at least once every three months and be based wherever possible on audit and inspection reports satisfactory to the Board.\n(b) That (save in exceptional cases) settlements be made with companies on the basis of standard profits as ascertained under the provisions of the Excess Profits Tax Act or such amount of net taxable profits as shall be equal to 15 cents per net ton of coal produced or sold, whichever amount may be the less.\n* * * *\n(e) That in cases in which unprofitable operations have been carried on in 1942 at the request of the Coal Administrator, the Board, if satisfied that the Coal Administrator\u2019s request was reasonable and that the request for reimbursement of losses is bona fide, will join with the Coal Administrator in recommending such reimbursement.\nIt will conduce to clearness to deal first with certain aspects of the deep seam operation. On December 23, 1941, the company wrote to F. G. Neate, Technical Adviser of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, foreshadowing a coal shortage at the beginning of the new year, and proceeded:\nOur Company, last Spring, realized that the call from this field would require a very considerable increase in output. We,, therefore, planned for additional production in the shape of sinking a new shaft to the Lower Seam to give us at least a 1,000 ton per day capacity. This program was rushed as fast as possible, but our schedule was badly disrupted through delays beyond our control. Steel was almost impossible to get\u2014steel erectors equally so, and due largely to the fact that material supplies delayed us, in place of getting into production along about the 1st of September, we were unable to get going until the 1st of November. However, we had to meet the situation the best way possible and fully expected to have 1,000 tons a day by the 1st of November, but due to the above delays, we will not reach the 1,000 tons until January 1.\nThe letter then goes on to state that an expenditure of $100,000 had already been made, but that a 1,000-ton production, would not be sufficient to meet the developing situation, and that it would be necessary to install additional units. It then adds, \u201cWe are, therefore, going to ask for a write-off on this additional expenditure in two years.\u201d The matter was taken up with the Department of Munitions and Supply and ultimately, of a total expenditure of $189,000, depreciation of two-thirds was allowed over the company\u2019s fiscal years of 1943, 1944 and 1945. On December 29, 1942, the company wrote the Board, and after mentioning the allowance, recounted the difficulties that had been and were being met owing to a serious deficiency of manpower. It then proposed that the Government take over the deep seam development and operate it entirely as a wartime project. The plant would remain under the management of the company and the opinion was expressed that \u201cunder the circumstances the property would unquestionably recover the capital expenditure very rapidly.\u201d This letter was acknowledged by Neate, at that time the administrative officer of the Board, to the effect that the matter would be placed before the Board at its next meeting. Nothing further appears which deals directly with this request, but it is undisputed that the proposal was not entertained.\nIt is thus beyond question that the opening of the deep seam was initiated by the company and carried on until at least the early part of 1943 voluntarily and for its own purposes, with no inducing action on the part of the Government or the then Fuel Administrator beyond the general exhortation for a country-wide increase in production. Nor was any recommendation made by the Board under paragraph (e) of the minute quoted.\nWe come then to the operations of the company as a whole. On January 4, 1943, the president wrote Neate, as Deputy Coal Administrator, informing him of orders issued by the War Labour Board in November to advance wages retroactive to the 1st of October, 1942, giving details of the increased payroll for the deep seam and strip operations separately, and inquiring how the company would be compensated for the additional cost. This letter was answered on the 6th of January by the Chairman of the Board, stating that the matter had been discussed that day, and that he had been requested to say that it would \u201cbe looked after just as soon as the formula for making accountable advances to companies has been decided.\u201d This was followed on January 29 by a letter to the president which should be quoted in full:\nReferring to your letter of the 4th instant and our reply of the 6th instant in connection with accountable advances, I am instructed to advise you that the Board has approved a plan whereby operators who are operating at a loss may foe reimbursed on the basis of standard profits as ascertained under the Excess Profits Tax Act or alternatively to a maximum net profit of 15 cents per net ton before taxation.\nFor the purpose of establishing a basis on which these advances < may be calculated, a new form F-4 has been prepared and I enclose a supply for your use. I note that the increased wage scale was, in the case of Western Dominion, approved as, of October 1, 1942, and in order to study the effect of such increased wages, I will require a form F-4 for each of the months of October, November and December, 1942, and monthly thereafter as soon after the close of business each month as possible.\nI would request that the form be read carefully, with particular attention paid to the instructions shown on the back. Inaccurate or incorrectly prepared forms will only cause unnecessary delay in making subsidy payments.\nIf you will forward the forms for the three months, October, November and December immediately, prompt consideration will be given thereto.\nThe forms mentioned contained on the reverse side certain instructions, of which the following are material:\n1. This production subsidy statement must be completed monthly, in duplicate, certified by the proprietor, partner or in the case of a corporation by a person authorized by by-law to sign, and the original promptly forwarded to the Office of The Emergency Coal Production Board, 238 Sparks Street, Ottawa.

If a change in wage scales should be authorized by The National War Labour Board the operator should submit at once a statement showing the effect of such change on his payroll so that the amount of the accountable advance may be adjusted.\n4. The maximum amount of subsidy paid is regulated by the lesser of the amounts indicated hereunder:\n(a) Profits not to exceed \u201cStandard Profits\u201d as ascertained under the provisions of the Excess Profits Tax Act or\n(b) Such amount of net taxable profits as shall be equal to 15 cents per net ton of coal produced or sold.\n5. \u201cStandard Profits.\u201d If the operator has not had his \u201cStandard Profits\u201d assessed under the Excess Profits Tax Act he should at once make application to the Inspector of Income Tax, Ottawa, for the establishment of a standard.\nAbout the middle of January, the president, following his letter of December 29, 1942, had met the Board, and in his language at the trial:\nI took it up with the Emergency Coal Production Board, and pointed out that our deep seam operations were running at a loss and therefore we had to have some relief, either by an increase in the price of coal or a subsidy. They agreed that the matter would be taken care of at that time.\n* * * * They said we would be taken care of and that the formula was not approved and prepared, but it. would follow later.\nAnd\nWe got the form F-4 with certain instructions.\nOn his examination for discovery these answers were given:\nQ. Had this interview anything to do with anything except the question of how far you were going to be compensated for any increase in wages?\nA. That was the whole purpose.\n* * * *\nYes, both the deep seam and the strip were discussed. Perhaps I might say there that the decision was coming from the National War Labour Board authorizing an increase in the rates of pay and therefore\u2014\n* * * *\nQ. Have you any statement anywhere from, the board that any particular basis of subsidy was authorized in respect of the deep seam mine? A. Yes, they forwarded me a letter.\nQ. I mean there is nothing except what appears in the correspondence?\nA. No.\nThe total loss on the deep seam operation is stated to have been $434,000, and that for the six months\u2019 period, $82,000; and the claim submitted, originally for $30,847 on a total production basis for the six months with a net of 15 cents a ton maximum, was by amendment at the trial increased to $44,209.30, the difference between the net surplus and the standard profits of $75,000.\nThe precise language of the letter of January 29, 1943, is of the utmost importance: \u201cThe Board has approved a plan whereby operators who are operating at a loss may be reimbursed.\u201d Here is a statement of the Board\u2019s intention toward coal mining generally throughout Canada. What is it that is to be operated at a loss? Conceivably, any part of a business the accounts of which could be segregated. But that the plain and ordinary meaning of the language is total operations, I think unquestionable. This is confirmed when it is construed with the reference to \u201cstandard profits\u201d, and to the instructions on Form F-4A. The purpose, obviously, was the instigation of production by means of financial assistance where without it the production would not have been carried on; commercial profit would meet the ordinary case; but where a company was operating either at a loss or so near a loss as to have no incentive to produce, the Board would furnish the needed stimulus. At the same time, notwithstanding price control, increased production would in general absorb increases of cost, such as wages. If, then, with the knowledge of the Board, operations were commenced or continued by reason only of the proposals for subsidy, the condition of assistance would be present. The minute of December 9 would seem to put the actual intention of the Board beyond doubt; and there is nothing in the documents that can fairly be said to have misled the company into believing that the general plan included the subsidizing of isolated operations; at the least, it should have raised the question in the mind of the president whether his case was covered and have been followed by inquiry. In other words, it is unreasonable on the part of the company to claim the wider interpretation on the written communications.\nThe same limitation is implied also in a letter to the appellant from the Executive Secretary of the Board dated February 11, 1943:\nI have received your letter of February 5, enclosing returns on Form F-4 for your stripping and shaft operations separately for the months of October, November and December, 1942. In the light of these statements and the seasonal nature of your operations, I am of the opinion that any question of subsidy should be deferred until your audited returns are received for your current financial year and also until you have been able to clarify the situation in respect to Standard Profits.\nand in the letter from the Deputy Coal Controller of April 17, 1943:\nIf and when subsidy should become payable on the basis of your rates on Form F-4, in accordance with our recent ruling, of which a copy is attached, there would be no deduction of tonnage on your subsidy statements.\nIt may be that the president left Ottawa in January, 1943, with an impression that in some way by a \u201cformula\u201d the deficit in the deep mining operations would be \u201clooked after\u201d. But the Board was then making up its mind and there is nothing to indicate that he gave any more information than that the seam was being operated at a loss. Whether the precise extent of the loss or its relation to the rest of the operations was presented or considered we do not know. But the discussion was necessarily preliminary and the Board, as it is made clear in the subsequent documents, was not in a position to give a categorical assurance of assistance, particularly so in the unusual operating situation.\nThe general plan would require a special application to a minor segment of a company\u2019s undertaking; but nothing looking to that took place. Moreover, the large capital expenditure had been completed only a few months before, and it would have been extraordinary that it should be abandoned so soon afterwards. No doubt the president\u2019s concern was chiefly with that seam; but when the letter of January 29 with the forms was received, the \u201cformula\u201d, at the time of the meeting in Ottawa in course of preparation, was then before him, couched in terms of overall operations, and making no provision for exceptional cases. Even the preliminary assurances said to have been given were linked with the basis then being formulated, and whatever general impression he had carried from the meeting, he was not at liberty from that moment to disregard the considered and precise statement so communicated. In the view most favourable to him, he continued on an understanding that some as yet undefined special treatment would be accorded his deep workings, an understanding quite unwarranted in the face of the declaration of the Board, and it appears neither that the Board held such an understanding nor was aware that he did.\nGiving to the company the benefit of every reasonable inference, and interpreting the facts in the background of the emergency and war conditions then prevailing, I am unable to find that the operation of the deep seam during the six months in question was ever involved in any bargain in which its continued operation was conditioned on the payment of the subsidy. Nor can I detect any indication that the attitude of the Board was not consistent throughout, that it was not at all times restricting subsidy to the results of the operations of the company as a whole. Not until the year 1944 was there a suggestion that the deep seam be dealt with separately, but the record does not disclose its fate. The company has not yet alleged an agreement by which the deficit itself would be recouped nor that a profit, however based, would be guaranteed; and the amendment at trial related to the output of the seam claims simply the difference between the net surplus of the company and the standard profits.\nWith contract, including any basis of estoppel, excluded, compliance with the conditions of an obligatory subsidy is urged. But these conditions, by their very terms, involved the discretion of the Board which could be exercised only after operating results became known and on an appreciation of all circumstances: a discretion which became executed only when the subsidy was in fact paid. This contention is really that an increased output in response to the appeal of the Board would ipso facto guarantee to any company producing it a net return of either the standard profit or of 15 cents for every ton produced, whichever was lower: but that is wholly inconsistent with what the Board laid down.\nThe inclusion of the appellant\u2019s name on a list of companies to which subsidy was approved was relied on; but the correspondence makes it clear that there was a lack of co-ordination between the different departments of the Board; time after time requests were made for statements that had long before been sent to the Board; and the inference that the company\u2019s operations had not been finally considered is confirmed by the absence of any amount for subsidy opposite its name. The entry was therefore, in fact, provisional: it is the converse aspect of \u201caccountable advances\u201d. It was made only in July, 1943, and it is relevant to the six months\u2019 period ending March 31, 1943, only as it might evidence recognition by the Board that the conditions on which the Board ordinarily acted were present; but the Board actually made its finding to the contrary, and the discretionary nature of its reserved power permitted it to do that.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Pitblado, Hoskin & Co.\nSolicitor for the respondent: F.

Before this Court a further objection was taken by said company that the Board was not a body known to the law and consequently could not appear in any legal proceedings.\nHeld: (1) Effect should not be given to the latter objection. (Per the Chief Justice and Kerwin J.: The effect of ss. 4 and 9 of said Act is that the Board is a legal entity and can appear in legal proceedings and be heard as to its rights. Per Rand and Kellock JJ.: Assuming that the Board is not an entity distinct from its members, it was not for said company at this stage, having chosen to designate them by their collective name and after having obtained a decision in its favour, including an order for payment of costs, to get rid of them now by such an objection; Taff Vale Ry. Co. v. Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants, [1901] A.C. 426, at 445, referred to).\n(2) The Board had the right to appeal to the Court of Appeal. (Per the Chief Justice and Kerwin J.: An examination of the cases indicates that for many years it has been taken as settled that a body such as the Board has a right to appeal where its jurisdiction is in question. Per Rand and Kellock JJ., referring to The King\u2019s Bench Act, R.S.S. 1940, c. 61, s. 2 (14) (\u201cparty\u201d); The Court of Appeal Act, R.S.S. 1940, c. 60, s. 6; and to the proceedings taken in the present matter; also to Mackay v. International Association of Machinists ([1946] 2 W.W.R. 257, at 260, 264): The Board was both a proper and a necessary party to the proceedings here in question and, being a party, had the right of appeal to the Court of Appeal and required no further or other status; the argument that a tribunal charged with the responsibility of deciding as between other persons should have no interest in supporting its decision in a Court of Appeal, is irrelevant here in view of said statutory provisions. Per Estey J.: It is indicated by authorities (cases reviewed) that over a long period of time it has been recognized that where the jurisdiction of a body such as the Board, constituted to discharge judicial functions, is questioned in a superior court, it may defend its jurisdiction and, in the event of an adverse judgment, take an appeal therefrom).\nAPPEAL by the Labour Relations Board of Saskatchewan from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan 1 dismissing its appeal from the judgment of Anderson J.2.\nOn an application before the said Board for an order determining that the employees employed by Dominion Fire Brick and Clay Products, Limited (hereinafter sometimes called the Company) at its plant near Claybank, Saskatchewan, except the office staff, plant foreman and chief engineer, constituted an appropriate unit of employees for the purpose of bargaining collectively, determining that the Clay Products Workers\u2019 Union represented a majority of the employees in that unit, and requiring the Company to bargain collectively with the said Union, the Company raised a preliminary objection that it was not an employer within the meaning of The Trade Union Act, 1944 (Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1944, Second Session, c. 69) and therefore the Board lacked jurisdiction to make the order applied for. On the question raised by this preliminary objection, the Board decided against the Company, and ruled that the Board had jurisdiction. On application by the Company by way of certiorari, Anderson J. (by his judgment above referred to) quashed or set aside the order of the Board, holding that, in view of the nature of the Company\u2019s work or undertaking, the Board had no jurisdiction (the jurisdiction lying with the Wartime Labour Relations Board under Federal Order in Council P.C. 1003, of February 17, 1944). The Board appealed to the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan. When the appeal was called for hearing, counsel for the Company advanced the preliminary objection that the Board had no status to bring the appeal. The hearing was adjourned and, after argument later on the preliminary objection, effect was given thereto and the appeal dismissed. From that judgment the present appeal was brought to this Court (by special leave granted to the Board by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan). Before this Court the additional point was raised, that the Board was not a body known to the law and consequently could not appear in any legal proceedings.\nF. A. Brewin and M. C. Shumiatcher for the appellant.\nJ. C. Osborne and G. F. Henderson for the respondent Dominion Fire Brick and Clay Products, Limited.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin J. was delivered by\nKerwin J.\u2014This is an appeal by the Labour Relations Board of Saskatchewan from an order of the Court of Appeal of that province and, in order to understand what is involved, it is necessary to go back to an application made to that Board by Clay Products Workers\u2019 Union. The application was for an order (1) that the employees employed by Dominion Fire Brick and Clay Products, Limited, at its plant near Claybank, Saskatchewan, except the office staff, plant foreman and chief engineer, constituted an appropriate unit of employees for the purpose of bargaining collectively, (2) that the Union represented a majority of the employees in that unit and (3) requiring the Company to bargain collectively with the applicant.\nOn that application the Company raised a preliminary objection that it was not an employer within the meaning of the Saskatchewan Trade Union Act, 1944, but the Board overruled this objection. The Company thereupon applied to Anderson J., in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, Crown Side, who ordered that the order of the Labour Relations Board be quashed without the actual issue of a writ of certiorari and that security for costs be dispensed with. The respondents on that application were the Board and the Union and they were ordered to pay the Company\u2019s costs.\nBefore us, a new objection was taken for the first time by the Company respondent that the Labour Relations Board was not a body known to the law, and consequently could not appear in any legal proceeding. That objection may first be disposed of. Section 4 of The Trade Union Act, 1944, as amended, constitutes the Board, provides that a majority shall constitute a quorum, and that a decision of a majority present and constituting a quorum shall be the decision of the Board. By section 9:\n9. A certified copy of any order or decision of the board shall within one week be filed in the office of a registrar of the Court of King\u2019s Bench and shall thereupon be enforceable as a judgment or order of the court, but the board may nevertheless rescind or vary any such order.\nThe effect of these provisions is that the Board is a legal entity, and, as put by Riddell J., speaking on behalf of the majority of the Ontario Court of Appeal in a case of mandamus: Re Provincial Board of Health for Ontario and City of Toronto 3: it has \u201crights as well as duties, and in that view it has a right to be heard in Court.\u201d\nThe ground of the decision of the Court of Appeal was that the Board was not a party aggrieved, but MacDonald J.A., who delivered the judgment of the Court, is clearly in error in stating that no costs were awarded against the Board by Anderson J. However, the matter may be put on a broader basis. Even if the cases mentioned by MacDonald, J.A., could be distinguished in the manner indicated by him, the fact that the point made by the Court of Appeal was not even taken in those cases or in cases such as Stonor v. Fowle 4 and Combe v. De la Bere 5 indicates that for many years it has been taken as settled that a body such as the Board has a right to appeal where its jurisdiction is in question.\nThe appeal should be allowed and, in accordance with an intimation from the Bench at the close of the argument, the matter should go back to the Court of Appeal for its determination as to the admissibility of certain affidavits filed on behalf of the Board and on the substantive matter raised by the original application for certiorari. The appellant is entitled to its costs in this Court in any event to be taxed only after the substantive matter in dispute shall have been finally disposed of. All other costs will be disposed of by the Court of Appeal.\nThe judgment of Rand and Kellock JJ. was delivered by\nKellock J.\u2014This is an appeal by the \u201cLabour Relations Board,\u201d established by Chapter 69 of the Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1944, 2nd Session, from the judgment of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan dismissing an appeal by the Board from the judgment of Anderson J. in the Court of King\u2019s Bench, quashing, in certiorari proceedings, an order of the Board purporting to have been made on April 15, 1946, under powers granted to it by the statute. The Court of Appeal gave effect to a preliminary objection by counsel for the respondent company that the Board had no sufficient interest or status to appeal the judgment of Anderson J. On the appeal to this Court, the additional point was raised that the Board was not a body known to the law and consequently could not appear in any legal proceedings. It will be convenient to consider this last objection first.\nThe Board is constituted by section 4 of the statute and is to consist of seven members, appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council. The majority of the members constitutes a quorum and a decision of the majority of such quorum is the decision of the Board. By section 9 a certified copy of any order or decision of the Board is to be filed in the office of a registrar of the Court of King\u2019s Bench and thereupon it becomes enforceable as a judgment or order of the court.\nThe respondent instituted the certiorari proceedings by notice of motion pursuant to Rule 4 of the Crown Practice Rules of Saskatchewan and the notice was directed to the Board by its official title and also to the respondent union and the Attorney General of Saskatchewan. By Rule 11 such a notice is required to be served upon \u201cthe person or one of the persons who made the judgment, conviction or order\u201d and in pursuance of this provision the notice of motion was served upon the Board. The method of service was not disclosed to us.\nAssuming that the respondent company is right in objecting that the Board is not an entity distinct from its members, I think that it is not for the respondent company at this stage, having chosen to designate them by their collective name and after having obtained a decision in its favour, including an order for the payment of costs, to get rid of them now by such an objection. I think the language of Lord Lindley in Taff Vale Railway v. Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants 6 may be used with propriety here. After saying that the respondent was not a corporation, His Lordship said: \u201cThe use of the name in legal proceedings imposes no duties and alters no rights; it is only a more convenient mode of proceeding than that which would have to be adopted if the name could not be used.\u201d\nWith regard to the ground of decision of the Court of Appeal, it is necessary to refer to certain other statutory provisions. By The King\u2019s Bench Act, R.S.S. 1940, Chap. 61, section 2 (14), \u201cparty\u201d includes \u201cevery person served with notice of * * * any proceedings, although not named in the record\u201d. It may be pointed out here that in the notice of motion here in question the Board, as well as the union, are named respondents and, as already mentioned, the Board was served. Accordingly, the Board was a \u201cparty\u201d in the Court of King\u2019s Bench. By section 6 of The Court of Appeal Act, R.S.S. 1940, Chap 60, it is provided that the Court of Appeal shall have jurisdiction and power, subject to the rules of court, to hear and determine all appeals or motions in the nature of appeals respecting any judgment, order or decision of any judge of the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nIn Mackay v. International Association of Machinists 7, the defendant association had applied to the Labour Relations Board for an order requiring an employer to refrain from certain alleged unfair labour practices and the Board made an order granting the application. In that case, which was an appeal in certiorari proceedings, Martin C.J.S. said at 260:\nCounsel for the association cited many authorities showing that it is not the practice in Canadian Courts to make an inferior Court or tribunal a party in certiorari proceedings; all that these authorities indicate is that the inferior tribunal is not formally named as a defendant but that circumstance cannot alter the fact that the tribunal may be a party as it undoubtedly is in this province by virtue of the service of the notice upon it.\nGordon J.A., at 264, said:\nBoth under the English practice and under our own Crown Practice Rules (Rule 11) the notice of motion for a writ of certiorari must be served upon \u201cthe person or one of the persons who made the judgment, conviction or order\u201d. Service on one member of the Labour Relations Board was effected in this case and the Board is therefore a party and a necessary party to the proceedings.\nIn my opinion, the Board was both a proper and a necessary party to the proceedings here in question and, being a party, had the right of appeal to the Court of Appeal and required no further or other status. It is urged that a tribunal charged with the responsibility of deciding as between other persons should have no interest in supporting its decision in a Court of Appeal. However that may be in other circumstances, the argument is irrelevant here in view of the statutory provisions referred to. A number of illustrations could be given where statutory bodies not dissimilar in function to the appellant Board have appeared by counsel to support their decisions. It is sufficient to refer to The King v. Electricity Commissioners 8.\nI would accordingly allow the appeal and refer the matter back to the Court of Appeal to be disposed of on the merits.\nEstey J.\u2014The Labour Relations Board of Saskatchewan as constituted under The Trade Union Act, 1944 (1944 Statutes of Saskatchewan, ch. 69) made an order dated April 15, 1946, declaring its jurisdiction to determine the proper bargaining unit for the employees at the Dominion Fire Brick and Clay Products, Ltd. Its jurisdiction to do so was questioned before Mr. Justice Anderson who under date of July 16, 1946, directed that the order of the Board be quashed without the issue of a writ of certiorari.\nThe Labour Relations Board appealed from the order of Mr. Justice Anderson to the Court of Appeal, and, upon preliminary objection being taken, the Court held that the Labour Relations Board had no status to appeal because the order of Mr. Justice Anderson did not in any way affect the interests of the Board.\nIn In re Jane McEwen 9, the Board of Review for Manitoba was one of the appellants to this Court from an order of the Court of Appeal in that province directing the issue of a writ of certiorari and that a proposal of the Board dated October 29, 1937, be quashed. An order for payment of costs was made against the Board in the Court of Appeal, as Mr. Justice Anderson did in the case at bar, but the main issue in that case, as here, was the jurisdiction of the Board to make the order, and no question was raised as to the status of the Board of Review as an appellant.\nIn The King v. London County Council 10, the London County Council had made an order permitting premises to be open for cinematographic entertainments on Sundays and certain holidays. The Divisional Court held that the Council had exceeded its jurisdiction, made absolute a rule nisi for a writ of certiorari and directed that the order should be quashed. The London County Council appealed and the Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the Divisional Court.\nIn Hetherington v. Security Export Co. 11 the Provincial Secretary-Treasurer of New Brunswick had signed a distress warrant under sec. 6 of the Liquor Exporters\u2019 Taxation Act of that province. The jurisdiction of the Secretary-Treasurer was questioned in an application for a writ of certiorari. The Court of first instance directed the writ of certiorari to issue. The Appellate Division discharged that order. In this Court the decision of the Appellate Division was reversed but was restored by the Privy Council. Throughout these proceedings the Provincial Secretary-Treasurer was both respondent and appellant and no question was raised as to his status to defend his jurisdiction in either capacity.\nThe record in the Hetherington case (supra), as in The King v. London County Council (supra), is not clear as to the disposition of costs upon the original application. It is not, however, suggested in any of the cases that an order directing either the payment of costs or the discharge of any of its duties is essential to give to the judicial body the status to take an appeal.\nSee also Combe v. De la Bere 12; Stoner v. Fowle 13; Rex v. Electricity Commissioners 14.\nThe learned judges in the Court of Appeal referred to Board of Education v. Rice 15, where both certiorari and mandamus were granted, and to Local Government Board v. Arlidge 16, where in the Court of Appeal 17, Lord Justice Vaughan Williams concluded his reasons for quashing an order for the issue of a writ of certiorari with a direction that the matter be \u201csent back to the Local Government Board to be determined in the manner provided by law\u201d. In neither of these cases is the status of the respective Boards to appeal discussed and, when considered with the authorities already cited, they do not appear to support the requirement or qualification suggested in the judgment here appealed from.\nThe application for a writ of certiorari is not an appeal upon the merits. It raises questions as to the legality of the proceedings. Very often, as in this case, it is the jurisdiction of the tribunal to make the order in question. The foregoing authorities indicate that over a long period of time it has been recognized that where the jurisdiction of the body, constituted to discharge judicial functions, is questioned in a superior court it may defend its jurisdiction and, in the event of an adverse judgment, take an appeal therefrom. The Court of Appeal had already held that the Labour Relations Board exercised judicial functions: Bruton v. Regina City Policemen\u2019s Association (1), and that the Board was a party in certiorari proceedings: Mackay and Mackay v. International Association of Machinists Lodge No. 1057 (2).\nIn my opinion, the appeal should be allowed and the matter referred back to the Court of Appeal as suggested by my brother Kerwin.\nAppeal allowed and order of the Court of Appeal set aside (further terms of judgment pronounced in accordance with the last paragraph in the judgment of Kerwin J.).\nSolicitor for the appellant: Morris C.

City of Regina, [1947] S.C.R. 345\nDate: 1947-05-13\nRegina Industries Limited Appellant;\nand\nThe City of Regina Respondent.\n1947 Feb 12; 1947 May 13\nPresent:\u2014Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin, Taschereau, Kellock and Estey JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR SASKATCHEWAN\nTaxation\u2014Business tax\u2014City Act, Sask., R.S.S. 1940, c. 126, ss. 460, 461, 463\u2014Assessment of company for business tax\u2014Company claiming that business in question was that of the Crown, that company was agent of the Crown and not liable\u2014Contract between company and Crown for manufacture of gun-carriages\u2014Construction of contract with regard to question in issue.\nAppellant company, under an agreement with the Crown (Dom.), manufactured gun-carriages for the Crown (for which purpose it was incorporated in 1941) on property in the city of Regina held by the Crown under lease from the owner thereof. The City of Regina (respondent) assessed appellant in 1944 for a business tax under The City Act, R.S.S. 1940, c. 126, which provides that (s. 460) taxes shall be levied upon lands, businesses, and special franchises, that (s. 463(1)) the assessor shall assess either the owner or the occupant of every parcel of land in the city, and every person who is engaged in business; and that (s. 461) the interest of the Crown in any property including property held by any person in trust for the Crown shall be exempt from taxation.\nThe said agreement contained, inter alia, terms under which the Crown provided to appellant the premises, the machinery and equipment, material to be used, funds for operation, specifications, etc.; the title to all equipment and supplies, completed and partially completed articles, was at all times in the Crown, which assumed risks and liabilities incidental to ownership thereof, and appellant was not liable for loss or destruction of or damage to articles and supplies except such as might result from its negligence or wilful misconduct; appellant hired employees and had control over and was responsible for the operation of the plant, but was subject to provisions for consultation with, furnishing information to, and supervision by, the Government Minister and inspector; appellant, upon acceptance of each gun-carriage, received a fee, to cover management and supervisory services; on cancellation by the Crown of the contract, appellant should be paid its cost to the date of its giving up possession, including a fee in respect of work not completed, and might be given an allowance for exceptional hardship resulting from cancellation; appellant was to be indemnified against losses, costs, claims, etc., arising out of performance of the contract and not resulting from gross negligence on its part.\nHeld, on consideration of all the terms of the agreement, the business was that of the Crown, not of appellant, who was the agent of the Crown, and was not a \u201cperson who is engaged in business\u201d within the meaning of s. 463(1) of said Act, and was not subject to the business tax in question; the case came within the authority of City of Montreal v. Montreal Locomotive Works Ltd. (P.C.), [1946] 3 W.W.R. 748; [1947] 1 D.L.R. 161.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, [1944] 3 W.W.R. 741, reversed.\nAPPEAL by Regina Industries Limited from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan (1) dismissing its appeal by way of stated case from a decision of the Saskatchewan Assessment Commission sustaining an assessment in the year 1944 by the City of Regina (the respondent) against the appellant for business tax in respect of certain property in the City of Regina, held by the Crown (in right of Canada) under lease from the owner thereof, on which the appellant manufactured gun-carriages for the Crown under contract with the Crown (therein acting and represented by the Minister of Munitions and Supply of Canada). The appellant contended that it did not carry on a business on the premises but managed and operated on behalf of the Crown a business belonging to the Crown; that the Crown, and not the appellant, carried on the business in question; and that, therefore, the appellant was not liable to assessment for business tax under The City Act (R.S.S. 1940, c. 126). The Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan held that the appellant carried on the business for profit as an independent contractor, and was therefore subject to be assessed for business tax under the provisions of the said Act. It answered in the affirmative the questions in the stated case, which were: Whether the Saskatchewan Assessment Commission was right in holding (1) that the buildings and other property referred to in the assessment were occupied and\/or used by the appellant for business purposes within the meaning of The City Act and that the appellant was liable to assessment for the whole of the said buildings and property, and (2) that the appellant was liable for assessment although solely engaged in performing a contract for the Crown.\nP. G. Hodges K. C. and W. R. Jackett for the appellant.\nE. C. Leslie K. C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin and Estey JJ. was delivered by \u2014\nEstey, J.\u2014The appellant was incorporated under the Dominion Companies Act in October, 1941, for the express purpose of executing and performing its obligations under a contract with. His Majesty in the right of Canada and the General Motors of Canada Ltd., dated October 17, 1941, and subsequently amended May 10 and June 30, 1943. The General Motors of Canada under this agreement agreed to lease, and did lease by a separate document to His Majesty the land and buildings in the City of Regina upon which the operations under the contract were carried out and also guaranteed the due performance of the appellant\u2019s obligations under this contract.\nUnder the terms of this agreement gun-carriages were manufactured for His Majesty, and both the Saskatchewan Assessment Commission and the Court of Appeal in Saskatchewan have held that the appellant was validly assessed in 1944 for a business tax by the City of Regina under the terms of The City Act, R.S.S. 1940, ch. 126. The appellant contends that it is not liable for the tax because it managed and operated the production of gun-carriages under the provisions of the contract not in its own right but on behalf of and, therefore, as agent for His Majesty in the right of Canada.\nThe relevant provisions of The City Act are as follows:\n(1) [1944] 3 W.W.R. 741; [1945] 1 D.L.R. 220; [1945] C.T.C. 83.\n460. Subject to the other provisions of this Act, the municipal and school taxes of the city shall be levied upon: (1) lands; (2) businesses; and (3) special franchises.\n461. The following property shall be exempt from taxation:\n1. The interest of the Crown in any property including property held by any person in trust for the Crown.\n463. (1) The assessor shall assess either the owner or the occupant of every parcel of land in the city, and every person who is engaged in business or is the owner of a special franchise, and shall prepare an assessment roll showing the name of each person assessed, the property in respect of which he is assessed and the assessed value of the property.\nThe issue is determined by an examination of the contract in the light of the recent decision of the Privy Council in City of Montreal v. Montreal Locomotive Works Ltd. [1], a judgment affirming that of this Court [2]. These judgments were not available to the Appellate Court as both were delivered after its judgment in this matter on November 25, 1944.\nThe Privy Council held that the Montreal Locomotive Works Ltd. were agents for the Crown in the manufacture of tanks and gun-carriages under a contract with His Majesty in the right of Canada dated October 23, 1940, and therefore not subject to the business tax imposed by the City of Montreal.\nLord Wright, in writing the judgment of the Privy Council, pointed out that while in earlier cases the single test of control had been used to determine whether the relationship of master and servant existed, then stated:\nIn the more complex condition of modern industry, more complicated tests have often to be applied. It has been suggested that a fourfold test would in some cases be more appropriate, a complex involving (1) control; (2) ownership of the tools; (3) chance of profit; (4) risk of loss. Control in itself is not always conclusive.\nUnder the terms of the contract in question, His Majesty provided to the appellant the premises, the machinery and all necessary equipment, material to be used in the production of the gun-carriages, and the funds for operating purposes. His Majesty provided the specifications, plans and drawings for the gun-carriages, and, though the appellant was required to maintain a staff of inspectors, the decision of the government inspector was final.\nThe title to all equipment and supplies, completed and partially completed articles, was at all times in His Majesty. The risks and liabilities incidental to the ownership thereof was expressly assumed by His Majesty and, further, the appellant was not liable for loss or destruction or damage of such articles and supplies, except as might result from its negligence or wilful misconduct.\nAn estimate of the wages and of all costs of operation was made by the appellant before the 20th of each month, and when the amount so estimated was approved by the Minister, the Government deposited the amount thereof in a special account upon which the appellant drew cheques and made all necessary payments.\nThe appellant received a fee from His Majesty upon the acceptance of each gun-carriage by the government inspector, but the agreement provided that \u201csuch carriages may only be rejected by the inspector on the ground that the same do not conform to such specifications,\u201d and then provided \u201cthe cost of correction * * * shall be part of the cost of the work under this contract * * * unless the character and total value of such spoiled materials shall clearly indicate gross mismanagement or lack of competence on the part of the Contractor [appellant]\nIt is provided that this fee payable upon acceptance of each gun-carriage \u201cshall be deemed to include and cover all management and supervisory services * * * performed by the Contractor * * *\u201d except those which are included as part of the cost in other sections of the agreement. This circumstance was expressly covered in the decision of the Privy Council in the following language:\nA \u201cfee\u201d was payable in respect of each completed vehicle, but, when the whole plan is considered, that was solely as a reward for personal services in managing the whole undertaking. It was something very different from the risk of profit or loss which an independent contractor has to assume; every item of expense was borne by the Crown, just as the Government took every possible risk of loss or damage except in the very unlikely event, as already noted, of bad faith or wilful neglect on the part of the respondent. The undertaking throughout was the undertaking of the Government and not the undertaking of the respondent which was simply an agent of mandatory or manager on behalf of the Crown.\nIn maintaining that the appellant was not an agent of the Crown but rather an independent contractor, counsel for the respondent indicated certain differences which he pressed as sufficient to distinguish this case from the Montreal case [3]. In particular, that the appellant is described throughout the contract in question as \u201ccontractor\u201d whereas in the Montreal case 3 it is specifically set out in the contract that the Montreal Locomotive Works Ltd. was an agent of His Majesty. The opening words of the agreement \u201cRegina Industries Limited (hereinafter called \u2018the Contractor\u2019)\u201d indicate merely that this word is used only for convenience in the drafting and reading of the contract. That which is significant is the provision that\nthe Contractor agrees to manage and operate the plant for and on behalf of His Majesty and to manufacture therein for the account of His Majesty * * * anti-tank gun-carriages * * * in such quantities and proportions as the Minister may from time to time direct in writing, and to be supplied and delivered to or to the order of His Majesty from time to time, as manufactured hereunder.\nIt was also pressed that the appellant had control of the plant. This provision appears in the following language:\nSubject to the foregoing provisions of this clause the Contractor shall have control over and be responsible for the operation of the plant * * *\nIn \u201cthe foregoing provisions\u201d referred to, the appellant agrees, as the Minister requests, to consult the Minister and the Inspector upon all matters pertaining to the performance of this contract, to permit examination of all contracts, plans, specifications, and to furnish the Minister with specified reports, and concludes with the general phrase \u201csuch other information and data with respect to the work and the progress thereof as the Minister may from time to time require.\u201d\nThe contract also provides:\nThe Minister shall have general supervision and full control over all such costs and expenses.\nThis includes wages and expenditures of all types. The Minister shall determine whether any items of costs or expenditures are excessive or unnecessary. Then, after specifying how effect should be given to such determination, it is provided:\nThe Minister will not in the exercise of this power and control over expenditures interfere with the management and conduct of the work by the Contractor in the absence of any gross negligence or wilful default on the part of the Contractor.\nIt was also pointed out that the workmen are the employees of the appellant and that it is optional with the appellant whether it extends to the workmen group, accident and sickness insurance benefits. A corporation may be an agent and, therefore, it does not follow as a necessary consequence that because the appellant hires the employees it is necessarily an independent contractor. It should be noted that if these benefits are extended to the workmen the cost thereof is provided by His Majesty.\nThese provisions and the contract read as a whole indicate the position of the appellant to be that of an agent with limited authority rather than that of an independent contractor managing and operating its own business to produce a product for a purchaser.\nThe contract expressly provides for cancellation on the part of His Majesty, in which event it is specifically provided that the appellant shall be paid the cost up to the date of his giving up possession including \u201ca fair and reasonable fee in respect of the work not completed.\u201d There is a further clause providing that if \u201cby reason of any action taken by the Minister\u201d in effecting cancellation of the contract \u201cexceptional hardship has resulted to the Contractor, then the Minister may * * * grant such allowance (not to include in any case, however, any allowance or compensation for loss or profit) to the Contractor * * *.\nThen the further provision:\nHis Majesty agrees to indemnify the Contractor against all losses, costs, expenses, liabilities and claims of any nature arising out of the performance of this contract and not resulting from gross negligence on the part of the Contractor.\nThese provisions make abundantly clear what is indicated throughout the contract that the Government supplies everything, including the costs of operation in advance, and that the appellant assumes no risk of loss except that which may arise out of his wilful or grossly negligent conduct. It was further pressed that the provisions for the surrender of the property and equipment at the termination of the agreement, the undertaking on the part of His Majesty to indemnify the appellant against any claim for infringement of patents, the guarantee of the due performance on the part of the appellant by the General Motors Ltd., all indicated the relationship of independent contractor. In general these do point rather to the relationship of independent contractor than that of agent, but they are not in themselves inconsistent with a contract of agency and do not outweigh the provisions of the contract under which the Government owns the land, equipment, materials, and supplies all of these and the funds as well as everything else for the conduct of the operations, retains the ultimate control and assumes the risks of the entire operation, which point so definitely to the relationship of agency.\nAll these circumstances bring this case within the authority of City of Montreal v. Montreal Locomotive Works, Ltd. 4. The appellant is, therefore, an agent of His Majesty under the provisions of this contract and is not a person who is engaged in business within the meaning of sec. 463(1) of The City Act, R.S.S. 1940, ch. 126, and therefore not subject to the business tax in question.\nThe appeal should be allowed, with costs to the appellant both here and in the Court below.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Kellock JJ. was delivered by\u2014\nKellock, J.\u2014The appellant was incorporated in 1941 by Letters Patent under the Dominion Companies Act. General Motors of Canada Limited was at that time, and at all material times, the owner of certain land and buildings in the City of Regina and by lease dated October 17, 1941, the said property was demised by the last mentioned company to His Majesty the King in right of the Dominion. This lease was made in pursuance of an agreement of the same date between His Majesty, represented by the Minister of Munitions and Supply, the appellant, therein described as the \u201cContractor\u201d, and the lessor company therein called the \u201cControlling Company\u201d. The purpose of this agreement and the lease was to bring about the manufacture of gun-carriages for His Majesty. The question in this appeal is as to the liability of the appellant for business tax in respect of the above premises in which the manufacture of these gun-carriages was carried on, having regard to the provisions of The City Act, R.S.S. 1940, ch. 126, as amended. The question arose by way of stated case which was answered in the affirmative and adversely to appellants. The question in the stated case was whether the Saskatchewan Assessment Commission was right in holding:\n(1) That the buildings and other property referred to in the assessment were occupied and\/or used by the appellant for business purposes within the meaning of The City Act and that the appellant was liable to assessment for the whole of the said buildings and property.\n(2) That the appellant was liable for assessment although solely engaged in performing a contract for the Crown.\nSince the decision appealed from, a similar situation has been considered by the Privy Council on appeal from this Court, in City of Montreal v. Montreal Locomotive Works Limited 5. In that case the substantial issue was whether the Locomotive Company was in occupation of certain premises itself so as to be taxable as the person carrying on business there or whether it was operating merely as a manager or agent of the Government. If the latter, the relation between the company and the Government under the contract would be one of mandate and it would not be on the premises in its own right and therefore not liable to tax under the legislation there in question. It was held that the Locomotive Company was acting throughout for and on behalf of the Government and was consequently not subject to taxation as the person carrying on or exercising a manufacture within the meaning of Article 363 of the Montreal Charter. That Article provided for a business tax on all trades or manufactures carried on or exercised by any person in the city, limited in amount to a percentage of the annual value of the premises in which such trades were carried on. The person engaged in carrying on the trade was made directly responsible for payment of the tax. In agreeing with the conclusion of this Court that the Locomotive Company was not the person carrying on the trade, their Lordships said at p. 170 6:\nThe combined force of the whole scheme of operations seems to them to admit of no other conclusion. The factory, the land on which it was built, the plant and machinery were all the property of the Government which had them appropriated or constructed for the very purpose of making the military vehicles. The materials were the property of the Government and so were the vehicles themselves at all stages up to completion. The respondent supplied no funds and took no financial risk and no liability with the significant exception of bad faith or wanton neglect: every other risk was taken by the Government. It is true that the widest powers of management and administration were entrusted to the respondent but all was completely subject to the Government\u2019s control. A \u201cfee\u201d was payable in respect of each completed vehicle, but when the whole plan is considered, that was solely as a reward for personal services in managing the whole undertaking. It was something very different from the risk of profit or loss which an independent contractor has to assume; every item of expense was borne by the Crown, just as the Government took every possible risk of loss or damage except in the very unlikely event, as already noted, of bad faith or wilful neglect on the part of the respondent. The undertaking throughout was the undertaking of the Government and not the undertaking of the respondent which was simply an agent or mandatory or manager on behalf of the Crown. The accuracy of the positive announcement in each of the contracts that the respondent was acting throughout under the contracts for and on behalf of the Government and as its agent cannot be controverted.\nIt is the contention of the present appellant that the principle of the above decision applies to the case at bar, notwithstanding any differences of fact or in the governing legislation.\nThe respondent raises the preliminary objection that under the relevant legislation the case was limited to a question of law only and it is submitted that the question upon which the decisions of the Assessment Commission and the Court of Appeal turned was whether or not the appellant was an agent of the Crown or an independent contractor. It is said that the finding of the Assessment Commission that the appellant was the occupant of the plant for the purposes of its business was a finding of fact and not of law. In my opinion, the question as to the person carrying on the business in question, depending, as it does, upon the construction of the contract here in question, is a question of law.\nUnder the provisions of sec. 463 of The City Act, R.S.S. 1940, ch. 126, an assessment may be made upon \u201cevery person who is engaged in business\u201d at a rate per square foot of the floor space \u201cused for business purposes\u201d. By section 460 it is provided that municipal and school taxes shall be levied upon \u201c(1) lands; (2) businesses; and (3) special franchises.\u201d While by section 463(1) it is the \u201cowner\u201d or the \u201coccupant\u201d of every parcel of land who is to be assessed, it is the \u201cperson who is engaged in business\u201d and the \u201cowner of a special franchise\u201d who are to be assessed with respect to the two last mentioned species of property.\nThe definition of occupant reads as follows:\n\u201cOccupant\u201d includes the resident occupier of land or, if there is no resident occupier, the person entitled to the possession thereof, a leaseholder and a person having or enjoying in any way for any purpose whatever the use of land otherwise than as owner.\nIt was not contended by the respondent that if it were held that the appellant was merely an agent of the Crown in respect of the manufacture of the gun-carriages, there was another business being carried on upon the same premises at the same time, namely, the business of managing for remuneration that manufacture, and that the appellant was properly assessable in respect of that business. The Assessment Commission appear to have had that view, as they say:\nIt is clear that while the appellant company is to manage and operate the plant for His Majesty it nevertheless is carrying on the business of so operating and managing the plant and manufacturing the gun-carriages therein.\nNeither section 463 nor section 465, however, seem to contemplate assessment in respect of more than one business at the same time in respect of any one area or more than one \u201coccupant\u201d of that area and, as already stated, the contention on behalf of the respondent is limited to the contention that it ought to be held that the appellant was not an agent of the Crown but an independent contractor.\nWhile the contract here in question is not exactly in the same form as that in question in the Montreal case (supra), it is clear that the draughtsman had before him the earlier contract. In my opinion, when the present contract is examined, it is clear that the considerations which led the Privy Council to conclude that the relationship of principal and agent existed between the parties in the Montreal case (1) are all present here also. The Crown and not the appellant was the lessee of the premises. The plant and machinery acquired and to be acquired were never at any time the property of the appellant but of the Crown. The materials and the completed carriages were also and at all stages the property of the Crown. The appellant supplied no funds and took no financial risk and no liability with the exception of gross negligence. Every other risk was taken by the Crown. The appellant had the widest powers of management and administration but these were completely subject to the control of the Crown. Section 38 of the General Conditions reads as follows:\nThe Contractor recognizes and acknowledges that this contract is entered into for the purpose of or for purposes connected with the prosecution of the war in which His Majesty is now engaged and the Contractor agrees that notwithstanding this contract or any term or provision thereof the Minister shall have full power at any time and from time to time to take such steps and to do such acts and things as in his opinion may be necessary or advisable, in the interests of His Majesty, to facilitate, expedite or protect the work called for by this contract.\nAs in the Montreal case 7, a fee was payable in respect of each completed vehicle, but that was in payment of the management services. Every item of expense was to be borne by the Crown, including the cost of work which might be rejected by the Crown\u2019s inspector as not up to specifications unless the character and total volume of spoiled materials should clearly indicate gross mismanagement or lack of competence on the part of the appellant. While the contract does not contain the exact language of section 1 of the contract in question in the Montreal case (1) that \u201cThe government hereby acknowledges and agrees that the company is acting on behalf of the government and as its agent,\u201d it is provided by section 9 that \u201cThe Contractor agrees to manage and operate the plant for and on behalf of His Majesty\u201d. It is also recited by the amending contract of May 10, 1943: \u201cWhereas by a certain contract * * * dated as of the 17th day of October, 1941, between the parties hereto providing for the equipment and operation by the Contractor on behalf of His Majesty * * *,\u201d The considerations, therefore, which dictated the decision in the Montreal case (1) are all present in the case at bar and establish the correctness of the above recital. While the contract does contain an agreement on the part of the appellant that on termination of the work it would deliver up to His Majesty possession of the plant for the remainder of the term of the lease, and while such a provision, taken alone, assumes that the appellant was in possession as against His Majesty, nevertheless, when all the terms of the agreement are considered it is plain, in my opinion, that the appellant never had possession in its own right but only as manager and operator for and on behalf of His Majesty. This provision was inserted ex abundanti to ensure that the appellant would discontinue its connection with the plant when the work was terminated. I, therefore, think that the business being carried on upon the premises was not the business of the appellant but that of His Majesty and that the appellant is not liable for the business tax.\nCertain provisions of the contract in particular weighed in the view which the Court of Appeal took, namely, that it was provided in the contract that the Minister and inspectors should have access to the plant, that the Minister might exercise control over expenditures to see that the carriages were being produced at a reasonable price, that the equipment purchased should be the property of His Majesty, and the provision already referred to for delivery up of all government equipment and possession of the premises on termination, and the further provision that the Minister should not be liable for federal and provincial income taxes, excess profit tax and surtax. The substance of all of these are to be found in the Montreal contract and did not prevent the Privy Council from reaching the conclusion they did in that case.\nI would allow the appeal, with costs here and below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: P.

These sums were made payable as principal without interest until maturity by monthly instalments of $300 for 23 months and the balance at the end of the 24th. It appeared from the evidence that the amounts advanced were actually $12,500 and $13,500, there having been a deduction of $5,000 composed of $1,500 interest and $1,000 bonus for each loan. An admission of those facts was contained in the respondent\u2019s plea to the action. The two loans were fully repaid at the time the properties securing them were sold. Subsequently, the plaintiff corporation brought an. action under section 9 of the Interest Act, which was continued by the trustee in bankruptcy, to recover the above sum of $5,000, on the ground that it had been paid in contravention of section 6 of the Act, the appellant contending that the payments of principal money and interest and bonus were blended and that the deeds of mortgage did not contain a statement of such principal sum, and the rate of interest chargeable thereon. The Superior Court maintained the action, but the appellate court, by a majority, reversed that judgment. On appeal to this Court, Held that the appellant could not recover. The agreement for the bonus and the interest was legal and enforceable.\nPer The Chief Justice and Taschereau J.:\u2014The principal money, or the interest or the bonus is not, upon the terms of the deeds, made payable pursuant to any of the methods mentioned in the statute. Therefore, there is no illegality if, before the mortgage has been given birth to, the parties have agreed to deduct or to pay in advance the interest and the bonus, and have stipulated in the deed of mortgage itself that no interest would be payable.\nPer Kerwin J.:\u2014As to the deduction of the bonus, the case is concluded against the appellant by the decision in the Meagher\u2019s case ([1930] S.C.R. 378). As to the deduction of the interest, its prepayment or retention, by a prior agreement of the parties, does not bring the case within the operation of section 6. The prime requisite for its operation is that, by the terms of the mortgage itself, the principal or interest secured thereby must be payable in one of the methods mentioned. In the present case, they are not so made payable and the result is that there is nothing to prevent the parties to a loan transaction agreeing, prior to the execution of the mortgage, to the deduction or payment in advance of interest for the term of the mortgage and then to provide by the mortgage document that there shall be no interest until default. The effect of such a collateral agreement is that the prepaid interest ceases to be such and becomes part of the principal advanced.\nPer Rand J.:\u2014Section 6 of the Interest Act is not designed to protect a borrower against agreeing to pay any particular rate or amount of interest. Its effect is that where repayment under a mortgage involves, in the forms mentioned, an increment of interest, it shall be made clear in the mortgage what the amount of the principal and the rate of interest are. Where the transaction is not either on its face or by the real intention of the parties within the section and the borrower is fully aware both of the actual amount of interest which he is paying, and the rate and principal with reference to which that calculation is made, the purpose of the section suffers no infringement. If, on the other hand, by that intention, the payments provided do involve interest within the section, then the form of words used would not ward off the penalties.\nPer Kellock J.:\u2014The present case, upon the evidence, is governed by the principle of Meagher\u2019s case ([1930] S.C.R. 378). There is no distinction to be drawn between the bonus and the interest paid in advance. Both became debts under the agreement for the loan and neither were at any time secured by the mortgage deed or included in any payment called for therein.\nLondon Loan & Savings Co. of Canada v. Meagher ([1930] S.C.R. 378) followed.\nCanadian Mortgage Investment Co. v. Cameron (55 Can. S.C.R. 409) discussed.\nSinger v. Goldhar (55 O.L.R. 267) overruled by Meagher\u2019s case. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Loranger J. and dismissing the appellant\u2019s action.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above headnote and in the judgments now reported.\nH. G\u00e9rin-Lajoie K.C. and C. J. G\u00e9linas for the appellant.\nJohn T.

S.R., c. 120, art. 9.\nLe demandeur, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 devant cette Cour par Paul Vermette, syndic \u00e0 la faillite, pr\u00e9tend que comme r\u00e9sultat de la violation de ces articles, il a droit de r\u00e9clamer du d\u00e9fendeur intim\u00e9, la somme de $5,000.\nLes faits sont les suivants:\nPar acte authentique re\u00e7u devant le notaire La voie le 27 f\u00e9vrier 1941, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00eat\u00e9 \u00e0 Asconi Building Corporation, une somme de $15,000, remboursable en vingt-trois paiements mensuels de $300 chacun, donnant un total de $6,900. Quant \u00e0 la balance de $8,100, elle devenait due et exigible le 1er mars 1943. Par un autre acte authentique re\u00e7u devant le m\u00eame notaire, le 17 juin 1941, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement pr\u00eat\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appelant un autre montant de $16,000 remboursable de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, soit en vingt-trois paiements mensuels de $300 chacun, et la balance de $9,100, le 1er juillet 1943.\nCes deux pr\u00eats \u00e9taient garantis par hypoth\u00e8ques, affectant des immeubles de l\u2019Asconi Building Corporation, et chaque acte contient une clause \u00e0 l\u2019effet que dans le cas de vente, la balance due sur le prix deviendra exigible.\nQuoiqu\u2019il soit stipul\u00e9 \u00e0 ces deux actes que les pr\u00eats sont respectivement de $15,000 et de $16,000, payables sans int\u00e9r\u00eat, il est certain que le capital du pr\u00eat de $15,000 n\u2019\u00e9tait que de $12,500, et que le capital de l\u2019autre pr\u00eat de $16,000 n\u2019\u00e9tait que de $13,500. Dans chaque cas, il y avait un montant de $2,500 repr\u00e9sentant un bonus et des int\u00e9r\u00eats.\nLe plaidoyer du d\u00e9fendeur ne laisse aucun doute sur ce point.\nLe d\u00e9fendeur admet ce qui suit:\nThat the loan of February 27, 1941, was in fact of $12,500, which with interest of $1,500 and bonus of $1,000, made the total mentioned in the deeds of $15,000 payable by plaintiff to defendant without interest save in event of default;\nThat the loan of June 17, 1941, was in fact of $13,500, (whereof $11,100 cash and $2,400 representing eight monthly payments of $300 overdue on the first loan or to fall due on the two loans within two months and payable by plaintiff to defendant) which with interest of $1,500 and bonus of $1,000 made the total of $16,000 mentioned in the deed and payable by plaintiff to defendant without interest save in the event of default;\nLe demandeur a donc re\u00e7u lors du premier pr\u00eat $12,500 et s\u2019est oblig\u00e9 de rembourser $15,000, et lors du second, il a re\u00e7u $13,500 et a consenti \u00e0 rembourser $16,000. Ces remboursements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits par le syndic qui ignorait ces conditions qui n\u2019apparaissaient pas aux actes re\u00e7us devant le notaire Lavoie, et le demandeur pr\u00e9tend maintenant, que les versements du principal et du bonus et des int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e9tant confondus, et que les actes ne contenant pas un \u00e9tat de la somme principale et du taux de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat, il a le droit de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter, en vertu des dispositions de l\u2019article 9, les int\u00e9r\u00eats et le bonus. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure lui a donn\u00e9 raison, mais la Cour du Banc du Roi, les honorables juges L\u00e9tourneau et Galipeault dissidents, a rejet\u00e9 son action. Une action en r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de ce genre doit r\u00e9ussir quand on trouve dans l\u2019acte de pr\u00eat les \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants:\n1\u00b0. Une somme principale et des int\u00e9r\u00eats.\n2\u00b0. Une somme garantie par hypoth\u00e8que.\n3\u00b0. Un taux d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qui n\u2019est pas calcul\u00e9 d\u2019avance.\n4\u00b0. Des versements de capital et d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats qui sont confondus.\nCette loi, qui est d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, a \u00e9videmment \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e afin que l\u2019emprunteur connaisse exactement le montant d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats qu\u2019il aura \u00e0 payer, et afin qu\u2019on ne lui extraie pas des taux usuriers. Dans une cause de Canadian Mortgage Investment Co. v. Cameron[1], M. le juge Walsh a d\u00e9fini ainsi les buts de la loi:\nThe evil which the section aims to prevent is the imposition of an extortionate rate of interest through the medium of blended payments of principal and interest. Under this system without the protection which this section affords a highly usurious rate of interest might be wrapped up in these innocent-appearing blended payments without the slightest suspicion on the part of an ignorant or careless borrower that he was being made the victim of it. And so parliament stepped in and decreed that such a mortgage should itself tell the mortgagor exactly how much of the aggregate of these blended payments represents principal and exactly the rate at which the interest included in them calculated yearly or half-yearly not in advance is charged under penalty of the loss of all interest for breach of this direction. I think that if such a mortgage gives all the information to which the mortgagor is entitled under the statute the exact form of words which it uses to convey it to him is absolutely immaterial. A statement is something which is stated. Surely if there is to be found within and as part of the mortgage something which states the amount of the principal money and the rate of interest chargeable thereon calculated in one of the methods prescribed by the section the mortgage does contain a statement of these things. The main thing, in fact the only thing, needed is to give to the mortgagor the information to which the section entitles him, and I think he can be given it just as effectually through the medium of his own covenants as he can by tabulating it in a formal statement.\nAu cours de l\u2019argument, quelques causes seulement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9es, car, quoique la loi soit ancienne, la jurisprudence n\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s abondante. Les deux premi\u00e8res causes pr\u00e9sentaient peu de difficult\u00e9s. Dans Standard Reliance Mortgage Corporation v. St. George Stubbs[2], le d\u00e9biteur hypoth\u00e9caire avait pris action afin qu\u2019il soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat ne pourrait \u00eatre per\u00e7u. Dans l\u2019acte d\u2019hypoth\u00e8que, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu \u201cthe principal is $700 and the rate of interest chargeable thereon is 10 per cent per annum.\u201d Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les exigences de la loi \u00e9taient satisfaites, et l\u2019action a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e.\nDans cette cause de Canadian Mortgage Investment Co. v. Cameron[3], qui est \u00e9galement venue devant cette Cour,[4] l\u2019acte d\u2019hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9 contenait les clauses suivantes:\nFirst: That he will pay to them, the said mortgagees, the above sum of one thousand four hundred dollars and interest thereon at the rate hereinafter specified in gold or its equivalent at the office of the said mortgagees at the city of Toronto, in the province of Ontario, as follows: That is to say, in instalments of one hundred and seventy-nine 90\/100 dollars half-yearly on the 24th days of June and December in each year until the whole of said principal sum and the interest thereon is fully paid and satisfied, making in all ten half-yearly instalments. The first of said instalments to become due and be payable on the 24th of December, 1907. All arrears of both principal and interest to bear interest at ten per centum per annum as hereinafter provided.\nSecondly: That he will pay interest on the said sum or so much thereof as remains unpaid at the rate of ten per centum per annum by half-yearly payments on the twenty-fourth days of December and June in each and every year until the whole of the principal money and interest is paid and satisfied, and that after maturity interest shall accrue due at the rate aforesaid from day to day, and that interest in arrear, whether on principal or interest, and all sums of money paid by the mortgagees under any provision herein contained or implied or otherwise, shall be added to the principal money and shall bear interest at the rate aforesaid, and shall be compounded half-yearly, a rest being made on the twenty-fourth days of the months of December and June in each year until all such arrears of principal and interest are paid; and that he will pay the same and every part thereof on demand.\nCette Cour en est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la conclusion que quand le d\u00e9biteur hypoth\u00e9caire convient de payer le principal et les int\u00e9r\u00eats en dix paiements semi-annuels, au taux de 10% le cr\u00e9ancier a droit aux int\u00e9r\u00eats, vu que les exigences de la loi sont satisfaites.\nJe suis port\u00e9 \u00e0 croire qu\u2019il y a beaucoup de similitude entre la cause de Singer v. Goldhar[5] et celle qui nous est actuellement soumise. Dans la premi\u00e8re, une somme de $3,500 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00eat\u00e9e, mais une hypoth\u00e8que de $4,700 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 consentie, et faite remboursable par versements mensuels de $100 durant 11 mois, et la balance \u00e0 la fin du douzi\u00e8me mois. La cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ontario a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait confusion du capital et des int\u00e9r\u00eats, qu\u2019aucun taux d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat n\u2019\u00e9tait stipul\u00e9 et que la diff\u00e9rence au-del\u00e0 de $3,500 ne pouvait \u00eatre r\u00e9clam\u00e9e. M. le juge Masten parlant pour la Cour s\u2019exprima ainsi:\nMr. Brown\u2019s next point is a suggestion which he couples with the former argument, viz., that the agreement is one and single for a bonus of $1,200; that the $4,700 is by agreement of the parties made principal on the face of the mortgage; and that the 12 instalments by which this $4,700 is to be paid are all instalments of principal, and thus there is no blending of principal and interest; and that the statute applies only to cases where there are periodical payments involving interest and principal combined, but not to cases where a single or definite sum (designated by the appellant as a bonus) is agreed by the mortgagor to be paid for the accommodation afforded. With this he couples the further argument that the mortgagor is estopped by the terms of the mortgage and by its receipt-clause from claiming that the $4,700 is not wholly principal.\nAgain I would agree but for the statute. Its provisions make it incumbent on the Court, if the issue is raised, to ascertain what in fact was actually the \u201cprincipal money advanced,\u201d and what was the \u201cinterest\u201d or compensation to the mortgagee for the advance.\nMais je crois que cette d\u00e9cision ne doit pas faire jurisprudence depuis le jugement rendu par cette Cour dans London Loan & Savings Co. of Canada v. Meagher[6]. Dans cette cause, l\u2019appelant avait pr\u00eat\u00e9 la somme de $30,000 avec int\u00e9r\u00eats au taux de 7\u00bd%, mais il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu qu\u2019en consid\u00e9ration de ce pr\u00eat, l\u2019appelant recevrait un bonus de $3,000, que l\u2019emprunteur a convenu de payer. L\u2019acte d\u2019hypoth\u00e8que a \u00e9t\u00e9 consenti pour la somme de $30,000 sans aucune r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au bonus de $3,000. L\u2019appelant a \u00e9mis un ch\u00e8que en faveur de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour la somme de $28,505.55, soit $30,000 moins certaines d\u00e9ductions pour les taxes, les primes d\u2019assurance, les frais l\u00e9gaux, et a re\u00e7u un ch\u00e8que de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour le bonus de $3,000. L\u2019appelant a poursuivi pour r\u00e9clamer le bonus de $3,000 et a r\u00e9ussi devant le tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance et devant la cour d\u2019appel d\u2019Ontario, mais ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvers\u00e9 par cette Cour, et M. le juge Smith rendant le jugement unanime de la Cour, s\u2019exprima de la fa\u00e7on suivante \u00e0 la page 382:\nThe application of the act therefore must be confined to mortgages that come clearly within the description set out in the act itself.\nEt encore \u00e0 la m\u00eame page:\nAs already pointed out, the $3,000 that the mortgagor agreed to pay as consideration for the loan, whether he got it as interest or as something different from interest, could have been recovered as a debt, not under the mortgage, but under the agreement for the loan, and the full $30,000 was advanced, whether the bonus is taken as paid by the mortgagor\u2019s cheque or by retention from the loan, unless the act applies.\nEt \u00e0 la page 383, le juge Smith dit encore:\nThese considerations form an additional reason for confining the application of the act to mortgages coming strictly within the description in section 6. Taking the precise language of this section, it is only where any principal money or interest is, by the mortgage itself, made payable on any of the plans mentioned, that the section applies, the words being \u201cis, by the same, made payable on the sinking fund plan,\u201d and it is only to mortgages described in the preceding part of the section that the final provision and section 9 apply. The proper conclusion seems to be that the provisions of the statute applied only to mortgages, which on their face come within the description set out in section 6.\nDans le cas qui nous occupe, la somme principale ou l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat ou le bonus, n\u2019est pas, par l\u2019acte m\u00eame, fait payable suivant l\u2019une des m\u00e9thodes mentionn\u00e9es au statut et, il s\u2019ensuit qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019ill\u00e9galit\u00e9 si, avant la cr\u00e9ation de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que, les parties ont convenu de d\u00e9duire ou de payer d\u2019avance les int\u00e9r\u00eats et le bonus, et ont stipul\u00e9 dans l\u2019acte d\u2019hypoth\u00e8que lui-m\u00eame qu\u2019aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat ne sera payable.\nL\u2019appel doit donc \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 avec d\u00e9pens.\nKerwin J.:\u2014This appeal involves the construction of section 6 of the Interest Act, R.S.C. 1927, chapter 102:\n6. Whenever any principal money or interest secured by mortgage of real estate is, by the same, made payable on the sinking fund plan, or on any plan under which the payments of principal money and interest are blended, or on any plan which involves an allowance of interest on stipulated repayments, no interest whatever shall be chargeable, payable or recoverable, on any part of the principal money advanced, unless the mortgage contains a statement showing the amount of such principal money and the rate of interest chargeable thereon, calculated yearly or half-yearly, not in advance.\nThis section was considered by this Court in London Loan and Savings Co. of Canada v. Meagher[7], where, prior to the execution of a mortgage, it was agreed between lender and borrower that $3,000 should be paid as a bonus for the making of the loan, and the payment was made. This agreement was held to be no part of the mortgage document itself and therefore the principal \u201csecured by mortgage\u201d was not \u201cby the same\u201d made payable in any of the three methods described in the section. That is, the bonus became part of the principal advanced upon which the agreed rate of interest was payable as a straight loan. The case of Singer v. Goldhar (1) was relied upon by the appellant in the present appeal. It was held in Meagher\u2019s case9 that the result in Singer[8] was not in conflict with the decision announced by this Court but part of the reasoning in Singer8 must be taken to be overruled and therefore those decisions in Ontario which followed the same line of reasoning.\nIn the case of each loan in question in this appeal, it appears from the evidence that the amount actually deducted was composed of interest and bonus. As to that part representing bonus, the case is concluded by the Meagher9 decision. While it is true that the Court there treated the bonus as interest, there is a great deal to be said for the opinion that the two are entirely distinct, and in view of the fact that Parliament is restricted to legislation in relation to interest, that phase of the matter should be kept in mind. Treating as open the question whether what is undoubtedly interest may be prepaid (or deducted from the amount of the loan), such a prepayment or retention, by a prior agreement of the parties, does not bring the case within the operation of section 6. In construing an enactment by which Parliament sought to remedy an existing evil, the Courts must give it such a reasonable interpretation as will carry out that intention but that intention can only be gathered from the terms of the enactment. The prime requisite for the operation of the section is that, by the terms of the mortgage itself, the principal or interest secured thereby must be payable in one of the methods mentioned. Here, the principal or interest is not so made payable and the result is that there is nothing to prevent the parties to a loan transaction agreeing, prior to the execution of the mortgage, to the deduction or payment in advance of interest for the term of the mortgage and then to provide by the mortgage document that there shall be no interest until default. The effect of such a collateral agreement is that the prepaid interest ceases to be such and becomes part of the principal advanced.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with costs. Rand J.:\u2014I take the facts in this appeal to be these: the parties intended that the respondent should lend and the appellant borrow the sum of $15,000, repayable in two years; that interest should be charged at the rate of 5 per cent per annum on the sum borrowed and in addition a premium or bonus of $1,000 be exacted; and that the interest for the two years so calculated and the premium should be paid in advance by way of deduction from the principal of the loan as in fact they were. The mortgage on its face, agreeably to that intention, declares the sum of $15,000 to be payable as principal without interest until maturity and thereafter at a rate specified, by monthly instalments of $300 for 23 months and the balance at the end of the 24th.\nThe question of law arising on these facts is whether section 6 of the Interest Act prevents what was intended from being done. The section reads:\n6. Whenever any principal money or interest secured by mortgage of real estate is, by the same, made payable on the sinking fund plan, or on any plan under which the payments of principal money and interest are blended, or on any plan which involves an allowance of interest on stipulated repayments, no interest whatever shall be chargeable, payable or recoverable, on any part of the principal money advanced, unless the mortgage contains a statement showing the amount of such principal money and the rate of interest chargeable thereon, calculated yearly or half-yearly, not in advance.\nThe transaction can be viewed in either of two aspects: first, as a payment over of $15,000 and the return payment by the borrower, whether out of the loan or out of other moneys belonging to him, of the amount intended as interest and premium, effected by the equivalent retention of that sum by the lender; or as a loan only of what ultimately passed from the lender to the borrower, with the difference between that sum and the amount of the obligation of repayment representing interest and premium: two aspects of the same objective facts, one including the intention of the parties as an essential element and the other confining itself to the naked acts themselves.\nInterest in its original sense is the consideration for the use of money, and strictly considered, the payment of interest in advance necessarily abstracts from the sum, the use of which is intended to be paid for; consequently it cannot be said that such a payment is for the use of the whole of the principal sum. If, on the other hand, the deduction is said to be the consideration for the use of what is actually advanced, then that becomes principal, and the rate of interest will vary accordingly. From the standpoint of the lender, the so-called payment in advance reduces somewhat the risk of ultimate recovery of the principal, while exhibiting a lower rate for the same return in interest; and from the standpoint of the borrower, there is a loss of the use of the interest so deducted. The elusive difference between the two views lies in the converse mathematical interpretations to which the facts lend themselves; the basis of the calculation in principal and rate is modified, but the actual advance and the actual amount of interest to be received remain the same.\nNo doubt under the usury acts, the form which the loan or the consideration for interest might take played little part in the question of the real nature of the bargain. An agreement providing for interest at the maximum rate in advance was illegal ab initio regardless of its form; what the Court was concerned to ascertain was the actual loan and the consideration for its use. In the language of Lord Mansfield in Floyer v. Edwards10:\nAnd where the real truth is a loan of money, the wit of man cannot find a shift to take it out of the statute. If the substance is a loan of money, nothing, will protect the taking more than 5 per cent.\nI think it too late, however, to question acceptance. of the notion of interest payable in advance. In Floyer v. Edwards10, Lord Mansfield says:\nUpon a nice calculation, it will be found that the practice of the bank in discounting bills exceeds the rate of 5 per cent; for they take interest upon the whole sum for the whole time the bills run, but pay only part of the money, viz., by deducting the interest first; yet this is not usury.\nThen, in Lloyd v. Williams 11, Blackstone J. is reported to have\nconceived that interest may as lawfully be received before-hand for forbearing as after the term is expired for having forborne. And it shall not be reckoned as merely a loan of the balance: else every banker in London who takes 5 per cent for discounting bills would be guilty of usury. Nothing in the French civil law contrary to these views has been suggested. A distinction might be urged between discounting negotiable paper and discounting a loan of money, but in substance the principle as it affects the consideration received is the same.\nNow section 6 of the Interest Act is not designed to protect a borrower against agreeing to pay any particular rate or amount of interest; in fact, under section 2 of the Act there is complete freedom of action in a contract for interest. The object of section 6 is something quite different. It is that where repayment under a mortgage involves, in the forms mentioned, an increment of interest, it shall be made clear in the mortgage what the amount of the principal and the rate of interest are. Obviously no device to defeat that purpose could be tolerated; but where the transaction is not either on its face or by the real intention of the parties within the section and the borrower is fully aware both of the actual amount of interest which he is paying, and the rate and principal with reference to which that calculation is made, the purpose of the section suffers no infringement. If, on the other hand, by that intention, the payments provided do involve interest within the section, then the form of words used would not ward off the penalties.\nThis conclusion, I think, follows necessarily from London Loan & Savings Company of Canada v. Meagher11. There, a bonus of $3,000 was retained from the loan; as here, the mortgagor knew the amount of principal and of the bonus and the actual agreement as to repayment was as expressed by the instrument; by the preliminary feature of the transaction the \u201camount advanced\u201d was taken to be the original sum from which the deduction was made, in the conception of which the stipulations of the instrument were made and interpreted. Smith J. treats the mode of dealing with the advance for which Mr. Lajoie argues as \u201cbegging the question\u201d, which I take as meaning that the case is brought within section 6, where the language itself does not do so, only when the parties intend such terms as that section envisages. Certainly I am unable to agree that the validity of the provisions in the instrument depends on whether the advance deduction is described as a \u201cbonus\u201d or \u201cinterest\u201d.\nAs no other ground is suggested requiring us to ascribe to the written obligation an interpretation which contradicts its precise form, it must be taken and enforced according to that form. Its terms may, of course, be significant to the operation of other statutes ,but whatever consequences of that sort may follow, it is sufficient here that neither the letter nor the purpose of the Interest Act is violated by them.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nKellock J.\u2014This is an appeal from the Court of King\u2019s Bench, Appeal Side, of the province of Quebec, allowing an appeal by the respondent (defendant) from a judgment of the Superior Court.\nBy a deed of mortgage dated February 27, 1941, Asconi Building Corporation, now in bankruptcy and represented by its trustee the appellant Vermette, mortgaged certain real property in or adjacent to the city of Montreal to the respondent. By the deed the company acknowledged receipt of the sum of $15,000 and covenanted to repay the same in two years from March 1, 1941, by twenty-three consecutive monthly instalments of $300 each and the balance of $8,100 on March 1, 1943, all without interest. There is a provision in the deed that in the event of sale of the premises then the balance outstanding would immediately fall due and be payable. This event in fact happened in the month of April, 1942, and the full balance of the $15,000 then outstanding was paid to the respondent. In this action the company and its trustee seek the recovery of the difference between the sum of $12,500, which was the amount actually paid over to the company at the time of the execution of the deed, and the $15,000. In addition there was claimed a further sum of $2,500, resulting from a similar dealing in respect of a mortgage deed of June 17, 1941, in the sum of $16,000. I shall deal first with the mortgage of February 27, 1941. The property mortgaged was, at the time of the deed, already heavily encumbered and that situation was prominent in the minds of the parties at the time of the negotiations for the loan. The judgment of the Superior Court proceeded upon the ground that section 6 of the Interest Act, R.S.C., cap. 102, applied and accordingly the appellant was entitled to succeed by reason of the provisions of section 9. The majority in the Court of King\u2019s Bench were, however, of opinion that the Act had no application.\nSection 6 is as follows:\nWhenever any principal money or interest secured by mortgage of real estate is, by the same, made payable on the sinking fund plan, or on any plan under which the payments of principal money and interest are blended, or on any plan which involves an allowance of interest on stipulated repayments, no interest whatever shall be chargeable, payable or recoverable, on any part of the principal money advanced, unless the mortgage contains a statement showing the amount of such principal money and the rate of interest chargeable thereon, calculated yearly or half-yearly, not in advance.\nThis section was considered by this court in London Loan and Savings Co. of Canada v. Meagher12. In that case the Trans-Canada Theatres Ltd., the mortgagor, had applied to the appellant company for a mortgage loan of $30,000. The loan company agreed to make the loan at 7\u00bd per cent, payable half-yearly, but stipulated that in consideration of the making of the loan, it should receive from the mortgagor a bonus of $3,000, which the mortgagor agreed to pay. The mortgage was dated the 15th of March, 1922, and on its face was for $30,000, with interest at 7\u00bd per cent, but there was no reference to the bonus. The mortgagee issued its cheque to the mortgagor for the amount of the loan of $30,000, less certain expenses which were the obligation of the mortgagor, and took a cheque from the mortgagor for the $3,000 bonus, which last mentioned cheque the mortgagee agreed to hold until its cheque for $30,000 had been forwarded to the mortgagor. The mortgage, after some payments of interest were made, fell into arrear and the mortgagor became insolvent. The mortgagee advertised the property for sale, whereupon the liquidator of the mortgagor paid off the full balance of the $30,000 then outstanding with interest without any knowledge of the bonus. He subsequently brought action to recover the $3,000 with interest.\nIt was held in this court that the action failed. The court was of opinion that (1) the full $30,000 was advanced whether the bonus was to be taken as paid by the mortgagor\u2019s cheque or by retention from the loan; (2) the mortgage there in question was not by its terms made payable on any of the plans mentioned in section 6 nor was there anything in the mortgage itself which brought it within the description set out in the section; and (3) the $3,000 agreed to be paid as consideration for the loan, whether regarded as interest or as something different from interest, could have been recovered as a debt, not under the mortgage, but under the agreement for the loan. The court therefore held the Act did not affect the mortgage.\nTurning to the provisions of the statute and paraphrasing the section, it provides that whenever any principal or interest secured by a mortgage of real estate is by the terms of the mortgage itself made payable on any of the plans there mentioned, no interest may be recovered on any part of the principal money advanced unless the statement prescribed by the statute is contained in the mortgage.\nFor the purposes of the question with respect to interest with which it deals, the statute raises the question in every case as to what was in fact \u201cthe principal money advanced\u201d. In Meagher\u2019s case13 the court held that the full face amount of the mortgage, viz., $30,000, had been in fact advanced, and it therefore followed that no part of the $3,000 bonus, even though it were regarded as interest in the sense of compensation for money lent, was interest \u201csecured by\u201d the mortgage and therefore no part of such bonus was included in any payment called for by the mortgage. Hence the statute did not apply.\nTurning to the facts of the case at bar, the mortgage deed, considered by itself and without more, shows merely that it was given to secure the sum of $15,000 repayable as already stated. By reason of the statute, however, it is necessary to inquire what was the principal money actually advanced. It is objected by the respondent that as this is a matter of evidence the matter is governed by the provisions of article 1234 of the Civil Code and the mortgage deed must be taken as conclusive. However, this article is subject to the provisions of article 1245 C.C., by which a judicial admission is complete proof against the party making it. In his plea the respondent pleads:\nThat the loan of February 27, 1941, was in fact of $12,500 which with interest of $1,500 and bonus of $1,000 made the total mentioned in the deed of $15,000 payable by plaintiff to defendant without interest save in event of default.\nHad appellant been content to rely upon this plea, then there was nothing else in the case to contradict the facts pleaded that the interest and the bonus were in fact secured by the mortgage. Appellant, however, was not content to rely upon this plea but called evidence to establish that the actual facts were to the contrary. This evidence, in my opinion, establishes that there was an agreement between mortgagor and mortgagee prior to the giving of the mortgage by which, by reason of the nature of the security or lack of it, the mortgagor agreed to pay in advance to the respondent the sum of $1,000 bonus and $1,500 for interest in consideration of the agreement of the respondent to make the loan at all, these amounts to be deducted from the proceeds of the loan, with the result that neither of these amounts was at any time secured by the mortgage deed.\nThe only evidence put in at the trial was put in on behalf of the appellant. Among the witnesses so called was the respondent who in chief said the following:\nD. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, il n\u2019y avait pas de diff\u00e9rence entre l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat et le bonus? c\u2019\u00e9tait tous les deux pour la m\u00eame chose?\nR. Non, non.\nD. Comment calculez-vous quinze cents dollars \u00e0 cinq pour cent?\nR. Je vais vous dire: Monsieur Chait a calcul\u00e9 tout cela. C\u2019\u00e9tait tout fait avant de terminer cette affaire-l\u00e0.\n* * * *\nD. Pourquoi avez-vous fait une distinction entre les int\u00e9r\u00eats et le bonus?\nR. Pour faire comprendre cela, cela a march\u00e9 suivant les ordres de monsieur Chait.\nD. Le plein montant de dieux mille cinq cents dollars \u00e9tait en consid\u00e9ration du pr\u00eat?\nR. Non, non, non. Mille dollars, c\u2019\u00e9tait pour le bonus et quinze cents dollars pour les int\u00e9r\u00eats. D. Mais les deux montants vous \u00e9taient pay\u00e9s pour vous faire consentir \u00e0 faire le pr\u00eat?\nR. Oui, certainement, certainement.\nD. C\u2019\u00e9tait une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration qui vous \u00e9tait donn\u00e9e pour pr\u00eater votre argent \u00e0 la compagnie?\nR. Oui, certainement.\n* * * *\nIt is true that the respondent also said at one point that the monthly payments of $300 included both \u201ccapital and interest\u201d and at another that they were only capital. In my opinion such answers, and other of like import, directed to an interpretation of the effect of the mortgage deed do not militate against the evidence quoted above and were in fact inadmissible as trenching on the province of the court.\nOne Asconi, president of the appellant, who acted for the appellant in the negotiations with the respondent, gave the following evidence:\nD. Sur quoi vous \u00eates-vous bas\u00e9 pour donner $1,000 de bonus?\nR. C\u2019est pour le bonus. Le bonus, c\u2019\u00e9tait pour avoir l\u2019argent direct de M. Dominic Vocisano.\nD. Est-ce lui, M. Vocisano, qui a exig\u00e9 un bonus de $1,000?\nR. Oui, c\u2019est lui.\nD. Est-ce le d\u00e9fendeur qui a exig\u00e9 le bonus et les int\u00e9r\u00eats pour faire le pr\u00eat?\nR. Oui.\nThe appellant also put in evidence the receipt given by the mortgagor to the respondent at the time of the completion of the advance under the mortgage. It reads:\nMontreal, February 27, 1941. Received from Dominic Vocisano, cheque of $12,500 being the amount of loan executed today before me, I. R. Lavoie, N.P., less interest and bonus totalling $2,500. Signed: Asconi Building Corporation per Orpheo Asconi.\nThe document indicates that the \u201camount of the loan\u201d was the full sum of $15,000 and that the interest and bonus were paid in advance.\nIn the minutes of its Board of Directors, held on the day on which the mortgage deed is dated, there is the following:\nIt was moved, seconded and unanimously resolved that the Company do borrow from Dominique Vocisano, the sum of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) without interest, interest at the rate of five per cent per annum being deducted from the principal, and to repay the said sum as follows.\n* * * *\nThen follow the terms of the repayment already mentioned and the following: All overdue instalments shall bear interest at the rate of six per cent (6%) per annum. And that the Company, for the security or repayment of the said sum of capital and interest as aforesaid, do hypothecate a certain area of rectangular figure forming part of that lot * * *\nThe interest here mentioned can only be the 6 per cent, as the interest of $1,500 was to be paid in advance by deduction. The whole $15,000 secured by the mortgage deed was the \u201ccapital\u201d.\nWith respect to the second loan of June 17, 1941, no receipt was produced and the minutes of the mortgagor company authorizing the second borrowing do not contain the extracts quoted above relating to the first loan. Otherwise however the considerations relating to the making of both loans are substantially the same and the evidence of the respondent quoted above was expressly with relation to both. The witness Asconi gave the following evidence also with respect to the second loan:\nD. Est-ce le d\u00e9fendeur qui a exig\u00e9 le bonus et les int\u00e9r\u00eats pour faire le pr\u00eat?\nR. Oui.\nAccordingly, in my opinion, on the above evidence the case, with respect to both loans, is governed by the principle of Meagher\u2019s case 14. There is no distinction to be drawn between the bonus and the interest paid in advance. Both became debts under the agreement for the loan and neither were at any time secured by the mortgage deed or included in any payment called for therein.\nCounsel for the appellant relied upon Singer v. Goldhar15. This decision is referred to in Meagher\u2019s case14 where Smith J. at p. 385 said that the result reached was not in conflict with the construction placed upon the statute in Meagher\u2019s case14. It is also stated on the same page that in Singer\u2019s case15 the court was there dealing\nwith a mortgage which had no provision for repayment on any of the plans described in section 6.\nIn Singer\u2019s case (2) the mortgage in question was for $4,000, repayable in eleven monthly instalments of $100, the balance to be repaid at the end of twelve months and there was no provision for the paying of interest. In the action, which was one for foreclosure, there was no oral evidence but it was admitted that $3,500 only had been advanced, while $3,800 had been repaid. It was held that the mortgage was satisfied. As in Ontario a mortgagor is not estopped by the terms of the mortgage from showing the actual amount advanced, the decision could have been put on the ground that there was no liability upon the mortgagor beyond the amount actually advanced. This, however, was not the ground of the decision but that the difference between the amount advanced and the face amount of the mortgage was interest and could not be recovered by reason of the statute.\nIn Meagher\u2019s case16 the court was not called upon to decide a case such as was involved in Singer\u2019s case17, as in the latter the liability of the mortgagor for bonus could not have been placed upon any basis outside the terms of the mortgage itself. I think therefore that the statement in the judgment with respect to the mortgage in Singer\u2019s case17 must be considered as obiter. In my opinion it is inconsistent with the actual decision in Meagher\u2019s case16.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Lajoie, G\u00e9linas and MacNaughton.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Hackett, Mulvena, Hackett and Mitchell.\n[1] (1917) 30 D.L.R. 792; [1917] 2 W.W.R. 18.\n[2] (1917) 55 Can.

On January 8, 1945, appellant made out and signed a cheque dated January 9, 1945, to M for $2,000 on appellant's savings account with respondent, the Royal Bank of Canada, at Calgary, and also signed his name on the back of the cheque, and presented it, along with an undated deposit slip in M's name, to the teller of the Canadian Bank of Commerce at Calgary, who filled in the date, January 8, on the deposit slip, and did not notice (nor was it drawn to her attention) that the cheque was postdated. The teller, immediately after the deposit, sent the cheque by messenger to the Royal Bank's office where the proper officers, not noticing that it was postdated, certified it and returned it. Later on the same day, M withdrew from her account in the Bank of Commerce (in which account the amount of said cheque had been credited) the sum of $2,000. Appellant, having learned from M on the evening of January 8 that the transaction, to help finance which the cheque was intended, had hot gone through, attended, at the opening of business on January 9, at the Royal Bank to stop payment of the cheque, but was told of the certification and that payment could not be stopped. Later the Royal Bank paid the amount of the cheque through the clearing house to the Bank of Commerce. Appellant sued the Royal Bank for said amount of $2,000, claiming that it was improperly charged to his account. The bank claimed that the instrument was a bill of exchange other than a cheque or alternatively that the true date was January 8, and, should it be held that appellant was entitled to countermand, the bank counterclaimed against appellant as endorser; the bank also (by amendment allowed by the Appellate Division, Alta.) pleaded estoppel, and alternatively, that appellant, in breach of duty to the bank, misled or caused to be misled the bank into certifying the cheque on January 8, by reason whereof the bank became entitled to debit appellant's account with the amount of the cheque.\nHeld (Rand J. dissenting): Appellant was entitled to recover the amount from the respondent bank. (Judgment of the Appellate Division, Alta., [1946] 2 W.W.R. 187, reversed, and judgment at trial, [1946] 1 W.W.R. 65, restored). Per the Chief Justice and Kerwin J.: The law that a cheque may be countermanded before the time of its payment as designated by its ostensible date, applied in this case. As between appellant and the respondent bank, January 9 was the true date of the cheque. Whether or not appellant, by signing his name on the back of the cheque, became an endorser, the respondent bank could not claim against him as such, as the respondent bank did not become a holder in due course. The plea of estoppel against appellant failed because the employees of the respondent bank who participated in the certification of the cheque did not rely upon appellant's endorsement.\nPer Taschereau and Estey J.J.: Appellant was within his rights in asking that the respondent bank stop payment. The certification of the cheque before its date was, as against appellant, invalid. On the evidence, the only reason that the bank certified the cheque was because its employees overlooked the fact that it was postdated; appellant was no party to this, and the essentials to found an estoppel were not present. Even if appellant be regarded as an endorser, yet the respondent bank received the cheque upon the terms of its contractual relationship with appellant, and its relationship is determined on that basis, and the bank could not under the circumstances claim as a holder in 'due course as against appellant.\nPer Rand J., dissenting: Appellant never intended that M should be contractually related to the cheque, that is to say, that she should ever be a party to any legal right or obligation created by its transfer to the Bank of Commerce or any subsequent dealing with it; crediting her account with the proceeds was a matter dehors the cheque. The payee was therefore a fictitious person, and under s. 21 of the Bills of Exchange Act, the cheque may be treated as payable to bearer; and in any event, appellant was estopped from denying that fictional existence. A cheque can be negotiated before its date; the Bank of Commerce became, therefore, the holder of the cheque with an engagement on appellant's part at least as drawer; and that title was transferred to the respondent bank. Assuming the countermanding to have been effective, the respondent bank was remitted to the rights of a transferee from the Bank of Commerce; and the counterclaim was well founded.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiff from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division[1], allowing the appeal of the defendant, the Royal Bank of Canada, from the judgment of H. J. Macdonald J.[2] in favour of the plaintiff for the sum of $2,000, being the amount of a certain postdated cheque drawn by the plaintiff on his account with the said bank and debited by the bank against that account, but which the plaintiff claimed should not have been so debited because he countermanded the cheque before the time at which, according to the cheque, it was payable. Facts giving rise to, and the nature of, the ques- tions in dispute are stated in the reasons for judgment now reported and are indicated in the above headnote. The bank alleged that the cheque, which was issued on January 8, 1945, but dated January 9, 1945, was in law a bill of exchange other than a cheque, or alternatively that the true date thereof was January 8, 1945. The Bank, should it be held that the plaintiff was lawfully entitled to countermand, counterclaimed for $2,000 against the plaintiff as endorser. The Appellate Division dismissed the action, and also (by the formal judgment) gave leave to the bank to amend its statement of defence and counterclaim by adding certain paragraphs which in effect alleged (1) that the plaintiff was estopped from saying that the cheque was postdated, and(2) alternatively that the plaintiff, in breach of his duty to the bank, misled or caused to be misled the bank into certifying the cheque on January 8, 1945, by reason whereof the bank became entitled to debit the plaintiff's account with the amount of the cheque.\nSpecial leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was granted to the plaintiff by the Supreme Court of Alberta, Appellate Division.\nR. L. Fenerty for the appellant.\nJ. J. Saucier K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin J. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014The appellant, A. M. Keyes, had a sum of money on deposit in a savings account in the main office, in Calgary, of the respondent, the Royal Bank of Canada. On January 8, 1945, he issued a cheque dated January 9, 1945, to a Mrs. J. I. Mundy on this account for two thousand dollars. At the opening of business on the 9th, he attended at the main office to stop payment of the cheque but found that it had been marked \"certified\" the previous day. Later, on the 9th, the amount of the cheque was paid through the clearing house to the Canadian Bank of Commerce which had been instrumental on the 8th in having it so marked. If that were all, there would be no difficulty, as the law is clear that, a cheque being merely an order of a customer on his banker to pay a sum of money, such order may be countermanded before the time of its payment as designated by its ostensible date. The respondent, however, relies upon the circumstances of the case to void this result and the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta agreed with it and, reversing the judgment at the trial, dismissed Keyes' action to recover the two thousand dollars.\nThe tale commences with the friendship between Keyes and Mrs. Mundy. He had previously given or loaned her several small sums, when she requested a loan of two thousand dollars to help finance the purchase of a tea room in Calgary. The transaction was to be closed on January 8th, and, while Keyes stated at one stage in his evidence that he told Mrs. Mundy he would think over the matter, at another he testified that he said he would deposit the required sum to her credit in the Bank of Commerce where she had a savings account and where he also had an account. Accordingly, on the afternoon of the 8th he attended the proper branch of the latter institution in Calgary and made out and signed the cheque on his account with the main office of the respondent in Calgary for two thousand dollars payable to J. I. Mundy or order, but dated the cheque January 9th. He did this, he explained, because he intended, if the proposed purchase did not materialize, to stop payment of the cheque. He made out an undated deposit slip in Mrs. Mundy's name and endorsed the cheque since, again according to his evidence, that was his custom. He presented the cheque and deposit slip to the teller, who filled in the date, January 8th, on the latter. Keyes asked the teller the present total to the credit of Mrs. Mundy's account including the $2,000, which information the teller declined to give. The teller did not notice that the cheque was postdated but, in accordance with the Bank of Commerce's custom when dealing with cheques of $1,000 and over, sent this cheque, by messenger, to the Royal Bank's main office, where the latter's proper officers, not noticing the date, marked the cheque \"certified\" and returned it to the messenger. Later the same afternoon Mrs. Mundy withdrew by a cheque on her account with the Bank of Commerce the sum of $2,000. That evening Mrs. Mundy telephoned Keyes and asked if he had deposited the two thousand dollars to her account and was told he had. Despite the efforts of the respondent, it was impossible to secure the attendance of Mrs. Mundy at the trial, but it is evident that she must have known that Keyes had deposited the two thousand dollars to her account, as otherwise she had not a sufficient sum to her credit to permit the withdrawal of that amount. During the course of the telephone conversation just mentioned, Keyes asked her if the purchase of the tea room had been completed and was told that it had not. He then decided to stop payment of the cheque and the next morning presented himself at the respondent's main office before the doors were open and gave the necessary instructions. He was told that the cheque had been marked \"accepted\" the previous day and that nothing could be done about the matter.\nNothing of what transpired was, of course, known to the respondent except that on January 8th the Bank of Commerce presented a cheque dated January 9th drawn by Keyes on his account with the former and that the cheque bore his endorsement as well as his signature as drawer. The cheque was never endorsed by Mrs. Mundy, as it was explained by various witnesses that when a cheque is deposited to the credit of the account of a payee, it is not considered necessary by the banks to insist upon the latter's endorsement. The respondent did not know that the cheque had been deposited by Keyes to Mrs. Mundy's account in the Bank of Commerce.\nBy section 165 of the Bills of Exchange Act, R.S.C. 1927, chapter 16, a cheque is a bill of exchange drawn on a bank, payable on demand, and except as otherwise provided, the provisions of the Act applicable to a bill of exchange payable on demand apply to a cheque. By section 167, the duty and authority of a bank to pay a cheque drawn on it by its customer are determined by countermand of payment. While some criticism of postdated cheques appear in English textbooks, the practice in this country is well established, and by section 27 of the Act (which applies to cheques) a bill is not invalid by reason only that it is antedated or postdated. The respondent, however, relied upon section 29 of the Act:\u2014 29. Where a bill or an acceptance, or any endorsement on a bill, is dated, the date shall, unless the contrary is proved, be deemed to be the true date of the drawing, acceptance or endorsement, as the case may be\nand argued that it has been shown that the true date of the cheque was January 8th and not January 9th. It is contended that by presenting the cheque on the earlier date to the Bank of Commerce with the request that the two thousand dollars be deposited to Mrs. Mundy's credit, and by inquiring the present total to her credit, the plaintiff must be taken to have meant that the true date of the cheque was the 8th.\nIt is unnecessary to consider the effect of the actions of the plaintiff as between him and the Bank of Commerce, except to note that it would apparently be held in some jurisdictions that the Bank of Commerce, by obtaining the respondent's certification of the cheque, must be taken to have accepted the latter as its debtor,\u2014since the certification took place, not at the instance of the drawer, but of the holder after the issue of the cheque. Whatever the position might be as between the Bank of Commerce and Keyes, his evidence makes it clear that the 9th was the true date.\nAs pointed out in Paget on Banking, 4th edition, page III:\u2014\"his [the banker's] business is not to pay it [a cheque] before the ostensible date, that being his customer's intention and direction.\" On the following page the same author draws attention to the fact that efforts had been made to get out of the difficulty by representing the banker as having purchased the cheque during its currency, and so being holder in due course entitled to sue the drawer. In effect that was another of the arguments advanced by the respondent, but the case of Da Silva v. Fuller[3] has been accepted for many year's as correctly stating the law. In that case a postdated cheque was lost and was paid by the banker on the day before its date and it was held that the banker was not protected and must repay the loser. The case is unreported but it is mentioned in the 6th edition of Bayley on Bills at page 319 and in the 11th edition of Chitty on Bills of Exchange at pages 188 and 279. It was also referred to by Baron Parke during the course of the argument in Morley v. Culverwell[4] at the end of the following statement:\u2014\nThe condition of an indorser of a bill payable after date is this, that he is a surety for the payment of it by the acceptor at a particular time and place, on presentment for payment. If the acceptor pays the bill before it is due to a wrong party, he is not discharged. It has been so held in the case of a banker's cheque payable to bearer; if the banker pays it before it is due, he is not protected.\nSee also Hart's Law of Banking, 4th edition, p. 366, and Halsbury, 2nd edition, vol. 1, pp. 820-821. I agree with the statement in Grant on Banking, 7th edition, p. 67, that the decision of the Supreme Court of Queensland in Magill v. Bank of North Queensland[5] is in direct conflict with the cases in England. The decision to the contrary, of the Court of Appeal of New Zealand, in Pollock v. Bank of New Zealand[6] is to be preferred.\nIt is contended that by signing his name on the back of the cheque, Keyes became an endorser, and reliance is placed upon sections 131 and 133 of the Act. By the former, when a person signs a bill otherwise than as a drawer or acceptor, he thereby incurs the liability of an endorser to a holder in due course and is subject to all the provisions of the Act respecting endorsers. By the latter, an endorser engages, on due presentment, that the bill shall be accepted and paid according to the tenor and that, if it is dishonoured, he will compensate the holder who is compelled to pay it. The argument fails in limine because under the rule mentioned the respondent did not become a holder in due course.\nAt the suggestion and with the leave of the Appellate Division and notwithstanding the appellant's objection, the respondent amended its defence by pleading estoppel. Accepting the leave of the Appellate Division, the plea fails because the two employees of the respondent who participated in the certification of the cheque did not rely upon the appellant's endorsement. This is clear from the evidence and in fact is admitted in the respondent's factum, although it is argued that that fact could not alter the express provisions of the statute, which, however, for the reasons already given, are not applicable. The appeal should be allowed and the judgment at the trial restored with costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Estey, JJ., was delivered by\nESTEY J.\u2014The appellant at Calgary on January 8, 1945, drew a cheque for $2,000 upon the Royal Bank of Canada where he had a savings account, postdating the cheque January 9th and making it payable to J. I. Mundy or order. Mrs. Mundy was negotiating the purchase of a restaurant and appellant had agreed to assist her in the purchase thereof to the extent of $2,000. She had asked that he deposit this to her account in the Canadian Bank of Commerce at Calgary on January 8th. The appellant had an account at the same branch of the Canadian Bank of Commerce and some time in the afternoon of January 8th tendered to the teller of that bank the cheque in question for $2,000 for deposit to the account of Mrs. J. I. Mundy. He did not draw the teller's attention to the fact that the cheque was postdated, nor did the teller notice that fact, but rather accepted it for deposit, and at once the amount thereof was credited to Mrs. Mundy's account. The teller in the course of receiving the cheque endorsed Mrs. Mundy's name thereon, and deposed that this was the usual banking practice. In so doing the bank was acting as agent for its customer, Mrs. J. I. Mundy.\nA banker undertakes to do what is in the proper course of a banker's business, and so far differs from an agent who is not a banker.\nBank of England v. Vagliano Brothers[7].\nSubsequently on the same afternoon Mrs. Mundy drew from her account $2,000. There is no allegation of fraud on the part of the appellant or of collusion between the appellant and Mrs. Mundy.\nImmediately the cheque was deposited on January 8th in the Canadian Bank of Commerce it was sent by messenger to the Royal Bank of Canada for certification, where again the postdating was overlooked by the clerks of that bank and the cheque certified. On the evening of January 8th Mrs. Mundy informed the appellant that negotiations were concluded, at least for the time being, and she was not purchasing the restaurant. As a consequence, immediately the bank opened on January 9th and before the cheque reached the Royal Bank of Canada in the ordinary course of banking, appellant called at that bank and asked that payment of the cheque be stopped, when he was informed that, because it had been certified on the previous day, payment could not be stopped.\nThe appellant brought this action to recover from the Royal Bank of Canada the sum of $2,000, which he alleges was improperly charged to his account following the certification of the aforementioned cheque.\nThe Appellate Court in Alberta reversed the judgment of the learned trial judge in favour of the appellant and directed that judgment be entered for the respondent.\nThe appellant contends that he had a right to stop payment of the cheque on the morning of January 9th, and the respondent that if he had, he was by his own conduct estopped from doing so. The respondent asks judgment on its counterclaim on the basis that the appellant is either an endorser or that it is a holder in due course of the cheque.\nThe appellant in connection with his savings account received from the Royal Bank of Canada a pass or bank book setting forth \"Savings Regulations\" paragraph 2 of which reads:\nFunds deposited will be paid only to the depositor in person or upon presentation of his written order.\nA cheque is a written order and the law imposes an obligation upon the bank to pay the depositor's cheque according to its tenor if the depositor has funds to the amount thereof at his credit. Halsbury, 2nd Ed., Vol. 1, p. 820:\nA banker is bound to pay cheques drawn on him by a customer in legal form provided he has in his hands at the time sufficient and available funds for the purpose. A postdated cheque since 1776 has been accepted as a negotiable instrument. Da Silva v. Fuller[8]; Emanuel v. Robarts[9].\nIn Falconbridge on Banking and Bills of Exchange, 5th Ed., p. 553:\nA cheque which is \"postdated is none the less a cheque, and is therefore payable, without grace, on demand on or after its date; but for some purpose it may be treated as if it were a bill of exchange payable at a future date.\nHalsbury, 2nd Ed., Vol. 1, p. 820:\nPostdated cheques are not invalid, but the banker should not pay such a cheque if presented before its ostensible date.\nPaget's Law of Banking, 4th Ed., p. 111:\nThe real trouble is where a banker inadvertently pays a postdated cheque before the ostensible date. He cannot debit it then, and he must not dishonour cheques presented in the interval up to the ostensible date, which, but for paying the postdated one, he would otherwise have paid.\nSee also Pollock v. Bank of New Zealand[10]:\nThe Bills of Exchange Act, R.S.C. 1927, chapter 16, section 165:\nA cheque is a bill of exchange drawn on a bank, payable on demand.\nSection 27:\nA bill is not invalid by reason only that it\n* * *\n(d) is antedated or postdated, * * *\nBank of Baroda, Ld. v. Punjab National Bank Ld.[11]. On June 13, 1939, Mitter took to the respondents, Punjab National Bank, Ld., a cheque dated June 20th drawn upon appellant, Bank of Baroda Ld., marked or certified \"Marked good for payment on 20.6.39. For the Bank of Baroda, Limited, M. P. Amin, Manager.\" On June 19th the appellant bank suspended Amin and on the 20th sent notice to the respondent and other banks that his power of attorney was cancelled. Appellant bank refused to pay the cheque on June 20th notwithstanding its having been previously marked. The Appellate Division of the High Court of Calcutta affirmed the judgment at trial in favour of the respondent on the basis that the appellant had, by marking or certifying the cheque, accepted it. The Privy Council reversed this decision on the ground that the ostensible authority of the manager did not extend to cover the certification of postdated cheques and that in the present case the manager had no authority in fact to do so. Lord Wright in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, stated at p. 187:\nTheir Lordships have referred to these matters as tending to support the view that certification is different both in its history and its effects from acceptance, even in jurisdictions in which either by statute or by custom it is declared to be \"equivalent\" to an acceptance.\nThen, after pointing out that a postdated bill is under the English Act, section 13, subsection 2, as in the Canadian Bills of Exchange Act, section 27, not invalid by reason only that it is postdated, he continued at p. 193:\nBut the material invalidity is that of the certification, taken in connection with the fact that the cheque was postdated. The true anomaly or invalidity consists in the attempt to apply certification to a cheque before it is due. Certification of a cheque when it is due may have operative effect and be valid as being directed to a cheque due in praesenti, such certification being presumably followed by debiting the drawer's account with the amount. This is particularly apparent when regard is had to the American or Canadian theory, that certification is equivalent to payment. It is impossible to treat the cheque as paid before it is due. The position might be different in jurisdictions where by law or custom certification is equivalent to acceptance, but nothing of the sort is applicable here. Even in such cases the difficulty of saying that there was constructive payment would remain. It is not easy to see why novel and anomalous theories should be invented to justify an unusual and unnecessary proceeding. This case can, however, be decided simply and sufficiently on the ground that the ostensible authority of the manager did not extend to cover the certifying of postdated cheques, and that in the present case the manager had no actual authority to do so. The bank accordingly was not bound. This in itself would be a sufficient ground for rejecting the respondent's claim.\nIt would appear from the foregoing that the Royal Bank of Canada had no ostensible authority to certify the appellant's cheque before its date, nor does the evidence suggest that it had any actual authority from the appellant to do it and, therefore, the certification as against the appellant was invalid.\nThe Bills of Exchange Act does not specifically deal with postdated cheques. A postdated cheque, however, has been accepted as a negotiable instrument and usually as a bill of exchange payable on the date thereof. Even an ordinary cheque has been described by Parke B. as \"a peculiar sort of instrument, in many respects resembling a bill of exchange, but in some entirely different.\" Ramchurn Mullick v. Luchmeechund Radakissen[12]. It is a bill of exchange that is also a cheque and possesses the differences which distinguish a bill of exchange from a cheque as enumerated by Lord Wright at p. 184 in Bank of Baroda, Ld. v. Punjab National Bank, Ld.,[13] and in particular the basic difference that the liability of the drawee of a cheque does not depend upon acceptance by the drawee as in a bill of exchange, but rather upon the contractual relationship between the drawer-depositor and the drawee-bank, under which the obligation of the drawee-bank is to pay the cheque if funds of the drawer are available when it is presented on the date thereof or a reasonable time thereafter.\nIn Ex parte Richdale. In re Palmer[14], it was contended that when the drawer of a postdated cheque received notice that a declaration of bankruptcy had been made with respect to the payee it was his duty to stop payment of the cheque. There the cheque was drawn by the purchasers of a business in favour of the vendor for the balance of the purchase price. It was postdated and, because of the reason given by the appellant in the case at bar, it is interesting to note the reason in that case. The report indicates at p. 410:\nThe cheque was postdated the 28th of April, the reason for this being that the licences could not be transferred without a written authority signed by Palmer, and Richdale & Tomlinson wished to be able to stop payment of the cheque in case this authority should not be given.\nPalmer was declared a bankrupt on April 27th. It was held that the giving of the cheque was a dealing within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Act and that there was no obligation upon the drawers, when they heard of the payee's bankruptcy, to stop payment of the cheque.\nIn the foregoing case it was contended that the right to countermand should have been exercised. In many cases the countermanding of postdated cheques has taken place and without any suggestion that such a right did not exist in the drawer. See Union Bank of Canada v. Tattersall[15]; Carpenter v. Street[16]; The Royal Bank of Scotland v. Tottenham[17]; Westminster Bank Ld. v. Hilton[18]. In the latter case the drawer brought an action against the drawee-bank for payment of a postdated cheque after he as drawer had instructed the bank to countermand payment thereof. His instructions to countermand were contained in a telegram in which he gave an incorrect number of the cheque. The plaintiff failed in his action, not because he had not the right to countermand, but because his instructions giving the incorrect number did not cover the cheque in question.\nIt has been suggested that a postdated cheque is so far a bill of exchange that the provisions relevant to cheques contained in Part 3 of the Bills of Exchange Act are not applicable thereto. In referring to a document in the form of a postdated cheque, Mr. Justice Duff (later Chief Justice) stated (in Leduc v. La Banque d'Hochelaga[19].\nA \"cheque\" is defined by the Bills of Exchange Act (s. 165) as \"a bill of exchange drawn on a bank, payable on demand.\" The order in question, as accepted, is obviously not payable on demand, and consequently is not a cheque within this definition.\nThese remarks are restricted to section 165. The essential differences between a cheque and a bill of exchange, as already indicated, make it plain that, while it is a bill of exchange for some purposes, it cannot be so regarded for all purposes; in particular the drawee's liability under a cheque is not that of the drawee-acceptor under the Bills of Exchange Act. Moreover, because countermanding with respect to postdated cheques has been so long recognized in the courts, it would appear that the provision of section 167 of the Bills of Exchange Act in providing for countermanding is merely setting forth the common law with regard thereto.\nSection 167:\nThe duty and authority of a bank to pay a cheque drawn on it by its customer, are determined by\n(a) countermand of payment;\nIt follows that the appellant on January 9th, before the Royal Bank of Canada made payment of the cheque, was within his rights in asking that the bank stop payment of his cheque in favour of Mrs. Mundy. It was further contended that the appellant was estopped from denying that in reality the cheque was dated January 8th, because by his conduct he detracted the attention or in some way prevented the teller from noticing the postdating. It is true that he did not draw to the attention of the teller of the Canadian Bank of Commerce the fact that his cheque was postdated. It is important to note that the positions of the Royal Bank of Canada and that of the Canadian Bank of Commerce are in their respective relations to the appellant entirely different and that in this action we are concerned only with the relationship which exists between the appellant and the Royal Bank of Canada. Apart from the question raised in the counterclaim as to the drawer being an endorser and the Royal Bank of Canada becoming a holder in due course, which will be dealt with later, the position as between the appellant and the respondent bank is as stated by Lord Atkinson in Westminster Bank Ltd. v. Hilton[20]:\nIt is well established that the normal relation between a banker and his customer is that of debtor and creditor, but it is equally well established that quoad the drawing and payment of the customer's cheques as against money of the customer's in the banker's hands the relation is that of principal and agent. The cheque is an order of the principal's addressed to the agent to pay out of the principal's money in the agent's hands the amount of the cheque to the payee thereof.\nThe foregoing indicates the relationship between the appellant and the Royal Bank of Canada, while the Canadian Bank of Commerce, in receiving the cheque for deposit, derives its rights through the negotiating of the cheque. The Royal Bank of Scotland v. Tottenham[21]. It would seem that the positions of the two banks with respect to the appellant are entirely different.\nThe appellant in tendering for deposit to Mrs. Mundy's account his cheque to the Canadian Bank of Commerce was negotiating a postdated cheque. While certain dangers incident to the practice of issuing postdated cheques have been from time to time emphasized, these cheques are nevertheless recognized in law as valid negotiable instruments, and the Canadian Bank of Commerce became at least a holder for value in receiving the cheque as it did. The Royal Bank of Scotland v. Tottenham(2). There is no allegation of fraud on the part of the appellant or of collusion between the appellant and Mrs. Mundy, and no evidence that he had any intention to deceive or mislead the Canadian Bank of Commerce, nor circumstances deposed to which would justify such an inference. If Mrs. Mundy had purchased the restaurant, the cheque was to be used to assist her. The record does not suggest that the appellant had any intimation that Mrs. Mundy would use the funds for any other purpose. Without that act on her part it is probable that, in spite of the fact that the postdating was overlooked by employees of both banks, this litigation would never have developed.\nWhatever took place between the Canadian Bank of Commerce and the appellant, it is clear upon the evidence that the only reason, the Royal Bank of Canada certified this cheque was because its employees overlooked the fact that the cheque was postdated. The appellant was no party to this, and, with great deference for the opinion of the learned judges in the Appellate Court, it would appear that the essentials to found an estoppel as set forth in Greenwood v. Martins Bank[22], are not present in this case.\nThe respondent by its counterclaim asks judgment against the appellant either because he is an endorser or, alternatively, that it is a holder in due course of the cheque from the Canadian Bank of Commerce. When asked why he had put his name on the back of the cheque, appellant replied: \"Well, just, there are lots of cheques that I put my signature on the back of them, just as a matter of form.\" Even if the signature of the appellant so placed on the back of the cheque be deemed an endorsement under section 131 of the Bills of Exchange Act, his liability therefor is determined by section 133. That section provides that \"the endorser of a bill * * * engages that on due presentment it shall be accepted and paid according to its tenor.\" This being a cheque, the respondent's duty was to honour it by payment according to its tenor. Before it was ever received by the bank on January 9th, the appellant had instructed the bank to countermand payment. The bank at that time was under a duty to carry out his instructions. Even if, therefore, the appellant be regarded as an endorser, the respondent under these circumstances cannot succeed.\nThe respondent received the cheque, as already stated, upon the terms of its contractual relationship with its depositor and its relationship is determined on that basis, and it cannot under the circumstances claim as a holder in due course as against its principal-drawer.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs throughout and the judgment of the learned trial judge restored.\nRAND J. (dissenting)\u2014The facts of this controversy are not in dispute. The appellant Keyes drew a cheque for $2,000 dated at Calgary the 9th day of January, 1945, on the respondent, the Royal Bank, purporting to be payable to the order of a woman named J. I. Mundy. On January 8th, he presented this cheque, endorsed by himself, but not by the payee and unknown to her, together with a deposit slip in her name, signed by him, to the Canadian Bank of Commerce, with the request that the amount be deposited to the credit of her account, and this was done. On the same day, the cheque was certified by the Royal Bank. Early next morning the appellant appeared at the Royal Bank and countermanded payment; but the respondent, observing its acceptance of the cheque, declined to accept the countermand and debited his account on that day, following the usual clearing house settlement.\nThe money was intended to be advanced to Mrs. Mundy to enable her to purchase a business, and it may have been in Keyes' mind to countermand if the contemplated transaction did not go through. Later in the day of January 8th, Mrs. Mundy drew a cheque on her account for the $2,000 which was paid to her; but she did not proceed with the purchase.\nThe action was brought to recover the amount represented by the cheque from the Royal Bank on the ground that the acceptance before its date was unwarranted, and that the countermand was effective; and the trial court upheld this contention. A counterclaim on the footing that the Royal Bank was a holder for value was dismissed. On appeal, that judgment was reversed. Harvey, C.J.A., with whom Macdonald, J.A., concurred, took the view that by his conduct the appellant was estopped from denying that the effective date of the cheque was January 8th ; Ford, J.A., seems rather to put it on the ground that in the circumstances he had disabled himself from countermanding its payment; Parlee, J A., adds that the negotiation on the 8th of January justified the Royal Bank in certifying the cheque before the day on which it was to become payable.\nI do not find it necessary to deal with any of these grounds. It is unquestioned that, although the name shown as that of the payee was of the name of a known person, it was never intended by the drawer that Mrs. Mundy should be contractually related to the cheque, that is to say, that she should ever be a party to any legal right or obligation created by its transfer to the Bank of Commerce or any subsequent dealing with it: crediting her account with the proceeds was a matter dehors the cheque. The payee was therefore a fictitious person, and under section 21 of the Bills of Exchange Act the cheque may be treated as payable to bearer: Vagliano Brothers v. Bank of England[23]; and in any event, the appellant is estopped from denying that fictional existence. That a cheque can be negotiated before its date is unquestioned: Royal Bank of Scotland v. Tottenham[24]; Union Bank v. Tattersall[25]. The Bank of Commerce became, therefore, the holder of the cheque with an engagement on the part of Keyes at least as drawer; and that title was transferred to the respondent. Even treating the acceptance as equivalent to payment, the case would be within the language of Parke B. in Morley v. Culverwell[26] :\nE.R. 727.\nI am of opinion that nothing will discharge the acceptor or the drawer, except payment according to the law merchant\u2014that is, payment of the bill at maturity: if a party pays it before, he purchases it, and is in the same situation as if he had discounted it.\nAssuming, therefore, the countermand to have been effective, the Royal Bank is remitted to the rights of a transferee from the Bank of Commerce; and as no defence has been suggested available to the respondent on the original negotiation to the latter bank, or the withdrawal by Mrs. Mundy, the whole of the facts surrounding which are before the court, the counterclaim is well founded.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\n[1] [1946] 2 W.W.R. 187; [1946] 3 D.L.R. 179.\n[2] [1946] 1 W.W.R. 65; [1946] 2 D.L.R. 42.\n[3] (1776) Sel.

Held, Taschereau J. dissenting, that section 6 is wholly ultra vires the Legislative Assembly of the province of Saskatchewan. This enactment is legislation in relation to \u201cinterest\u201d and such legislation is within the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament under head 19 of section 91 of the British North America Act.\nPer Taschereau J. (dissenting): Provisions of section 6 were competently enacted by the Legislature. Legislation to relieve farmers of financial difficulties and to lighten the burdens resulting from the uncertainties of farming operations is legislation in relation to \u201cagriculture\u201d (s. 95 B.N.A. Act.)\u2014Also, the clauses contained in that section are dealing with the civil rights of the vendor or of the mortgagor is. 92 (13) B.N.A. Act)\u2014Moreover, in enacting the Act, \u2018the legislature was entering the field of contracts, and the legislature has power to insert in a private contract a statutory clause which affects the civil rights of one or both parties who contract, even\u2019 if the rights of the parties are modified or totally destroyed\u2014The Farm Security Act is therefore in pith and substance a law relating to agriculture and civil rights and its constitutionality cannot be successfully challenged merely because it may incidentally affect \u201cinterest\u2019\u2019.\nPer Taschereau J.\u2014But the Act, and specially section 8, must be construed as not affecting the Crown in right of the Dominion or any of its agencies holding mortgages in the Province.\nPer Taschereau J.\u2014The Provincial Legislature, in creating the Provincial Mediation Board, did not confer to it the powers of a court, thereby infringing upon the prerogatives of the Dominion. The Board does not fulfil \u201cjudicial\u201d or \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d but solely \u201cadministrative\u201d functions.\nREFERENCE by His Excellency the Governor General in Council to the Supreme Court of Canada in the exercise of the powers conferred by section 55 of the Supreme Court Act (R.S.C. 1927, c. 3f) of the questions contained in the Order in Council now recited:\n\u201cWhereas the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan at its second session in the calendar year 1944 enacted a statute entitled An Act for the Protection of certain Mortgagors, Purchasers and Lessees of Farm Land being Chapter 30 of the aforesaid second session and bearing the short title The Farm Security Act, 1944;\n\u201cAnd whereas section 6 of the said statute provides, amongst other things, for the automatic reduction, in the year of a crop failure, as defined, in the principal indebtedness of a mortgagor or purchaser by 4% or by the same percentage as that at which interest accrues on the principal debt whichever is the greater; \u201cAnd whereas section 6 aforesaid was amended by the Legislative Assembly at its session in the calendar year 1945 by Chapter 28 of the statutes of that session;\n\u201cAnd whereas questions have been raised as to whether the Legislative Assembly has legislative jurisdiction to enact the provisions of section 6 aforesaid as amended;\n\u201cAnd whereas questions have also been raised as to the operative effect of section 6 aforesaid in the case of mortgages\n(a) securing loans made by His Majesty in right of Canada either alone or jointly with any other person under the National Housing Act, 1944, or otherwise;\n(b) securing loans made by the Canadian Farm Loan Board;\n(c) assigned to the Central Mortgage and Housing: Corporation.\n\u201cAnd whereas the Minister of Justice is of opinion that the same are important questions of law touching the constitutionality and interpretation of this provincial legislation;\n\u201cTherefore, His Excellency the Governor General in Council, on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice, pursuant to the provisions of section 55 of the Supreme Court Act, is pleased to refer and doth hereby refer the following questions to the Supreme Court of Canada for hearing and consideration:\n1. \u201cIs section 6 of the Farm Security Act, 1944, being Chapter 30 of the Statutes of Saskatchewan 1944 (second session) as amended by section 2 of Chapter 28 of the Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1945, or any of the provisions thereof ultra vires of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan either in whole or in part and if so in what particular or particulars and to what extent?\u201d\n2. \u201cIf the said section 6 is not ultra vires, is it operative according to its terms in the case of mortgages\n(a) securing loans made by His Majesty in right of Canada either alone or jointly with any other person under the National Housing Act, 1944, or otherwise; (b) securing loans made by the Canadian Farm Loan Board; or\n(c) assigned to the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation.\u201d\n(Sgd.) A. D. P. Heeney,\nClerk of the Privy Council.\nJ. L. Ralston K.C. and D. W. Mundell for the Attorney-General for Canada.\nIves Pr\u00e9vost K.C. for the Attorney-General for Quebec.\nG. W. Mason K.C., M. C. Shumiatcher and R. S. Meldrum for the Attorney-General for Saskatchewan.\nH. J. Wilson K.C. for the Attorney-General for Alberta.\nC. F. Carson K.C. and L. S. Goodenough for The Dominion Mortgage and Investments Association.\nThe judgment of The Chief Justice and Kerwin J. was delivered by\nKerwin J.:\u2014The validity of section 6 of the Farm Security Act was attacked on several grounds and, on the other hand, its constitutionality was affirmed under various provisions of the British North America Act. One of the grounds of attack was that section 6 was in relation to interest, which is head 19 of section 91 of the B.N.A. Act, and that is the only point that I find it necessary to consider.\nIn the factum of counsel for the Attorney-General of Saskatchewan it is stated:\u2014\nThe pith and substance of the legislation is agricultural security and the reduction of unavoidable risks to individual farmers by a spreading of such risks as exist between both farmers and their creditors, and eventually perhaps, among the provincial population as a whole.\nIt may be taken that this is the object of the legislation but when one considers what the legislature is doing by subsection 2 of section 6 of the Act, which is the important provision, it seems plain that the pith and substance of the Act is interest. If, according to the other provisions, a mortgagor or a purchaser under an agreement of sale, of farm land in Saskatchewan, is able to realize, due to causes beyond his control, from the crops on the land a sum less than a sum equal to $6.00 per acre sown to grain in any one year on such land, then there is a crop failure within the meaning of the Act. If this event happens, the mortgage or agreement of sale is deemed to contain, the condition that (1) the mortgagor or purchaser shall, not be required to make any payment of principal during the period of suspension,\u2014which by definition means the period commencing August 1st in the year of a crop failure and ending on July 31st in the next succeeding year; (2) any principal falling due during the period of suspension and any principal which thereafter falls due shall become automatically postponed for one year; (3) the principal outstanding on the fifteenth day of September in the period of suspension shall on that date become automatically reduced by four per centum thereof or by the same percentage thereof as that at which interest will accrue immediately after the said date on the principal then outstanding, whichever percentage is the greater; provided that, notwithstanding such reduction, interest shall continue to be chargeable, payable and recoverable as if the principal had not been so reduced.\nAs to (3), it was stated and not denied that all mortgages, or agreements of sale of land in Saskatchewan, practically without exception, bear interest at a rate greater than four per centum per annum. The effect, therefore, of (3) is that while the mortgage or agreement will be reduced by the amount of interest for the period of suspension, according to the proviso, the same amount of interest shall continue to be paid as if the principal had not been so reduced. It is not important to resolve the dispute between counsel as to exactly how this third limb of the condition would operate in various cases but two things are clear. One is that the interest for the period of suspension is cancelled, and the other is that the same amount of interest is payable, thereby effecting in substance a payment of interest in the future at a rate higher than that agreed upon. Legislation reducing the rate of interest payable under a contract is legislation in relation to interest: Board of Trustees of Lethbridge Northern Irrigation District v. Independent Order of Foresters[1] and the legislation here in question is definitely in relation to interest.\nOnce that conclusion is reached, the decision in Ladore v. Bennett[2], so greatly relied on, can have no \u2018application. As was pointed out in the Lethbridge case1, the legislation in question in Ladore v. Bennett2 and also that in Day v. Victoria[3], was legislation in relation \u2018to a matter within section 92 of the B.N.A. Act, and any provisions with regard to interest were incidental. In the present case the provisions as to interest are the very warp and woof of the enactment. It is impossible to sever these from the remainder of the Act, and in my opinion, therefore, section 6 is wholly ultra vires the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan., This renders it unnecessary to answer the second question.\nTaschereau J.\u2014By an Order in Council of the 14th of May, 1946, being P.C. 1921, His Excellency the Governor General in Council referred to this Court for hearing and consideration, pursuant to the authority of section 55 of the Supreme Court Act, the following questions:\u2014\n1. In section 6 of The Farm Security Act, 1944, being chapter 30 of the statutes of Saskatchewan 1944 (second session) as amended by section 2 of chapter 28 of the statutes of Saskatchewan, 1945, or any of the provisions thereof ultra vires of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan either in whole or in part and if so in what particular or particulars and to what extent?\n2. If the said section 6 is not ultra vires, is it operative according to its terms in the case of mortgages\n(a) securing loans made by His Majesty in right of Canada either alone or jointly with any other person under The National Housing Act, 1944, or otherwise;\n(b) securing loans made by the Canadian Farm Loan Board; or\n(c) assigned to the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation.\nThe Attorney General of Canada and the Dominion Mortgage and Investment Association submitted that this section, which is not severable from the rest of the Act, is ultra vires of the powers of the province of Saskatchewan, while the Attorney General of Alberta supported the view of the Attorney General of Saskatchewan, that the legislation is within the powers of the province. The Attorney General of Quebec asked the Court to make certain reservations if the Act were declared ultra vires.\nThis Act is challenged on the ground that it deals with interest, bankruptcy and insolvency which are within the exclusive legislative jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament. It is also said that if the subject matter of section 6 were to be regarded as merely ancillary to legislation relating to Bankruptcy and Insolvency, the Provincial Legislature of Saskatchewan is nevertheless precluded from entering that field, because it is claimed that it is now occupied by the Dominion. It is further submitted that it is inconsistent with sections 96, 99 and 100 of the British North America Act, in that it confers the powers of a Court on a body not competently constituted to exercise such powers. As to question two, the contention of the Attorney General of Canada is that the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation and the Canadian Farm Loan Board are agents of the Crown, and that the mortgages they hold, being vested in the Crown, cannot be affected by Provincial Legislation.\nThe section of the Act which is challenged enacts that when there is in the Province a \u201ccrop failure\u201d, as defined in the Act, then, the mortgagor or the purchaser of a farm shall not be required to make any payment of principal to the mortgagee or to the vendor, during the period of \u201csuspension\u201d, and any principal outstanding on the 15th day of September, in the period of suspension, shall become automatically reduced by four per cent. but, interest shall continue to be chargeable, payable and recoverable, as if the principal had not been reduced. If the mortgagee and mortgagor or the vendor and purchaser do not agree as to whether or not there has been a \u201ccrop failure\u201d in any year, either party may apply to the Provincial Mediation Board appointed by the provincial authorities which, after hearing both parties, determines whether or not there has been a \u201ccrop failure\u201d in the year in question.\nIt is claimed by the Attorney General of Alberta that the Act is in pith and substance legislation in relation to farm security in the province, as it affects farmers and the farming industry, a subject well within the powers of the Provincial Legislation.\nUnder the B.N.A. Act, \u201cagriculture in the Province\u201d is a matter on which Provincial Legislation may competently be enacted. The unambiguous terms of section 95 can leave no doubt. It reads as follows:\n95. In each Province the Legislature may make laws in relation to Agriculture in the Province, and to Immigration into the Province; and, it is hereby declared that the Parliament of Canada may from Time to Time make laws in relation to Agriculture in all or any of the Provinces, and to Immigration into all or any of the Provinces; and any Law of the Legislature of a Province relative to Agriculture or to Immigration shall have effect in and for the Province as long and as far only as it is not repugnant to any Act of the Parliament of Canada.\nAgriculture is undoubtedly the main industry in Saskatchewan, and it is by far the principal source of revenue of its inhabitants. We have been told that from 1920 to 1943, the total estimated gross cash income to farmers of the province was $4,303,000,000 of which $3,006,000,000 was from wheat. This income is, of course, subject to wide fluctuations; and precipitation, pests, rust and weeds, and various other hazards of production, are variable factors which, to a very large extent, affect the revenues of the farmers. It has been submitted that the spreading of the risk more equitably between the mortgagor and mortgagee and between the vendor and the purchaser, in an effort to mitigate against these hardships, is a matter pertinent to the agricultural industry in Saskatchewan.\nThe word \u201cagriculture\u201d must be interpreted in its widest meaning, and ought not to be confined to such a narrow definition, that would allow the province to enact legislation, pertaining only, as Morrison J. said in Brooks v. Moore[4] \u201cto those things that grow and derive their substance from the soil.\u201d I am strongly of opinion that legislation to relieve the farmers of financial difficulties, to lighten the burdens resulting from the uncertainties of farming operations, is legislation in relation to agriculture.\nAs it has often been said, it is the true nature and character of the legislation that has to be found in order to ascertain the class of subject to which it belongs. (Russell v. The Queen,[5]; Gallagher v. Lyon[6]).\nThe same principle has also been reaffirmed by the Judicial Committee in Shannon et al v. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board, and the Attorney General for British Columbia)[7]. (Vide also Home Oil Distributors Limited and Attorney-General of British Columbia,[8]).\nI have reached the conclusion that this legislation, being a legislation enacted for the purpose of dealing with agricultural matters within the province of Saskatchewan, is legislation in pith and substance in relation to agriculture and that it was, therefore, competently enacted by the province of Saskatchewan.\nSection 95 of the B.N.A. Act gives also power to the Parliament of Canada to make laws in relation to agriculture in all or any of the provinces, and it is only when the laws enacted by the province are repugnant to any Act of the Parliament of Canada, that they cease to have effect in and for the province. Here, the subject matter covered by the Farm Security Act is the only of its kind, and no federal legislation having been enacted, it results that the field is clear and that this law cannot be repugnant to any federal legislation. In order to avoid any possibility of encroachment, it is stated in the law that section 6, which is the impeached one, shall not apply to a mortgagor or purchaser:\n(a) whose property is deemed to be under the authority of the court pursuant to subsection (1) of section 10 of The Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, 1943, (Canada);\n(b) whose affairs have been arranged by and are subject to a composition, extension of time or scheme of arrangement approved by the court or confirmed by the Board of Review under The Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, 1984, (Canada) or approved or confirmed by the court under The Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, 1943, (Canada); or\n(c) whose affairs have been so arranged and where the composition, extension of time or scheme of arrangement has been annulled pursuant to either of the said Acts.\nIt has been further submitted by the Attorney General of Saskatchewan that this legislation also relates to property and civil rights in the province, a subject within the competency of the Provincial Legislature. In its efforts to equalize the risks between the vendor and purchaser and the mortgagor and mortgagee in a period of crop failure, the Legislature has enacted that during such a period the purchaser or the mortgagor shall not be required to make any payment of principal to the mortgagee or to the vendor, and that during the period of suspension, the capital shall become automatically reduced by four per cent. These clauses, which are deemed to be incorporated in every agreement of sale notwithstanding anything to the contrary, unquestionably deal with the civil rights of the vendor or of the mortgagor.\nThe courts are not concerned with the wisdom of the legislation, but must apply the laws as they stand. In granting a period of suspension or a reduction of the principal of a civil debt, the Legislature of Saskatchewan legislates obviously on a civil subject matter which, under section 92 (13), is of a local and provincial nature. A civil debt is founded on some contract alleged to have taken place between the parties, or on some matter of fact from which the law would imply a contract between them If the debt is not paid, an action lies to enforce the claim, and as it is within the powers of the Provincial Legislature to authorize the necessary action for the enforcement of the claim, it is also well within the same powers to suspend, reduce or extinguish it entirely. On such matters, the sovereignty of the Provincial Legislature cannot be challenged.\nIn enacting the Farm Security Act, the Legislature of Saskatchewan was dealing with agreements of sale and mortgages, and therefore was entering the field of contracts. In Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parson[9], Sir Montague Smith said at page 110:\nThe words \u201ccivil rights and property\u201d are sufficiently large to embrace, in their fair and ordinary meaning, rights arising from contract, and such rights are not included in express terms in any of the enumerated classes of subjects in section 91.\nAnd at page 111, referring to the Quebec Act (14 Geo. III, chap. 83), he stated:\nIn this statute, the words \u201cproperty and civil rights\u201d are plainly used in their largest sense; and there is no reason for holding that in the statute under discussion (The B.N.A. Act) they are used in a different and narrower one. The well known \u201cinsurance cases\u201d may be referred to in connection with the interpretation which has been given to s.s. 13 of section 92. In Attorney General for Canada v. Attorney General for Alberta[10]; Attorney General for Ontario v. Reciprocal Insurers[11]; and In Re Insurance Act of Canada[12], the Judicial Committee dealt with the power of the Dominion Parliament to license and control the activities of the Insurance Companies. It was held that this type of legislation could not be supported under the Dominion law to legislate over \u201cTrade and Commerce\u201d, or \u201cCriminal Law\u201d, or under any other of the enumerated or residuary provisions of section 91, because the legislation remained directly related to civil contracts and trenched upon the provincial power to legislate over \u201cproperty and civil rights in the Province\u201d.\nI know of no authority which prevents the Legislature to insert in a private contract a statutory clause which affects the civil rights of one or both parties to the contract, even if the rights of the parties are modified or totally destroyed.\nIt has been submitted that section 6 invades the federal field and is, therefore, ultra vires of the powers of the province, because it contains a clause which is to the effect that during the suspension period or after the reduction in capital, as the case may be, the interest will continue to run as if no suspension or reduction in capital had been made.\nThe clause is as follows:\nNotwithstanding such reduction, interest shall continue to be chargeable, payable and recoverable as if the principal had not been so reduced.\nThere is no doubt that under section 91 of the British North America Act, subsection 19, \u201cinterest\u201d is a matter on which the Parliament of Canada only may properly legislate, and it is obviously in order to prevent any attack on that ground that the clause was inserted by the Legislature of Saskatchewan. But, with the clause as it stands, it is said that when the principal oustanding is automatically reduced, interest continues to be chargeable, payable and recoverable on a principal which is not existent. It results that there is an increased rate on the amount of principal actually outstanding.\nThe answer to this objection is, that the Act is in pith and substance a law relating to agriculture and civil lights, and, if interest is affected, it is only incidentally. The Act is not directed to interest. Its main purpose and object is to assist farmers in times of distress by redrafting a civil contract, as a result of which their losses, due to a fortuitous event or an act of God, are shared partly with their mortgagees or vendors. If, as a consequence of this legal intervention of the Provincial Legislature in the contractual relations between two individuals, interest is incidentally affected, it remains nevertheless that the law is valid and not impeachable.\nI think that this point has been definitely settled since the judgment of the Privy Council in Ladore v. Bennett[13]. In that case, several municipalities of Ontario had failed to meet their debentures or interests, and were amalgamated together. The Ontario Municipal Board accepted a scheme which had been formulated for funding and refunding the debts of the amalgamated municipalities, under which former creditors of the old independent municipalities, received debentures of the new city of equal nominal amount to those formerly held, but with the interest scaled down in various classes of debentures. It was argued that the relevant statutes adopted by the Ontario Legislature were ultra vires because they invaded the field of \u201cinterest\u201d. It was held by the Judicial Committee that the pith and substance of the Ontario Acts were in relation to \u201cmunicipal institutions in the Province\u201d and that interest was affected only incidentally. The Acts were held valid.\nIn 1938, the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in Day v. City of Victoria[14], had reached a similar conclusion, and in the Lethbridge case[15], the Day v. Victoria case14 was approved by the Privy Council.\nIn the Lethbridge case15, it was held that the legislations adopted by the Provincial Government of Alberta, which purported to reduce by one-half the interest on certain securities guaranteed by the province, and the interest payable on securities issued by the province, were ultra vires of the powers of the province of Alberta; it was held that these legislations were in pith and substance in relation to interest. Their sole object was to reduce the rate. But, the principles enunciated in Ladore v. Bennett[16], were reaffirmed, and it is for the sole reason given above that the acts were declared to be without the powers, of the Provincial Legislature.\nHaving come to the conclusion that the Act which is. now under attack is in pith and substance and that its true character is in relation to agriculture, it naturally follows that its constitutionality cannot be successfully challenged merely because it may incidentally affect interest.\nIt has also been submitted that the Act is invalid because it invades the fields of \u201cbankruptcy or insolvency\u201d within the meaning of head 21 of section 91 of the B.N.A. Act. The short answer to this contention is that the Act does not even deal incidentally with insolvency or bankruptcy, if the meaning of these terms are properly understood. Its purpose is not, when there is a crop failure, to make a final distribution of the assets of the mortgagor or of the purchaser in the general interest of the creditors, or to make a compromise of any kind which would have the characteristics of bankruptcy or insolvency. Independently of the solvency or insolvency of the mortgagor or purchaser the Act merely purports to deal with a civil debt. It is the participation between two private individuals in a loss, which otherwise would be the sole burden of the mortgagor or purchaser, which lies at the very root of this legislation. (Union St-Joseph v. Belisle, (2)[17]; Attorney General of Ontario v. Attorney General of Canada,[18]).\nWith further contention that the impugned legislation confers the powers of a court not competently constituted to exercise such powers, cannot I think, be accepted. The only function of the Board is merely to decide whether there has been or not a crop failure, and if it is found that such a condition exists, the rights and obligations of the parties then arise from the statute itself. No declaration of the rights of the parties is made by the Board, and I am therefore quite satisfied that it does not fulfil \u201cjudicial\u201d or \u201cquasi judicial\u201d functions. (Shell Co. of Australia v. Federal Commissioners of Taxation,[19]; Haddart Parker & Co. v. Moorehead,[20]).\nI may also refer to the case of The Attorney General of Quebec v. Slamac & Grimstead et al,[21] in which the constitutionality of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of Quebec was attacked. It was alleged that this Act was unconstitutional, ultra vires and void because it made the Commission a real tribunal conferring upon it a civil jurisdiction belonging to Superior and County Court judges of each province. The court of appeal of the province of Quebec held that the functions of the Commissioners were administrative and not judicial.\nThe Board must of course act \u201cjudicially\u201d in the sense that it must act fairly and impartially, but this does not mean that its members are anything more than mere administrative officers in the performance of their duties. (Saint-John v. Fraser,[22]).\nThe second question submitted and which has now to be determined is the following:\n(2) If the said section 6 is not ultra vires, is it operative according to its terms in the case of mortgages\n(a) securing loans made by His Majesty in right of Canada either alone or jointly with any other person under The National Housing Act, 1944, or otherwise;\n(b) securing loans made by The Canadian Farm Loan Board, or\n(c) assigned to The Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation.\nThe Farm Security Act contains clause 8 which reads as follows:\n8. This Act shall affect the rights of the Crown as mortgagee, vendor or lessor.\nHaving come to the conclusion that the Act itself is intra vires of the powers of the Legislature of Saskatchewan, it is now necessary to examine if the Act is operative as to what has been called the Federal Crown holding mortgagee in the province. A negative answer to this question would of course not make the Act ultra vires, but it would merely mean that section 8 should be construed as not affecting the Dominion Crown or its agencies.\n\u201cIt is true that there is only one Crown\u201d, but as Viscount Dunedin added in In re Silver Bros. Ltd.,[23]\nas regards Crown revenues and Crown property, by legislation assented to by the Crown there is a distinction made between the revenues and property in the Province, and the revenues and property in the Dominion. There are two statutory purses.\nIn Gauthier v. The King,[24] Anglin J. as he then was, dealt with the matter as to whether or not the Crown in right of the Dominion was bound by a reference to the Crown in a provincial statute, and the then Chief Justice Sir Charles Fitzpatrick said at page 182 of the same case:\nI agree with Anglin J. that the provincial Act, read as a whole, cannot be interpreted as applicable, for the reasons he gives, to bind the Dominion Crown.\nAnd, in any event, the provinces have, in my opinion, neither executive, legislative nor judicial power to bind the Dominion Government. Provincial statutes which were in existence at the time when the Dominion accepted a liability form part of the law of the province by reference to which the Dominion has consented that such liability shall be ascertained and regulated, but any statutory modification of such law can only be enacted by Parliament in order to bind the Dominion Government. That this may occasionally be productive of inconvenient results is one of the inevitable consequences of a divided authority inherent in every federal system such as provided by the constitution of this country.\nOn the same matter see also Burrard Power Company v. The King[25].\nThe principles enunciated in these cases are, I believe, applicable here, and I have to come to the conclusion that the Act must be read as not affecting the Crown in right of the Dominion, or any of its agencies holding mortgages in the province.\nFor the above reasons, I would answer both interrogatories in the negative.\nThere should be no cost to either party. Rand J. The questions submitted to us by His Excellency in Council are these:\n1. Is section 6 of the Farm Security Act, 1944, being Chapter 30 of the Statutes of Saskatchewan 1944 (second session) as amended by section 2 of Chapter 28 of the Statutes of Saskatchewan, 1945, or any of the provisions thereof, ultra vires of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan either in whole or in part and if so in what particular or particulars and to what extent?\n2. If the said section 6 is not ultra vires, is it operative according to its terms in the case of mortgages\n(a) securing loans made by His Majesty in right of Canada either alone or jointly with any other person under the National Housing Act, 1944, or othewise,\n(b) securing loans made by the Canadian Farm Loan Board, or\n(c) assigned to the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation?\nThe clauses of section 6, as amended, pertinent to the conclusion at which I have arrived, are as follows:\n6. (1.) In this section the expression:\n1. \u201cagreement of sale\u201d or \u201cmortgage\u201d means an agreement for sale or mortgage of farm land heretofore or hereafter made or given, and includes an agreement heretofore or hereafter made renewing or extending such agreement of sale or mortgage;\n2. \u201ccrop failure\u201d means failure of grain crops grown in any year on mortgaged land or on land sold under agreement of sale, due to causes beyond the control of the mortgagor or purchaser, to the extent that the sum realizable from the said crops is less than a sum equal to six dollars per acre sown to grain in such year on such land;\n* * *\n5. \u201cpayment\u201d includes payment by delivery of a share of crops;\n* * *\n(2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, every mortgage and every agreement of sale shall be deemed to contain a condition that, in -case of crop failure in any year and by reason only of such crop failure:\n1. the mortgagor or purchaser shall not be required to make any payment of principal to the mortgagee or vendor during the period of suspension;\n2. payment of any principal which falls due during the period of suspension and of any principal which thereafter falls due under the mortgage or agreement of sale shall become automatically postponed for one year;\n3. the principal outstanding on the fifteenth day of September in \u2018the period of suspension shall on that date become automatically reduced by four per cent, thereof or by the same percentage thereof as that at which interest will accrue immediately after the said date on the principal then outstanding, whichever percentage is the greater; provided that, notwithstanding such reduction, interest shall continue to be chargeable, payable and recoverable as if the principal had not been so reduced. (Sub-section (2) shall be deemed to have been in force on and from the thirtieth day of December, 1944. See amending act Chap. 28, Acts of 1945, Section 2 (3)).\n* * *\n(7) This section shall not apply to a mortgagor or purchaser:\n(a) whose property is deemed to be under the authority of the court pursuant to sub-section (1) of section 10 of The Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, 1943, (Canada);\n(b) whose affairs have been arranged by and are subject to a composition, extension of time or scheme of arrangement approved by the court or confirmed by the Board of Review under The Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, 1934, (Canada) or approved or confirmed by the court under The Farmers\u2019 Creditors Arrangement Act, 1943, (Canada); or\n(c) whose affairs have been so arranged and where the composition, extension of time or scheme or arrangement has been annulled pursuant to either of the said Acts.\n(8) The Provincial Mediation Board may by order exclude from the operation of this section any mortgage or agreement of sale or agreements of sale and in case of such exclusion this section shall not apply to the excluded mortgage or agreement of sale or class of mortgages or agreements of sale.\nThe definition of \u201ccrop failure\u201d is embarrassed by the use of the words \u201cto the extent that the sum realizable * * * is less than a sum equal to six dollars per acre\u201d; they have been assumed to provide that any return less than six dollars an acre constitutes a failure, and this I take to be the case, although they would ordinarily signify something relative. I take the section, also, not to apply to a mortgage or contract which does not in some form carry interest.\nThe clause around which the controversy hinges is (3) and I find some difficulty in its precise interpretation. Apart from the proviso, its effect would be an immediate and actual percentage reduction on September 15th of the principal sum and the accrual of interest on the balance at the rate stipulated to apply in the circumstances of the day next following. But the proviso forces a modification of that simple result. If interest is to be charged \u201cas if the principal had not been\u201d reduced, either the same factors in the computation were intended to continue to be used, or the amount of interest to be maintained. In the latter case, treating the principal as actually reduced, the rate must vary with the deduction, and is to be that \u201cat which interest will accrue immediately after the Said date (September 15)\u201d. On the present assumption, this, although mathematically possible, would involve calculating a decimal factor from what except to mathematicians would be a complicated equation on each ascertainment. To avoid that practical objection, some other rate would appear to be intended and, as counsel for Saskatchewan assumed, we return to the rate stipulated in the contract applied to the whole, i.e. the constructive principal. But this meets a further obstacle. No time is specified at which the charging of interest on the statutory reduction is to cease and if the interest is charged \u201cas if the principal had not been so reduced\u201d, without a limitation implied it must continue payable in perpetuity. The appropriation of the reduction does not appear to be made to any particular part of the principal, and in the case of instalment payments many questions would arise. Conceivably the provision is not to affect the contract of interest up to the date of maturity; but a very few contracts for interest are limited to that point of time. Difficulties likewise would be encountered by special terms of the interest contract such as, for instance, that it should run until all of the principal money has been repaid and not merely until the obligation as to principal should be discharged. Assuming interest to accrue until the reduced balance has been paid, is the total principal then deemed discharged? That would in effect suspend the application of the deduction until the final payment of the remaining principal and would terminate the contract of interest on the discharge of the obligation for principal.\nInterest is, in general terms, the return or consideration or compensation for the use or retention by one person of a sum of money, belonging to, in a colloquial sense, or owed to, another. There may be other essential characteristics but they are not material here. The relation of the obligation to pay interest to that of the principal sum has been dealt with in a number of cases including: Economic Life Assur. Society v. Usborne[26] and of Duff J. in Union Investment Co. v. Wells[27]; from which it is clear that the former, depending on its terms, may be independent of the latter, or that both may be integral parts of a single obligation or that interest may be merely accessory to principal.\nBut the definition, as well as the obligation, assumes that interest is referrable to a principal in money or an obligation to pay money. Without that relational structure in fact and whatever the basis of calculating or determining the amount, no obligation to pay money or property can be deemed an obligation to pay interest.\nApart then from the difficulties presented in a plan for the payment of interest and principal to which section 6 of the Interest Act would apply, and to cases where by special stipulation interest becomes more than merely an accessory to principal, and whatever else may be intended, the indisputable effect of section 6 must be taken to be a reduction of the principal and the maintenance of the quantum of interest as if that deduction had not been made. That effect cannot here be overborne by any play with the words of inconsistent conceptions; we are bound to treat the statutory language as language of reality, and as carrying its plain and unequivocal meaning. On this view, and, assuming for practical purposes what seems to be implied by section 2 of the Interest Act, that interest involves a \u201crate\u201d relationship to the principal, the statute works a change of rate as the principal is diminished, which, in the Crowd\u2019s contention, is legislation in relation to interest, a field of civil rights committed exclusively to the Dominion.\nMr. Mason argues that the enactment is designed to promote the stability of agriculture and is valid under section 95 of the Confederation Act. The immediate operation of the statute is put on the theory of the prevention of the annual growth of certain debts where crop failure prevents the parallel growth of the wealth out of which economically and generally it is said they are contemplated to be paid, accomplished by extending to the creditor the risk of that failure now borne alone by the debtor; but viewed most favourably to the provincial contention, the statute only in a most limited manner embodies that conception. It is confined to creditors who have security for debt on land and it assumes that in substance it is only to that land and its fruits they look for payment, and that the fortunes of the debt should be deemed wrapped up in the fortunes of its security. It does not apply to farmers who have availed themselves of the benefits of the Farmers\u2019 Arrangements Acts of the Dominion, although why on the theory advanced they should be denied its benefit is difficult to see. Then clause 8, by giving the Mediation Board power to exclude a contract or class of contracts, and having regard to clause 7, enables the benefit of the section to be overborne by economic or even ethical considerations quite incompatible with the notion of a debt contractually conditioned in a genuine risk; and whatever the legislature may have had in mind, the section invests the Board with a power to restrict its application to any condition or to any class of debtors whatever.\nThe conclusion of the argument is that with such a purpose in view, the effect on the contract of interest is incidental to legislation valid under the principle of the decision of the Judicial Committee in Ladore v. Bennett[28]. The ratio decidendi of that case rested on the provincial power to create and dissolve municipal organizations for local government, including the delimitation of their capacity to incur liability; and the view that contracts with these bodies stipulating for interest are made subject to that power; legislation dealing in substance with such institutions might therefore incidentally affect contracts of interest.\nThe general interest of agriculture may be advanced by many legislative means, some within the jurisdiction of the Dominion and some within that of the Province; but not all legislation which in its ultimate results may benefit agriculture is for that reason alone legislation within section 95. There is obviously a distinction between legislation \u201cin relation\u201d to agriculture and legislation which may produce a favourable effect upon the strength and stability of that industry: between consequential effects and legislation operation. But beyond any doubt, the field of that section does not include that of Interest in a substantive aspect, and in each case the question remains, what is the real nature and character, the pith and substance of the enactment? If it is in the strict sense legislation within section 95, then incidentally it may affect other areas of jurisdiction, the operation of which may depend on the impact on the underlying matter of legislation in relation to agriculture; but where that is not the case, the means employed to bring about the benefit intended must not be such as are forbidden to the provincial jurisdiction.\nWhat is done by section 6, notwithstanding that it is confined to farm lands, is strictly a modification of civil rights: that is the substance of the section: any benefit to agriculture hoped for or contemplated would be a resulting tendency to hold farmers to the land and its cultivation. But the alteration of the contract involves, as an inseverable part of its substance, legislation in relation to interest, and it is, because of that, ultra vires; Board of Trustees of Lethbridge v. Independent Order of Foresters[29]. In this respect lies its distinction in principle from Ladore v. Bennett[30]. Whether the purported dealing with principal is in these circumstances and in particular the use of the interest rate, a colourable device to nullify the accrual of interest, I do not find it necessary to decide.\nIt was suggested, though not seriously urged as a material consideration, that there might be contracts providing for crop payments not related to money with \u201cinterest\u201d accruing in the same form, to which the section would apply. If there are such contracts, on the material before us they are in number insignificant; and assuming that the \u201crate\u201d of reduction is not incompatible with their terms, and that \u201cinterest\u201d under the Act of 1867 would apply to such an increment of price, the clear intention of the section that the entire group should be dealt with as one does not permit us to say that one class of contract would have been the subject of legislation without the other, and any question of severability is excluded.\nThen it was argued that the untrammelled scope of discretionary action given by section 8 indicates conclusively that the power was furnished as a means for assisting insolvent debtors by a compulsory reduction of debts, and doubtless the power could be used as a sub-legislative control for such an application of the section. It was also contended that the legislation interfered with the status and powers of bodies incorporated under Dominion law; that the Mediation Board in determining the fact of crop failure upon which the specific terms of the statute declared to be annexed to every mortgage and contract became operative was, in so doing, exercising jurisdiction that brought it within section 96 of the Confederation Act and its finding therefore a nullity; and finally, that in any event the statute could not apply to debts arising from loans made by the Dominion Crown either solely or jointly with others under the National Housing Act, 1944, or to loans made by the Canadian Farm Loan Board or assigned to the Central Mortgage & Housing Corporation. To these points, because of the conclusion to which I have come, I do not find it necessary to address myself.\nMy answer to the first question is therefore that section 6 of the Farm Security Act, 1944 is wholly ultra vires. This dispenses with an answer to the second question.\nKellock J.\u2014Argument against the validity of the legislation was submitted to us by counsel on behalf of the Attorney-General of Canada on the following grounds, namely, that it was (a) in relation to interest; (b) in relation to bankruptcy and insolvency; and (c) inconsistent with sections 96, 99 and 100 of the British North America Act, in that it confers powers of a court on a body not competently constituted to exercise such power. Counsel on behalf of the Dominion Mortgage and Investments Association supported these contentions and also urged objection on the further grounds that the legislation impairs the status and essential capacities of companies incorporated by the Dominion and that it provides for delegation of legislative powers and functions by the provincial legislature to the Mediation Board which is unauthorized under the British North America Act. Both counsel submit that even if some part, or parts, of the section is valid, such parts are not capable of severance. On behalf of the Attorney-General of Saskatchewan the legislation was supported under (a) section 95, agriculture in the province; (b) section 92, (13) Property and Civil Rights in the province; and (c) section 92 (16) matter of a local or private nature in the province. Counsel for the Attorneys-General of Quebec and Alberta also supported the validity of the legislation, counsel for the last mentioned basing his submissions on the additional ground of section 92 (14)\u2014administration of justice in the province.\nAs has been so often said, it is necessary in an inquiry of this sort to ascertain the pith and substance or the true nature and character of the enactment in question; Attorney-General for Ontario v. Reciprocal Insurers[31] The next step in a case of difficulty is to examine the effect of the legislation. A closely similar matter which calls for attention is the object or purpose of the legislation; Attorney-General for Alberta v. Attorney-General for Canada[32]. See also Attorney-General for Manitoba v. Attorney-General for Canada[33]. I therefore leave out of consideration the 4 per cent rate specifically mentioned in the statute as it was made perfectly plain before us that as things stand no such rate is currently operative and has not been for some time.\nIn support of the submission that the section trenches upon the federal jurisdiction, with regard to interest, counsel directed argument principally to paragraph 3 of subsection (2). This paragraph enacts (1) that the principal outstanding on September 15th in a period of suspension shall be automatically reduced by the percentage there described; and (2) that notwithstanding such reduction, interest shall continue to be \u201cchargeable, payable and recoverable\u201d as if the principal had not been so reduced.\nIf, according to the plain language of the sub-section, the principal outstanding is automatically reduced, it follows that interest ceases to accrue thereafter on the amount of the reduction. There can be no such thing as interest on principal which is non-existent. As by the proviso it is enacted that interest shall continue to be \u201cchargeable, payable and recoverable\u201d, (language to be found in the Interest Act, R.S.C., chap. 102) as if the principal had not been so reduced, such a provision therefore can operate in no other way than as an increased rate on the amount of principal actually outstanding, so that the same amount of money in respect of interest will be produced after as before the reduction. This is in fact recognized by the Attorney-General of Saskatchewan in his submission that the amount required to pay off a mortgage after the statutory reduction has taken place is the amount of the reduced principal, together with an amount for interest equal to the amount which would have been earned had there been no reduction in principal. Such a result can be reached only on the basis that it is the principal in fact outstanding which bears interest at the higher rate, for otherwise if the proviso could be construed as continuing to attach interest to the amount of the statutory reduction, interest hereon would never cease to accrue and its running could only be put an end to by actual payment in money of the amount of the \u201creduction\u201d. Such a construction would render the legislation completely nugatory and it is not to be considered that the legislature had in mind any such result.\nThe submission of the Attorney-General is thus put in his factum:\nThe amount required to pay a mortgage or indebtedness under an agreement for sale is the full amount of the interest owing to the date of payment, having no regard to the provisions of paragraph 3 of section 6 (2), together with the full amount of the principal, less the deduction provided for in that paragraph. The amount of the deduction is determined by the following formula: A deduction is made from the principal with respect to each crop failure year occurring in the year 1944 and in every subsequent year, consisting of a percentage of the principal outstanding on September 15th of each crap failure year (after taking into account previous deductions), which is either four per cent or the same percentage as the rate of interest stipulated in the mortgage or agreement, whichever is greater.\nIn my opinion the above submission does not pay sufficient regard to the language of the statute. The statute does not say that the reduction of principal is to be at the contract rate. It provides that the reduction is to be by the same percentage\nas that at which interest will accrue immediately after the said date on the principal then outstanding\nIn other words, as the rate of interest which the principal outstanding must earn is increased that increased rate is the rate by which the reduction is governed and not the contract rate. This necessitates a somewhat difficult and cumbersome calculation but the statute so provides.\nThe effect of the statute will be found to be that it wipes out an amount of debt somewhat larger than the annual interest, while professing not to interfere with the amount of the interest. Whether or not this is to do indirectly what may not be done directly need not be considered. The statute in fact effects an increase in the rate of interest which, in my opinion, is beyond the power of the legislature of the province to do. While the matter of conditions in contracts within the province is no doubt a matter for the provincial legislature: Citizens Insurance Company v. Parsons[34]; Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board v. Canadian Pacific Railway Company[35], contractual interest is the subject matter of exclusive Dominion legislative power under section 91 (19) of the British North America Act; the Lethbridge case[36].\nIn my opinion the legislation here in question is not in its pith and substance legislation within section 95 as being with relation to agriculture nor within any of the heads of section 92 but is legislation with relation to interest and governed by the principle of the above decision. To quote from the judgment of Viscount Caldecote L.C.36:\nIn so far as the Act in question deals with matters assigned under any of these heads to the Provincial Legislatures, it still remains true to say that the pith and substance of the Act deals directly with \u201cinterest\u201d and only incidentally or indirectly with any of the classes of subjects enumerated in Section 92. Even if it could be said that the Act relates to classes of subjects in Section 92, as well as to one of the classes in Section 91, this would not avail the appellants to protect the Provincial Act against the Interest Act of 1927, passed by the Dominion Parliament, the validity of which, in the view of their Lordships, is unquestionable. Section 2 of the Interest Act is as follows: \u201cexcept as otherwise provided by this or by any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, any person may stipulate for, allow and exact, on any (contract or agreement whatsoever, any rate of interest or discount which is agreed upon * * *\u201d Dominion legislation properly enacted under Section 91 and already in the field must pravail in territory common to the two parliaments.\nThis language is in my opinion equally appropriate in the case at bar.\nReliance was placed by counsel supporting the legislation upon the decision of the Privy Council in Ladore v. Bennett[37], and that of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in Day v. Victoria[38], approved of in the Lethbridge case[39]. I would distinguish both these decisions. They are dealt with in the Lethbridge case39 at pages 532 and 533, where it is pointed out that the legislation in question in each case was legislation in relation to a matter within section 92, while any provisions with regard to interest were incidental.\nThe jurisdiction allocated to Parliament under any of the heads of section 91 is \u201cnotwithstanding anything in this Act\u201d. I cannot think that because the particular contracts here in question are limited to those affecting farm lands this renders the legislation in its true nature and character any the less legislation with relation to interest or not in conflict with the provisions of section 2 of the Interest Act.\nAs already mentioned, while the direct attack upon the section upon the ground mentioned was limited to paragraph three, it was contended that if that paragraph were ultra vires then the whole section must fall to the ground as it could not be severed, even assuming that the remainder of the section were valid. In my opinion this contention is well taken. The provisions of section 6, in my opinion, constitute a code by which upon the happening of the event there described all the provisions of subsection (2) come into play. I do not think it can be presumed that the legislature intended to enact the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of the sub-section without that included in paragraph 3. It is not therefore necessary to consider any of the other objections urged against the legislation. I would answer question 1 as follows: \u201cSection 6 is ultra vires as a whole.\u201d It is therefore not necessary to answer the second question.\nSolicitor for the Attorney-General for Canada: F.

MacLeod and the said Silver Glade Roller Bowl (Defendants) Appellants;\nand\nDoris Roe (Plaintiff) Respondent\n1947: February 4; 1947: May 13.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Kerwin, Rand, Kellock and Estey JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OF ALBERTA, APPELLATE DIVISION\nNegligence\u2014Person, while skating on roller skating rink, injured by fail caused by skate coming off\u2014Claim for damages against operator of rink\u2014Skates rented from operator and attached by his employee\u2014 Negligence alleged because toe straps not used in attaching skates\u2014 Extent of operator's duty\u2014Sufficient that he acted in accord with general and approved practice. Defendant operated a roller skating rink. Plaintiff rented from him, and was fitted by his employee with, a pair of roller skates. After about an hour of skating, a skate came off, causing plaintiff to fall and be injured. She sued defendant for damages. She recovered judgment at trial, [1946] 2 W.W.R. 482, on the finding that the skate came off because of negligence in defendant's employee in not using a toe strap to attach it securely to her shoe. That judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Division, Alta., [1946] 3 W.W.R. 522. Defendant appealed, to this Court.\nThe evidence was (as found in this Court) that the skates kept and supplied by defendant were the product of a well known manufacturer, were standard in the roller skating amusement business, were regularly examined by competent employees of defendant, that the skate in question was examined immediately after the accident and found to be in perfect condition; that the usual method of attaching the skates to the shoes was adopted in this case; that the use of toe straps was not a standard method; defendant supplied toe straps on deposit of 10 cents, which was repaid on return of the straps, and a notice to that effect was above defendant's ticket window.\nHeld: Defendant's appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed.\nPer the Chief Justice and Kerwin and Estey JJ.: Even if by the use of toe straps the skates might (according to certain evidence) have been made safer for skating, it was sufficient for defendant to show, as was done, \"that he had acted in accord with general and approved practice\" (Vancouver General Hospital v. McDaniel, 152 L.T. 56, at 57-58). (Per Estey J.: In the absence of express provisions in the contract of hiring, the law implied an obligation on defendant to provide skates that at the time of hiring were reasonably safe for the purpose of skating. The fact that defendant made toe straps available did not establish that they were necessary in order to ensure reasonable safety in skating where the shoes, as here, were well adapted for that purpose, and, therefore, did not establish an obligation on defendant to supply them to all patrons; to require toe straps in addition to standard equipment would impose on defendant a greater obligation or a higher standard of care than that which the contract of hiring imposed).\nPer Rand and Kellock JJ.: In furnishing and fastening the skates, defendant did not undertake that under no circumstances would they become loose or come off; the obligation assumed, at its highest, did not go beyond furnishing and attaching skates which could be used with reasonable safety if ordinary and usual skill and care were exercised by the skater. There was no evidence that, either in the general experience of roller skating or in the opinion of persons who had closely observed its practice, the absence of toe straps rendered the skates less than reasonably safe for use. Further, assuming a duty to have toe straps used or offered for use, there was no evidence that defendant was responsible for their absence; the question was, not whether plaintiff knew that they could be obtained, but rather, did defendant take reasonable steps to bring the fact of their availability to his patrons' notice; and, considering the necessary mode of carrying on such a business, he had done so. Moreover, there was nothing to make it appear that plaintiff, under any circumstances, would have used toe straps; and the finding at trial in effect required defendant to include them as part of the primary equipment; but the only evidence bearing on that was against that conclusion; the skates were complete without toe straps, for which in fact they were not designed, and the wide general use of the skates without them was, in the record of this case, convincing evidence that they were not necessary to any safety in use which a patron had a right to look for.\nAPPEAL by the defendants from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta[1] which (Ford J.A. dissenting) affirmed the judgment of O'Connor J. at trial[2] in favour of the plaintiff for damages for injury suffered by her when she fell while skating on the defendants' roller skating rink. The trial judge found that she fell and was injured because one of her skates came off, and that that happened because of negligence of the defendants' employee, who fitted her with the skates, in not using a toe strap to attach securely the skate to her shoe.\nThe plaintiff cross-appealed, to the Appellate Division (which dismissed the cross-appeal) and to this Court, for an increase in the amount of general damages awarded.\nS. Bruce Smith K.C. for the appellants.\nSydney Wood K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin J. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014On Sunday, February 4th, 1945, the respondent, Doris Roe, was roller skating in a rink operated by the appellant, Austin MacLeod, carrying on business under the name of the Silver Glade Roller Bowl, in the city of Edmonton. One of her skates became loose, causing her to fall. Her action to recover damages occasioned by this fall was upheld by the trial judge, Mr. Justice O'Connor, and, on appeal, by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, with Mr. Justice Ford dissenting.\nThe facts fall within a narrow compass. The respondent had attended the appellant's rink a number of times previous to the occasion in question but was still a novice at roller skating. On Sunday evenings the respondent charged no admission fee but rented roller skates for twenty-five cents to those who desired them, and they were thereupon at liberty to make use of the rink. The respondent paid the required fee, and a pair of roller skates, suitable to the size of her shoes, were handed to her and were put on by one of the skate boys employed by the appellant. The skates thus supplied, together with the other skates kept by the appellant, are the product of a well-known manufacturer and are known as Chicago skates. The evidence is clear that these skates are standard in the roller skating amusement business, and that the usual method of attaching the skates to the shoes was adopted in connection with the respondent. William A. Magark, who has had considerable experience in and around roller skating rinks and who, on the night in question, was floor manager for the appellant, so testified, and his evidence was uncontradicted. The sole of the shoe is placed on a flat piece of the metal part of the skate and a clamp at either side is securely fastened and tightened by means of a worm screw. The heel fits snuggly into the back of the skate and is held in position by a leather strap attached to the skate and running through either the first or second crossing of the shoe lace.\nWhile other questions were investigated at the trial, the only fault found by the trial judge and the Court of Appeal against the appellant is that while the usual method was adopted in connection with the respondent, a strap should have been used to hold the toes of each foot tightly against the skate. Toe straps were at one time used by the appellant but, as it was found that many school children took the straps, the practice was adopted of charging ten cents as a deposit for each pair, which deposit would be repaid upon the return of the straps. The use of toe straps is not a standard method. The evidence is that all of the appellant's skates were regularly examined by competent employees of the appellant and that the skates furnished the respondent were examined immediately after the accident and found to be in perfect condition. The skates not being defective, the appellant cannot be made liable for the injuries suffered by the respondent even if, according to the evidence of George Wade, called on behalf of the respondent, they might have been made safer for roller skating. To use the words of Lord Alness, speaking for the Judicial Committee, in Vancouver General Hospital v. McDaniel[3]: \"A defendant charged with negligence can clear his feet if he shows that he has acted in accord with general and approved practice.\" This principle was adopted by this Court in a case from the province of Quebec: The London & Lancashire Guarantee & Accident Company of Canada v. La Compagnie F. X. Drolet[4].\nThe appeal should be allowed and the action dismissed with costs throughout. The cross-appeal of the respondent as to the quantum of damages should be dismissed without costs.\nThe judgment of Rand and Kellock JJ., was delivered by\nRAND J.\u2014The essential question here is, what did the appellant undertake in furnishing the skates and fastening them to the respondent's shoes? Certainly not that under no circumstances would they become loose or come off; that possibility is too intimately bound up with their use, in which the state or quality of the shoes, combined with the manner in which they are used, depending again upon the skater, might all play a part in loosening them.\nI do not think the obligation assumed, at its highest, goes beyond furnishing and attaching skates which can be used with reasonable safety if ordinary and usual skill and care are exercised by the skater; that the management will do for a reasonably careful patron what that patron would do, and in the rink here has the privilege of doing and in some cases does, in the way of equipping himself with skates. Admittedly those furnished are and for years have been standard throughout the United States and Canada and no negligence in screwing down the clamps is suggested.\nBut O'Connor J., at trial, held that, in addition to the clamps and as a reasonably necessary safeguard, straps should have been used or should have been offered to the respondent. To this I think there are two answers: there was no evidence that, either in the general experience of roller skating or in the opinion of persons who have closely observed its practice, the absence of straps rendered these skates less than reasonably safe for use; nor, assuming such a duty, was there evidence that the appellant was responsible for that absence. Right above the ticket window was a notice that straps were available on the deposit of 10 cents, and they were used by a few skaters. The question is not whether this young woman of 23 years of age actually knew or did not know that straps could be obtained; the question is, did the management of the rink take reasonable steps to bring the fact of their availability to the notice of its patrons; and, considering the necessary mode of carrying on a business of this nature, which has not only a financial interest to the proprietor, but meets the wholesome desires of a large proportion of young people of the community, I should say that it had clearly discharged that duty. There is, moreover, nothing whatever to make it appear that the respondent, under any circumstances, would have used straps, and the finding in effect requires the management to include them as part of the primary equipment. But the only evidence bearing on this is against that conclusion. The skates are complete without straps, for which, in fact, they are not designed, and nowhere in the United States or Canada are straps used more than occasionally or otherwise than as a special safeguard. So far as the evidence shows, they might be considered to bind the feet or otherwise lessen the freedom of skating; the fact that the almost universal use of the skates is without them is, in the record of this case, convincing evidence that they are not necessary to any safety in use which the patron has a right to look for. I think in the circumstances we must accept the standard so established rather than the individual opinion of any judge.\nThe appellant, somewhat of a novice, had attended the rink six or seven times in the course of a month or so, and on the evening in question had been on the floor almost an hour before the accident. A friend, who had skated with her all evening, testified that a few seconds before the accident she had remarked that her skates felt \"funny\" on her, to which it was suggested that the skates be checked, but that she said she would make another round. The respondent admits having written her friend about a statement of the latter to that effect. O'Connor J. was not satisfied the remark was made, not because of untruthfulness in the witness, but because of a tendency to \"desire to please counsel\" and of a resulting discrepancy in relation to the exact spot on the floor where the words were passed.\nBut I do not place my conclusion on any action or conduct of the respondent; I put it on the absence of proof of any failure in fulfilling the undertaking of the appellant. The injury was very painful, no doubt, and it calls out the utmost sympathy; but that circumstance cannot justify our placing a responsibility for the misfortune where it does not belong.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and dismiss the action, with costs, throughout. The cross-appeal should be dismissed without costs.\nESTEY J.:\u2014The appellants (defendants) own and operate at Edmonton, Alberta, a roller skating rink known as the Silver Glade Roller Bowl. On February 4th, 1945, the respondent (plaintiff), a young lady twenty-three years of age, rented from and was fitted by the appellants' servants and agents with a pair of roller skates. After about an hour of skating one of the skates came off, causing her to fall and suffer serious injuries, damages for which she asks in this action.\nThe Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Alberta, Mr. Justice Ford dissenting, affirmed the judgment of the learned trial judge in favour of the respondent (plaintiff).\nThe respondent pleaded that the appellants' servants and agents were negligent in several particulars, but at the trial they were in effect reduced to two:(1) The said skates were improperly secured to the shoes of the respondent by the appellants' employees;(2) The appellants failed to attach any adequate apparatus to the toe of the respondent's shoes properly to ensure that the said skates were secure. The learned trial judge found:\nAfter the plaintiff had skated about an hour and while she was skating, one of her skates came off and she fell on the floor. No skater was down in front of her or cut in ahead of her. No one bumped or tripped her. Lotawski, who was skating with the plaintiff, felt a kick on her ankle, and heard a clank like a loose skate. Wade, who was skating 12 feet behind the plaintiff, and who picked her up, saw the loose skate.\n* * *\nI find the plaintiff fell and was injured because her skate came off while she was skating, and her skate came off because the defendants had negligently failed to securely attach it to her shoe with a toe strap. The plaintiff was injured by the negligence of the defendants.\nThe appellants' employees affixed the roller skates to the respondent's shoes by using the equipment supplied with the skates as purchased, namely, an ankle strap that passes through a hole for that purpose in the metal part of the skate and then around the ankle of the patron, and toe clamps which are so made as to fit over the sole of the patron's shoe and then tightened by a key. The respondent when asked: \"And they were tightly and properly affixed to your shoes that evening, weren't they?\" replied: \"Yes.\"\nThe learned trial judge made no finding of negligence in respect to the use or adjustment of this equipment by the appellants' employees in fitting the roller skates to the respondent's shoes, and the respondent's contention that the learned judge erred in this respect is not supported by the evidence.\nThe main issue concerns the finding of the learned trial judge that in addition to the ankle straps and toe clamps the appellants failed to use toe straps in affixing the skates to respondent's shoes.\nThe roller skates equipped with ankle straps and toe clamps supplied by the appellants were purchased from an established and well known manufacturer thereof. So equipped they have been and still are used in many rinks throughout Canada and the United States. They were inspected twice a week by the floor manager and once a week by the boys oiling them. The particular skate that came off on this occasion was inspected immediately after respondent's fall and found to be in good condition. No repair was made thereto and it was apparently put back for immediate use. The respondent, after being so fitted, skated for about an hour, when, as she stated: \"all of a sudden the skate came off and I fell over\". Respondent was then asked: \"You do not know why it came off, do you?\" and replied: \"No\". Nor is there any evidence as to why it came off. There is no evidence that the standard equipment, which includes the ankle strap and toe clamps but not the toe straps, was not reasonably sufficient, nor is there evidence that toe straps at any time or place have been regarded as part of the standard equipment.\nMagark who had four and a half years' experience, first as assistant manager and later as floor manager in Vancouver and Edmonton, and who was floor manager at appellants' rink on the night in question, but who at the time of the trial had left the appellants' employment and returned to Vancouver, stated that the skates were satisfactory and safe with standard equipment, and further that \"it is a very popular skate all through America.\"\nAll of the witnesses, including the respondent, knew roller skates came off from time to time and for various reasons. Sometimes the shoes were not adapted for the affixing of roller skates thereto or, if adapted, they were worn to the point that the soles were weakened and would give and thereby work out of the toe clamps, or that the ankle straps became loose for different reasons including that of the skater's foot colliding with the side or wall of the rink or other solid substance with sufficient force to loosen the ankle strap, or that the skater had fallen and in the course of getting up had loosened the ankle strap or worked the sole out of the toe clamps. Magark deposed:\nQ. Do they ever come off while a person is skating regularly without some sort of a knock or a bump?\nA. It has been known but it is very rare.\nHe explained in the course of his evidence that there is usually something in the shoe, skate or conduct of the skater which causes the skates to come off. The respondent's shoes were well adapted for roller skating and, as previously intimated, no reason is given as to why respondent's skate came off.\nAt the rink the appellants supplied toe straps and made that fact known by a sign over or near the skate wicket, stating that these straps were available without charge upon a deposit of 10 cents to ensure their return. Why they were supplied was left as a matter of inference and upon the whole of the evidence it would seem that they were for patrons whose shoes were not reasonably adapted for roller skating or had become so far worn as to weaken the sole. They were used by several of the patrons, how many or what percentage of those skating at the rink was not indicated. The respondent, who had been at the rink about half a dozen times before, had neither noticed the sign relative to the availability of toe straps nor had she noticed others obtaining, using or returning the toe straps.\nWade, who was called as a witness for the respondent and who had had considerable experience in roller skating, said that it was commonly known that the toe straps were available on a deposit of 10 cents and that many used them. He himself had used them before he obtained his own equipment. If the toe straps were \"put on tight\", he said, it was practically impossible for the skates to come off. He further deposed:\nQ. Have you seen skates come off people's feet as they were skating?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Could you observe any reason why those skates would come off?\nA. It would be a matter of theory if I did. I presume the strap must have come loose.\nMr. Wade here implies that if the skates came off when affixed with standard equipment the ankle strap must have worked loose, presumably for some of the reasons already mentioned. He does not express an opinion here nor elsewhere throughout his evidence that the toe strap is essential for reasonable safety. He goes no further than to say that if the toe straps are put on tight it is quite impossible for skates to come off.\nThe duties and obligations between the parties hereto are determined by the contract of hiring under which the respondent obtained the skates from the appellants. In this case a fee was paid by the respondent when the appellants made the skates available. There were no express provisions concerning the issues here involved, and in such circumstances the law implies an obligation upon the appellants to provide skates that at the time of hiring are reasonably safe for the purpose of skating. Halsbury, 2nd Ed., Vol. 1, p. 757; Algoma Steel Corporation v. Dube[5]; Hyman v. Nye[6].\nThe appellants cited among other authorities McDaniel v. Vancouver General Hospital[7]. A patient at the Vancouver General Hospital claimed damages for having developed small pox within the incubation period after leaving the hospital. It was alleged that this was due to the negligence of the hospital in not segregating the small pox patients, and further in permitting the plaintiff to be treated by nurses who were also treating small pox patients. The Privy Council held that the hospital was not liable because it had followed general and approved practice. Lord Alness, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, stated at p. 623:\nA defendant charged with negligence can clear his feet if he shows that he has acted in accord with general and approved practice.\nThat statement appears particularly apt and concludes the case in favour of the appellants because the appellants were not found negligent in the use of the standard equipment but were alleged to be negligent in that they did not add an extra safety precaution in the form of toe straps.\nThroughout so much has been made of the failure of the appellants to use the toe straps that it may be appropriate to note the observation of Lord Thankerton in Glasgow Corporation v. Muir[8].\nThe court must be careful to place itself in the position of the person charged with the duty and to consider what he or she should have reasonably anticipated as a natural and probable consequence of neglect, and not to give undue weight to the fact that a distressing accident has happened or that witnesses in the witness box are prone to express regret, ex post facto, that they did not take some step, which it is now realized would definitely have prevented the accident.\nThe fact that the appellants provided these toe straps, either for the reasons above mentioned or merely for those patrons who desired to take extra precautions, does not establish that they are necessary in order to ensure reasonable safety in skating where the shoes, as here, were well adapted for that purpose, and, therefore, does not establish an obligation upon appellants to supply them to all patrons.\nWith the greatest respect for the majority of the judges in the courts below, who hold a contrary opinion, it would appear that to require, in addition to standard equipment, the toe straps, would impose upon the appellants a greater obligation or a higher standard of care than that which the contract of hiring imposed.\nThe respondent's cross-appeal that the damages awarded at the trial should be increased was dismissed at the hearing of this appeal.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the respondent's action dismissed, with costs throughout. The cross-appeal should be dismissed without costs.\nAppeal allowed and action dismissed, with costs throughout. Cross-appeal dismissed without costs.\n[1] [1946] 3 W.W.R. 522; [1947] 1 D.L.R. 135.\n[2] [1946] 2 W.W.R. 482; [1947] 1 D.L.R. 135, at 135-141.\n[3] (1934) 152 L.T. 56, at 57-58; [1934] 3 W.W.R. 619, at 623.\n[4] [1944] S.C.R. 82.\n[5] (1916) 53 Can.

Subsequently Hudson J. died, and on Feb. 4, 1947, the Court required a reargument, which took place on April 22, 23, 1947, before Rinfret C.J. and Taschereau, Rand, Kellock and Estey JJ. On June 18, 1947, judgment was delivered.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR MANITOBA\nIncome tax\u2014Company, with head office and manufacturing plant in Ontario, selling in Manitoba\u2014Assessed for income tax in Manitoba\u2014Question whether, from profits assessed, company entitled to deduction of allowance for profits on its operations in Ontario\u2014The Income Taxation Act, R.S.M. 1940, c. 209, s. 24\u2014\u201cNet profit or gain arising from the business\u201d of the Company in Manitoba. By s. 24 (1) of The Income Taxation Act, Man., R.S.M. 1940, c. 209, \u201cthe income liable to taxation under this Part of every person residing outside of Manitoba, Who is carrying on business in Manitoba, * * * shall be the net profit or gain arising from the business of such person in Manitoba\u201d. By s. 24 (2), the section applies to a joint stock company carrying on business in Manitoba and which has not its head office in Manitoba.\nAppellant, a joint stock company manufacturing and selling chewing gum, had its head office and manufacturing plant in Ontario. It had a warehouse and office in Manitoba. Manufactured goods were shipped to the warehouse in Manitoba where they were stored and, on orders received and accepted there, were distributed to appellant\u2019s customers in Manitoba and certain other provinces. The selection and the credit rating of the jobbers to whom the Manitoba office might make sales, the book-keeping, collecting of accounts, and the general direction and control of the business were all dealt with exclusively at the head office in Ontario.\nAppellant was assessed for income tax for the years 1936, 1937, 1938 and 1939, under Manitoba statutary provisions not materially different from provisions now contained in said Act, on all the net profits from sales made from appellant\u2019s Manitoba office. Appellant claimed a deduction of an allowance for profits on its operations in Ontario, as not being profits on gain arising from its business in Manitoba.\nHeld (Rand and Kellock JJ. dissenting): Appellant was entitled to deduction of an allowance for profit on the cost of manufacture in Ontario. (Judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba, 53 Man. R. 213, reversed, and judgment of Major J., ibid, restored).\nPer the Chief Justice and Taschereau J.: The manufacturing profits were made in Ontario and cannot be said to have arisen from appellant\u2019s business in Manitoba. The selling in Manitoba cannot have the effect of imparting, for taxing purposes in Manitoba, profits earned in the initial operations in Ontario which made the goods ready for sale. \u201cArising from the business * * * in Manitoba\u201d in s. 24 means \u201cwhat is attributable to the business in Manitoba\u201d or \u201cprofits derived from sources in Manitoba\u201d; and the manufacturing profits made in Ontario are not so attributable or so derived. (Cases reviewed).\nPer Estey J.: In the light of the authorities (discussed) and the taxing power of Manitoba, s. 24 must be construed that the tax is imposed only on the net profit arising out of that portion of the business which a non-resident carries on in Manitoba. Activities and operations other than contracts for sale constitute a carrying on of business and produce or earn income, and therefore, while the income may be realized through the sale, it does not entirely arise from the sale. In the present case, the manufacturing operations in Ontario are a carrying on of business which contributes to appellant\u2019s income and the income should be apportioned accordingly. (Other sections of the Act discussed as to their bearing on the construction of s. 24).\nPer Rand J., dissenting: Construing s. 24 with other sections of the Act, the net profit or gain \u201carising from\u201d the business in Manitoba is the entire profit; \u201carising from\u201d is not intended to be the equivalent of \u201cearned\u201d; the legislative assumption is a business embracing the necessary elements to a profit and the whole profit realized upon the sale is the profit dealt with.\nPer Kellock J., dissenting: Construing s. 24 with other sections of the Act, the legislative intent is that in any case where there is a carrying on of business within the Province by reason of the habitual making of contracts of sale therein, s. 24 applies to make taxable the entire profit arising from such sales, without any apportionment, (16 & 17, Vict. (Imp.), c. 34, and decision thereunder, discussed; those decisions are pertinent and the principle of them is applicable).\nAPPEAL by Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company Limited (a company, incorporated under the Dominion Companies Act, with head office and manufacturing plant in Ontario and licensed to do, and doing, business in Manitoba) from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba[1] which, reversing the judgment of Major J.[2], affirmed (Trueman J.A., and Dysart J.A. (ad hoc), dissenting) the assessments made against the appellant for income tax for the years 1936, 1937, 1938 and 1939, under Manitoba statutory provisions not materially different from provisions now found in The Income Taxation Act, R.S.M. 1940, c. 209. The main question in the appeal had to do with the interpretation of s. 24 of said Act.\nThe material facts of the case and the question in dispute are stated in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported and are indicated in the above headnote.\nEverett Bristol K.C. for the appellant.\nG. L. Causley K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Taschereau J. was delivered by:\nTaschereau J.\u2014This litigation arises out of the interpretation of section 24 (1) of The Income Taxation Act of the province of Manitoba.\nThis section reads as follows:\u2014\nThe income liable to taxation under this Part of every person residing outside of Manitoba, who is carrying on business in Manitoba, either directly or through or in the name of any other person, shall be the net profit or gain arising from the business of such person in Manitoba. The appellant company has its head office in the city of Toronto, Ontario, and carries on business in the province of Manitoba. For the purpose of the Act, the appellant company is deemed to be residing outside of Manitoba, in view of subsection 2 of section 24, which enacts that a joint stock company not having its head office in Manitoba, will be subject to subsection 1 of section 24.\nThe appellant company manufactures chewing gum, and while the manufacturing plant is located in Ontario, it has a warehouse and a distributing organization in the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba. After the goods have gone through the manufacturing processes in Ontario, they are shipped to the Winnipeg warehouse where they are stored and distributed to the appellant\u2019s customers in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. All orders from those three provinces are received in Winnipeg, and are filled by that office out of that stock.\nFor the fiscal years 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939, the Provincial Treasurer of Manitoba has assessed the appellant for income tax purposes, on all the net profits from the sales of gum, made from the Winnipeg office, in the three above mentioned provinces. The company claims that it is entitled to an allowance as profit on the actual cost of manufacture; in other words, that factory profits are deductible because they are not profits or gain arising from the company\u2019s operations in Manitoba.\nThe matter was heard before Mr. Justice Major in the Court of King\u2019s Bench in Manitoba, who ruled that these manufacturing profits were deductible, but the Court of Appeal (Messrs. Justices Trueman and Dysart (ad hoc) dissenting) allowed the appeal and affirmed the decision of the Minister.\nThe contention of the respondent is briefly that the profits or gain of the company arise from the sales, and as the sales were made in Manitoba, within the time provided in the Act, the assessments are properly made.\nA preliminary observation, as to sections 3 and 24 of the taxing statute, is essential. Section 3 is drafted in the following terms:\u2014\nFor the purposes \u2018of this Part, \u201cincome\u201d means the annual net profit or gain or gratuity, whether ascertained and capable of computation as being wages, salary, or other fixed amount, or unascertained as being fees or emoluments, or as being profits from a trade or commercial or financial or other business or calling, directly or indirectly received by a person from any office or employment, or from any profession or calling, or from any trade, manufacture or business, as the case may be whether derived from sources within Manitoba or elsewhere; and includes the interest, dividends or profits directly or indirectly received from money at interest upon any security or without security, or from stocks, or from any other investment, and, whether such gains or profits are divided or distributed or not, and also the annual profit or gain from any other source including * * *\nIn view of this language, it would seem that the legislature intended to tax profits whether derived from sources within Manitoba or elsewhere, but section 24 deals particularly with persons residing outside of Manitoba carrying on business in Manitoba, and says that the income liable to taxation shall be the net profit or gain arising from the business of such person in Manitoba.\nI have no doubt that the definition of the word \u201cincome\u201d in section 3, and which includes profits derived from sources outside of Manitoba, does not apply to section 24, where the tax is limited on the net profit or gain arising from the business in Manitoba.\nThe same point arose in International Harvester Co. of Canada, Ltd. v. The Provincial Tax Commission[3] and in that case Sir Lyman Duff, dealing with a similar statute, said at page 331:\u2014\nIt is clear, I think, that the effect of the words \u201cnet profit or gain arising from the business of such person in Saskatchewan\u201d in section 21a is, for the purpose of that section, to delete from the definition of income in section 3 the words \u201cor elsewhere\u201d.\nIt is, therefore, section 24, taken independently of section 3 that must be examined for the purpose of determining this case. If the profits arise where the sales are made then the assessments are valid, but if the manufacturing profits are deductible in computing the gain made in Manitoba, and on which the tax is imposed, this appeal must succeed.\nThis question of allowances of manufacturing profits for provincial income tax purposes is by no means a new one. In International Harvester Co. of Canada, Ltd. v. The Provincial Tax Commission[4] the same argument made by the present respondent was also considered by this Court. The International Harvester Company carried on the business of manufacturing and selling agricultural machinery, and had its head office at Hamilton, Ontario, where the manufacturing business was carried on. The company sold its products in Saskatchewan as well as in other parts in Canada, and it was admitted by all parties that the central management and control of the company, as in the present case, were at the head office in Ontario.\nThe Commissioner of Income Tax for Saskatchewan made assessments upon the company in respect of its income for each of the years 1934 to 1936 inclusive, without allowing for manufacturing profits. The charging section in Saskatchewan was similar to the one enacted by the legislature of Manitoba, and which we have now to consider.\nThe business of the company in Saskatchewan was the making of contracts of sale by its agents, and the International Harvester Company therefore claimed that it was entitled to an allowance for manufacturing profits, which did not arise from the business of the company in Saskatchewan. The then Chief Justice of Canada, Sir Lyman Duff, with whom concurred Davis and Taschereau JJ. said:\nIt is nat the profits received in Saskatchewan that are taxable; it is the profits arising from its business in Saskatchewan, not the profits arising from the company\u2019s manufacturing business in Ontario and from the company\u2019s operations in Saskatchewan taken together, but the profits arising from the company\u2019s operations in Saskatchewan.\nThe judgment of Sir Lyman Duff was a dissenting judgment, but Rinfret, Crocket, Kerwin and Hudson, JJ., who took an opposite view on some other points of the case, did not in any way contradict the opinion of Chief Justice Duff on that particular point. Although not a binding pronouncement, this expression of opinion is, I believe, the logical interpretation to be given to that part of the Saskatchewan statute, which is identical to section 24 of the Manitoba Act. The respondent has cited the following passage of Mr. Justice Kerwin in the case of Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. of Canada, Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income Tax[5].\nThe manufacture in Ontario of the appellants\u2019 goods, however necessary to the existence of its business, does not earn income. The goods are manufactured for the purpose of sale and the income is earned when the goods are sold and. all the income, therefore, was earned within British Columbia.\nIn that case, the Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. of Canada, Ltd., having its head office at the city of Hamilton, had no office or any employees in the province of British Columbia. Its sales, in that province, were made through an independent firm, and the majority of this Court held that the contract between the parties was not one of agency, but one of sale, and, therefore, it was held that the Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. Ltd. was not liable to income tax in British Columbia.\nThe Income Tax Act of British Columbia, R.S.B.C. 1936, Chap. 280, provides:\u2014\n3. (1) To the extent and in the manner provided in the Act and for the raising of a revenue for Provincial purposes:\n(a) All income of every person resident in the Province and the income earned within the Province of persons not resident within the Province shall be liable to taxation.\nIt may be first of all pointed out that the judgment of Mr. Justice Kerwin, with whom Mr. Justice Hudson concurred, was a minority judgment, but moreover, Mr. Justice Kerwin in his reasons said that the entire scope of the British Columbia Act is quite different from that of the Saskatchewan Act, and that, therefore, the decision in International Harvester Co. of Canada Ltd. v. The Provincial Tax Commission[6] did not apply in the Firestone case. In Saskatchewan a tax is imposed on \u201cthe net profit or gain arising from the business of such person in Saskatchewan\u201d, while in the British Columbia Act a tax is imposed on \u201call income of every person resident in the Province and the income earned within the Province of persons not resident within the Province\u201d. In his reasons for judgment in the International Harvester case[7], Sir Lyman Duff further says at page 331:\u2014\nThe profits of the Company are derived from a series of operations, including the purchase of raw material or partly manufactured articles, completely manufacturing its products and transporting and selling them, and receiving the proceeds of such sales. The essence of its profit making business is a series of operations as a whole. That part of the proceeds of sales in Saskatchewan which is profits is received in Saskatchewan, but it does not follow, of course, that the whole of such profits \u201carises from\u201d that part of the Company\u2019s business which is carried on there within the contemplation of section 21 a; and I think such a conclusion is negatived when the language of this section is contrasted with that of other sections of the Act.\nSir Lyman Duff cites the case of Commissioners of Taxation v. Kirk[8]. In that case the income tax statute of New South Wales charged within income tax, income \u201cderived from lands of the Crown held under lease or licence\u201d in New South Wales, and income \u201carising or accruing\u201d from \u201cany other source in New South Wales\u201d. The statute provided that \u201cno tax shall be payable in respect of income earned\u201d outside New South Wales. The company whose income came into question in that case was a mining company owning and working mines in New South Wales, the crude ore being there converted for the most part into concentrates. Almost the whole of the ore so treated was sold and the contracts for sale were made outside New South Wales. The Supreme Court of New South Wales held, following a previous decision in In re Tindal[9], that the whole of the income included in the proceeds of sales was earned and arose at the place where the sales were made and the proceeds of the sales received, and that, consequently, no part of such proceeds was taxable as income in New South Wales. The Judicial Committee reversed this judgment and, at pages 592 and 593 (2), their Lordships said:\nTheir Lordships attach no special meaning to the word \u201cderived\u201d, which they treat as synonymous with arising or accruing. It appears to their Lordships that there are four processes in the earning or production of this income: (1) the extraction of the ore from the soil; (2) the conversion of the crude ore into a merchantable product, which is a manufacturing process; (3) the sale of the merchantable product; (4) the receipt of the moneys arising from the sale. All these processes are necessary stages which terminate in money, and the income is the money resulting less the expenses attendant on all the stages. The first process seems to their Lordships clearly within sub-s. 3, and the second or manufacturing process, if not within the meaning of \u201ctrade\u201d in sub-s. 1, is certainly included in the words \u201cany other source whatever\u201d in sub-s. 4.\nSo far as relates to these two processes, therefore, their Lordships think that the income was earned and arising and accruing in New South Wales * * * This point was, if possible, more plainly brought out in Tindal\u2019s case[10] * * * The question in that case, as here, should have been what income was arising or accruing to Tindal from the business operations carried on by him in the Colony.\nThe fallacy of the judgment of the Supreme Court in this and in Tindal\u2019s case (1) is in leaving out of sight the initial stages, and fastening their attention exclusively on the final stage in the production of the income.\nThis reasoning, I think, applies in the present case. When the goods of the appellant company reach Winnipeg, they have also gone through a series of processes or operations which make them ready for consumption. It is in these first stages that the manufacturing profits are made, and I fail to see how it can be said that they have \u201carisen from the business of the appellant in Manitoba\u201d. It is quite true that the goods are sold in Manitoba, but the business of selling and collecting the sales price in Manitoba, which is the final stage of a series of operations, cannot have the effect of importing for taxing purposes in Manitoba, profits earned in the initial stages in the province of Ontario, as a result of manufacturing operations.\nI fully agree with Mr. Bristol when he suggested that \u201carising from the business\u201d means \u201cwhat is attributable to the business in Manitoba\u201d or \u201cprofits derived from sources in Manitoba\u201d. The manufacturing profits made in Ontario are surely not attributable to the operations in Manitoba, and they are not derived from sources in Manitoba.\nIn order to accept the conclusions of the respondent, it would be necessary to say that the law taxes profits \u201cderived from contracts entered in Manitoba\u201d and I find myself unable to so construe section 24.\nI, therefore, come to the conclusion that the appellant is entitled to an allowance as profit on the actual cost of manufacture and I would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the judgment of Mr. Justice Major, with costs throughout. Rand J. (dissenting)\u2014The transactions in Manitoba, constituting admittedly a business carried on there, were these: the receipt and warehousing at Winnipeg of merchandise, the acceptance and fulfilment of orders received from approved jobbers in the three prairie provinces through distribution by shipment or delivering of the goods called for; general superintendence of the business in those provinces, including coordinate direction over the field representatives canvassing the prairies; and the keeping of all proper records of the business so done. The expenses at Winnipeg were met by cash received from the head office at Toronto. The price for the goods was remitted by the purchasers direct or through the Winnipeg office to Toronto where all commercial accounts were kept. The travelling representatives were under general instruction from headquarters and paid direct from there. The question is what was the net profit or gain \u201carising from\u201d the business so conducted?\nThe relevant provisions of the taxing Act are as follows:\n3. For the purposes of this Part, \u201cincome\u201d means the annual net profit or gain or gratuity, whether ascertained and capable of computation, as being wages, salary, or other fixed amount, or unascertained as being fees or emoluments, or as being profits from a trade or commercial or financial or other business or calling, directly or indirectly received by a person from any office or employment, or from any profession or calling, or from any trade, manufacture or business, as the case may be whether derived from sources within Manitoba or elsewhere; * * *\n4. The following incomes shall not be liable to taxation hereunder:\n(v) Income earned by a corporation or joint stock company with its head office in Manitoba (other than a personal corporation) in that part of its business carried on outside of Manitoba.\n(1) In computing the amount of the profits or gains to be assessed, a deduction shall not be allowed in respect of * * *\n(4) Where a corporation or joint stock company with its head office in Manitoba, other than a personal corporation, carries on business outside of Manitoba, no losses incurred in respect to that part of its business shall be deducted or taken into account in calculating the amount of income earned in Manitoba.\n9. (1) There shall be assessed, levied and paid upon the income during the preceding year of every person * * *\n(d) who, not being resident in Manitoba, is carrying on business in Manitoba during such year;\n24. (1) The income liable to taxation under this Part of every person residing outside of Manitoba, who is carrying on business in Manitoba, either directly or through or in the name of any other person, shall be the net profit or gain arising from the business of such person in Manitoba. (2) This section shall apply to a taxpayer which is a corporation or joint stock company carrying on business in Manitoba and which has not its head office in Manitoba.\n25. The income liable to taxation under this Part of every person residing outside of Manitoba, who derives income for services rendered in Manitoba, otherwise than in the course of regular or continuous employment, for any person resident or carrying on business in Manitoba, shall be the income so earned by such person in Manitoba.\n26 (1) Where a non-resident person produces, grows, mines, creates, manufactures, fabricates, improves, packs, preserves or constructs, in whole or in part, anything within Manitoba and exports the same without sale prior to the export thereof, he shall be deemed to be carrying on business in Manitoba and to earn within Manitoba a proportionate part of any profit ultimately derived from the sale thereof outside of Manitoba.\n(2) The minister shall have full discretion as to the manner of determining such proportionate part.\n27A. (1) Any non-resident person soliciting orders or offering anything for sale in Manitoba through an agent or employee, and whether any contract or transaction which may result therefrom is completed within Manitoba or without Manitoba, or party within and partly without Manitoba, shall be deemed to foe carrying on business in Manitoba and to earn a proportionate part of the income derived therefrom in Manitoba.\n(2) The minister shall have full discretion as to the manner of determining such proportionate part.\nIt is agreed that section 24 is the applicable provision, but it can be seen at once that the first consideration raised is that of the meaning of certain words and expressions used both in that and the other provisions. We have \u201carising from\u201d, \u201cderived from\u201d, \u201cearned\u201d. Others of analogous import appear in the cases cited to us: \u201caccruing from\u201d, \u201caccruing from any source\u201d, \u201cproduced in\u201d. Primarily, to \u201cearn\u201d income or profit is, I should say, to expend the effort or exertion which creates the value to be exchanged; profit is \u201crealized\u201d if and when that value is converted into money or, in a practical business sense, into debt, in an amount greater than the cost of producing it. \u201cArising from\u201d, \u201cderived from\u201d and \u201caccruing from\u201d I take to be equivalents; they are applicable to a defined source; and in the case of a business, where used without more, it is on the assumption that the \u201cbusiness\u201d includes factors essential in substance to producing profit. In the present case, the sales in. Manitoba are obviously the final step in an overall business embracing manufacture and sale; but for the purposes of Manitoba, they and their clustered elements are a segregated and distinct business of themselves. The only difference between them and ordinary commercial trading is that in the latter case the goods are bought and they enter th\u00e9 business with their value therein so created; the essential factors are purchase, possession and sale; here, value is produced instead of purchased out of Manitoba, brought there and localized for the same purpose. In the statutory conception, ownership, possession, and disposal of the goods in Manitoba furnish the foundation of the taxable business there conducted. Not every \u201cbusiness\u201d can be said to possess all factors required for the production of profit within the localization. It may, though self-contained, be but an intermediate process; for some, at least, of such cases section 26 makes provision; in them the legislature taxes either the process or a potential profit deemed annexed to it, on the basis of that portion of ultimate profit attributable to it. If, therefore, there is in a business from which profits must \u201carise\u201d, a sufficient basis in fact for the legislative assumption, as I think the case here, jurisdiction to tax the entire profit, on that apart from any other ground, is established; in the absence of modifying language in the context, the profit \u201carising from\u201d that business is the entire profit; and the cost to that point, even though a manufacturing cost, determines the amount of it.\nBut the question remains whether by the provisions of the statute as a whole such a meaning is modified to point clearly to another subject-matter of tax or basis of determining the taxable profit. Does it appear that the words \u201carising from\u201d are intended to be the equivalent of \u201cearned\u201d and the basis of the tax, that share of the profits from the company\u2019s entire operations\u2014where, as here, they consist of a connected series\u2014completed by the Manitoba transactions, which the value added to the goods by the operations in Manitoba bears to the total value produced? The different conceptions are sufficiently defined and the difficulty is one of legislative meaning only.\nThe provisions as a whole make it, I think, indisputable that the distinction suggested between \u201carising from\u201d and \u201cearned\u201d was fully appreciated. Section 26,\nto earn within Manitoba a proportionate part of any profit ultimately derived from the sale thereof outside of Manitoba, seems to put that beyond question. The contention is that the converse of the effect of this unambiguous language was intended in section 24, but I am unable to agree with it. The expression \u201carising from\u201d in section 24 carries the same signification as \u201cderived from\u201d in 26; in each case there is assumed a business embracing the necessary elements to a profit and in each the whole profit realized upon the sale is the profit dealt with.\nIt is argued that Commissioners of Taxation v. Kirk[11] is against that view. There again the question was one of the particular language used, and, as put by Lord Davey, it was\nwhether any part of these profits were earned or (to use another word also used in the Act) produced in the Colony.\nHe treats \u201cderived\u201d as synonymous with \u201carising\u201d or \u201caccruing\u201d but he does not extend that equivalence to \u201cearned\u201d or \u201cproduced\u201d. It was the four processes there that earned or produced the income. Section 27 declared that no tax should be payable in respect of income earned outside the Colony, and what Lord Davey was concerned to ascertain was what income was earned within the Colony. In such a context \u201carising\u201d or \u201caccruing\u201d was referrable to the distributed income attaching to the process of production carried out in New South Wales and his statement\nNor is it material whether the income is received in the Colony or not if it is earned outside\napplies whether it is wholly or partly earned outside. The \u201cearning\u201d, the work resulting in the creation of value, is the proper measure of the share of total profit to be annexed to the particular process wherever it may be carried out.\nThe many other authorities brought to our attention are of value only in clarifying the subject-matter and the terms employed; to ascertain the intention of the legislature from the language used is in each case an individual problem for which we can generally look for but small assistance from principle or analogy.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs. Kellock J. (dissenting)\u2014The appellant Company has its head office and factory in Toronto and an office and warehouse in Winnipeg. Its business is the manufacture and sale of chewing gum. At the factory ingredients for the finished article are purchased and stored, manufactured and packaged ready for sale. Shipments are then made from Toronto to Winnipeg, where a stock is carried for distribution in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and a part of Northwestern Ontario. The Winnipeg branch receives the orders taken by jobbers in these areas, accepts and fills them and bills the purchasers, copies of the invoices being forwarded to the head office. Payment is made, not to the Winnipeg branch, but directly to the head office.\nThe assessments in question on this appeal are in respect of the appellant\u2019s fiscal periods ending in the years 1936 to 1939, inclusive. For the legislation governing, it is convenient to refer to R.S.M. 1940, cap. 209. It was not contended that there is any material difference between this and the earlier statutes which are applicable. Section 3, so far as material, defines \u201cincome\u201d as\nthe annual net profit or gain * * * directly or indirectly received by a person from * * * any trade, manufacture or business * * * whether derived from sources within Manitoba or elsewhere * * *\nThe persons who are made liable to taxation on income thus defined are set out in section 9, the relevant part of which is as follows:\n9. (1) There shall be assessed, levied and paid upon the income during the preceding year of every person * * *\n(d) who, not being resident in Manitoba, is carrying on business in Manitoba during such year;\ntax at certain rates.\nThe combined effect of these two provisions purport, in the case of a non-resident carrying on business in Manitoba, to make such person liable to taxation in Manitoba in respect of his whole income. However, special provision is made for the case of a non-resident who carries on business in Manitoba by section 24 (1), which reads as follows:\nThe income liable to taxation under this Part of every person residing outside of Manitoba, who is carrying on business in Manitoba, either directly or through or in the name of any other person, shall be the net profit or gain arising from the business of such person in Manitoba. This subsection is, by subsection 2, made applicable to a company whose head office is without the province. The question for determination on this appeal is the proper construction of the words \u201cthe net profit or gain arising from, the business of such person in Manitoba\u201d.\nAppellant submits that, while it has only one profit, that profit, to quote its factum, \u201cmust be deemed to have arisen in all stages of the company\u2019s operations\u201d and \u201cmust be apportioned on some basis to arrive at the taxable income in Manitoba\u201d. Reliance is placed upon the decision of the Privy Council in Commissioners of Taxation v. Kirk[12] and the dissenting judgment in International Harvester v. The Provincial Tax Commission[13] (Sask.). It is said that the net profit or gain \u201carising from the business\u201d in Manitoba means the net profit arising from the appellant company\u2019s \u201coperations\u201d in Manitoba. Appellant also invokes sections 26, 27 and 27A, as showing a legislative intent to apportion profit on the basis contended for. For the respondent it is contended that the whole of the net profit arising from contracts of sale made in Manitoba are taxable, while profit arising from contracts made elsewhere are not taxable.\nBefore turning to a consideration of the authorities, it is essential first to consider the particular legislation which is here in question. In the statute one finds that section 24 is followed by a group of sections, 26 to 28, inclusive, grouped under the heading \u201cIncome from Operations in Manitoba\u201d. These sections are as follows:\n26. (1) Where a non-resident person produces, grows, mines, creates, manufactures, fabricates, improves, packs, preserves or constructs, in whole or in part, anything within Manitoba and exports the same without sale prior to the export thereof, he shall be deemed to be carrying on business in Manitoba and to earn within Manitoba a proportionate part of any profit ultimately derived from the sale thereof outside of Manitoba.\n(2) The Minister shall have full discretion as to the manner of determining such proportionate part.\n27. (1) Any non-resident person, who lets or leases anything used in Manitoba, or who receives a royalty or other similar payment for anything used or sold in Manitoba, shall be deemed to be carrying on business in Manitoba and to earn a proportionate part of the income derived therefrom in Manitoba.\n(2) The Minister shall have full discretion as to the manner of determining such proportionate part.\n27A. (1) Any non-resident person soliciting orders or offering anything for sale in Manitoba through an agent or employee, and whether any contract or transaction which may result therefrom is completed within Manitoba or without Manitoba, or partly within and partly without Manitoba, shall be deemed to be carrying on business in Manitoba and to earn a proportionate part of the income derived therefrom in Manitoba.\n(2) The Minister shall have full discretion as to the manner of determining such proportionate part.\n28. Nothing in the three last preceding sections shall in any way affect the generality of the term \u201ccarrying on business\u201d used elsewhere in this Part.\nIt is admitted that appellant is carrying on business in Manitoba within the meaning of section 24. The question is, what is the \u201cbusiness\u201d in Manitoba the net profit arising from which is taxable? Is the line to be drawn horizontally, as appellant contends, by apportioning some notional profit to all of the operations of the appellant which culminate in the sale of its product, the part apportioned to the later operations actually performed within the province alone being taxable, or does the statute indicate, as respondent submits, that the line is to be drawn vertically as between the profit arising from contracts of sale made within and those made without the province? It is quite clear from section 24 itself that the entire net profit arising from the business carried on in Manitoba is taxable. The only question is, what is \u201cthe business\u201d? Under section 26 any one of a number of particular operations is made to constitute the carrying on of business and there is express provision for apportioning profit to such operations. It is also significant that the section expressly excludes sale, and it would seem that the intention of the legislature is thereby indicated that where sale takes place within the province, that is a carrying on of business within the meaning of the statute without the necessity for any express provision to that effect, as the legislature evidently thought was necessary in the case of operations which do not culminate in sale. The same theory is exhibited by section 27A. I think it follows, therefore, that in any case where there is a carrying on of business within the province by reason of the habitual making of contracts of sale therein, section 24 applies and the entire profit arising from such sales is taxable and there is no apportionment.\nWere section 24 absent from the Act, section 27A would apply to the appellant in respect of orders solicited in Manitoba. That section isolates the solicitation of orders or the offering of anything for sale in Manitoba from other operations and constitutes this a carrying on of business in Manitoba for the purposes of the section. The greater, however, is made to include the less by the provisions of section 24, and, as the operations of the appellant go beyond what is described in section 27A, I think section 24 is the section which applies to the appellant. Counsel for the appellant agrees with this construction.\nTurning to the English legislation, 16 and 17 Victoria, cap. 34, section 2, Schedule D, makes provision for taxation \u201cfor and in respect of the annual profits or gains arising or accruing to any person whatever, whether a subject of Her Majesty or not, although not resident within the United Kingdom, from * * * any * * * trade * * * exercised within the United Kingdom\u201d.\nFor my part, I cannot follow counsel for the appellant in his argument that: \u201cthe annual profits or gains arising or accruing to any person * * * from any trade exercised within the United Kingdom\u201d differs in meaning from \u201cthe annual profits or gains arising or accruing to any person from the trade (or business) of such person in the United Kingdom\u201d, had the statute been so expressed as is the case with the Manitoba legislation here in question. To my mind, therefore, the decisions under the Imperial statute are pertinent. It is to be observed that that statute does not indicate what constitutes the exercise of a trade within the United Kingdom. Two questions therefore arise in any given case namely, (1) whether there is a trade exercised or carried on within the United Kingdom from which profits arise; and (2) what are the profits which are made subject to tax.\nIn Erichsen v. Last[14], the appellants were a foreign company domiciled in Copenhagen, having three marine cables connecting with the United Kingdom at different points. They accepted messages in the United Kingdom for transmission to various countries over their own cables and the cables of others. It was held that they were exercising a trade in the United Kingdom and chargeable to income tax on the profits arising from the contracts made within the United Kingdom. Any apportionment of profit such as is here contended for was negatived. As to the first question, Brett L.J. said at p. 418:\nThe only thing that we have to decide is whether, upon the facts of this case, this company carry on a profit earning trade in this country. I should say that wherever profitable contracts are habitually made in England, by or for foreigners, with persons in England, because they are in England, to do something for or supply something to those persons, such foreigners are exercising a profitable trade in England, even though everything to be done by them in order to fulfil the contracts is done abroad.\nAt p. 420[15] Cotton L.J. said:\n* * * and in my opinion when a person habitually does and contracts to do a thing capable of producing profit, and for the purpose of producing profit, he carries on a trade or business.\nThis was approved by Lord Watson in Grainger v. Gough[16].\nAs to the second question, Brett L.J. said at p. 41915:\nThen from what is the duty to foe collected? It is from the profit accruing to this company from the trade which they carry on in England, namely, the making such contracts, and that profit is the difference between the sum the company receive and what it costs to earn that sum. There is no difficulty about that. It is immaterial whether the company have expended in this country or abroad what it properly can be said to cost them in order to earn the money which they so receive, but such expense, and nothing more, must be deducted in order to get the profit.\nAt p. 42015, Cotton L.J. said:\nThen as to the question on what profit the company are to pay? The question is, what profit they make by the business carried on here, which is contracting to send messages to various parts of the world. It is, in my opinion, the sum received, after deducting everything which the company pay for the purpose of performing their contract. If part is performed by the company themselves, they cannot deduct anything in respect of a profit supposed to have been earned by them in the course of such performances. They can, of course, deduct all expenses, including their own expenses, and sums paid to other companies, but they cannot deduct a profit which is imaginary and has no real existence.\nUnder the same legislation in question in the above cited case, on the other hand, it was held by the House of Lords in Grainger v. Gough16, that the solicitation of orders in the United Kingdom by an agent on behalf of a wine merchant carrying on business in France would not fall within the statute, no contracts being made in England. In that case Lord Davey, at page 345, said:\nNow, what does one mean by a trade, or the exercise of a trade? Trade in its largest sense is the business of selling, with a view to profit, goods Which the trader has either manufactured or himself purchased. It was held also in Sulley v. Attorney General[17] that where an American firm carried on business in New York consisting in the resale there of goods purchased on their account in England by one of the partners who resided in England did not constitute the exercise of a trade in the United Kingdom within the meaning of the legislation. As stated by Lord Watson in Grainger\u2019s case[18] at page 341:\nOne reason assigned for the decision was that the firm\u2019s transactions here did not involve any profits or gains, which were wholly dependent upon the resales effected by the firm on the other side of the Atlantic.\nIn Maclaine v. Eccott[19], Viscount Cave L.C. expressed the principle thus at page 432:\nI think it must now be taken as established that in the case of a merchant\u2019s business, the primary object of which is to sell goods at a profit, the trade is (speaking generally) exercised or carried on (I do not myself see much difference between the two expressions) at the place where the contracts are made. No doubt reference has sometimes been made to the place where payment is made for the goods sold or to the place where the goods are delivered, and it may be that in certain circumstances these are material considerations; but the most important, and indeed the crucial, question is, where are the contracts of sale made?\nIt would appear that the use of the phrase, \u201ca merchant\u2019s business\u201d was not intended to exclude from the application of the principle, businesses which include the production of the article sold as distinct from mere purchase. All of the members of the House approved of the dissenting judgment of Lord Dundas in Crookston v. Furtado[20], where the company concerned was the owner of phosphate mines, the product of which it sold in the United Kingdom. See also Werle & Co. v. Colquhoun[21].\nIn my opinion, the principle of the above decisions is applicable to section 24 of the legislation here in question. I am further of opinion that the legislation, including sections 26, 27 and 27A, was drawn with that principle in view. Although a different opinion with respect to somewhat similar legislation is expressed in the dissenting judgment in the International Harvester case[22], already referred to, I cannot, with respect, accept it, for the reasons set forth above. That opinion was founded upon Kirk\u2019s case[23] but Lord Davey, who was a party to the judgment in Grainger v. Gough[24] in which Erichsen v. Last[25] was approved, said, in relation to the New South Wales Income Tax Act, 1895, with which the Privy Council was concerned in Kirk\u2019s case[26], at page 593:\nThe learned judges refer to some English decisions on the Income Tax Acts of this country, which in language, and to some extent in aim, differ from the Acts now before their Lordships.\nIn Kirk\u2019s case26 their Lordships were concerned with two companies, each incorporated under the law of the Colony of Victoria and having its head office and board of directors in that Colony. Each company conducted mining operations on leasehold lands held from the Crown in New South Wales, where each had an office and a mine manager. It is stated by Lord Davey, who delivered the judgment of their Lordships, that neither company made any contracts for sale in New South Wales. In addition to the mining of the ore the greater part of the ore was converted into a merchantable product in New South Wales.\nThe legislation in question in that case, so far as material, provided by section 15 for income tax in respect of all incomes:\n1. Arising or accruing to any person wheresoever residing from any profession, trade, employment or vocation carried on in New South Wales * * * 3. Derived from lands of the Crown held under lease or licence issued by or on behalf of the Crown. 4. Arising or accruing to any person wheresoever residing from any kind of property * * * or from any other source whatsoever in New South Wales not included in the preceding subsections.\nIt was also provided by section 27, subsection 3, that:\nNo tax shall be payable in respect of income earned outside the Colony of New South Wales.\nIt was held by the Board that there were four processes in the earning or production of the income of the companies: (1) the extraction of the ore from the soil; (2) the conversion of the crude ore into a merchantable product, which is a manufacturing process; (3) the sale of the merchantable product; (4) the receipt of the moneys arising from the sale. It was pointed out that the word \u201ctrade\u201d no doubt primarily means traffic by way of sale or exchange or commercial dealing, but that it may have a larger meaning so as to include manufacture. Confining the word to its literal meaning, their Lordships asked why in the case before them the income was not derived mediately or immediately from lands of the Crown held on lease under subsection 3 or from some other source in New South Wales under subsection 4, and they held that the question must be answered in the affirmative even if the manufacturing process did not come within the meaning of trade within subsection 1.\nIf subsection 1 of the statute in question in Kirk\u2019s case[27] be examined, it will be found, in my opinion, to be indistinguishable from the English legislation already referred to. If, therefore, the language and the aim of the English legislation was considered by the Privy Council to differ from the New South Wales legislation, as above pointed out, it can only be because of the presence of subsections 3 and 4 of section 15 and subsection 3 of section 27. In my opinion, as section 24 of the legislation here in question, like Schedule D of the United Kingdom statute, stands alone, there is nothing upon which any apportionment of profit over the various operations of the appellant company can be based. It seems to me that when the legislature intended to provide for an apportionment of profits to operations they did so expressly in sections 26, 27 and 27A. The fact that there is no similar provision in section 24 is not only significant but, in my opinion, conclusive.\nAppellant points to the provisions of clause (v) of section 4, which exempts from taxation\nincome earned by a corporation or joint stock company with its head office in Manitoba (other than a personal corporation) in that part of its business carried on outside of Manitoba.\nI see no basis for applying this provision to a company such as the appellant whose head office is without the province. Section 24 deals with that kind of case.\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.\nEstey J.\u2014The appellant is a Dominion company manufacturing and selling chewing gum, with head office and manufacturing plant in the province of Ontario. It admits that it is carrying on business in Manitoba and as such is liable for the payment of income tax for the years 1936 to 1939 inclusive under the provisions of The Income Taxation Act, being R.S.M. 1940, c. 209 (a consolidation of earlier statutes in which the sections material hereto are unchanged). The question in this appeal is the basis or principle upon which this income tax should be computed.\nThe appellant contends that, while the profit is realized only when the goods are sold, under section 24 this profit should be distributed or apportioned to all of its operations leading up to and culminating in the sale, that the amount so apportioned to the business in Manitoba is \u201cthe net profit or gain arising from the business\u201d of the appellant in Manitoba.\nThe respondent submits that the business of the company in Manitoba is the selling of gum, that no profit or gain arises from any prior operations of the company and therefore the full profit or gain arises out of the sale in Manitoba. This profit is therefore taxable as \u201cthe net profit or gain arising from the business\u201d of the appellant in Manitoba.\nThe learned trial judge accepted the appellant\u2019s contention. His judgment was reversed in the Appellate Court, Mr. Justice Trueman and Mr. Justice Dysart (ad hoc) dissenting.\nThere is no dispute as to the facts. The appellant has its head office and manufacturing plant in Ontario. It maintains an office and a warehouse in Manitoba. Orders are received, accepted, and the gum shipped and invoiced from its premises in Manitoba to jobbers in Western Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. The selection and the credit rating of the jobbers to whom the Manitoba office may make sales, the bookkeeping, the rendering and collecting of accounts and the general direction and control of the business are all matters dealt with exclusively at head office in Ontario. It is clear that the contracts of sale for the gum are made in Manitoba.\nThe parties hereto are in agreement that the liability of the appellant is under section 24 of the Act and that the determination of the issue in this case depends upon the construction of that section. Section 3 of The Income Taxation Act, R.S.M. 1940, c. 209, reads in part as follows:\n3. For the purposes of this Part, \u201cincome\u201d means the annual net profit or gain * * *from a trade or commercial or financial or other business or calling, directly or indirectly received by a person from any office or employment, or from any profession or calling, or from any trade, manufacture or business, as the case may be whether derived from sources within Manitoba or elsewhere; * * *\nSection 9 (1) (d) reads as follows:\nThere shall be assessed, levied and paid upon the income during the preceding year of every person\n* * *\n(d) who, not being resident in Manitoba, is carrying on business in Manitoba during such year;\n* * *\na tax at the rates applicable * * *\n\u201cIncome\u201d is defined in section 3, and section 9 is the charging section. It is common ground that if sections 3 and 9 were the only provisions with respect to non-residents, the statute would purport to tax a non-resident carrying on business in Manitoba upon the net profit or gain derived from sources within Manitoba or elsewhere. Such a provision applicable to non-residents would give rise to obvious constitutional issues. That fact was, no doubt, the essential reason why section 24, which applies specifically to non-residents, was enacted.\nSection 24 reads as follows:\n24. (1) The income liable to taxation under this Part of every person residing outside of Manitoba, who is carrying on business in Manitoba, either directly or through or in the name of any other person, shall be the net profit or gain arising from the business of such person in Manitoba.\n(2) This section shall apply to a taxpayer which is a corporation or joint stock company carrying on business in Manitoba and which has not its head office in Manitoba.\nThroughout the hearing of this appeal, and in many of the cases, particularly the earlier ones, it was emphasized that where the contracts of purchase and sale were made business was carried on. Even in those cases it was pointed out that such was not the only test, and it is now recognized that business may be carried on by a person in different places and by operations quite apart from the making of contracts. Moreover, under section 24 the business of the non-resident may be wholly or partially carried on in Manitoba. The legislature of Manitoba, no doubt, had both of these factors in mind in enacting section 24 and providing thereby that the\nincome liable to taxation * * * shall foe the net profit or gain arising from the business of such person in Manitoba.\nIn this case the appellant carries on the business of manufacturing and selling gum. The fact that it manufactures in one and sells in many provinces does not in any way detract from the fact that it conducts but one business. Its business is not that of a manufacturer and then that of a wholesaler or jobber, but that of manufacturing and selling gum. Its business is a unit and every operation contributes to the ultimate profit or loss. That the profit is realized but once and only through the medium of the sales is admitted, but that does not determine the meaning of the words in section 24 as to what is the net profit or gain arising from the business of the appellant in Manitoba.\nThe several sections of the statute discussed at the hearing are phrased to cover special circumstances. Sections 26, 27 and 27A are phrased upon the assumption that the activities and operations there enumerated on the part of non-residents do not constitute a carrying on of business. Some of them would not and in a given case under any heading there might be a doubt. These sections declare not only that the non-resident who engages in the specified activities or operations shall be deemed to be carrying on business in Manitoba, but also that the non-resident shall be deemed \u201cto earn a proportionate part of the income derived therefrom\u201d. The legislature is here legislating to create in certain cases that which for purposes of taxation exists in fact in other cases. That this was the view of the legislature is evidenced by the provisions of section 28, which avoids any conflict between section 24 and sections 26, 27 and 27A. In effect it provides that when the nonresident is in fact carrying on business in Manitoba the provisions of section 24 apply. In these circumstances, if any conclusion may be drawn to assist in the construction of section 24, it is that the legislature is by these sections providing that the specific circumstances dealt with shall be \u201cdeemed to be\u201d that which in fact exists elsewhere in the statute. The legislature was here creating statutory fictions. (Hill v. East and West India Dock Co.[28]) and were therefore making the provisions as complete and full as possible.\nThen by section 4 (m) (prior to 1940 amendment), dealing with a company having its head office in Manitoba, the \u201cprofits earned by a corporation * * * in that part of its business carried on at a branch or agency outside of Manitoba\u201d \u201cshall not be liable to taxation\u201d. It would follow that, in order to come within the exemptions, the company must be carrying on business in fact outside of Manitoba. The phrase \u201cin that part of its business\u201d is significant, and the section as phrased must contemplate apportionment as regards a resident company.\nThe Saskatchewan statute dealt with in International Harvester Co. of Canada, Ltd. v. The Provincial Tax Commission[29] is for all practical purposes identical except that the Saskatchewan Act contained an additional provision for the adoption of regulations setting up a method for the determination of the tax if the information necessary to compute the income of any taxpayer was not available to the commission. The commission, acting under such regulations, determined the tax. Litigation followed in which the issues raised by the company included the constitutional validity of both the statute and the regulations. These regulations, it was contended, were invalid because they involved the imposition of a tax upon income arising from the company\u2019s business outside of Saskatchewan. The majority of this Court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Saskatchewan and held the regulations valid because it was not the intention of either the statute or the regulations to exceed the taxing powers of the province, and if in this particular case the tax as computed exceeded that which would be valid qua tax, it was valid qua penalty imposed upon the taxpayer who did not furnish the required information. In the course of his judgment my lord the Chief Justice (then Rinfret, J.), with whom Crocket and Kerwin JJ. agreed, stated at pp. 351-352. It was next argued that, even if the Acts are constitutional or the regulations are intra vires, yet in their operation in the present case they have the effect of taxing profits or gains which did not arise from the business of the appellant in Saskatchewan.\n* * * In an endeavour to transform that objection into a question of law, appellant\u2019s counsel stresses the point to the extent of saying that the application of the regulations necessarily includes in the assessment manufacturing profits said to have arisen exclusively outside Saskatchewan, i.e., at the head office of the appellant in Hamilton, Ontario, where the central management and control of the appellant abide (De Beers Consolidated Mines v. Howe[30]; Commissioners of Taxation v. Kirk[31]).\nSuch, in my view, was not the purpose of the Acts of Saskatchewan or of the regulations made thereunder and applied in the present case. The Commissioner, in making each assessment, intended to tax exclusively the profits and gains arising from the business of the appellant in Saskatchewan.\nMr. Justice Hudson\u2019s conclusions were in accord, but Chief Justice Duff (with whom Davis and Taschereau JJ. agreed) dissented on the basis that (p. 334):\n* * * under the regulation the subject of income tax is that part of the sales in Saskatchewan which is profit; that is to say, the Whole of the profit received in Saskatchewan * * * I humbly think that this is a procedure wholly inadmissible under the Statute. Nowhere does the Statute authorize the Province of Saskatchewan to tax a manufacturing company, situated as the appellant company is, in respect of the whole of the profits received by the company in Saskatchewan. It is not the profits received in Saskatchewan that are taxable; it is the profits arising from its business in Saskatchewan, not the profits arising from the company\u2019s manufacturing business in Ontario and from the company\u2019s operations in Saskatchewan taken together, but the profits arising from the company\u2019s operations in Saskatchewan.\nIn the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan[32], Chief Justice Turgeon construed the corresponding section in the Saskatchewan statute as applied to the business of a corporation carrying on business in provinces other than Saskatchewan to mean \u201conly the net profits arising from that part of the business of the corporation which is carried on in Saskatchewan.\u201d It would appear that the reasons of all the learned judges in this Court were agreed in principle with that statement. The majority of the learned judges had in mind specifically \u201cmanufacturing profits\u201d as indicated by the foregoing quotation from my lord the Chief Justice (then Rinfret, J.) but construed the regulations as not to include them, while the minority, because in their opinion they did, held them ultra vires. In Commissioners of Taxation v. Kirk[33], the Privy Council considered the provisions of the Land and Income Tax Assessment Act, 1895, of New South Wales. The respondent companies were incorporated in the State of Victoria and had their head offices at Melbourne in the latter state. In 1897, the year in question, the companies carried on mining operations in New South Wales, but the contracts for sale of their product were all made outside of New South Wales. Lord Davey, speaking for the Privy Council, at p. 592 stated:\nThe real question, therefore, seems to be whether any part of these profits were earned or (to use another word also used in the Act) produced in the Colony.\nHe then analyzes the business as follows:\nIt appears to their Lordships that there are four processes in the earning or production of this income\u2014(1) the extraction of the ore from the soil; (2) the conversion of the crude ore into a merchantable product, which is a manufacturing process; (3) the sale of the merchantable product; (4) the receipt of the moneys arising from the sale. All these processes are necessary stages which terminate in money, and the income is the money resulting less the expenses attendant on all the stages.\nThe Supreme Court of New South Wales had decided that there was no income derived or arising or accruing in New South Wales, basing their decision upon one of their earlier cases, Tindal\u2019s case[34]. Lord Davey, in referring to that case, speaks as follows:\nThe fallacy of the judgment of the Supreme Court in this and in Tindal\u2019s case34 is in leaving out of sight the initial stages, and fastening their attention exclusively on the final stage in the production of the income.\nThe Privy Council based their decision upon the words in section 15 (3), \u201cderived from lands of the Crown held under lease\u201d, and the words in section 15 (4), \u201carising or accruing * * * from any other source whatsoever in New South Wales\u201d, and then, referring specifically to the four processes in the earning or production of income, stated:\nThe first process seems to their Lordships clearly within sub-s. 3, and the second or manufacturing process, if not within the meaning of \u201ctrade\u201d in sub-s., 1, is certainly included in the words \u201cany other source whatever\u2019\u2019 in sub-s. 4.\nThe problem in the Kirk case33 was to determine whether income was derived or was arising or accruing (words which were treated as synonymous by the Privy Council) in New South Wales. An analysis of the business carried on disclosed that income was derived and therefore taxable under the provisions of the statute in New South Wales. This case is important because of the analysis of the business and that, notwithstanding contracts of sale were not made in New South Wales, the Privy Council held that income was derived from the initial process within New South Wales, which process, with subsequent operations, produced the product that, when sold, realized the income.\nIn Commissioners of Taxation (N.S.W.) v. Meeks[35], Mr. Justice Isaacs stated:\nNow, the question in the special case in Kirk\u2019s case[36] as Lord Davey is careful to point out in the opening sentence of the judgment, was whether the companies had any income in 1897 taxable in New South Wales\u2014and not whether all the income arising from their contracts was taxable in the State * * * Then, after referring to Tindal\u2019s case[37] he says: \u201cThe question in that case, as here, should have been what income was arising or accruing to Tindal from the business operations carried on by him in the Colony\u201d\u2014that is, what apportionment should be made attributable to New South Wales. And it is because the Privy Council divide the operations of the company into those operations which are carried on in* the State, and those which are not, that the observation is made that the fallacy of the Supreme Court judgment existed in leaving out of sight the initial stages, and fastening their attention exclusively on the final stage in the production of the income.\nThe Kirk case36 is of particular significance because the judgment of the Privy Council was written by Lord Davey who was one of their Lordships in Grainger & Son v. Gough[38], and, referring specifically to that and the case of Sulley v. Attorney-General[39], he states that:\n* * * these cases do not appear to their Lordships to have much to do with a case such as the one before them, where a business is admittedly carried on in this country.\nHe was also one of their Lordships in San Paulo (Brazilian) Ry. Co. v. Carter[40], with regard to which he states at p. 59435:\nIt would have been difficult to say in that case that the profits or income were not to some extent, at any rate, earned in Brazil. Then with respect to the authorities in Great Britain generally, at p. 593 he states:\nThe learned judges refer to some English decisions on the Income Tax Acts of this country, which in language, and to some extent in aim, differ from the Acts now before their Lordships. The language used in the English judgments must of course be understood with reference to the cases then under consideration.\nIn Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain[41], the Underwood Typewriter Company was a Delaware corporation seeking recovery of a tax paid under protest in the State of Connecticut. Connecticut imposed a tax of 2 per cent, upon the net income of the corporation earned during the preceding year from business carried on within the state. The head office of the company was in the City of New York but all its manufacturing was done in Connecticut and it had a branch for selling in Connecticut as well as in other states. A number of questions were raised, including one that it imposed a tax upon the income arising from business conducted beyond the boundaries of the state. Mr. Justice Brandeis stated at p. 120.\nThe profits of the corporation were largely earned by a series of transactions beginning with manufacture in Connecticut and ending with sale in other States. In this it was typical of a large part of the manufacturing business conducted in the State. The legislature in attempting to put upon this business its fair share of the burden of taxation was faced with the impossibility of allocating specifically the profits earned by the processes conducted within its borders. It, therefore, adopted a method of apportionment which, for all that appears in this record, reached, and was meant to reach, only the profits earned within the State * * * There is, consequently, nothing in this record to show that the method of apportionment adopted by the State was inherently arbitrary, or that its application to this corporation produced an unreasonable result.\nIt would, therefore, appear that where statutory limitations are imposed upon the taxing authorities, the principle of apportionment has been approved, as evidenced by the foregoing cases.\nA number of British decisions were cited and it was pointed out that there was a similarity in the language of Schedule D of the Imperial Income Tax Act, 1853 (16 & 17 Vict., c. 34), with that of section 24 of the Manitoba statute, both of which impose a tax upon the non-resident. Schedule D of the Imperial Act reads in part:\n* * * the annual profits or gains arising or accruing to any person * * * although not resident within the United Kingdom, from any * * * trade *.* * exercised within the United Kingdom.\nThe same provision was enacted in Schedule D, 1 (a), of the Income Tax Act, 1918.\nOnce under the foregoing provision it is established that a non-resident is exercising a trade in Great Britain, the annual net profits or gains arising or accruing therefrom are taxable and they are not concerned whether these profits are earned within the boundaries of Great Britain or elsewhere, and therefore the apportionment of the profits earned in Great Britain or elsewhere is never an issue. There are no constitutional limitations upon the taxing power of Parliament in Great Britain.\nIn San Paulo (Brazilian) By. Co. v. Carter[42], the issue was whether the resident company should pay a tax, as provided by section 5, 16 & 17 Vict., c. 34, under the first or the fifth case. If the trade was carried on wholly or partly within Great Britain the tax was imposed under the first case, but if exclusively outside of Great Britain under the fifth case. There the resident company operated a railway in Brazil, and, apart from the control and direction, all the work and the profits were earned in Brazil. It was held, however, that the fact that the control and direction existed in Great Britain that the company was carrying on business in Great Britain and therefore taxable under the first case.\nThese authorities establish that activities and operations other than contracts for sale constitute a carrying on of business and, further, that these respective activities and operations produce or earn income, and therefore, while the income may be realized through the sale, it does not entirely arise from that one activity or operation.\nMoreover, it is clear that a taxing authority, in order to impose an income tax, must have either the person or the source, in this case the business, within its jurisdiction. The Income Tax Acts, however, themselves impose a territorial limit; either that from which the taxable income is derived must be situate in the United Kingdom or the person whose income is to be taxed must be resident there.\nColquhoun v. Brooks[43], Smidth & Co. v. Greenwood[44].\nOperations that have been held to constitute a carrying on of business and which contribute to the income are in this case outside of Manitoba.\nThem from the statute itself it appears, both with respect to residents who are carrying on business outside of the province, and with respect to non-residents who are carrying on business in the province, that a separation or segregation of that business carried on within the province is contemplated. Section 24, in the light of the foregoing authorities and the taxing power of Manitoba, must be construed so that the tax is imposed only on the net profit arising out of that portion of the business which a non-resident carries on in the province of Manitoba.\nThe judgment of the learned trial judge should be restored and the appeal allowed with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed and judgment of the trial judge restored, with costs throughout.\nSolicitors for the appellant: White, Bristol, Gordon, Beck & Phipps and Williams, Dilts, Baker, Laidlaw, Shepard & Hamilton.\nSolicitor for the respondent: R.

Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 86, s. 261; reduction of murder to manslaughter)\u2014\u201cInsult\u201d\u2014Drunkenness of accused as matter for consideration with regard to his acting on the \u201cwrongful act or insult\u201d\u2014Onus of proof as to defences of drunkenness, provocation.\nConviction of appellant of the murder of his wife was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1947] O.R. 332, Roach J.A. dissenting (holding there should be a new trial) on grounds, (1) that there was misdirection and non-direction in the trial judge\u2019s charge to the jury with reference to the defence of provocation, as a result of which the full theory of the defence with respect to provocation was not stated by him to the jury; (2) that he erred in his charge by telling the jury several times that the burden of proof lay upon the accused to satisfy them with respect to his defences of drunkenness and of provocation by a preponderance of evidence, and, though at other times in the charge he gave a correct statement of the law as to the onus of proof, yet it could not be concluded with certainty that the jury must have had a proper understanding of it. Appellant brought tan appeal to this Court, based on those dissents, and also, by leave granted under s. 1025, Cr. Code, on the ground that the decision appealed from conflicted with that of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in Rex v. Harms, 66 Can. Crim. Cas. 134 on the following point: assuming the facts permitted the jury to find that they were \u201csufficient to deprive an ordinary -person of the power of self-control\u201d under s. 261 (2), Cr. Code, may the jury, in deciding whether or not the provocation did in fact produce a passion that led to the fatal act, take into account the actual condition of the accused in respect to drunkenness.\nAt the trial appellant gave evidence, which included evidence of words spoken between himself and his wife and, after a certain answer by his wife, a slap by her on his head, and that he did not remember what happened after that until he was trying to pick her up from the floor.\nHeld: The conviction should be set aside and a new trial held.\nPer The Chief Justice and Kerwin J.: Both grounds of said dissent were rightly taken.\nAs to the first ground: Under s. 261 (3), Cr. Code, it was for the jury to say \u201cwhether or not any particular wrongful act or insult amounts to provocation, and whether or not the person provoked was actually deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation which he received\u201d. The jury were entitled to believe the whole, or part, or none, of appellant\u2019s testimony; if they accepted the whole, they were at least entitled to consider the wife\u2019s answer in connection with the slap; if they accepted only the evidence as to the conversation between appellant and his wife, they were entitled, in view of the word \u201cinsult\u201d in s. 261, to consider whether that was sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control; and these matters were not put to the jury.\nAs to the second ground: Reading in its entirety what the trial judge said to the jury, it is impossible to say that there was no error; the jury did not have such a clear and correct direction as the accused was entitled to; and under all the circumstances it could not be said that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice. The third ground of appeal should not have effect. Should a jury find that what was complained of was sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control, then, in deciding whether the accused was actually so deprived, they are not entitled to take into consideration any alleged drunkenness on the part of the accused. Rex. v. Harms (supra) disapproved on this point.\nPer Taschereau and Kellock JJ.: Appellant should succeed on the first ground of said dissent and also on the third ground of appeal. If the jury believed appellant\u2019s evidence, his wife\u2019s act of slapping him, which was wrongful in itself, was also, against its verbal background (in a meaning which it was open to the jury to give to the words spoken), an \u201cinsult\u201d, within the meaning of that word in s. 261 (2). It was (under s. 261 (3)) for the jury to find (1) as to the sufficiency of the particular wrongful act or insult to cause an ordinary person to be deprived of self-control, and (2) whether appellant was thereby actually deprived of his self-control. In finding on the latter question the jury should consider the effect on appellant\u2019s mind of the intoxication to which he was subject at the time, if they should find he was intoxicated to any degree. Rex v. Harms (supra) approved.\nAs to the erroneous direction several times to the jury as to onus with respect to drunkenness and provocation, and the effect of this upon the jury in view of correct statements of the matter to the jury at other times: As there is to be a new trial, it is sufficient to refer to Woolmington v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1935] A.C. 462, at 481 and 482, where the trial judge\u2019s duty on such matter is clearly defined.\nPer Estey J.: As to the first ground of said dissent: The conversation and the slap (of appellant\u2019s evidence thereon was believed by the jury) would, under all the circumstances, constitute evidence of a \u201cwrongful act or insult\u201d within the meaning of s. 261. An insult may be effected by either words or acts or a combination of both. Appellant\u2019s wife\u2019s words and her act were so closely associated that their meaning and effect could only be determined by considering them together and in relation to all the surrounding circumstances. It was a misdirection to charge the jury in such a way that their consideration was directed to the slap alone.\nAs to the third ground of appeal: If the jury found the \u201cinsult\u201d of such a nature as to be \u201csufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control\u201d, then, in considering whether the accused \u201cacted upon it on the sudden and before there had been time for his passion to cool\u201d, the jury might consider any facts in evidence that might have influenced the accused to act or not to act upon it, including his consumption of liquor and its effect upon him. (The view taken on this point in Rex v. Harms, supra, approved).\nWhether the effect of the trial judge\u2019s repeated misdirection to the jury as to onus of proof was corrected in their minds by his correct statements of the law at other times in his charge, it was not necessary to determine, as a new trial must be had on other grounds above. (The law as to burden of proof in criminal trials stated, with explanatory discussion thereon, and reference to the Woolmington case, supra, at p. 481).\nAPPEAL by the accused from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] dismissing (Roach J.A. dissenting) his appeal from his conviction, at trial before Chevrier J. and a jury, on a charge of murder. The appeal was on grounds of the dissent taken by Roach J.A. (who held there should be a new trial), and also on a ground raised by leave granted under s. 1025 of the Criminal Code (R.S.C. 1927, c. 36). The said grounds are stated in the reasons for judgment in this Court now reported and are indicated in the above headnote.\nG.A. Martin K.C. and W.A. Donohue for the appellant.\nW.B. Common K.C. and W.M. Martin K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and Kerwin J. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014The appellant was convicted of the murder of his wife and that conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeal for Ontario with Mr. Justice Roach dissenting on the ground that there was misdirection and non-direction in the charge of the trial judge with reference to the defence of provocation as a result of which the full theory of the defence with respect to provocation was not put by him to the jury. This is the only ground of dissent stated in the formal judgment, but in his reasons, Mr. Justice Roach also dissented on the ground that the trial judge erred in his charge by telling the jury several times that the burden of proof lay upon the accused to satisfy them with respect to his defence of drunkenness and of provocation by a preponderance of evidence. Although this second ground does not appear in the formal judgment, this Court is entitled to look at the reasons of the dissenting judge: Reinblatt v. The King[2].\nThe appellant appeals from the Order of the Court of Appeal based on these two dissents. By leave of Mr. Justice Rand, granted under section 1025 of the Criminal Code, the appellant also appeals on the ground that the decision a quo conflicts with the decision of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in Rex v. Harms[3] on the point whether, assuming the facts permitted the jury to find that they were sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control under section 261 (2) of the Criminal Code, the jury, in deciding whether or not the provocation did in fact produce a passion that led to the fatal act, might take into account the actual condition of the accused in drunkenness. Mr. Justice Rand treated what was said in this respect by the Chief Justice of Ontario for the majority of the Court of Appeal, not as a mere dictum but as laying down a proposition by which that Court would be subsequently bound. It is open to the Court to come to a contrary conclusion but, upon consideration of the reasons of the Chief Justice, it would appear that he meant his remarks upon the subject to be treated as laying down a binding rule.\nAs there should be a new trial, I mention only such circumstances as are necessary for a determination of the three questions thus raised. At the trial, the appellant testified that, some days before the night his wife received the injuries from which she died, he warned her never to be alone with one Holmes because of something the appellant had witnessed between Holmes and Mrs. Morgan. There was evidence that throughout that night and evening the appellant had been drinking at several places before returning with his wife and Holmes to his own home. At some stage, the appellant\u2019s wife went out of the house. The appellant testified: that, being alone in his house, he heard the sound of a motor car which he stated he recognized as being Holmes\u2019 motor car; that his wife shortly thereafter came in the house and when he asked her \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d, she did not answer; that he said, \u201cYou have been out with Harry Holmes\u201d, to which she replied \u201cSo what? Harry Holmes is all right\u201d,\u2014which, he testified, meant to him that she thought Holmes a better man than he, and when asked in what respect, he answered, \u201cWell, that would depend on how a woman judged a man\u201d; he further testified that when he said to her \u201cYou have been out with Harry Holmes\u201d, he meant that as an accusation of misconduct; upon being asked at the trial what happened after his wife answered \u201cSo what? Harry Holmes is all right\u201d, he replied, \u201cShe walked over to me and slapped me a good one on the side of the head\u201d, he said that he did not remember what happened after that until he was trying to pick his wife up from the floor.\nAs to both drunkenness and provocation, the trial judge several times charged the jury correctly as to the onus remaining throughout upon the Crown to prove a charge of murder beyond a reasonable doubt, but on several occasions he put it as if there were an onus on the accused to make out such a case of drunkenness or provocation as would reduce the crime charged from murder to manslaughter. This was misdirection: Woolmington v. Director of Public Prosecutions[4], and the first general proposition stated by Viscount Simon in Mancini v. Director of Public Prosecutions[5].\nWoolmington\u2019s case4 is concerned with explaining and reinforcing the rule that the prosecution must prove the charge it makes beyond reasonable doubt, and, consequently, that if, on the material before the jury, there is a reasonable doubt, the prisoner should have the benefit of it.\nFinally, after the jury had been out for three hours, they came in and the foreman addressed the judge:\u2014\nIn your address to the jury, you spoke in regards to provocation as regards to the sobriety item, and you spoke of drunkenness as a second item, and it is the end of your remarks. In other words, summarizing your address, you pointed out that we should take all the facts into consideration. Well, we need some guidance in regard to combined provocation and drunkenness.\nThe trial judge replied in part as follows:\u2014\nWell, gentlemen, if you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt the accused is the one who killed Rita Taylor, then you have provocation and drunkenness to look after. If he was provoked to the point that I have indicated, and you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that there was then provocation, that provocation would reduce that to manslaughter. It is true that he proceeded to state the matter in terms that could not be objected to, but in view of the conflicting directions in his charge before the jury retired and of the error in the first part of his answer upon their return,\nIf he was provoked to the point that I have indicated, and you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that there was then provocation, that provocation would reduce that to manslaughter.\nI am forced to the conclusion that the jury did not have such a clear and correct direction as the accused was entitled to. Reading the charge in its entirety and particularly the whole of the trial judge\u2019s answer to the foreman\u2019s question, I find it impossible to say that there was no error. Mr. Justice Roach was, therefore, right in his second ground of dissent, and under all the circumstances I cannot say that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.\nI now turn to Mr. Justice Roach\u2019s first ground of dissent. The criminal law for Canada on the subject of provocation is set out in section 261 of the Criminal Code.\n261. Culpable homicide, which would otherwise be murder, may be reduced to manslaughter if the person who causes death does so in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation.\n2. Any wrongful act or insult, of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control, may be provocation if the offender acts upon it on the sudden, and before there has been time for his passion to cool.\n3. Whether or not any particular wrongful act or insult amounts to provocation, and whether or not the person provoked was actually deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation which he received, shall be questions of fact: Provided that no one shall be held to give provocation to another by doing that which he had a legal right to do, or by doing anything which the offender incited him to do in order to provide the offender with an excuse for killing or doing bodily harm to any person.\n4. The illegality of an arrest shall not necessarily reduce an offence of culpable homicide from murder to manslaughter, but if the illegality was known to the offender it may be evidence of provocation.\nExcept for a few immaterial variations, this is the same as section 176 of the Draft Code prepared by the Criminal Code Commission of 1878-79 in England, which section is set out in the third volume of Stephen\u2019s History of the Criminal Law in England at page 81. A Bill was prepared for enactment to carry out the provisions of the Draft Code and that part of the Commission\u2019s report relating to the provisions of the Draft Code and of the Bill dealing with provocation is set out in Taschereau\u2019s Criminal Code at page 156:\u2014\nThere is no substantial difference between the provisions of the Draft Code and the Bill dealing with provocation, though the language and arrangement differ. Each introduces an alteration of considerable importance into the common law. By the existing law, the infliction of a blow, or the sight by the husband of adultery committed with his wife, may amount to provocation which would reduce murder to manslaughter. It is possible that some other insufferable outrages might be held to have the same effect. There is no definite authoritative rule on the subject, but the authorities for saying that words can never amount to a provocation are weighty. We are of opinion that cases may be imagined where language would give a provocation greater than any ordinary blow. The question whether any particular act falls or not within this line appears to us to be pre\u2011eminently a matter of degree for the consideration of the jury.\nThe Bill was never enacted into law and in England, therefore, the matter is still dealt with at common law. It is in the light of these circumstances that the decisions of the House of Lords in Mancini\u2019s case[6] and in Holmes v. Director of Public Prosecutions[7] must be read.\nIn the enunciation of the second general proposition in the Mancini case6 it is said:\u2014\nIf the evidence before the jury at the end of the case does not contain material on which a reasonable man could find a verdict of manslaughter instead of murder, it is no defect in the summing-up that manslaughter is not dealt with.\nThat may be taken as generally true in Canada in the sense that in order to raise a question of manslaughter there must be some foundation for it at the trial. That is true also in so far as provocation is concerned, subject to the express terms of section 261 of the Code. Earlier in the Mancini case6 (at p. 10), Viscount Simon had stated:\u2014\nIn that view [i.e., that Mancini\u2019s story was rejected] the only knife used in the struggle was the appellant\u2019s dagger, and this followed Distleman\u2019s coming at him and aiming a blow with his hand or fist. Such action by Distleman would not constitute provocation of a kind which could extenuate the sudden introduction and use of a lethal weapon like this dagger, and there was, therefore, on the assumption that the appellant\u2019s evidence was rejected, no adequate material to raise the issue of provocation.\nThe position at common law is again set forth in Holmes\u2019 case7, at page 597:\u2014\nIf there is no sufficient material, even on a view of the evidence most favourable to the accused, for a jury (which means a reasonable jury) to form the view that a reasonable person so provoked could be driven, through transport of passion and loss of self-control, to the degree and method and continuance of violence which produces the death it is the duty of the judge as matter of law to direct the jury that the evidence does not support a verdict of manslaughter.\nThus at common law the House of Lords has declared that it is the province of the judge to decide whether there is any evidence of provocation proper to be dealt with by the jury, but for Canada subsection 3 of section 261 of our Code provides:\u2014\nWhether or not any particular wrongful act or insult amounts to provocation, and whether or not the person provoked was actually deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation which he received, shall be questions of fact.\nThis is not to say that in a proper case the trial judge should not draw the jury\u2019s attention to the nature of the provocation and the mode of resentment and ask them to consider whether the latter bears a reasonable relation to the provocation, but the subsection clearly enacts that it is not the province of the judge to decide such matters.\nThe Chief Justice of Ontario considered that the wife of the appellant repudiated the latter\u2019s implied accusation, and continues:\u2014\nIn the circumstances I am strongly of the opinion that her words and conduct in so doing did not constitute provocation within section 261. They were the answer to be expected from a woman of any spirit to an unfounded charge of infidelity made by a husband who himself had been so occupied with his drink that he did not know even where she was. In my opinion there was no evidence to go to the jury in this case that would support the plea of provocation set up by the appellant.\nThe issue, however, was raised, so that it cannot be said that there was no foundation for it, and the meaning to be ascribed to the wife\u2019s equivocal answer to the appellant\u2019s query, taken in conjunction with the slap, was for the jury. As is pointed out in the extract from the report of the English Criminal Code Commission set out above:\u2014\nThe question whether any particular act falls or not within this line appears to us to be pre-eminently a matter of degree for the consideration of the jury.\nAnd the matter is thus put by Sir Lyman Duff, speaking for this Court in The King v. Manchuk[8]:\u2014\nWe think it was a question for the jury whether (a) the acts relied upon as constituting provocation were calculated to deprive an ordinary man of self-control to such an extent as to cause an attack upon Mrs. Seabright of such a character as that delivered by the accused.\nViscount Simon stated in the Holmes\u2019 case[9] at page 600 that it was not necessary to decide whether there were any conceivable circumstances accompanying the use of words without actual violence, which would justify the leaving to a jury of the issue of manslaughter as against murder, but continued:\u2014\nIt is enough to say that the duty of the judge at the trial, in relevant cases, is to tell the jury that a confession of adultery without more is never sufficient to reduce an offence which would otherwise be murder to manslaughter, and that in no case could words alone, save in circumstances of a most extreme and exceptional character, so reduce the crime. When words alone are relied upon in extenuation, the duty rests on the judge to consider whether they are of this violently provocative character, and if he is satisfied that they cannot reasonably be so regarded, to direct the jury accordingly.\nThe wording of our Code, however, is \u201cany wrongful act or insult\u201d, and the word \u201cinsult\u201d, as generally understood and as defined in standard dictionaries, includes language as distinct from acts: Rex v. Krawchuk[10]. The reason for the recommendation of the English Criminal Code Commission is expressed as follows:\u2014\nWe are of opinion that cases may be imagined where language would give a provocation greater than any ordinary blow.\nand our Code follows the Draft Code and Bill.\nThe jury were entitled to believe the whole, or part, or none, of the accused\u2019s testimony. If they accepted it in its entirety, they were at least entitled to consider the wife\u2019s answer in connection with the slap, and, if they accepted only the evidence relating to the conversation between the appellant and his wife, they were entitled, in view of the word \u201cinsult\u201d, to consider whether that was sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control. These matters were not put to the jury, and the first ground of dissent by Roach J.A., is, therefore, well taken.\nI pass to the conflict between the decision of the Court of Appeal in this case and that of the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in the Harms case[11]. The argument, that the jury should have been directed that if they came to the conclusion that what was complained of was sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control, they then, in deciding whether the appellant was actually so deprived, must consider the alleged drunkenness of the appellant, cannot, in my view, prevail. It is important to refer again to subsection 2 of section 261 of the Code:\u2014\n2. Any wrongful act or insult, of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control, may be provocation if the offender acts upon it on the sudden, and before there has been time for his passion to cool.\nThe criterion is the effect on an ordinary person. It is true that a trial judge must at some stage ask the jury whether the accused was actually deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation which he received, because there may be cases where, because of evidence of ill-will before the provocation or other circumstances, it would be open to the jury to find that the accused did not so act. However, in coming to a conclusion on that point, the jury is not entitled to take into consideration any alleged drunkenness on the part of the accused. In my opinion, the matter is tersely and correctly put by Roach J.A., when he says that the argument on behalf of the appellant is tantamount to saying\nthe act or insult on which I rely would have caused an ordinary man to lose his self\u2011control but not me. The only reason I lost my self-control was because I was drunk.\nThe decision on this point in the Harms case11 cannot be supported.\nThe appeal should be allowed, the order of the Court of Appeal and the conviction set aside, and a new trial directed.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Kellock, JJ., was delivered by\nKELLOCK J.\u2014The appellant was convicted on a charge of murdering his wife. His appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario was dismissed, Roach J.A. dissenting. This appeal comes to this Court on two questions of law pursuant to section 1023 of the Criminal Code, namely, alleged misdirection in regard to provocation and alleged misdirection and non-direction with respect to the burden of proof. There is a further question raised pursuant to leave granted under section 1025, as to alleged conflict between the judgment in appeal and the decision of the Court of Appeal of Saskatchewan in Rex v. Harms11. Mr. Common submits that, notwithstanding the leave, this last point is not open as there is in fact no conflict. It will be convenient to consider this point first.\nThe way the matter is put is that the basis of the judgment in appeal is that there was no evidence of provocation and therefore anything said in relation to the decision in the Harms case11 was obiter. While in the judgment of the majority it is stated, not once but twice, that there is no evidence of provocation, the point arising in the Harms case11 is dealt with as a distinct ground of appeal and is decided adversely to the appellant. I think, therefore, that the point was a ground of decision and that conflict has been shown accordingly.\nProvocation is governed by section 261 of the Code. By subs. 1, the provocation with which the section deals is sudden provocation, and the offender also must himself have acted \u201cupon the sudden\u201d. By subs. 2 \u201cany\u201d wrongful act or insult may be provocation if of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control but only if the offender acts thereon. The question, however, as to whether or not there is any evidence is for the court, but, subject to that, it is provided by subs. 3 that the above two matters are both questions of fact for the jury, namely:\n(1) the sufficiency of the particular wrongful act or insult to cause an ordinary person to be deprived of self-control, and\n(2) whether the accused was actually deprived of his self-control by such act or insult.\nTo appreciate the matters in controversy, it is necessary to state shortly the relevant facts. I quote from the reasons for judgment of Roach J.A. in the Court of Appeal:\nRita Taylor was the wife of the accused. Together they resided in a residence which was originally intended as a summer cabin, but which, due to a housing shortage, was occupied the year round, at a place called Baxter\u2019s Beach on the Canadian shore of the St. Clair River a few miles outside the city of Sarnia. The accused was employed as a labourer at a foundry in or near the city of Sarnia. On Friday, November 29th, he quit work at noon and went to his home. In the afternoon he and his wife went into the city of Sarnia where he, at least, did some shopping and later they went together to the beverage room of a local hotel. There an orgy of drinking commenced which was not concluded until somewhere around midnight out at Baxter\u2019s Beach.\nIn the hotel the accused met a man called Holmes, and he joined the accused and his wife at the latter\u2019s table in the beverage room. The accused did not have a motor car; Holmes did. Towards the end of the afternoon Holmes suggested that he would drive the accused and his wife to their home at Baxter\u2019s Beach. Before leaving the city, however, and shortly before 6 o\u2019clock, Holmes and the accused went to a local wine shop and purchased between them four bottles of cheap wine. Then Holmes drove the accused and his wife to their home at the beach where all three proceeded to drink the wine. Early in the evening a neighbour called Goodwin from a nearby cabin joined them. While he was present, and about 9 o\u2019clock, the appellant and his wife got into an argument and they went into an adjoining bedroom. There is some evidence of scuffling in the bedroom. The appellant emerged from that room and said that he had given his wife a few \u201crabbit punches\u201d. The accused states that the argument developed as a result of the wife\u2019s intoxicated condition, and his insistence that she should go to bed. Whatever were the nature of the \u201crabbit punches\u201d the wife was not perceptibly hurt. She remained in the bedroom and the three men went to Goodwin\u2019s cabin, where the fourth and last bottle of wine was consumed. Some little time later and while the men were still there, the appellant\u2019s wife came over to Goodwin\u2019s cabin and joined them. The wine having been exhausted, Holmes and the appellant and his wife drove in Holmes\u2019 car to a bootlegger\u2019s place where they drank beer. Leaving the bootlegger\u2019s place they returned to the appellant\u2019s cabin, apparently, about 11 o\u2019clock or a little later, bringing with them three bottles of beer. Holmes and the appellant went into the cabin but the wife apparently remained outside in the car. Holmes and the appellant finished the beer and Holmes left about midnight.\nThe appellant stated in evidence that the next he recalls was when he awoke and found himself on his bed dressed only in a new suit of underwear which he had purchased that afternoon. He had no recollection of having put on that underwear. He states that he was awakened by the cold; he got up and realized that his wife was not there.\nWhen Holmes arrived at his car he found the wife half asleep\u2014in a doze in the back seat. There was some conversation between them which was not admissible in evidence, but as a result of which Holmes and the wife drove around the country-side over a circuitous route and returned to the neighbourhood of the accused\u2019s cabin about one o\u2019clock. They stopped on the highway about a quarter of a mile from the Taylor cabin. There the wife got out and walked home.\nI should here interject that the appellant swore in evidence that some days earlier he and this wife had some conversation about Holmes, during which conversation he told her never to be alone with Holmes because of an \u201cincident\u201d he had seen take place between Holmes and a Mrs. Morgan who lived in a nearby cabin. Mrs. Morgan was a Crown witness and on cross-examination she said that sometime earlier she had told both Taylor and his wife that Holmes had tried to get \u201cfresh\u201d with her and to have sexual intercourse with her.\nAs to what happened when the wife arrived at the cabin in the early hour of the morning in question, we have only the appellant\u2019s word. In the evidence he stated that he heard the noise from Holmes\u2019 car. He identified that noise as coming from Holmes\u2019 oar because of the fact that apparently the car was lacking a muffler and made a terrific noise. Realizing that his wife was not in the cabin, he concluded that she was with Holmes. His evidence of what happened on her return is most important, and is as follows: \u201cQ. What, then, was your reaction on hearing this car, realizing that your wife was away from the cabin? A. I was getting a little mad, sir. Q. Now, what happened after that? A. My wife came in the back door. I went out in the kitchen. I said, \u2018Where have you been?\u2019 I got no answer. I said, \u2018You have been out with Harry Holmes.\u2019 Her answer to that was, \u2018So what? Harry Holmes is all right.\u2019 Q. Now, what did that convey to you, Mr. Taylor? A. She thought him a better man than me. Q. In what respect? A. Well, that would depend on how a woman judged a man. Q. What did you mean by saying to her, \u2018You have been out with Harry Holmes?\u2019 Was it an accusation you were making against her? A. It was. Q. Was it an accusation of misconduct with Holmes? A. It was. Q. And her answer was, \u2018So what? Harry Holmes is all right.\u2019 Is that right? A. That is right, sir. Q. What happened after that? A. She walked over to me and slapped me a good one on the side of the head. Q. Now, Mr. Taylor, do you know what happened from there on? A. I do not, sir. Q. What was the next thing chat you remember? A. I was trying to pick my wife up, and I didn\u2019t have the strength. Q. Have you any consciousness of the passage of time between that last incident of the slap and the time you tried to pick your wife up? A. I had not, sir.\u201d\nIn the interval during which he swore he had no recollection of what was happening, there can be no doubt that he caused his wife most serious and grievous bodily injuries. He broke a chair over her head or body, and probably struck her head with his fists. The attack can best be described as maniacal.\nSometime about one-thirty o\u2019clock that morning the accused came to one of the nearby cabins and aroused the occupants. They got up and went with the accused to his cabin where they found the wife on the floor with frightful injuries to her head and bleeding profusely. A doctor was called and later an ambulance and the wife was rushed to the hospital. She died the following afternoon as a result of her injuries.\nIn these circumstances, the first question which arises is, what is the matter in evidence upon which, if believed, the accused was entitled to rely as constituting provocation within the meaning of the statute. The learned trial judge in his charge, upheld by the majority below, directed the jury that they could consider only the slap in the face and not what was said by the deceased wife, taking the view that, as to the words spoken, the point was covered by the decision of the House of Lords in Holmes v. Director of Public Prosecutions[12]. Roach J.A. was of opinion that the Holmes case12 had no application and that:\nIn my opinion it was grave error to instruct the jury in that fashion and the result was that the whole theory of the defence was not put to the jury. The theory of the defence was not that the accused was provoked within the meaning of s. 261 by the mere slap; the theory was that he was thus provoked by the slapping coupled with the words spoken almost contemporaneously therewith and all the surrounding circumstances.\nAs to the Holmes case12, it is first to be observed that it is not a decision under a statute but upon the common law. The actual decision that the words spoken in that case, namely, the confession of the wife that she had been unfaithful, standing by themselves did not amount to provocation, does not apply, in my opinion, to the case at bar. The words spoken by the deceased were not the same as the words in question in the Holmes case12, and, moreover, they do not stand by themselves. Further, the statement of Viscount Simon that\nin no case could words alone, save in circumstances of a most extreme and exceptional character, so reduce the crime,\ni.e. from murder to manslaughter, requires to be placed against the language of the statute \u201cany insult\u201d, and, so viewed, cannot in my opinion, be a correct statement under the Code. They were not intended to be.\nIn the present case, the husband said to the wife \u201cYou have been out with Harry Holmes\u201d. At the least that amounted to a statement that she had disregarded his injunction given previously, but it was also open to the jury to interpret it as an accusation of misconduct with Holmes. On the answer of the wife \u201cSo what? Harry Holmes is all right\u201d, in my opinion, it was open to the jury to believe that \u201cSo what?\u201d meant either \u201cEven if that be so\u201d or \u201cIt is so, what are you going to do about it?\u201d or \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do about it\u201d. \u201cInsult\u201d is defined in \u201cThe Oxford English Dictionary\u201d inter alia, as\nan act, or the action, of attacking or assailing; an open and sudden attack or assault without formal preparations; injuriously contemptuous speech or behaviour; scornful utterance or action intended to wound self-respect; an affront; indignity.\nIn my opinion the act of slapping, which was wrongful in itself, was also, against its verbal background, an insult. I therefore agree with Roach J.A. on this branch of the case.\nComing to the second question, the learned trial judge refused to direct the jury that the fact that the accused was intoxicated to such degree, if any, as they might find, was a matter which they might consider in determining whether or not the accused\nwas actually deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation which he received.\nAll the members of the Court of Appeal considered that there was no error in this respect, the view of the majority being that any such direction would be in conflict with the decision of the House of Lords in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Beard[13]. This view was not accepted by the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan in the Harms case[14]. That Court regarded the Beard case13 as approving the direction of Baron Parke in Rex v. Thomas[15], which was applied in the Harms case14. That direction was as follows:\nBut drunkenness may be taken into consideration in cases where what the law deems sufficient provocation has been given, because the question is, in such cases whether the fatal act is to be attributed to the passion of anger excited by the previous provocation, and that passion is more easily excitable in a person when in a state of intoxication than when he is sober.\nIn support of the judgment in appeal Mr. Common submits that the third proposition laid down by Lord Birkenhead in Beard\u2019s case[16] is in conflict with the direction of Parke B. That proposition, to be found at p. 502, is as follows:\n3. That evidence of drunkenness falling short of a proved incapacity in the accused to form the intent necessary to constitute the crime, and merely establishing that his mind was affected by drink so that he more readily gave way to some violent passion, does not rebut the presumption that a man intends the natural consequences of his acts.\nFor my part I am unable to see anything in the language which is in conflict with the law as laid down in Rex v. Thomas[17]. The third proposition in Beard\u2019s case16 draws the line between drunkenness of such a nature that capacity to form the necessary intent is absent, and drunkenness of a lesser degree. A person doing an act resulting in death while drunk to the greater extent, is guilty of manslaughter only, whether provoked or not. If drunk to the lesser degree, the same act may be reduced from murder to manslaughter if committed under provocation as defined in section 261. Intent in the last mentioned case is present at the time, because there is no lack of capacity, and it cannot be said that a person free from alcohol who acts in passion due to provocation lacked intent at the time although then deprived of his self-control due to the passion which has been provoked. In Woolmington\u2019s case[18], Viscount Sankey, L.C., said at 482:\nWhen evidence of death and malice has been given (this is a question for the jury) the accused is entitled to show, by evidence or by examination of the circumstances adduced by the Crown that the act on his part which caused death was either unintentional or provoked.\nLack of intention, then, is not an element in the application of section 261, and therefore the third proposition in Beard\u2019s case16 does not apply to it. In truth the proposition deals and deals only with drunkenness as a defence and not with the aspect under consideration in Rex v. Thomas17. I am unable to find anything in Lord Birkenhead\u2019s reference to Rex v. Thomas21 which throws doubt upon the soundness of that decision, and I find it still cited as an authority in the Hailsham Edition of Halsbury, Vol. 9, p. 439, as well as in Russell on Crime, the 9th Edition, p. 39. In Stephen\u2019s Digest of the Criminal Law, p. 231, Art. 317, the following is stated:\nProvocation does not extenuate the guilt of homicide unless the person provoked is at the time when he does the act deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation which he has received; and in deciding the question whether this was or was not the case, regard must be had to the nature of the act by which the offender causes death, to the time which elapsed between the provocation and the act which caused death, to the offender\u2019s conduct during that interval, and to all other circumstances tending to show the state of his mind.\nIf intoxication to any degree is a circumstance which may tend to affect the mind of a person, and it is generally agreed it is, then, if Stephen J. be right, the jury must consider the effect on the mind of the offender of the intoxication to which he was subject at the time if they find he was intoxicated to any degree. That the proposition as stated by Stephen J. correctly states the common law is established by the fact that it was cited with approval by the House of Lords in Mancini v. Director of Public Prosecutions[19]. The statement in the judgment of Viscount Simon on the same page as to the relationship between the mode of resentment and the provocation reserved is not, under the Code, a matter of law, but a matter to be considered by the jury when determining whether or not the accused acted as he did by reason of the provocation. As put by Stephen J. in the passage already quoted,\nregard must be had to the nature of the act by which the offender causes death.\nIn my opinion, therefore, the Harms case[20] was rightly decided. It is admitted, this being so, that the charge cannot be supported on this branch of the case.\nIf the jury be directed to disregard any degree of intoxication to which they may believe the accused was subject at the time, the result will be that the question which they will be considering is whether the accused, if he had not been intoxicated, would have acted on the provocation, instead of the question directed by the statute, namely, whether the accused in his then actual state of mind so acted.\nThere remains the question as to the admittedly erroneous direction of the learned trial judge to the jury, repeated on several occasions, as to the matter of onus with respect to both drunkenness and provocation. There was considerable argument as to the effect of this upon the jury in view of the fact that upon other occasions the learned trial judge stated the matter correctly. In view of the fact that there is to be a new trial, it will perhaps be sufficient to say that the duty of a judge presiding at a criminal trial with respect to this matter is clearly defined in Woolmington\u2019s case[21] at pages 481 and 482. If the law as there laid down is followed at the new trial, as no doubt it will be, there should be no further difficulty on this point.I would allow the appeal and direct a new trial.\nESTEY J.\u2014The accused, convicted for the murder of his wife, appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario. At his trial, apart from contending that he had not committed the offence, he pleaded drunkenness and provocation as separate grounds for reducing the offence to manslaughter. The majority of the Court of Appeal affirmed the con- viction, but Mr. Justice Roach dissented on the basis that the learned trial judge had misdirected the jury as to what constituted evidence of provocation and as to the burden of proof both with respect to drunkenness and provocation.\nThis appeal is taken under section 1023 of the Criminal Code upon those points raised in the dissenting judgment and on a further point as a consequence of leave granted under section 1025 of the Criminal Code on the basis of possible conflict between the decision of the majority of the Court of Appeal in this case and that of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in Rex v. Harms20.\nThe evidence disclosed that the accused, his wife and Harry Holmes had been drinking downtown in the afternoon of November 29, 1946, that in the late afternoon they had all gone to the home of the accused in Harry Holmes\u2019 car. Harry Holmes remained there and all three continued drinking. During the evening they visited two homes and returned to the home of the accused around 11 o\u2019clock. Sometime thereafter the accused fell asleep on his bed. When he later awoke, he was alone in the house.\nIn a few minutes he heard a car upon the road and from its noise concluded it was the car of Harry Holmes. As he had warned his wife not to be alone with Harry Holmes, this made him a \u201clittle mad\u201d. In a few minutes his wife came in the back door, and to his inquiry as to where she had been she made no reply. He then, as he deposed, accused her of improper conduct in these words: \u201cYou have been out with Harry Holmes\u201d. Her reply was: \u201cSo what? Harry Holmes is all right\u201d and with that he says \u201cshe walked over to me and slapped me a good one on the side of the head.\u201d He deposed that as to what followed he had no recollection. Harry Holmes deposed that after the accused went to sleep, he went out to his car and found Mrs. Taylor there, that she refused to get out of the car and that as a result they drove around for some time and then she went home and he continued to his home.\nAt about 1.30 a.m. the accused called at his neighbour, Morgan\u2019s, for assistance. Mr. and Mrs. Morgan went at once to his home where they found Mrs. Taylor unconscious and bleeding as a result of a brutal attack, as a consequences of which she died later the same day. With deference to the learned judges who hold a contrary opinion, it would appear that the conversation and the slap here deposed to, if believed, would under all the circumstances constitute evidence of a \u201cwrongful act or insult\u201d from which the jury might find provocation within the meaning of section 261 of the Criminal Code.\nHis Lordship charged the jury that the slap in the face alone could be considered as evidence of provocation and that the foregoing words and their implication of immorality did not constitute evidence of provocation and must be disregarded in the consideration of that issue. This direction is based on statements similar in effect in the decisions at common law, more recently discussed in Holmes v. Director of Public Prosecutions[22], where it would appear that even at common law there is some qualification to the general statement that mere words cannot constitute evidence of provocation.\nWe need not here, however, discuss the precise statement of the common law. Parliament, in enacting section 261 of the Criminal Code, has declared the law with respect to provocation in Canada:\n261. (Provocation) Culpable homicide, which would otherwise be murder, may be reduced to manslaughter if the person who causes death does so in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation.\n2. (What is provocation) Any wrongful act or insult, of such a nature as to; be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control, may be provocation if the offender acts upon it on the sudden, and before there has been time for his passion to cool.\n3. (Question of fact) Whether or not any particular wrongful act or insult amounts to provocation, and whether or not the person provoked was actually deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation which he received, shall be questions of fact: Provided that no one shall be held to give provocation to another by doing that which he had a legal right to do, or by doing anything which the offender incited him to do in order to provide the offender with an excuse for killing or doing bodily harm to any person.\n4. (Illegal arrest) The illegality of an arrest shall not necessarily reduce an offence of culpable homicide from murder to manslaughter, but if the illegality was known to the offender it may be evidence of provocation.\nUnder this section, when there is evidence of \u201cany wrongful act or insult\u201d it is for the jury to determine whether it is\nof such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control. If, therefore, there is any evidence of any wrongful act or insult, this must be submitted to the jury in such a fair and complete manner that the jury will appreciate the law, and the evidence in relation to that issue.\nUnder this section 261 an insult may constitute provocation, and an insult may be effected by either words or acts or a combination of both. In the case at bar, the words of Mrs. Taylor and her act were so closely associated that their meaning and effect can only be determined by considering them together and in relation to all the surrounding circumstances. This evidence adduced by the accused himself may or may not be true, but that is entirely a question for the jury. The only concern of the appellate court is the right of the accused to have his defence, so far as it is supported in the evidence, fairly and fully placed before the jury. It was, with respect, a misdirection to segregate the slap from the words and direct the jury that the slap alone should be considered in determining whether there was sufficient provocation within the meaning of section 261.\nIf the jury found that this insult was\nof such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self\u2011control,\nthen that insult was in this case provocation. If and when the jury found such provocation, it was then their duty under section 261 to consider whether the accused acted \u201cupon it on the sudden\u201d and before there had been time for his passion to cool, or, as stated by Chief Justice Duff in The King v. Manchuk[23]:\nWe think it was a question for the jury * * * whether in fact the accused was by reason of what occurred deprived of his self-control to such a degree; and in his attack * * * was acting upon such provocation on a sudden and before his passion had time to cool * * *\nIn determining this question whether the accused acted on the sudden upon this provocation, the jury must consider the conduct of the accused himself as distinguished from the conduct of the ordinary man. Upon this question or issue the jury may consider any facts in evidence that may have influenced the accused to act or not to act upon that provocation already found by them. His consumption of liquor and its effect upon him may be taken into con- sideration upon the second question where his own conduct is under consideration, but not upon the first question where the standard is that the wrongful act or insult must be such as to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control in order to constitute provocation.\nThat was the view expressed in Rex v. Harms[24]. It was submitted at the hearing that Director of Public Prosecutions v. Beard[25] was contrary to Rex v. Harms24. In the Beard case25, the House of Lords was considering the defence of drunkenness as evidence of inability to form the intent essential in the crime of murder. Drunkenness in relation to its effect upon the action of one who had suffered provocation within the meaning of the law was not an issue nor was it discussed further than a mere reference thereto. Rex v. Thomas[26], cited in support of the reasons in Rex v. Harms24, is mentioned along with certain other authorities in the Beard case25 where the Lord Chancellor, in referring particularly to these cases, states at p. 497:\nThe judgments however in these cases diverged into topics not specifically helpful in the matter now under debate.\nWith geat respect, I do not find the suggested conflict between the Beard[27] and the Harms[28] cases.\nThe charge of the learned trial judge relative to drunkenness sufficient to render the accused unable to form the intent essential in the crime of murder was not questioned before this Court further than with respect to the burden of proof both as to the defence of drunkenness and provocation. It was contended, as Mr. Justice Roach held, the learned trial judge had instructed the jury that the burden of proof rested upon the accused to prove either of these defences by a preponderance of evidence. The learned judge pointed out that this burden upon the accused was not so great as to require that he prove his drunken condition beyond a reasonable doubt, but he repeated at different times in the course of his charge that the accused must prove either of these defences by preponderance of evidence. With respect, this constituted a misdirection. However, about as often as this direction was given, it was offset by a correct statement that throughout the entire trial the burden rested upon the Crown to prove the accused guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Whether, therefore, the effect of the misdirection upon this point was corrected in the minds of the jury we need not here determine, as a new trial must be had upon the basis already discussed with respect to provocation. It is sufficient to emphasize that, apart from the defence of insanity and a statutory provision with respect to the burden of proof, the burden of proof rests always and throughout the entire case upon the Crown to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. The evidence favourable to the accused, either as found in the evidence adduced by the Crown or adduced on his own behalf, may be sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury. The position is that if after all the evidence, both for the Crown and the defence, has been seriously considered, the jury is unable to conclude that the evidence establishes the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, then he is entitled to a verdict of not guilty.\nIn Woolmington v. The Director of Public Prosecutions[29], Lord Sankey at p. 481 states:\n* * * it is not till the end of the evidence that a verdict can properly be found and that at the end of the evidence it is not for the prisoner to establish his innocence, but for the prosecution to establish his guilt. Just as there is evidence on behalf of the prosecution so there may be evidence on behalf of the prisoner which may cause a doubt as to his guilt. In either case, he is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. But while the prosecution must prove the guilt of the prisoner, there is no such burden laid on the prisoner to prove his innocence and it is sufficient for him to raise a doubt as to his guilt; he is not bound to satisfy the jury of his innocence.\nSee also Mancini v. Director of Public Prosecutions[30].\nIn the result, a new trial must be held.

Sound of a buzzer indicated a police raid. The appellant became excited, ran to a screen door which was fastened by a hook, unhooked it, shoved it open and stepped out; and, since there was no stairway, he fell and suffered serious injuries. The appellant\u2019s action for damages was maintained by the trial judge; but the Court of Appeal held that the appellant could not recover, on the ground that he was on the premises, not lawfully, but for a criminal purpose, and that respondents owed him no duty that a court of justice would recognize to provide against such an emergency. Upon appeal to this Court,\nHeld that the judgment of the Court of Appeal should be affirmed but on different grounds than those upon which that Court proceeded.\u2014Assuming that the appellant was an invitee upon the premises of the respondents and that a duty was owed to him by them, it was incumbent upon the appellant to use reasonable care for his own safety. The duty on the part of the respondents towards the appellant cannot be extended to include responsibility, in the circumstances surrounding the manner in which the appellant used the premises in making his exit.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1], reversing a judgment of the Supreme Court of Ontario, Le Bel J.[2] and dismissing an action of the appellant for damages for injuries suffered in a fall from premises occupied by the respondents.\nJ.A. Kennedy for the appellant.\nG.A. Martin K.C. and Ralph Sweet for the respondent. The judgment of the Court was delivered by\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014This appeal was dismissed on the hearing without calling upon counsel for the respondents but we intimated that we must not be taken as approving the grounds upon which the Court below proceeded. Assuming without deciding that Mr. Kennedy is right in his contention that the appellant was an invitee upon the premises of the respondents, and that they were under the duty toward him which that relationship cast upon them, it was incumbent upon the appellant to use reasonable care for his own safety.\nOn the alarm being given, the appellant, believing that a raid by the police was in progress, became excited, as did the other inmates, and in order to avoid arrest ran to the screen door which, according to the finding below, with which we agree, was fastened by a hook. The appellant unhooked the door, shoved it open and stepped out, apparently without looking, on the assumption that the door led to a stairway on the outside of the building of which the premises here in question form a part. There was a stairway on the outside of the building which the appellant had casually observed previously, but it did not lead to the door in question nor to any other door on that side of the building but to the rear of the upper part of the building on quite a different level. The appellant had never used the stairway in question and even if, as found by the learned trial judge, he was justified in believing that the doorway led to the stairway, we think that this action must fail. We do not think that the duty on the part of the respondents toward the appellant even as invitee can be extended to include responsibility in the circumstances surrounding the manner in which the appellant used the premises in making his exit.

In the foyer, a narrow corridor, the lights were dimmed, and, proceeding along the wall at her left, she opened an unlocked door, which she thought was leading to the waiting room, but which led to a stairway into the basement. The appellant fell down the stairs and was injured. In an action for damages, the jury found that the injuries were caused by an unusual danger consisting in the unlocked door and that the respondent failed to use reasonable care to prevent injury from that danger because of an inadequate sign on the door and of lack of \u201cfacilities to fasten door in a safe and secure manner.\u201d The jury further found that the appellant did not use reasonable care for her own safety in that she did not use proper caution in proceeding after opening the door. The degree of contribution to the accident was found to be 90% against the respondent and 10% against the appellant. Judgment was directed accordingly by the trial judge. The appellate court reversed that judgment and dismissed the action, holding that the finding against the appellant established a case of ultimate negligence by reason of which she must be taken to be the author of her own injuries.\nHeld that the appeal to this Court should be allowed and the judgment at the trial be restored. The doctrine of ultimate negligence does not apply under the circumstances of this case.\u2014There was evidence upon which the finding of the jury against the respondent could have been made.\nPer The Chief Justice and Kerwin, Rand and Estey JJ.:\u2014The danger in the door was not because it was unlocked, but because it opened in effect into a pit; and the finding of negligence against the respondent is a finding that the conditions in the theatre were such as to invite a patron using ordinary care to mistake the door into the basement for that into the ladies\u2019 room and to draw him into the vortex of danger behind the door. The finding of negligence on the part of the appellant cannot be taken to supersede the negligence on the part of the respondent. Per The Chief Justice and Kerwin, Rand and Estey JJ.:\u2014The facts in this case raised more than the ordinary question of the duty owed by a proprietor of premises towards an invitee.\u2014The appellant paid a consideration for the privileges of the theatre, including that of making use of the ladies\u2019 room. There was a contractual relation between her and the theatre management that exercising prudence herself she might enjoy those privileges without risk of danger so far as reasonable care could make the premises safe.\nPer Kellock J.:\u2014The finding of negligence against the respondent was that the thing, which was the effective cause of the appellant getting beyond the door at all, was the invitation created by the surroundings. The force of that invitation, when acted on as it was, continued to operate up to the point of injury although aided by the appellant\u2019s own negligence. These two negligences cannot be separated so as to conclude that the negligence of the appellant was of such a character that that of the respondent became mere narrative.\nJudgment of the Court of Appeal ([1946] O.R. 454) reversed.\nGreisman v.

Walker K.C. for the appellants.\nG.W. Adams K.C. and R.B. Burgess for the respondent.\nThe judgment of The Chief Justice and of Kerwin, Rand and Estey JJ. was delivered by\nRAND J.:\u2014The appellant, Margaret Brown, was injured by falling down a stairway in a theatre in Toronto. After passing through a brightly lighted lobby, she entered the foyer, intending to go to the ladies\u2019 room. This was on the left of the entrance and was indicated by a short electric sign 7\u2019 high facing her as she turned. In the foyer, a narrow corridor, the lights were dimmed; and, proceeding along the wall at her left, she opened what she took to be the door to the waiting room. A fire extinguisher 2\u2019 long and 4\u2019 from the floor hung on the wall next to the left side of the door; and at the right side was a post or panel 7\u201d wide, projecting about 4\u201d out from the wall; the door, 31\u201d wide, swinging toward the left, on which the word \u201cPrivate\u201d was printed in faint letters, was between three and four feet in front of the sign and led to a stairway into the basement. The platform or landing was about 24\u201d deep and the door must have swung somewhat before the edge would be brought into view. Immediately inside on the wall at the right and on a level with her eyes, was a light which, on her story, momentarily blinded her. The entrance to the ladies\u2019 room was separated from this door by the post or panel.\nOn these facts, the jury made two findings (paraphrased):\n(1) That the injuries to the plaintiff were caused by an unusual danger on the defendant\u2019s premises of which the latter knew or ought to have known, consisting in the unlocked door; and that the defendant failed to use reasonable care to prevent injury from that danger because of an inadequate sign on the door, of lack of additional protection on the unlocked door, and because there were not proper facilities to fasten the door in a safe and secure manner.\n(2) That Mrs. Brown did not use reasonable care for her own safety in that she did not use proper caution in proceeding after opening the door.\nIt was further found that the degree of contribution to the accident of the defendant was 90% and Mrs. Brown 10%.\nAt the trial, judgment was directed in accordance with these percentages of responsibility. On appeal, it was held that the finding against Mrs. Brown established a case of ultimate negligence by reason of which she must be taken to be the author of her own injuries, and the action was ordered dismissed. Laidlaw J.A. was also of the opinion that no breach of duty was shown on the part of the defendant.\nI think the only question in this Court is whether or not the conclusion of ultimate negligence can stand. I have no doubt whatever that there was evidence upon which the finding against the respondent could have been made.\nAs was pointed out by Roach J.A., the danger in the door was not because it opened, but because it opened in effect into a pit; and the finding that the negligence of the respondent was responsible for the injury is a finding that the conditions in the theatre were such as to invite a patron using ordinary care to mistake the door into the basement for that into the ladies\u2019 room and to draw her into the vortex of danger behind the door.\nThe finding of negligence on the part of Mrs. Brown was taken to supersede that, and the question is whether it does. What the jury had in mind was this: that the invitation which drew Mrs. Brown into the staircase was one which persisted in its influence upon her to the end; but at the same time, notwithstanding that continuing influence and in spite of it, she should have exercised more caution. They conceived the original negligence of the defendant and that later of the appellant to be operative up to and including the injury; and the small percentage of responsibility attributed to the latter was obviously due to their view that there was little blame to be charged against her because she was at all times under the impulsion of the false invitation; she relied on that invitation and did not look, and the jury thought her slightly to blame because she did not look. Greisman v. Gillingham[2].\nThe principle of Davies and Mann[3], which the Court below purported to apply, is, I think, this: where a situation of danger to person or property is brought about by the negligence of a person which at a critical moment he is unable in fact to counteract or relieve, then if, at that moment, another party, exercising a care with which he is chargeable, could have avoided that situation, he is held to be the sole cause of the damage resulting from his failure to do so, whether to the one or the other, and it is of no significance whether he became aware or merely should have become aware of the predicament with which he became involved.\nBut in such a case there is not, in the conduct of the person whose negligence was subsequent in time, any element of inducement or influence by the other; and where that is present, obviously a distinction must be made. The continuing effect on the conduct of the former of the latter\u2019s earlier action becomes a circumstance significant to the final result; that conduct becomes in fact a consequence of the prior negligence. In such circumstances, to find that the last act is likewise negligent is simply to say that, in spite of the misleading inducement, acting on it was culpable. That conception appears to have been in the mind of Greer L.J. in The Eurymedon[4], where he states a rule in these words:\nIf the negligent act of one party is such as to cause the other party to make a negligent mistake that he would not have otherwise made, then both are equally to blame.\nHe treats that as a corollary of another rule:\nBut if the negligence of both parties to the litigation continues right up to the moment of collision, whether on land or on sea, each party is to blame for the collision and for the damage which is the result of the continued negligence of both.\nI take the words \u201cequally to blame\u201d to import joint contribution to the result and not necessarily the degree of responsibility. These rules embody the notion of the actually and not wholly unreasonably operating elements in the conduct of both parties persisting to the end, as being determinative of responsibility. The same idea is contained in the language of Viscount Birkenhead in his speech in the case of S. S. Volute[5], in which he says:\nAnd while no doubt where a clear line can be drawn, the subsequent negligence is the only one to look at, there are cases in which the two acts come so closely together and the second act of negligence is so mixed up with the state of things brought about by the first act, that the party secondly negligently * * * might * * * invoke the prior negligence as being part of the cause of the collision so as to make it a case of contribution.\nThe case has been treated as raising the ordinary question of the duty owed by a proprietor of premises towards an invitee. I think I should observe, however, that this is not merely a case of such invitation as was present in Indermaur v. Dames[6]. Here, Mrs. Brown paid a consideration for the privileges of the theatre, including that of making use of the ladies\u2019 room. There was a contractual relation between her and the theatre management that exercising prudence herself she might enjoy those privileges without risk of danger so far as reasonable care could make the premises safe. Although the difference in the degree of care called for may not, in the circumstances here, be material, I think it desirable that the distinction between the two bases of responsibility be kept in mind: Maclenan v. Segar[7], following Francis v. Cockrell[8]. In Cox v. Coulson[9], Swinfen Eady L.J. said:\nThe defendant must also be taken to have contracted to take due care that the premises should foe reasonably safe for persons using them in the customary manner and with reasonable care:\nciting Francis v. Cockrell8.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and restore the judgment at the trial, with costs throughout.\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014The duty owing by the respondent to the female appellant is governed, in my opinion, by the decision in Francis v. Cockrell8, discussed by McCardie J. in Maclenan v. Segar7.\nIn my opinion the answers of the jury are not to be construed as a finding of ultimate negligence on the part of the female appellant. The negligence found against each of the parties came so close together as to make applicable the principle expressed by Viscount Birkenhead, L.C., in The Volute[10]. I see no ground for distinguishing or failing to apply that principle to the facts of this case: Greisman v. Gillingham[11]. This is the principle underlying the decision of Riddell J.A. in Blair v. City of Toronto[12].\nI do not think that the failure of the jury, after having their attention called to it, to make any specific finding with respect to the lighting beyond the door affects the finding of negligence against the respondent that the thing which was the effective cause of the appellant getting beyond the door at all was the invitation created by the surroundings. The force of that invitation, when acted on as it was, continued to operate up to the point of injury although aided by the appellant\u2019s own negligence. For my part I do not see how it is possible to so separate the two so as to come to the conclusion that the negligence of the appellant was of such a character that that of the respondent became mere narrative. Leave to appeal having now been granted by the Court of Appeal for Ontario to the appellant\u2019s husband, I would allow the appeal of both appellants with costs here and below.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: David J.

The appellant pleaded that he was a minister of a religion (Witnesses of Jehovah) and was not bound by the by-law; but he was found guilty and condemned to pay a fine of $100, with an alternative of three months in jail. The appellant did not pay the fine, was committed to gaol and then applied for a writ of habeas corpus. The judgment of the Superior Court, dismissing the petition, was affirmed by a majority of the appellate court. Special leave to appeal to this Court was granted by the appellate court (1). The respondent, the city of Quebec, moved to quash the appeal for want of jurisdiction. Held: The motion should be allowed and the appeal quashed.\nJurisprudence is well settled that there are \u201cprovincial crimes\u201d, over which the various legislatures of the Dominion have jurisdiction, and that they are \u201ccriminal matters\u201d within secton 36 of the Supreme Court Act.\nIn re McNutt (47 Can.

How contra.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nTaschereau J.\u2014The respondent the city of Quebec moves to quash the appeal of the appellant for want of jurisdiction.\nThe appellant was charged before the Recorder of the city of Quebec with having illegally distributed pamphlets without previously having obtained the written permission of the chief of police of the city, in violation of the provisions of by-law 184 of the said city.\nThis by-law reads as follows:\u2014\nIt is, by the present by-law, forbidden to distribute in the streets of the city of Quebec any book, pamphlet, booklet, circular, tract whatever without having previously obtained for so doing the written permission of the chief of police.\nThe defendant pleaded to the charge that he was a minister of a religion (Witnesses of Jehovah) and was not bound by the by-law. The Recorder however found the appellant guilty and condemned him to pay a fine of $100 and costs, with an alternative of three months in gaol, as provided by the by-law. The appellant did not pay the fine and was committed to gaol, but he then applied for a writ of habeas corpus with certiorari in aid. Mr. Justice Boulanger dismissed the petition for habeas corpus, and his judgment was confirmed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench, Mr. Justice Galipeault dissenting.\nOn the 21st of April, 1947, the Court of King\u2019s Bench granted special leave to appeal, but in the formal judgment we read the following \u201cconsid\u00e9rant\u201d:\u2014\nConsidering that in view of said decisions, although there may be some doubt as to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada to hear the appeal asked for by appellant, it is not within the province of this Court to determine the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Canada.\nIn its motion to quash, the respondent, the city of Quebec (supported by the Attorney General of the province of Quebec), alleges that the matter in controversy is criminal, quasi criminal or penal, and that under section 36 of the Supreme Court Act, there is no appeal to this Court in proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus, certiorari or prohibition arising out of a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d. The point that falls to be determined by this Court is whether the habeas corpus, which has been dismissed by Mr. Justice Boulanger, is the result of a civil or criminal process.\nIt is now well settled that there are \u201cprovincial crimes\u201d, over which the various legislatures of the Dominion have jurisdiction, and that they are \u201ccriminal matters\u2019\u2019 within section 36 of the Act. In In re McNutt [1], it was held by three of the six judges (Sir Chs. Fitzpatrick, Davies and Anglin) that a trial and conviction for keeping liquor for sale contrary to the provisions of the Nova Scotia Temperance Act are proceedings on a \u201ccriminal charge\u201d, and no appeal lies to the Supreme Court of Canada from the refusal of a writ of habeas corpus to discharge the accused from imprisonment on such conviction.\nAt page 261, Sir Charles Fitzpatrick C.J. said:\u2014\nIt was on the appellant to shew that we have jurisdiction, and he referred us to section 39 (c) of the Supreme Court Act which provides for an appeal \u201cfrom the judgment in any case of proceedings for or upon a writ of habeas corpus * * * not arising out of a criminal charge\u201d. In other words, the statute gives an appeal when the petitioner for the writ is detained in custody on a process issued in a civil matter.\nIn Mitchell v. Tracey 2, it was held by this Court that the opinions of the three above mentioned justices in the McNutt case 1 should be followed, and this Court refused to hear an appeal on a writ of prohibition to restrain a magistrate from proceeding on a prosecution for violation of the provisions of the Nova Scotia Temperance Act, because it did arise out of a criminal charge and was not a civil matter.\nIn The King v. Nat Bell 3, it was said by Lord Sumner speaking for the Judicial Committee:\u2014\nTheir Lordships are of opinion that the word \u201ccriminal\u201d in the section and in the context in question is used in contradistinction to \u201ccivil\u201d and \u201cconnotes a proceeding which is not civil in its character\u201d. Certiorari and prohibition are matters of procedure, and all the procedural incidents of this charge are the same whether or not it was one falling exclusively within the legislative competence of the Dominion Legislature, under section 91, head 27.\nIn The King v. Charles Bell 4, it was held:\u2014\nThe proceeding in this case does not fall within the civil jurisdiction of this Court under section 41 (b) of the Supreme Court Act, but it is a \u201ccriminal cause\u201d within the meaning of the exception in section 36 of the Act.\nAt page 66 of the same case, Anglin C.J. said:\u2014\nWhenever a statute imposes a penalty by way of punishment for non-observance of a behest which it enacts in the public interest and the prescribed penalty is made enforceable by criminal procedure, these proceedings fulfil the two conditions connoted by the word \u201ccriminal\u201d as used in s. 36 of the Supreme Court Act. Clifford v. O\u2019Sullivan 5. That the question to be determined in such a case as this is merely as to whether the original proceedings are civil or criminal in form is shown by the following at page 64:\u2014\nBut, although a civil liability might be imposed, if Parliament provides for its enforcement by a proceeding in its nature criminal, that that proceeding would be a criminal cause within the purview of s. 36 of the Supreme Court Act would seem to follow from the judgment of the English Court of Appeal in Seaman v. Burley 6. Lord Esher, in holding that a judgment on a case stated by justices on an application to enforce payment of a poor-rate by warrant of distress was a judgment in a criminal cause or matter within s. 47 of the Judicature Act, said, at page 346:\n\u201cIt seems to me that the question is really one of procedure. The question is whether the proceeding which was going on was a criminal cause. That it is a question of procedure may be easily seen by taking the case of an assault. An assault may be made the subject of civil procedure by action, in which case there may be an appeal to this court; or it may be made the subject of criminal procedure by indictment, in which case there cannot be such an appeal. This seems to me to be contrary to the argument employed by the counsel for the appellant to the effect that the question depends upon whether the origin of the proceeding, i.e., the matter complained of, is in its nature criminal or not. In each case the thing complained of is the same, namely, the assault; but there is or is not an appeal to this court according as the procedure to which recourse is had is civil or criminal. Therefore, assuming the contention that the rate is a debt to be well founded, which I do not admit, nevertheless, if the legislature have enacted that it may be recovered or enforced by criminal procedure, there can be no appeal to this court.\u201d\nIn Chung Chuck v. The King and the Attorney General for Canada, 7, it was decided that a prosecution under a statute of British Columbia, whereby a person summarily convicted of the offence thereunder is liable to a penalty and imprisonment, and consequent proceedings by way of habeas corpus, certiorari, or stated case, raising the question whether the statute is ultra vires, are criminal matters for the above purpose. In that case, the Judicial Committee followed the decision of Nadan v. The King 8.\nIn this latter case, the Privy Council had said dealing with section 1025 of the Criminal Code of Canada:\u2014\nSection 1025 is expressed to apply to an appeal in a criminal case from \u201cany judgment or order of any court in Canada\u201d and this expression is wide enough to cover a conviction in any Canadian court for breach of a statute, whether passed by the legislature of the Dominion or by the legislature of the province. In the same case, it was held:\u2014\nAn appeal, in respect of a charge of violating a public law for which imprisonment could be imposed, is an appeal in a criminal case, although the statute violated is a provincial one.\nIt has been submitted by Mr. Howe, acting for the appellant, that these decisions do not apply because they refer to \u201cprovincial crimes\u201d, and in the present instance, we have not to deal with one of those crimes, but with a municipal enactment imposing a fine and in default of payment an imprisonment. I cannot agree with this contention, and I am of opinion that the matter from which arises the habeas corpus is not civil in its character, and that, therefore, this Court has no jurisdiction. The word \u201ccriminal\u201d, as used in section 36 of the Supreme Court Act, cannot be considered as \u201ccriminal law\u201d, as assigned to the Dominion of Canada by the B.N.A. Act, but must be considered in the sense that it is not civil.\nTwo other cases have been cited. The first is the case of Quebec Railway Light and Power Co. v. Recorder\u2019s Court of the city of Quebec 9. In that case the Quebec Railway Company operating a tramway in the city of Quebec, was fined for having violated the following provisions of a city by-law:\nThe cars shall follow each other at intervals of not more than five minutes, except from eight o\u2019clock at night to midnight, during which space of time they shall follow each other at intervals of not more than ten minutes.\nThe Company had a writ of prohibition issued which was quashed by the Superior Court and the appeal before this Court was dismissed.\nThe second case is the case of Segal v. City of Montreal, 10. In that case, Segal\u2019s petition for a writ of prohibition had been dismissed by the Court of King\u2019s Bench and the judgment was confirmed by this Court. Segal had been brought before the Recorder\u2019s Court on a complaint that he was unlawfully doing business as a canvasser without having previously obtained a licence and was fined.\nIn both cases this Court heard the appeals on writs of prohibition, but obviously the question of the jurisdiction of the Court was not raised by either party nor by the Court itself, and therefore the question was not discussed, and these two cases cannot be cited as authorities in support of the appellant\u2019s contention.\nIt has been further argued that this Court should entertain the present appeal because it has been submitted, and the judgment of Mr. Justice Galipeault of the Court of King\u2019s Bench is based on that point, that the by-law upon which the appellant has been convicted is ultra vires of the powers of the provincial legislature and of the city of Quebec. I do not think that this submission may be allowed to prevail, because whether or not the by-law is intra or ultra vires, it remains that the original question raised before the Recorder, and of which the petition for habeas corpus is merely an incident of procedure, is not civil, and it is only in such a case that this Court has jurisdiction. (Vide Chung Chuck v. The King, (1), where the statute was attacked as being ultra vires).\nI am forced, therefore, to come to the conclusion that the characteristics of a civil process cannot be found in the proceedings in the courts below, that they are of a \u201cpenal nature\u201d, that is to say, \u201ccriminal\u201d for the purposes of the Supreme Court Act, and that no appeal lies to this Court, which is a statutory court and whose jurisdiction is therefore limited.\nThe motion should be allowed, and the appeal quashed.\nMotion allowed and appeal quashed.\n[1] (1912) 47 Can.

P., principal shareholder of a company which had tendered for the construction of a municipal aqueduct, such amount to be ascertained on completion of the works, when the contract would have been wound up. The appellants, contending that the amount due them was in excess of $40,000, claimed the full amount of the note. The respondents pleaded inter alia: (1) that the original note and its renewal were prescribed; (2) that novation had been effected and the original amount due was consequently discharged; and (3) that payments made by B. P. should have been imputed totally against the note as being the older debt. The respondents also contended that the onus was on the appellants to show the loss incurred in the execution of the contract. The appellants\u2019 action was maintained by the Superior Court, but was dismissed by the appellate court.\nHeld: The appeal is allowed and the appellants\u2019 action is maintained for a sum of $11,158.18, being half of $22,316.37, which was the final amount owed by the respondents.\nHeld that prescription does not run as long as a creditor holds a guarantee or security given to him by the debtor.\u2014Per The Chief Justice and Kerwin, Taschereau and Kellock JJ.\u2014A note dated in 1936, given to renew another dated in 1931, would therefore be prescribed in 1941, unless there are found causes interrupting or delaying the prescription. In this case, in 1931, concurrently with the signing of the original note, a contract of guarantee was signed by two of the parties thereto whereby one of them transferred inter alia shares, for an amount of $15,000, of a certain company to secure the payment of the debt for which the note was given and of another debt. Now, it was only in 1941, when the affairs of the aqueduct works had been finally wound up, that these shares were returned to the debtor by the creditor: therefor, the prescription of the notes began to run only from that date. Moreover, though the guarantee was given to one of the appellants; only, because the other appellant was a joint and several creditor with him, all the acts interrupting or delaying the prescription towards the former have the same effect towards the latter. (Arts. 2230 and 2239 C.C.)\nPer The Chief Justice and Kerwin, Taschereau and Kellock JJ.:\u2014Novation was not effected by the renewal in 1936 of the original note, as otherwise the debt represented by that note would have been extinguished.\u2014It is true that B. P. was the signer of the original note and the endorser of the renewal note, but the debt represented by the first note has not been renovated by the second. In order that novation be effected, there must appear, besides any change made in the original obligation, some acts of the parties showing the will to extinguish it and to replace it by a new one.\u2014Novation is not presumed and there must be an evident intention of effecting it; the will of the parties not to make the new obligation coexisting with the old one must appear clearly from the deed or its circumstances; in case of doubt, the original obligation remains in force; in this case, the creditor kept possession of the first note; the net result of its renewal is that the amount of the first note cannot be recovered until the date of maturity of the second note.\nPer The Chief Justice and Kerwin, Taschereau and Kellock JJ.:\u2014Under the general provisions of the law, payment must be imputed upon the debt which the debtor has the greatest interest in paying and, if the debts are of the same nature and equally onerous, the imputation must be effected upon the oldest debt. However, these principles apply only when there are several debts but a single debtor and a single creditor. Consequently, if the debtor gives security to guarantee both the payment of a note due to one creditor and the claim of another creditor against a company of which the payee of the note was a shareholder, the fact that the note was earlier in date than the claim should not be taken into consideration. (Legal imputation does not apply in such a case (Arts. 1158 et seq. C.C.), as, while there are several debts and one debtor only, there are also two creditors: the Company and one of its shareholders. These parties, both creditors of B. P. but having different claims under the law, were holding jointly the same security for the guarantee of their respective claims; and the amount resulting from the conversion of the security into money cannot be subjected to any preference. Both creditors must, according to the ratio of their claims, divide between them the proceeds of the security, in the absence of some agreement in the matter.\nPer The Chief Justice and Kerwin, Taschereau and Kellock JJ.:\u2014The construction company issued in May 1931 a cheque for $4,000 payable to one E. R. and in December next paid to the appellants a sum of $4,563.93. The trial judge expressed doubt as to the legality of the appropriation of the amount of $4,000. Held: The onus was on the appellants to establish that the payment of $4,563.93 had been made in settlement of a valid and legal claim. Otherwise, if such proof is lacking, that payment must be applied on account of a promissory note, which was the only debt for which the appellants were creditors on the date of the payment.\nPer Rand J.:\u2014The agreement entered into by the parties in 1933, wherein the note of $20,000 sued upon was mentioned, by implication in fact provides that the note shall run as a continuing maximum obligation for one-half of the ultimate sum, on completion of the works, found due from B. P. to the appellants, which in the circumstances would represent part of the loss on the contract, less what B. P. himself might pay on it, and that consequently it became payable in March. 1941, when the affairs of the construction company had been wound up.\nPer Rand J.:\u2014The note of 1936 did not supersede that of 1931 either in intention or because B. P.\u2019s liability was changed from that of a maker to that of an endorser, and, consequently, the original debt or liability did not cease to exist in 1936. The reasonable inference from the circumstances is that the second note was taken, ex abundantia cautela, not in substitution for, but additional to, the first. The earlier note continued therefore, subject to the operation of prescription until 1941. But even if there were a substitution, on both notes B. P. was in fact a surety to the construction company and, either as maker or \u2018endorser, his obligation to the appellants vis-\u00e0-vis the respondents remained unaffected. Per Rand J.:\u2014The onus of proving the fact of a loss in carrying out the reservoir contract, which loss was a condition of the respondents liability under the agreement of 1933, did not lay on the appellants, when the circumstances in which the note of 1933 was given are considered, and more specially where the appellants had nothing to do with the direction of the construction company and had no control over the disbursement of moneys.\nPer Rand J.:\u2014The securities given by B. P. in 1931 should, under the language of the agreement, be appropriated proportionately to the debts owed by him, to wit the one represented by the note given to the appellants and the one represented by a loan made to B. P. by the respondent company.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Lalibert\u00e9 J., and dismissing the appellants\u2019 action, by which they claim $20,000 on a promissory note.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are fully stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nAndr\u00e9 Taschereau K.C. and Renault St. Laurent for the appellants.\nM. L. Beaulieu K.C. and A. Labr\u00e8que for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin, Taschereau and Kellock JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau J.: Les appelants r\u00e9clament des d\u00e9fendeursintimes conjointement et solidairement la somme de $20,000. La Cour de premi\u00e8re instance leur a donn\u00e9 gain de cause, mais leur action a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par la Cour du Banc du Roi.\nLes faits qui ont fait na\u00eetre ce litige sont assez compliqu\u00e9s et peuvent se r\u00e9sumer ainsi. Au cours du mois d\u2019avril 1931, la Compagnie de Construction de Qu\u00e9bec, dont un nomm\u00e9 B\u00e9loni Poulin \u00e9tait le principal actionnaire et administrateur, a fait parvenir \u00e0 la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec une soumission pour la construction d\u2019un r\u00e9servoir municipal. Cette soumission devait \u00eatre accompagn\u00e9e d\u2019un d\u00e9p\u00f4t de $30,000, et comme la Compagnie ne disposait pas des fonds requis, les appelants V. Dionne et Fils ont fourni ce montant en escomptant un billet de $30.000 \u00e0 la Banque Royale du Canada, succursale St-Georges de Beauce. Quelques mois plus tard, soit le 21 juillet 1931, la Compagnie de Construction, Rodolphe Marcotte, Alfred Gagnon et B\u00e9loni Poulin ont conjointement et solidairement sign\u00e9 un billet promis-soire payable \u00e0 demande, \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de V. Dionne et Fils, au montant de $30,000 et portant int\u00e9r\u00eat au taux de 6 p. 100. Ce billet, qui devait servir \u00e0 garantir les avances faites par V. Dionne et Fils, fut remis par ces derniers \u00e0 la Banque Royale du Canada.\nAu mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, la Compagnie a obtenu de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec le contrat pour la somme de $458,507.35, et la Canadian General Insurance Company d\u00e9posa entre les mains d\u2019un officier autoris\u00e9 de la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec une police de garantie pour assurer la fid\u00e9le ex\u00e9cution du contrat. L\u2019un des d\u00e9fendeurs, M. Edouard Lacroix, beau-fr\u00e8re de B\u00e9loni Poulin, a lui-m\u00eame garanti la compagnie d\u2019assurance contre toutes pertes qu\u2019elle pourrait subir.\nC\u2019est la Banque Royale du Canada qui a fourni \u00e0 la Compagnie les fonds n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des travaux, et les trois lettres de garantie suivantes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es \u00e0 la Banque Royale:\n18 ao\u00fbt 1931 $75,000\n16 mars 1932 $50,000\n19 octobre 1932 $75,000\nL\u2019un des appelants, Ludger Dionn\u00e9, associ\u00e9 de la firme V. Dionne et Fils, a sign\u00e9 ces trois lettres de garantie de m\u00eame que B\u00e9loni Poulin et Rodolphe Marcotte. Alfred Gagnon n\u2019a sign\u00e9 que les deux premi\u00e8res.\nQuelques jours apr\u00e8s la signature de la premi\u00e8re lettre de garantie, B\u00e9loni Poulin et Rodolphe Marcotte ont, le 20 ao\u00fbt 1931, sign\u00e9 devant le notaire Cr\u00e9peau un document en vertu duquel ils ont conjointement et solidairement garanti Ludger Dionne jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence d\u2019une somme de $105,000, contre toutes pertes qu\u2019il pourrait faire comme r\u00e9sultat de la premi\u00e8re avance de $30,000 et de la premi\u00e8re lettre de garantie au montant de $75,000. Par cet acte, B\u00e9loni Poulin a hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9 en faveur de Ludger Dionne certains immeubles et lui a transport\u00e9 \u00e9galement d\u2019autres valeurs et cr\u00e9ances. Il est cependant important de noter ici que c\u2019est la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 V. Dionne et Fils qui a avanc\u00e9 le premier $30,000 qui devait accompagner la soumission pour la construction du r\u00e9servoir, que c\u2019est Ludger Dionne personnellement qui a sign\u00e9 les lettres de garantie et que, cependant, les hypoth\u00e8ques et transports consentis par B\u00e9loni Poulin pour garantir le paiement des deux cr\u00e9ances sont en faveur de Ludger Dionne personnellement. Je reviendrai plus tard sur ce point.\nOr, apr\u00e8s la signature de tous ces documents, et alors qu\u2019on entrevoyait la fin des travaux du r\u00e9servoir, ainsi que la probabilit\u00e9 d\u2019une perte assez substantielle, Edouard Lacroix, l\u2019un des d\u00e9fendeurs, emprunta de V. Dionne et Fils, le 7 f\u00e9vrier 1933, pour le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de deux compagnies dont il est propri\u00e9taire, la Madawaska Company et la Port Royal Pulp & Paper Company, la somme de $83,000. Un contrat fut sign\u00e9 \u00e0 cet effet, et \u00e9videmment en consid\u00e9ration de ce pr\u00eat, la Madawaska Company a sign\u00e9 en faveur de V. Dionne et Fils un billet au montant de $20,000, payable le 1er septembre 1933 et endoss\u00e9 personnellement par Edouard Lacroix. Dans l\u2019acte relatif au pr\u00eat de $83,000, on trouve la clause suivante:\nEn outre, la Madawaska Company donne auxdits V. Dionne et Fils un billet dat\u00e9 de ce jour au montant de vingt mille piastres ($20,000) qui sera payable sans int\u00e9r\u00eat le 1er septembre prochain. Ce montant repr\u00e9sentant un pr\u00eat fait \u00e0 B\u00e9loni Poulin par la Madawaska Company, et \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 auxdits V. Dionne et Fils en acompte sur ce que ledit B\u00e9loni Poulin leur doit et \u00e9tant cens\u00e9 repr\u00e9senter la moiti\u00e9 du montant d\u00fb auxdits V. Dionne et Fils lorsque toutes les affaires du r\u00e9servoir seront r\u00e9gl\u00e9es.\nIl est compris que si cette dette \u00e9tait moindre que $40,000 ce billet ne sera d\u00fb que pour la moiti\u00e9 de cette dette, ladite Madawaska Company n\u2019\u00e9tant pas oblig\u00e9e de payer plus que le billet de $20,000.\nLes demandeurs pr\u00e9tendent que, B\u00e9loni Poulin \u00e9tant d\u00e9biteur des demandeurs V. Dionne et Fils en un montant sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 $40,000, ils ont droit de r\u00e9clamer des d\u00e9fendeurs conjointement et solidairement ladite somme de $20,000.\nCe document ne constitue pas un cautionnement destin\u00e9 \u00e0 garantir la dette de B\u00e9loni Poulin \u00e0 V. Dionne et Fils. Sa lecture d\u00e9montre plut\u00f4t que les d\u00e9fendeurs ont assum\u00e9 l\u2019obligation de payer le montant d\u00fb par B\u00e9loni Poulin \u201clorsque toutes les affaires du r\u00e9servoir seront r\u00e9gl\u00e9es\u201d.. D\u2019o\u00f9 il r\u00e9sulte que la discussion des biens de Poulin n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire et que la seule preuve de la dette de Poulin envers les demandeurs rend la cr\u00e9ance des demandeurs exigible.\nLa premi\u00e8re question qui se pose est donc de d\u00e9terminer le montant de la dette de B\u00e9loni Poulin due \u00e0 V. Dionne et Fils, lors de la signature de ce document, telle qu\u2019\u00e9tablie lors du r\u00e8glement des \u201caffaires du r\u00e9servoir\u201d. Pour la compl\u00e8te intelligence de la cause, il importe en premier lieu de distinguer les deux dettes de Poulin.\nLa premi\u00e8re est celle qui est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le billet de $30,000 qu\u2019il a sign\u00e9 conjointement et solidairement avec d\u2019autres, \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de V. Dionne et Fils, le 21 juillet 1931, payable \u00e0 demande et portant int\u00e9r\u00eat au taux de 6 p. 100, et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 aux appelants pour garantir les $30,000 qu\u2019ils avaient pr\u00eat\u00e9es \u00e0 la Compagnie de Construction, lors de la soumission faite par cette derni\u00e8re pour la construction du r\u00e9servoir.\nLa seconde de ces dettes est constitu\u00e9e par la cr\u00e9ance de la Banque Royale du Canada au montant de $195,500, garantie par Ludger Dionne personnellement, B\u00e9loni Poulin, Rodolphe Marcotte et Alfred Gagnon, cr\u00e9ance que les demandeurs ont pay\u00e9e partiellement et dont ils sont devenus cessionnaires en 1941. Ce montant de $195,500 \u00e9tait d\u00fb \u00e0 la Banque \u00e0 la date du 7 f\u00e9vrier 1933, quand la Madawaska Company et Edouard Lacroix ont assum\u00e9 l\u2019obligation de participer dans les pertes, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de $20,000.\nCette dette de $195,500, et pour laquelle Ludger Dionne \u00e9tait personnellement responsable, fut pay\u00e9e \u00e0 la Banque de la fa\u00e7on suivante: Le 12 ao\u00fbt 1931, la Compagnie de Construction a transport\u00e9 \u00e0 la Banque Royale du Canada tous les montants qui lui \u00e9taient dus par la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, et en vertu de ce transport, les divers acomptes re\u00e7us par la Banque ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9s \u00e0 la r\u00e9duction de la dette de la Compagnie de Construction et ne contribuaient pas au paiement du billet de $30,000 d\u00fb \u00e0 V. Dionne et Fils. Il s\u2019ensuit que, d\u00e9duction faite de tous ces paiements transmis par la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, il est rest\u00e9 d\u00fb \u00e0 la Banque $70,667.60 pour avances \u00e0 la Compagnie de Construction, et cet autre montant de $30,000 plus $15,722.80 d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats ($45,722.80), formant un grand total de $116,390.40. Le 15 mars 1941, V. Dionne et Fils ont pay\u00e9 \u00e0 la Banque Royale du Canada le billet de $30,000, sur lequel ils avaient ant\u00e9rieurement pay\u00e9 les int\u00e9r\u00eats, plus la somme de $70,667.60, et ont obtenu pour ce dernier montant une quittance avec subrogation contre ceux qui avaient sign\u00e9 les lettres de garantie \u00e0 la Banque Royale du Canada, et dont B\u00e9loni Poulin. Il r\u00e9sulte de toutes ces diverses transactions, qu\u2019\u00e0 cette date du 15 mars 1941, un montant de $116,390.40 \u00e9tait d\u00fb \u00e0 V. Dionne et Fils.\nQuelque temps plus tard, soit dans le mois d\u2019avril 1941, il y eut des pourparlers de r\u00e8glement entre Ludger Dionne et B\u00e9loni Poulin. B\u00e9loni Poulin a alors pay\u00e9 \u00e0 V. Dionne et Fils, cessionnaires de Ludger Dionne, $47,300 comme cons\u00e9quence des transports qu\u2019il avait consentis \u00e0 Ludger Dionne. Ce montant de $47,300 ne fut appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 aucune dette en particulier, de sorte que B\u00e9loni Poulin est rest\u00e9 d\u00e9biteur d\u2019une somme de $69,090.40.\nIl me semble impossible d\u2019admettre que les appelants puissent baser leur r\u00e9clamation contre les d\u00e9fendeurs en soutenant que B\u00e9loni Poulin leur devait \u00e0 eux comme cessionnaires de Ludger Dionne. Il est bien vrai qu\u2019en mars 1941 ce dernier a c\u00e9d\u00e9 tous ses droits \u00e0 V. Dionne et Fils et que lors des paiements faits \u00e0 la Banque, ils ont obtenu une quittance avec subrogation contre B\u00e9loni Poulin, mais l\u2019obligation des d\u00e9fendeurs de payer ne s\u2019\u00e9tend pas jusque l\u00e0. En vertu de l\u2019\u00e9crit du 7 f\u00e9vrier 1933, les d\u00e9fendeurs se sont oblig\u00e9s de payer ce que B\u00e9loni Poulin devait \u00e0 V. Dionne et Fils, \u00e0 la date o\u00f9 l\u2019\u00e9crit a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9, malgr\u00e9 que la d\u00e9termination de ce montant ne devait se faire que lorsque les affaires du r\u00e9servoir se r\u00e8gleraient. Or, \u00e0 cause de divers proc\u00e8s, ce n\u2019est qu\u2019en 1941 que les affaires du r\u00e9servoir ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es, et qu\u2019on a pu d\u00e9terminer le montant d\u00fb par B\u00e9loni Poulin \u00e0 la date du 7 f\u00e9vrier 1933. Tous les droits acquis par les appelants subs\u00e9quemment \u00e0 cette date ne peuvent servir de base pour \u00e9tablir la dette de Poulin vis-\u00e0-vis les demandeurs, et rendre ainsi exigible une cr\u00e9ance conditionnelle que ces derniers avaient contre les d\u00e9fendeurs. Ce que B\u00e9loni Poulin devait \u00e0 la date du 7 f\u00e9vrier 1933, \u00e0 part le billet de $30,000, il le devait \u00e0 Ludger Dionne personnellement, et les transports subs\u00e9quents faits par Ludger Dionne \u00e0 V. Dionne et Fils ne peuvent augmenter les obligations des d\u00e9fendeurs. L\u2019action des demandeurs ne repose pas seulement sur le billet de $20,000 qui constituerait une preuve prima facie de la dette due par les d\u00e9fendeurs, mais elle est la r\u00e9sultante de l\u2019effet combin\u00e9 de ce billet et de l\u2019\u00e9crit du 7 f\u00e9vrier. Les deux ne font qu\u2019un tout et doivent n\u00e9cessairement \u00eatre lus ensemble. La Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et la Cour du Banc du Roi ont cru que la preuve, qui incombait aux demandeurs de prouver que l\u2019argent avanc\u00e9 par la banque a \u00e9t\u00e9 exclusivement employ\u00e9 aux travaux de construction du r\u00e9servoir, est insuffisante. Etant donn\u00e9e l\u2019opinion que j\u2019ai exprim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019effet que la dette due par B\u00e9loni Poulin pour les fins de la pr\u00e9sente r\u00e9clamation ne peut \u00eatre celle r\u00e9sultant de la cession de cr\u00e9ance, il devient inutile de discuter cette question.\nMais, en ce qui concerne la cr\u00e9ance de $30,000 et int\u00e9r\u00eats, que les appelants font valoir contre B\u00e9loni Poulin, la situation me semble bien diff\u00e9rente. Cette cr\u00e9ance existait certainement \u00e0 la date du 7 f\u00e9vrier 1933, et les v\u00e9ritables cr\u00e9anciers sont bien les demandeurs dans la pr\u00e9sente cause, le billet ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 fait payable \u00e0 leur ordre. De plus, la preuve \u00e9tablit clairement de quelle fa\u00e7on cet argent a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9.\nLes intim\u00e9s soutiennent, cependant, que ce montant n\u2019es\u2019t pas d\u00fb par B\u00e9loni Poulin, et ils invoquent en premier lieu un moyen r\u00e9sultant de la prescription. Comme nous l\u2019avons vu pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, ce billet a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 le 21 juillet 1931 par la Compagnie de Construction de Qu\u00e9bec, Alfred Gagnon, B\u00e9loni Poulin et Rodolphe Marcotte. Le 14 juillet 1936, ce m\u00eame billet qui \u00e9tait demeur\u00e9 impay\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9, mais il a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par la Compagnie de Construction de Qu\u00e9bec Limit\u00e9e et endoss\u00e9 avec renonciation au prot\u00eat par Rodolphe Marcotte, B\u00e9loni Poulin et Alfred Gagnon. Apparemment, ce billet devait \u00eatre prescrit en 1941, et \u00e0 moins qu\u2019on y trouve quelques causes qui ont interrompu ou suspendu la prescription, celle-ci \u00e9tait acquise lors de la signification de l\u2019action.\nNous avons vu pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment que, le 20 ao\u00fbt 1931, B\u00e9loni Poulin et Rodolphe Marcotte ont donn\u00e9 des garanties \u00e0 Ludger Dionne, et dans l\u2019acte re\u00e7u devant M. le notaire Cr\u00e9peau on y voit les clauses suivantes:\nAttendu que la susdite compagnie (La Compagnie de Construction de Qu\u00e9bec Limit\u00e9e) a obtenu en la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec un contrat pour la contraction d\u2019un reservoir et que ledit Ludger Dionne a garanti jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence d\u2019une somme de trente mille piastres ($30,000) envers la ville de Qu\u00e9bec pour la parfaite et enti\u00e8re ex\u00e9cution du susdit contrat.\nAttendu que la susdite compagnie a besoin d\u2019un certain cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 la banque pour financer cette entreprise et que ledit Ludger Dionne s\u2019est port\u00e9 garant pour la susdite compagnie \u00e0 la Banque Royale du Canada \u00e0 St-Georges-Est, Beauce, et ce jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence d\u2019une somme de soixante-quinze mille piastres ($75,000).\nPar la faveur des pr\u00e9sentes lesdits B\u00e9loni Poulin et Rodolphe Marcotte garantissent personnellement et conjointement et solidairement ledit Ludger Dionne pour toute la somme totale, soit cent cinq mille piastres ($105,000) ou partie d\u2019icelle que tous les int\u00e9r\u00eats sur icelle et d\u00e9clarent affecter et hypoth\u00e9quer les immeubles ci-apr\u00e8s d\u00e9crits, savoir:\n(Liste des immeubles hypoth\u00e9qu\u00e9s:)\nLedit B\u00e9loni Poulin d\u00e9clare en outre c\u00e9der et transporter audit Ludger Dionne quinze mille piastres ($15,000) de parts qu\u2019il d\u00e9tient dans la Compagnie St-Georges Woollen Mills et il s\u2019engage de signer les transferts des susdites actions en faveur dudit Ludger Dionne.\nPour donner suite \u00e0 cette entente sign\u00e9e par toutes les parties, B\u00e9loni Poulin a remis \u00e0 Ludger Dionne lesdites actions qui, comme on peut le voir par l\u2019acte lui-m\u00eame, garantissaient et l\u2019avance de $30,000 et un premier montant de $75,000 pr\u00eat\u00e9 \u00e0 la Compagnie de Construction de Qu\u00e9bec par la Banque Royale du Canada, sur la force de la lettre de garantie sign\u00e9e par Ludger Dionne.\nOr, ce n\u2019est qu\u2019en 1941, quand les affaires du r\u00e9servoir ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es, que Ludger Dionne a remis les parts en question \u00e0 B\u00e9loni Poulin, et il s\u2019ensuit donc que pendant ce temps, la prescription des billets n\u2019a pas couru. Il est un principe admis et reconnu par la jurisprudence et par les auteurs, que la prescription ne court pas tant qu\u2019un cr\u00e9ancier d\u00e9tient un gage que lui a remis son d\u00e9biteur.\nDans La Banque du Peuple v. Huot[1], la Cour de Revision a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que:\nLe fait pour un d\u00e9biteur, qui a donn\u00e9 un gage \u00e0 son cr\u00e9ancier pour assurer le paiement de sa dette, de laisser ce gage en la possession du cr\u00e9ancier, constitue une reconnaissance constante et incessante de son obligation qui en interrompt la prescription, tant que le cr\u00e9ancier conserve la possession du gage.\nL\u2019article 2227 du Code Civil se lit ainsi:\nLa prescription est interrompue civilement par la renonciation au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du temps \u00e9coul\u00e9 et par la reconnaissance que le possesseur ou le d\u00e9biteur fait du droit de celui contre lequel il prescrivait. L\u2019article correspondant du Code Napol\u00e9on est l\u2019article 2248 qui est au m\u00eame effet:\nLa prescription est interrompue par la reconnaissance que le d\u00e9biteur ou le possesseur fait du droit de celui contre lequel il prescrivait.\nDalloz, R\u00e9pertoire Pratique, n\u00b0 322, \u00e0 la page 174, commentant cet article 2248, dit:\nLa reconnaissance tacite peut encore r\u00e9sulter * * . * lorsque le d\u00e9biteur fournit une caution ou donne un gage au cr\u00e9ancier. (Troplong, t. 2, No. 618; Laurent, t. 32, No. 129; Hue, No. 402; Baudry-Lacantinerie et Tissier, No. 530.)\nBaudry-Lacantinerie, 3e \u00e9d., vol. 25, n\u00b0 530, dit \u00e0 la page 395:\nLes principaux faits d\u2019o\u00f9 peut s\u2019induire la reconnaissance tacite sont le paiement fait par le d\u00e9biteur qui est en voie de prescrire d\u2019une partie de sa dette \u00e0 titre d\u2019acompte, le paiement par le d\u00e9biteur des int\u00e9r\u00eats de sa dette, la demande qu\u2019il fait d\u2019un d\u00e9lai pour le paiement, l\u2019offre et \u00e0 plus forte raison la dation de s\u00fbret\u00e9s, telles qu\u2019une caution, un gage, une hypoth\u00e8que.\nVu la d\u00e9cision de cette Cour dans Par\u00e9 v. Par\u00e9[2], il y a lieu de faire certaines r\u00e9serves, en c\u00e9 qui concerne l\u2019hypoth\u00e8que.\nPlaniol et Ripert, Droit Civil, vol. 12, n\u00b0 112, page 113, disent aussi:\nTant que le cr\u00e9ancier gagiste reste nanti, sa cr\u00e9ance n\u2019est pas soumise \u00e0 la prescription, le fait du d\u00e9biteur de laisser le gage entre ses mains constituant de sa part une reconnaissance tacite permanente du droit du cr\u00e9ancier, qui interrompt \u00e0 tout instant la prescription. La solution contraire aboutirait \u00e0 ce r\u00e9sulat inadmissible, que le d\u00e9biteur, apr\u00e8s prescription de la dette, pourrait r\u00e9clamer la restitution du gage sans payer ce qu\u2019il devait.\nLa remise de ses parts de la St-Georges Woollen Mills par B\u00e9loni Poulin \u00e0 Ludger Dionne a donc constitu\u00e9 une garantie continuelle, une reconnaissance de sa dette et la prescription n\u2019a donc pas couru.\nOn objecte cependant que la remise de ce gage a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 Ludger Dionne personnellement, et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence V. Dionne et Fils qui \u00e9taient les b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires du billet, ne peuvent invoquer \u00e0 leur profit cette reconnaissance.\nEvidemment, cet acte, par lequel des garanties sont donn\u00e9es \u00e0 Ludger Dionne, n\u2019est pas r\u00e9dig\u00e9 dans les termes les plus appropri\u00e9s, et il eut \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable que les faits eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 relat\u00e9s tels qu\u2019ils se sont produits. Mais il n\u2019en reste pas moins vrai que B\u00e9loni Poulin reconna\u00eet l\u2019existence de la dette de $80,000 qu\u2019il doit aux demandeurs, et que pour en assurer le paiement il donne des actions en gage \u00e0 Ludger Dionne; qui est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment Tun des associ\u00e9s de la firme V. Dionne et Fils, et l\u2019un des cr\u00e9anciers solidaires du billet de $30,000. Tous les actes interruptifs ou qui suspendent la prescription vis-\u00e0-vis Ludger Dionne, ont le m\u00eame effet vis-\u00e0-vis Ars\u00e8ne Dionne, l\u2019autre associ\u00e9 de V. Dionne et Fils. L\u2019article 2230 C.C. est clair sur ce point:\nTout acte, qui interrompt la prescription \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019un des cr\u00e9anciers solidaires, profite aux autres.\nEt l\u2019article 2239 C.C. dit:\nLes r\u00e8gles particuli\u00e8res, concernant la suspension de la prescription quant aux cr\u00e9anciers solidaires et \u00e0 leurs h\u00e9ritiers, sont les m\u00eames que celles de l\u2019interruption dans les m\u00eames cas expliqu\u00e9s en la section pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente.\nLes intim\u00e9s ont \u00e9galement soutenu que le renouvellement du billet du 14 juillet 1936 a op\u00e9r\u00e9 une novation et que la dette repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le premier billet n\u2019existe plus. Le double r\u00e9sultat de l\u2019extinction du premier billet remplac\u00e9 par le second serait d\u2019abord que le gage donn\u00e9 pour garantir le premier billet de $30,000 n\u2019aurait pas garanti le second, et que la prescription sur le dernier n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 interrompue. De plus, le second billet ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 consenti en 1936 et repr\u00e9sentant une dette nov\u00e9e, n\u2019existait pas \u00e0 la date du 7 f\u00e9vrier 1933, et ne peut pas, en cons\u00e9quence, \u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration pour d\u00e9terminer le montant de la dette des d\u00e9fendeurs.\nJe ne crois pas que cette pr\u00e9tention soit fond\u00e9e. Il est vrai que B\u00e9loni Poulin est signataire du billet du 21 juillet 1931, et qu\u2019il appara\u00eet comme endosseur sur le renouvellement du 14 juillet 1936, mais la dette repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le premier n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 nov\u00e9e par le second. Pour que la novation existe il faut, qu\u2019en dehors du changement apport\u00e9 dans l\u2019obligation primitive, apparaissent les volont\u00e9s des parties de l\u2019\u00e9teindre pour la remplacer par la nouvelle. La novation ne se pr\u00e9sume pas, l\u2019intention de l\u2019op\u00e9rer doit \u00eatre \u00e9vidente, et la volont\u00e9 de ne pas faire coexister la nouvelle obligation avec l\u2019ancienne doit r\u00e9sulter clairement de l\u2019acte ou de ses circonstances. En cas de doute, l\u2019obligation initiale subsiste. En certains cas, le renouvellement d\u2019un billet op\u00e9rera novation, et particuli\u00e8rement s\u2019il y a remise du billet originaire, mais lorsque l\u2019intention expresse n\u2019appara\u00eet pas, et que le cr\u00e9ancier, comme dans le. cas qui nous occupe, conserve la possession du billet ant\u00e9rieur, l\u2019obligation primitive n\u2019est pas \u00e9teinte, et coexiste avec la seconde. Alors, l\u2019effet du renouvellement est que le montant du premier billet ne peut \u00eatre recouvr\u00e9 tant que l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du second n\u2019est pas arriv\u00e9e.\nDe nombreux jugements \u00e0 cet effet ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, et je ne citerai que celui de M. le juge Stein dans la cause de Allaire v. Gagnon[3]. Dans cette cause, les billets originaires sign\u00e9s par Gagnon et Ouellette avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9s par des billets sign\u00e9s par d\u2019autres, et endoss\u00e9s par Gagnon et Ouellette. Les premiers billets avaient m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 remis aux cr\u00e9anciers. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de novation, et ce jugement a \u00e9t\u00e9 unanimement confirm\u00e9 par la Cour du Banc du Roi[4]. Les m\u00eames principes doivent s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente cause et il s\u2019ensuit donc que la dette de Poulin au montant de $30,000 subsiste, qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas prescrite, et qu\u2019elle existait \u00e0 la date du 7 f\u00e9vrier 1933.\nLes intim\u00e9s ont pr\u00e9tendu que, comme r\u00e9sultat de l\u2019imputation l\u00e9gale des paiements, le billet de $30,000 \u00e9tait \u00e9teint. Il est certain qu\u2019en vertu des dispositions de la loi, le paiement doit \u00eatre imput\u00e9 sur la dette que le d\u00e9biteur avait le plus d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 acquitter, et que si les dettes sont de m\u00eame nature et \u00e9galement on\u00e9reuses, l\u2019imputation se fait sur la plus ancienne. Mais cette r\u00e8gle ne trouve son application que lorsqu\u2019il y a plusieurs dettes, mais un seul d\u00e9biteur et un seul cr\u00e9ancier.\nIl est \u00e9vident que les montants vers\u00e9s par la cit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec, en vertu du transport consenti par la Compagnie de Construction, devaient n\u00e9cessairement servir \u00e0 payer ce que la Compagnie devait \u00e0 la Banque, et non pas \u00e0 payer ce que B\u00e9loni Poulin pouvait devoir \u00e0 V. Dionne et Fils ou \u00e0 Ludger Dionne personnellement. Quant aux paiements faits par B\u00e9loni Poulin, la situation est diff\u00e9rente et assez complexe, mais doit se solutionner de la fa\u00e7on suivante. Il est \u00e9tabli que lorsque, le 20 ao\u00fbt 1931, B\u00e9loni Poulin a donn\u00e9 des gages et des hypoth\u00e8ques \u00e0 Ludger Dionne, il entendait garantir, et le billet de $30,000 d\u00fb \u00e0 V. Dionne et Fils, et le montant que Ludger Dionne pourrait devoir \u00e0 la Banque Royale, en sa qualit\u00e9 de signataire d\u2019une lettre de garantie, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de $75,000. Quand en 1941, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu que B\u00e9loni Poulin paierait $27,000 pour lib\u00e9rer les garanties donn\u00e9es, et une somme suppl\u00e9mentaire d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 $20,300, formant un grand total de $47,300, il payait partiellement et le billet de $30,000 plus les int\u00e9r\u00eats, et la cr\u00e9ance que Ludger Dionne avait personnellement contre lui. Il est vrai que le billet de $30,000 est ant\u00e9rieur \u00e0 l\u2019autre dette, mais il ne peut dans ce cas y avoir d\u2019imputation l\u00e9gale, suivant les articles 1158 et al. du Code Civil, car s\u2019il y a plusieurs dettes et un seul d\u00e9biteur, il y a aussi deux cr\u00e9anciers, dont l\u2019un est V. Dionne et Fils et l\u2019autre Ludger Dionne. Ces deux derniers, cr\u00e9anciers de Poulin et diff\u00e9rents aux yeux de la loi, d\u00e9tenaient conjointement un gage pour garantir leurs cr\u00e9ances respectives, et le montant de la r\u00e9alisation de ce gage ne peut \u00eatre soumis \u00e0 aucune pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Les deux cr\u00e9anciers doivent, dans la proportion de leurs cr\u00e9ances, se partager le produit du gage, vu qu\u2019il n\u2019y a eu aucune entente \u00e0 ce sujet.\nIl a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 au cours de l\u2019enqu\u00eate que le 2 mai 1931 V. Dionne et Fils ont \u00e9mis un ch\u00e8que au montant de $4,000, fait payable \u00e0 l\u2019ordre de Emile Renaud. Le 22 d\u00e9cembre de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, la Compagnie de Construction a pay\u00e9 aux demandeurs une somme de $4,563.93. Le juge de premi\u00e8re instance n\u2019est pas satisfait de la l\u00e9galit\u00e9 de l\u2019emploi de cette somme de $4,000, et il incombait en effet aux appelants de d\u00e9montrer \u00e0 la satisfaction de la Cour que le paiement de $4,563.93, re\u00e7u de la Compagnie de Construction, \u00e9tait pour une consid\u00e9ration l\u00e9gale. L\u2019absence de cette preuve, dont les appelants avaient incontestablement le fardeau, ne peut conduire qu\u2019\u00e0 une seule conclusion, et c\u2019est que ce paiement de $4,563.93 doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 en r\u00e9duction du billet de $30,000, car \u00e0 la date o\u00f9 le paiement a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, soit le 22 d\u00e9cembre 1931, il n\u2019y avait pas d\u2019autre dette, dont les demandeurs \u00e9taient cr\u00e9anciers.\nLe billet de $30,000 portait int\u00e9r\u00eat au taux de 6 p. 100, et il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 que les int\u00e9r\u00eats se chiffrent au montant de $15,722.80, formant un total de $45,722.80. Le montant de $4,563.93 plus les int\u00e9r\u00eats au taux de 6 p. 100, depuis le 22 d\u00e9cembre 1931 au 9 juillet 1936, qui s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8vent \u00e0 $1,245.36, et au taux de 5 p. 100 depuis le 9 juillet 1936 au 15 mars 1941, se chiffrant \u00e0 $1,068.43, forment un total de $6,877.72, qu\u2019il faut d\u00e9duire de $45,722.80, laissant une balance de $38,845.08. Enfin, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sur ce dernier montant jusqu\u2019au 8 mai 1941, au taux de 6 p. 100 donne une somme globale de $39,189.89. Il est indiff\u00e9rent que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat soit accord\u00e9 sur ce paiement de $4,563,93, ou d\u00e9duit de la somme de $45,722.80. L\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des op\u00e9rations donne le m\u00eame r\u00e9sultat.\nIl ressort de tout ceci que la dette totale est de $109,857.49, et il s\u2019ensuit que la balance due par B\u00e9loni Poulin \u00e0 V. Dionne et Fils sur le billet de $30,000 plus les int\u00e9r\u00eats, est de $22,316.37, soit $39,189.89 moins $16,873.52 qui est la proportion de la r\u00e9alisation du gage applicable \u00e0 la dette de $39,189.89. Cependant, vu les termes de r\u00e9crit du 7 f\u00e9vrier, la moiti\u00e9 seulement de cette somme, soit $11,158.18 peut \u00eatre r\u00e9clam\u00e9e des d\u00e9fendeurs conjointement et solidairement.\nIl reste trois autres questions d\u2019importance mineure \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer.\nLes intim\u00e9s ont cru voir dans l\u2019arrangement intervenu entre les demandeurs cessionnaires des droits de Ludger Dionne et B\u00e9loni Poulin, le 5 mai 1941, un r\u00e8glement complet et final qui \u00e9teignait totalement la dette de B\u00e9loni Poulin. Il est clair qu\u2019il n\u2019en est pas ainsi, car il a \u00e9t\u00e9 stipul\u00e9 \u00e0 la m\u00eame date du 5 mai qu\u2019une quittance finale ne serait donn\u00e9e \u00e0 B\u00e9loni Poulin que lorsque les demandeurs auraient exerc\u00e9 tous leurs recours contre les oblig\u00e9s. Or, comme cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement n\u2019est pas arriv\u00e9 encore, il n\u2019y a pas eu de quittance finale. L\u2019action prise contre les d\u00e9fendeurs, apr\u00e8s cet arrangement du 5 mai, est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment l\u2019exercice de l\u2019un de ces recours.\nComme autre moyen pour demander le rejet de l\u2019action, les d\u00e9fendeurs se sont appuy\u00e9s sur un \u00e9crit du 24 d\u00e9cembre 1934, sign\u00e9 par Ludger Dionne, et qui se lit ainsi:\nV. Dionne & Fils\nSt-Georges, Beauce, 24 d\u00e9cembre 1934.\nSi par suite d\u2019une perte dans le r\u00e8glement de -la Construction du R\u00e9servoir de Qu\u00e9bec, M. Edouard Lacroix est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 payer le billet de $20,000 qu\u2019il m\u2019a sign\u00e9 \u00e0 cet effet, je m\u2019engage, apr\u00e8s que je serai compl\u00e8tement d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9 de l\u2019affaire, \u00e0 lui transporter les droits que j\u2019ai sur le m\u00e9nage, le stock et le roulant, ainsi que $15,000 de parts de la St-George Woollen Mills Co., qui m\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s par M. B\u00e9loni Poulin en garantie.\nIl est entendu que M. Lacroix devra remettre possession de ces valeurs \u00e0 M. B\u00e9loni Poulin lorsque ce dernier le remboursera de ses d\u00e9bours\u00e9s.\n(Sign\u00e9) Ludger Dionne. On a pr\u00e9tendu que les d\u00e9fendeurs ne peuvent \u00eatre condamn\u00e9s \u00e0 payer le montant r\u00e9clam\u00e9, \u00e0 moins que les demandeurs offrent et consignent les dites actions de la St-George Woollen Mills et r\u00e9troc\u00e8dent les autres droits qu\u2019ils se sont engag\u00e9s \u00e0 transporter. Les termes de cet \u00e9crit sont clairs. En premier lieu, il est sign\u00e9 par Ludger Dionne personnellement, et en second lieu, ce n\u2019est que lorsque Ludger Dionne \u201csera compl\u00e8tement d\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9 de l\u2019affaire\u201d que son obligation prendra effet. Au moment o\u00f9 l\u2019action a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e, il \u00e9tait encore le cr\u00e9ancier d\u2019un montant substantiel, et il n\u2019\u00e9tait s\u00fbrement pas \u201cd\u00e9sint\u00e9ress\u00e9\u201d. Le terme de cette obligation, s\u2019il arrive jamais, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas arriv\u00e9 en 1941, et le droit des demandeurs de r\u00e9clamer n\u2019\u00e9tait donc pas subordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 la remise aux d\u00e9fendeurs de ces droits et actions.\nEnfin, dans leur plaidoyer, les d\u00e9fendeurs all\u00e8guent que le billet du 7 f\u00e9vrier 1933, fait payable le 1er septembre de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, serait prescrit. Les termes m\u00eames de l\u2019\u00e9crit qui accompagne le billet semblent suffisants pour disposer de cette pr\u00e9tention. L\u2019obligation qu\u2019ont assum\u00e9e les d\u00e9fendeurs, de payer \u201cla moiti\u00e9 du montant d\u00fb aux dits V.

Or, comme les affaires n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es qu\u2019en 1941, il est \u00e9vident que la prescription a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendue, et qu\u2019elle n\u2019a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 courir qu\u2019\u00e0 cette date, l\u2019ann\u00e9e m\u00eame o\u00f9 l\u2019action a \u00e9t\u00e9 institu\u00e9e.\nPour les raisons ci-dessus mentionn\u00e9es, je suis d\u2019opinion de maintenir le pr\u00e9sent appel, et d\u2019accueillir l\u2019action jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de la somme de $11,158.18, soit la moiti\u00e9 du montant de $22,316.37 qui est la limite de l\u2019obligation des d\u00e9fendeurs intim\u00e9s. Les appelants auront droit aux int\u00e9r\u00eats sur ce montant depuis le jour de la signification de l\u2019action, et aux d\u00e9pens en Cour Sup\u00e9rieure et devant cette Cour. Les frais d\u2019appel \u00e0 la Cour du Banc du Roi seront payables par les appelants, car les intim\u00e9s ont r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 faire r\u00e9duire de fa\u00e7on substantielle le montant de la premi\u00e8re condamnation.\nRand J.: The material facts of this controversy are these. In the spring of 1931 the city of Quebec called for tenders for the construction of a reservoir. La Compagnie de Construction Limit\u00e9e submitted a tender, accompanied by a required deposit of $30,000. The largest interest in the shares of the Construction company was owned by one Poulin, the managing director. The secretary was Marcotte. The Construction company was the successful tenderer, and a bond against performance was furnished by a surety company which was in turn guaranteed against loss by the respondent, Lacroix, a brother-in-law of Poulin. The money for the deposit of $30,000, obtained by discounting a note dated July 20th, 1931, with the Royal Bank of Canada, was furnished to the company by the firm of V. Dionne et Fils, appellants, who took by way of security a demand note dated July 21st, 1931, for the same amount signed by the Construction company, one Gagnon, a director, Poulin and Marcotte, and endorsed by the appellants to the bank as collateral to the instrument discounted. On July 14th, 1936, a new security note, taken evidently in view of the approaching 5-year limitation period, on which the Construction company was maker and Messrs. Poulin, Marcotte and Gagnon endorsers, was furnished to the appellants and likewise transferred to the bank. Ultimately the discounted note, on which interest was paid from 1931 to 1941 by the appellants, was taken up by them and, with the two collateral notes, returned to them by the bank.\nFor the further financing of the contract, three guarantees were in the course of 1931 and 1932 furnished to the bank executed by Messrs. Poulin, Marcotte, Gagnon and Ludger Dionne, a member of the appellant firm. These were for $75,000, $50,000 and $75,000 respectively and each covered any ultimate balance that might be owing by the Construction company to the bank at the completion of the contract. The final balance for which these guarantors became responsible was $70,667.60 as of March 15th, 1941. On that day the appellants, under an arrangement with Ludger Dionne, paid off the bank and took over whatever securities were held against the account.\nThe work on the reservoir was commenced in 1931 and was substantially completed by February 7th, 1933, when it had become apparent that a loss would be suffered. Shortly before that time, the respondent Lacroix, the owner of all the shares of the respondent Madawaska company, approached the appellants for a loan of $83,000 for the benefit of that company and the Port Royal Pulp & Paper Company, likewise controlled by him. The former was to be advanced $60,000 and the latter $23,000. The negotiations issued in an agreement by which, in consideration of the loans, the Madawaska company and Lacroix were to assume one-half of the amount which Poulin should ultimately owe the appellants arising out of the obligations mentioned. The terms were reduced to writing and the clauses of the memorandum dealing with this feature are as follows:\u2014\nEn outre, la Madawaska Company donne aux dits V. Dionne et Fils un billet dat\u00e9 de ce jour au montant de vingt mille piastres ($20,000) qui sera payable sans int\u00e9r\u00eat le 1er septembre prochain. Ce montant repr\u00e9sentant un pr\u00eat fait \u00e0 B\u00e9loni Poulin par la Madawaska Company, et \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 aux dits V. Dionne & Fils en acompte sur ce que le dit B\u00e9loni Poulin leur doit et \u00e9tant sens\u00e9 repr\u00e9senter la moiti\u00e9 du montant d\u00fb aux dits V. Dionne & Fils lorsque toutes les affaires du r\u00e9servoir seront r\u00e9gl\u00e9es.\nIl est compris que si cette dette \u00e9tait moindre que quarante mille piastres ce billet ne sera d\u00fb que pour la moiti\u00e9 de cette dette, la dite Madawaska Company n\u2019\u00e9tant pas oblig\u00e9e de payer plus que le billet de vingt mille piastres.\nThe note mentioned was signed by the Madawaska company, endorsed by Lacroix and delivered to the appellants and is that on which the action is based. It was at this time expected that the construction would be completed in September of 1933, but between delay in minor details and controversies over claims, including liens, asserted against the City, the matter was not finally concluded until March, 1941, when the settlement with the bank was made.\nIn 1931 Poulin and Marcotte under an agreement in writing with Ludger Dionne had furnished certain securities to cover, as I interpret the agreement, the $30,000 notes and the liability of Dionne on the first letter of indemnity for $75,000 against which Poulin had agreed to protect him; and in relation to the notes, Ludger Dionne must be taken to represent the appellants. On March 11th, 1941, the securities were transferred to the appellants and in April and May of the same year they were in part taken over by them and in part surrendered to Poulin for cash on a total valuation of $47,300. At that time the interest on the discounted note for $30,000 as reduced in 1936 to 5 per cent. by a collateral note, which had been paid annually to the bank by the appellants, amounted to $15,722.80, making a total liability of $45,722.80. The notes given by Poulin and the others as collateral bore interest at 6 per cent. to cover this but a question is raised as to the amount of interest which can be claimed against Poulin.\nI think it clear that the agreement of February 7th, 1933, by implication in fact provides that the note of the respondents for $20,000 shall run as a continuing maximum obligation for one-half of the ultimate sum, on completion of the works, found due from Poulin to the appellants, which in the circumstances would represent part of the loss on the contract, less what Poulin himself might pay on it, and that consequently it became payable in March, 1941. In the original claim, the total sums paid by the appellants to the bank, namely $70,667.60, on account of the guarantees, and $45,722.80 on account of the principal and interest of the original loan, were asserted to represent that liability and loss; but I do not think the evidence permits us to connect that agreement with the indebtedness of Poulin arising out of the personal guarantee of Ludger Dionne to the bank. The former had been made with the appellants as a partnership; but the guarantees were signed by Dionne alone under an arrangement by which he became entitled to a large share of the net profits. The appellants cannot, therefore, resort to the deficit in operations for the purpose of ascertaining the debt of Poulin to them for the purposes of the agreement.\nThere remains the advance of $30,000 and its interest, both of which the collateral notes were intended to secure. It is argued that the agreement of 1933 provided for the assumption of one-half of the ultimate debt in respect of the obligations of Poulin existing at that time; that the note of 1936 superseded that of 1931 both in intention and because Poulin\u2019s liability was changed from that of a maker to that of an endorser; and that consequently that particular debt or liability had ceased to exist in 1936. But the reasonable inference from the circumstances here is that the second note was taken, ex abundantia cautela, not in substitution for, but as additional to, the first. The original continued to be held by the bank and both were delivered to the appellants attached to the discounted note. Ordinarily in such case the later instrument is taken to operate as a conditional payment suspending action on the earlier until dishonour, here clearly before July, 1941, upon which its collateral character relates back to the beginning: Noad v. Bouchard[5]; Royal Bank of Canada v. Hogg[6]. The earlier note continued therefore, subject to the operation of prescription, until 1941. This disposes also of the second point; but even if there were a substitution, on both notes Poulin was in fact a surety in relation to the Construction company and whether he appeared as maker or as endorser with waiver of protest, his obligation to the appellants vis-\u00e0-vis the respondents remained unaffected.\nThe prescription of the first note as well as the second however seems clearly to have been interrupted by the possession by or on behalf of the appellants, as security, of the shares of stock given them by Poulin under the agreement of 1931. That such possession is an interruption under article 2227 of the Civil Code seems to be clear both from the French commentators and decisions of the courts of Quebec. For instance, Dalloz, R\u00e9pertoire Pratique, n\u00b0 322, at page 174 says:\u2014\nLa reconnaissance tacite peut encore r\u00e9sulter: * * * de ce que le d\u00e9biteur fournit une caution ou donne un gage au cr\u00e9ancier. (Troplong, t. 2, No. 618; Laurent, t. 32, No. 129; Huc. No. 402; Baudry-Lacantinerie et Tissier No. 530;\nBaudry-Lacantinerie, 3rd edition, vol. 25, no. 530, at page 395:\u2014\nLes principaux faits d\u2019o\u00f9 peut s\u2019induire la reconnaissance tacite sont le paiement fait par le d\u00e9biteur qui est en voie de prescrire d\u2019une partie de sa dette -\u00e0 titre d\u2019acompte, le paiement par le d\u00e9biteur des int\u00e9r\u00eats de sa dette, la demande qu\u2019il fait d\u2019un d\u00e9lai pour le paiement, l\u2019offre et \u00e0 plus forte raison la dation de s\u00fbret\u00e9s telles qu\u2019une caution, un gage, une hypoth\u00e8que.\nPlaniol & Ripert, Droit Civil, vol. 12, n\u00b0 122, page 113:\u2014\nInterruption de la prescription de la cr\u00e9ance garantie\u2014Tant que le cr\u00e9ancier gagiste reste nanti, sa cr\u00e9ance n\u2019est pas soumise \u00e0 prescription, le fait du d\u00e9biteur de laisser le gage entre ses mains constituant de sa part une reconnaissance tacite permanente du droit du cr\u00e9ancier, qui interrompt \u00e0 tout instant la prescription. La solution contraire aboutirait \u00e0 ce r\u00e9sultat inadmissible, que le d\u00e9biteur, apr\u00e9s prescription de la dette, pourrait r\u00e9clamer la restitution du gage sans payer ce qu\u2019il devait.\nThis view was adopted in La Banque du Peuple v. Huot[7] and McGreevey v. McGreevey[8];. the same rule was applied in The Royal Trust Co. v. The Atlantic and Lake Superior Ry Co.[9]. The note, then, given in 1931 carries interest from that year until 1941 at the rate of 6 per cent. to produce an amount more than the interest actually paid. This interruption is not negatived by what, in the circumstances, we must take to be the case, the appropriation by the appellants of the proceeds of the securities to the indemnity liability, which under the agreement the creditor was entitled to make.\nThe main ground of resistance, which found support in the Court below, was that the note and agreement of 1933 together created an obligation on their part that was conditioned not only on the existence of an indebtedness of Poulin to the partnership but also on a loss in carrying out the reservoir contract; and that the onus lay on the appellants to prove the latter fact. But if we consider the circumstances in which the note was given, the ground of that contention disappears. Here was a construction of considerable magnitude virtually completed and the liabilities fixed. The financing had rested on the security of the partnership or one of its members and the only real protection to this was the personal obligation of Poulin and the property given by him in hypothec or pledge. Dionne was not a shareholder of the Construction company, and although he had bargained for a high percentage of the profits, he had nothing to do with the direction of the company, the contract or the reservoir work. No doubt it was loss on the latter that was in the minds of both the respondents and the appellants, but the reference to its completion in the 1933 agreement carries no further that general assumption. It is not suggested that the Construction company was at that time engaged in any other work, or that the particular account in the Royal Bank carried entries related to any other matter; and as to the actual expenditure made up to February, 1933, from what appears, Lacroix knew as much about it as Dionne. What are cried up are two or three items which are said to be misappropriations or to be outside of the range of the contract. Certainly if it can be shown that the appellants have received funds of the Construction company out of the bank credit set up, they must account for them. But it would be somewhat absurd to hold them to a responsibility for the disbursement of moneys over which, so far as it appears, except one item of $4,000 with which I shall deal, they had not the slightest control; and there is no evidence that any sum was actually spent for other purposes than what Poulin, whose entire financial substance seems to have been put at the risk of the venture, considered to be in the interest of the Construction company. At the highest, that is all that could be claimed on behalf of Lacroix. Moreover, the utmost implication of the evidence touches no more than a fraction of the $23,000 remaining after applying the securities to the operating loss.\nBut on May 2nd, 1931, Ludger Dionne, in the name of the appellants, drew a cheque on the Royal Bank of Canada at St. Georges payable to the order of Emile Renaud for $4,000. Under cross-examination, he admitted that this cheque was cashed and the money received by him, and that thereafter it came into the hands of another, who was named, to be used to influence members of the City Council of Quebec in relation to the award of the contract. It was stated by him on re-examination that these proceeds were actually used to pay the salary and travelling expenses of an employee of the Construction company and a receipt dated January 23rd, 1932, was produced in which a general acknowledgment of all moneys due purports to have been given. On December 22nd, 1931, the Construction company paid to the appellants the sum of $4,563.93 which is said to represent the return of the moneys so advanced. Lalibert\u00e9 J. at the trial remarks on this\u2014:\nLe soussign\u00e9 estime qu\u2019il appartenait aux d\u00e9fendeurs qui avaient sign\u00e9 le billet P-1 d\u2019\u00e9tablir, surtout apr\u00e8s la production des pi\u00e8ces mises au dossier par la demande, ce qui constituait dans le compte de la banque de la Compagnie de Construction de Qu\u00e9bec une dette ill\u00e9gale contract\u00e9e par Poulin. La preuve permet au soussign\u00e9 de d\u00e9clarer que la d\u00e9fense a prouv\u00e9 cependant \u00e0 la satisfaction de la Cour qu\u2019un montant de $4,000 a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9 de la banque pour des fins ill\u00e9gales, savoir dans le but de l\u2019appliquer \u00e0 l\u2019achat du vote de certains \u00e9chevins. Rien dans la preuve ne permet cependant de conclure que ledit montant a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 effectivement \u00e0 cette fin plut\u00f4t que de rester entre les mains de certains interm\u00e9diaires.\nIt will be seen that it is not found that the proceeds were in fact applied to the salary and expenses mentioned. But the fact remains that the appellants received from the Construction company the sum of $4,563.93 for which it is not shown they gave a valid consideration. If it had been established that the original proceeds had been applied to the illegal purpose, and witnesses were available who might have shown the truth or falsity of the allegation, the question would arise whether that fact had not so tainted the whole dealings between Poulin and the appellants that no binding obligation existed between them. But in any event it was encumbent upon Dionne at least to satisfy the Court that the payment made to his firm in December was credited to a legal indebtedness, and in the absence of that proof, this money must be treated as a payment on account of the debt that had at that time been incurred, the $30,000 advance. The principal therefore of $4,563.93 with interest at 6 per cent, until July 14th, 1936, and at 5 per cent, thereafter until March 11th, 1941, must be deducted from the total of $45,722.80.\nIt was argued that the Madawaska company had no power to bind itself as surety. The language of the agreement \u201cce montant repr\u00e9sentant un pr\u00eat fait \u00e0 B\u00e9loni Poulin par la Madawaska Company\u201d raises a serious doubt whether that is the true legal relation brought about: but as no evidence was offered to support the plea of ultra vires, this contention must be rejected.\nIt was then objected that Poulin was released from his liability to the partnership under the following document:\nSt-Georges de Beauce, le 5 mai 1941.\nNous, soussign\u00e9s, V. Dionne & Fils, nous nous engageons \u00e0 quittancer M. B\u00e9loni Poulin en ce qui regarde la construction du r\u00e9servoir de Qu\u00e9bec, lorsque nous aurons exerc\u00e9 nos recours contre les oblig\u00e9s dans cette affaire.\nBut assuming the engagement to be binding, this discharge is to be taken only when the firm has exercised its recourse against the other obligors. Admittedly, it is not a present release, and the reservation preserves the rights of sureties, if the respondents are such. A final point remains: should the securities given by Poulin in 1931 be appropriated pro rata to the two debts? Whether the language stating the purpose of the note:\u2014\nce montant repr\u00e9sentant un pr\u00eat fait \u00e0 B\u00e9loni Poulin par la Madawaska Company, et \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 auxdits. V. Dionne et Fils en acompte sur ce que ledit B\u00e9loni Poulin leur doit et \u00e9tant sens\u00e9 repr\u00e9senter la moiti\u00e9 du montant\nhas the effect of making the respondent a surety may be doubted; but I take it to preclude a surrender of any security in the hands of the appellants to another creditor of Poulin. It must, then, be attributed proportionately to the debt owing to the respondents and to that under the guarantee.\nI would allow the appeal and reduce the amount of the judgment at trial to the sum of $11,158.18. The appellants should have their costs in the Superior Court and in this Court. The respondents should have their costs in appeal before the Court of King\u2019s Bench.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants:\nSt. Laurent, Taschereau, St. Laurent & Gagn\u00e9.\nSolicitors for the respondents: Morin & Morin.\n[1] (1897) Q.R. 12 S.C. 370.\n[2] (1894) 23 Can.

M.C., a boy about ten years of age, was injured in the barn of the appellant, a farmer. The boy, already acquainted with that kind of operations, went to the appellant\u2019s farm to help him with his thrashing. He had not been invited but was not prevented doing so. He was asked to hold the bags to receive the grain, which was not a dangerous job. At the end of the day\u2019s work, the appellant removed the main belt running from the tractor to the thresher and two smaller belts in the machine itself; but the shaft of the drum continued to revolve under its own momentum. The boy, having tried without success to stop it with his hands, picked up one of the small belts and pressed it to the end of the shaft to slow it down, although called to by an employee to leave it alone. A momen later, the belt seemed to have been seized by the shaft and whirled around, and the boy\u2019s arm caught up in it was badly broken above the wrist. An action for damages brought by the respondent, in his quality of tutor to his minor son, was dismissed by the trial judge; but that judgment was reversed by a majority of the appellate court.\nHeld: The appeal should be allowed and the judgment of the trial judge restored.\nPer Kerwin and Kellock JJ.:\u2014Under all the circumstances of this case, there was not any duty owing by the appellant to the injured boy. More particularly the boy was not left alone at the time of the accident but there were three other men present who tried to stop him.\u2014The accident happened in such a short time that there was no obligation on the appellant to have previously warned the boy or to have sent him away from the premises.\nPer Taschereau, Rand, Kellock and Estey JJ.:\u2014The respondent\u2019s claim must be decided under the terms of article 1053 C.C. and the burden of proof was upon him. The machine was not by itself dangerous. The boy was injured not on account of the nature of the work he was doing, but because he voluntarily committed an imprudent act which the appellant was not at fault in not foreseeing.\nPer Taschereau, Kellock and Estey JJ.:\u2014The fact that it was possible that an accident might occur is not the criterion which should be used to determine whether there has been negligence or not. The law does not require a prudent man to foresee everything possible that might happen. Caution must be exercised against a danger if such danger is sufficiently probable so that it would be included in the category of contingencies normally to be foreseen. To require more and contend that a prudent man must foresee any possibility, however vague it may be, would render impossible any practical activity.\nAPPEAL from a judgment rendered by a majority of the Court of King\u2019s Bench, appeal side, province of Quebec, reversing the judgment of the Superior Court, Boulanger J. and maintaining an action for damages brought by the respondent for injuries which his minor son sustained in an accident. The material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the above headnote and in the judgments now reported.\nAlexandre Chouinard K.C. and Louis A. Pouliot K.C. for the appellant.\nLouis P. Pigeon K.C. and Geo. Ren\u00e9 Fournier for the respondent.\nKerwin J.:\u2014Marcel Cloutier, a boy of about ten years and five months of age, was injured in the barn of the appellant Ouellet, a farmer in the province of Quebec, in September, 1944. Although the boy did not give evidence at the trial and the trial judge did not, therefore, have an opportunity of observing his demeanour in the witness box, he was present in court. It is true that at that time he was more than a year older than at the time of the accident but, under all the circumstances, I do not know that the lack of the trial judge\u2019s opportunity to conclude from his appearance in the witness box as to his capacity is very important as an appeal court does not need a finding upon the boy\u2019s ability in order to dispose of the matter. I should add, however, that I do not adopt the view which it is contended the trial judge took that Marcel was under the care of Eugene Talbot.\nAccording to his own admission, the boy had been at a thrashing before and, on this occasion, went with some employees of a neighbour of the respondent, Madame Fournier. These employees went to Ouellet\u2019s barn in order to assist the appellant with his thrashing. Without deciding, I am willing to accept the position of the boy, contended for by counsel, as doing work for the appellant. I cannot see that any duty owing by the appellant to the boy is enlarged by that circumstance as the boy certainly was not a trespasser. He was not left alone at the time of the accident but there were three other men present. It was suggested that because the boy saw the appellant remove the small belt from the shaft, he was justified in assuming that it would be safe for him to replace the belt while the shaft was still revolving of its own momentum. Everything happened in such a short time that I think there was no obligation on the defendant to have previously warned the boy or to have sent him away from the premises.\nThe appeal should be allowed and the trial judgment restored, with costs throughout.\nThe judgment of Taschereau and Estey JJ. was delivered by\nTaschereau J.: Le deman-deur-intim\u00e9, en sa qualit\u00e9 de tuteur \u00e0 son enfant mineur, a poursuivi Napol\u00e9on Ouellet et Joseph Ouellet, et leur a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 conjointement et solidairement la somme de $2,722. Il all\u00e8gue dans son action que son fils mineur, Marcel Cloutier, \u00e2g\u00e9 de 10\u00bd ans, a \u00e9t\u00e9, le 21 septembre 1944, s\u00e9rieusement bless\u00e9 alors qu\u2019il aidait les d\u00e9fendeurs \u00e0 la mise en sacs du grain dans un moulin \u00e0 battre, op\u00e9r\u00e9 par Napol\u00e9on Ouellet et propri\u00e9t\u00e9 de l\u2019autre d\u00e9fendeur Joseph Ouellet.\nLa Cour Sup\u00e9rieure pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par M. le juge Boulanger a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019action, mais la Cour du Banc du Roi, infirmant ce jugement, a fait droit \u00e0 l\u2019appel et a maintenu l\u2019action du demandeur \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9 pour la somme de $2,484.20. Devant cette Cour, seuls Napol\u00e9on Ouellet et l\u2019intim\u00e9 sont en cause.\nL\u2019accident qui fait la base de ce litige est arriv\u00e9 alors qu\u2019un jour de cong\u00e9, Marcel Cloutier, fils mineur du demandeur, s\u2019\u00e9tait rendu chez une dame Thomas Fournier pour aider un nomm\u00e9 Talbot \u00e0 charroyer du bois. Avec tous les hommes de madame Fournier, l\u2019enfant se rendit chez le d\u00e9fendeur pour lui aider \u00e0 battre du grain, sans \u00eatre invit\u00e9 \u00e0 le faire, mais sans qu\u2019on lui d\u00e9fende de s\u2019y rendre. Le d\u00e9fendeur Napol\u00e9on dirigeait les op\u00e9rations de battage, et c\u2019est lui qui indiquait aux hommes le travail qu\u2019ils devaient faire. Le jeune Marcel n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u d\u2019instructions particuli\u00e8res, mais, au cours de la journ\u00e9e, a fait des travaux divers, et, quelque temps avant que le travail ne prit fin, Talbot qui recevait le grain dans les sacs a demand\u00e9 au jeune Marcel de faire ce travail qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve, n\u2019est pas un travail dangereux.\nLa machinerie \u00e9tait compos\u00e9e d\u2019un tracteur qui fournissait la force motrice \u00e0 la batteuse, et les deux \u00e9taient reli\u00e9s l\u2019une \u00e0 l\u2019autre par une courroie de transmission. Une autre courroie reliait \u00e9galement deux organes mobiles de la machine. Lorsque le travail, vers la fin de la journ\u00e9e, fut termin\u00e9, Napol\u00e9on Ouellet ordonna la fin des travaux et enleva la grande courroie reliant le tracteur \u00e0 la batteuse, ainsi que les deux courroies plus petites qui partent de poulies \u00e0 chaque extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 de l\u2019axe du batteur et actionnent le secoueux et le cribe ventilateur. Sous l\u2019effet de la force acquise, le batteur continua cependant \u00e0 tourner encore, et Marcel s\u2019aventura de l\u2019arr\u00eater avec ses mains qu\u2019il appuya sur la poulie de l\u2019axe; mais, voyant qu\u2019il ne pouvait r\u00e9ussir, il prit la courroie qui gisait \u00e0 terre, l\u2019appuya sur la poulie, mais malheureusement cette courroie s\u2019enroula sur l\u2019arbre, happa le bras droit de l\u2019enfant qui fut fractur\u00e9 au poignet.\nLe demandeur \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que cet accident est d\u00fb \u00e0 la faute, \u00e0 la n\u00e9gligence, \u00e0 l\u2019imprudence du d\u00e9fendeur Ouellet, en tol\u00e9rant la pr\u00e9sence du jeune enfant pr\u00e8s de la machine \u00e0 battre, qui serait une machine dangereuse et en n\u2019ayant pas pr\u00e9vu l\u2019imprudence de l\u2019enfant qui accomplissait un acte dans l\u2019ignorance totale du danger qu\u2019il comportait.\nIl est certain que la pr\u00e9sente action ne repose pas sur l\u2019article 1054 du Code Civil, mais que la demande ne peut \u00eatre fond\u00e9e que sur les dispositions de l\u2019article 1053 C.C. Pour r\u00e9ussir, le demandeur \u00e8s-qualit\u00e9 doit n\u00e9cessairement prouver la faute de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nCe dernier a-t-il manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 un devoir quelconque? Je ne le crois pas. Il est incontestable que la pr\u00e9sence du jeune Cloutier \u00e9tait tol\u00e9r\u00e9e dans la grange o\u00f9 se faisaient les travaux de battage et que m\u00eame ce dernier a \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 y participer. Mais, dans les circonstances, le fait de laisser ce jeune enfant, habitu\u00e9 \u00e0 ce genre de travaux, aider les autres hommes ne pr\u00e9sentait aucun danger. Je m\u2019accorde avec M. le juge Pratte de la Cour du Banc du Roi qui a dit:\nA la date de l\u2019accident, Marcel \u00e9tait \u00e2g\u00e9 de 10 ans et 5 mois. Fils d\u2019ouvrier, vivant \u00e0 la campagne, il avait l\u2019habitude de participer aux travaux de la ferme quand il n\u2019allait pas \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole. D\u2019une intelligence normalement d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e, il avait d\u00fb acqu\u00e9rir les connaissances que prennent les enfants de la campagne au contact des choses de la ferme. Il ne saurait y avoir de doute l\u00e0-dessus. Il n\u2019est pas un enfant de la campagne, vivant sur une ferme ou fr\u00e9quentant les cultivateurs \u00e0 leur travail, qui n\u2019ait pris part, m\u00eame avant l\u2019\u00e2ge de 10 ans, \u00e0 tous les travaux de la ferme, et qui ne connaisse le fonctionnement des machines agricoles m\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019a pas la dext\u00e9rit\u00e9 ou la s\u00fbret\u00e9 requises pour qu\u2019on lui eu confie la direction. Cela fait partie de son \u00e9ducation. Marcel Cloutier avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 assist\u00e9 au battage du grain; et s\u2019il n\u2019est pas \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il connaissait en d\u00e9tail le fonctionnement de la batteuse, il savait, \u00e0 n\u2019en point douter, le danger que pr\u00e9sente une roue ou un arbre de couche en mouvement.\nOr, le d\u00e9fendeur connaissait Marcel; non seulement il l\u2019avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu travailler avec les ouvriers de madame Fournier, mais l\u2019enfant avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 assist\u00e9 au battage chez lui. Le d\u00e9fendeur avait raison de croire que l\u2019enfant en savait tout autant, sur les travaux de la ferme, qu\u2019un fils de cultivateur. Peut-on dire alors qu\u2019il a commis une faute en l\u2019admettant dans la grange avec les ouvriers de madame Fournier qu\u2019il accompagnait souvent et qu\u2019il avait suivis ce jour-l\u00e0? Non pas. Certes, s\u2019il se fut agi d\u2019un enfant inconnu, ou absolument \u00e9tranger aux travaux de la ferme, le d\u00e9fendeur aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 tenu d\u2019exercer sur lui une surveillance \u00e9troite; mais dans le cas qui nous occupe, une telle mesure ne s\u2019imposait pas.\nLa machine elle-m\u00eame n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dangereuse, et le travail confi\u00e9 au jeune homme ne l\u2019exposait \u00e0 aucun p\u00e9ril. S\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 bless\u00e9, ce n\u2019est pas \u00e0 cause de la nature de son travail, mais bien parce qu\u2019il a volontairement commis une imprudence, qu\u2019on ne peut pas reprocher \u00e0 Ouellet de ne pas avoir pr\u00e9vue. Cet enfant, normalement intelligent, a \u00e9t\u00e9 par son imprudente activit\u00e9 l\u2019auteur de sa propre m\u00e9saventure, en essayant, malgr\u00e9 que l\u2019on eut tent\u00e9 de l\u2019en dissuader, d\u2019arr\u00eater par le moyen que l\u2019on sait la poulie en mouvement. Il s\u2019est expos\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame \u00e0 un danger \u00e9vident, qu\u2019il avait pourtant l\u2019\u00e2ge voulu pour appr\u00e9cier.\nIl se peut qu\u2019il \u00e9tait possible qu\u2019un accident semblable arriv\u00e2t. Mais ce n\u2019est pas l\u00e0 le crit\u00e8re qui doive servir \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a eu oui ou non n\u00e9gligence. La loi n\u2019exige pas qu\u2019un homme pr\u00e9voie tout ce qui est possible. On doit se pr\u00e9munir contre un danger \u00e0 condition que celui-ci soit assez probable, qu\u2019il entre ainsi dans la cat\u00e9gorie des \u00e9ventualit\u00e9s normalement pr\u00e9visibles. Exiger davantage et pr\u00e9tendre que l\u2019homme prudent doive pr\u00e9voir toute possibilit\u00e9, quelque vague qu\u2019elle puisse \u00eatre, rendrait impossible toute activit\u00e9 pratique.

Diamond Truck Co. [2]; Donoghue v. Stevenson [3]. Je suis en cons\u00e9quence d\u2019opinion que l\u2019appelant n\u2019a pas commis de faute en tol\u00e9rant dans la grange la pr\u00e9sence du fils de l\u2019intim\u00e9, pas plus qu\u2019en ne pr\u00e9voyant pas l\u2019imprudence que ce dernier a commise. On ne peut reprocher \u00e0 l\u2019appelant de ne pas avoir fourni les soins ordinaires qu\u2019un homme diligent devait fournir dans des conditions identiques. (L\u2019\u0152uvre des Terrains de Jeux de Qu\u00e9bec v. Cannon [4], M. le juge Rivard \u00e0 la page 114.)\nL\u2019appel doit \u00eatre maintenu, l\u2019action rejet\u00e9e et le jugement de M. le juge Boulanger r\u00e9tabli avec d\u00e9pens devant toutes les cours.\nRand J.:\u2014I see nothing in the evidence to support the case against the appellant. He is charged with fault in failing to exercise the care which, in the circumstances, a prudent man would have exercised to protect the young boy aged ten years and five months against the danger presented by the revolving shaft of the threshing machine. The boy had gone along to the barn with a group of four men sent over by a neighbour to assist in the threshing. Like a child of that age, he wanted to be in the work, and he was allowed to hold the bags into which the grain was poured by hand out of the containers into which it came from the machine; but he was in and out of the barn at will all day, and when near the machine would be in the presence of the workmen. Late in the afternoon, the appellant removed the main belt running from the tractor to the thresher on the left side and the small belt on the right side of the thresher connecting the main shaft with a smaller one, and set about to back the tractor out of the barn. At that moment, the shaft of the drum of about 2\u201d in diameter and projecting a few inches beyond the closed side of the drum was revolving under its own momentum, and three of the men were watching the teeth or arms of the shaft with the boy within five or six feet of them. All of a sudden, he picked up the small belt, about 1\u00bd\u201d in width and 5\u2019 in length, and pressed it to the end of the shaft to slow it down. One of the men called out to leave it alone, but he answered: \u201cNon, je l\u2019arr\u00eate\u201d. A moment later, the belt seems to have been seized by the shaft and whirled around, and the boy\u2019s arm caught up in it was badly broken above the wrist. I will assume that the end of the revolving shaft did present some degree of danger, but having regard to the fact that the boy was almost within reach of three men with whom he had come to the barn, that the shaft was merely running down, and that the boy was acquainted with the operations of the machine, I think it impossible to say that a reasonably prudent father would have taken any further step to guard against such a sudden and unexpected sortie. The appellant must show that the boy was surrounded with the care and foresight of such a person, and this I think he has done. Boys at farms, as part of their practical education as well as a satisfaction of their natural propensity to imitate their elders, assist at small jobs where they do not interfere with the work, and where the conditions are reasonably safe for them; and although the boy\u2019s father was not a farmer, he lived in a farming district and the boy spent a good deal of his spare time around the farms in the vicinity of his home, including the appellant\u2019s. He had the ordinary boy\u2019s discipline and dependability in these practical situations. But here was an impulsive act of wantonness indulged in a few moments before the last motion of the machinery would have been ended. Normally, in such circumstances, particularly the presence of the men, a boy of that age would not touch a revolving shaft, but certainly he would be expected to drop the belt instantly upon a sharp command to do so; and the injury suffered by him is due to that momentary wilfulness in disobedience.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and dismiss the action with costs throughout.\nKellock J.:\u2014Mr. Pigeon agrees that there is no difference between the civil law and the common law as to the principles applicable to such a case as the present. I proceed on the assumption contended for by the respondent that the infant was an employee of the appellant. In Smith v. Baker [5], Lord Herschell said at p. 362:\nIt is quite clear that the contract between employer and employed involves on the part of the former the duty, of taking reasonable care to provide proper appliances, and to maintain them in a proper condition, and so to carry on his operations as not to subject those employed by him to unnecessary risk. It is part of the obligation of the master that he shall warn the servant where the employment involves the use of machinery which may prove dangerous to the servant unless he is instructed with regard thereto, and instruction which reaches the standard of reasonable care in the case of an adult may not be sufficient in the case of a young person; Young v. Hoffman Mfg. Co. Ld. [6].\nI do not think there was any fault on the part of the appellant in permitting the boy to be engaged at all as he was that day. The evidence shows that he had been engaged in doing much the same sort of thing the year before without incident.\nThe other ground of liability which is urged is that the appellant ought to have anticipated that what happened was just the sort of thing a young boy would be likely to do and that the appellant failed in his duty to warn against it.\nIt is to be observed in the first place that in the case at bar the boy was not injured during the course of any work which he had been engaged in during the day or which he had been called upon to do. He had not been called upon to operate any part of the machinery or to come in contact with it. Moreover, the machine was not, when properly used, a dangerous machine, and even if the end of the shaft, which continued in motion after the belts were thrown off, came into contact with anyone it would not have caused any injury as is shown by the fact that the boy said he first placed his two hands on it to try to stop it.\nNor was the boy left alone. There were three adult workmen near him at all times. I do not think it can be said that the appellant ought to have anticipated the combination of circumstances that the boy would take from the floor one of the belts lying there and apply it to the shaft without being observed by one of the workmen in time to prevent him. I think the principle applicable is to be found in the following authorities:\nMazeaud: Responsabilit\u00e9 Civile, 2e \u00e9dition 1934, t. 2, no. 1597, p. 464;\nUne simple possibilit\u00e9 vague de realisation ne saurait suffire \u00e0 exclure l\u2019impr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9. Demogue: Des Obligations, 7, 6, no. 538, page 576:\nLe fait doit \u00eatre assez probable pour qu\u2019on doive se pr\u00e9munir contre lui car on ne peut se pr\u00e9munir contre tout ce qui est possible.\nIn Glasgow Corporation v. Taylor [7] Lord Sumner said at p. 67:\nWhere a question as to the care to be used arises between persons using as of right the place, where they respectively act, infancy as such on others to respect it, than infirmity or imbecility; but a measure of care is no more a status conferring right or a root of title imposing obligations on others to respect it, than infirmity or imbecility ; but a measure of care appropriate to the inability or disability of those who are immature or feeble in mind or body is due from others, who know of or ought to anticipate the presence of such persons within the scope and hazard of their own operation.\nAs to the boy himself the learned trial judge says:\n1. Selon son certificat de naissance, Marcel Cloutier est n\u00e9 \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec, le 6 avril 1934. Il \u00e9tait donc \u00e2g\u00e9 exactement de 10 ans, 5 mois et 15 jours \u00e0 la date de l\u2019accident. Les t\u00e9moins sont unanimes \u00e0 dire que c\u2019est un enfant intelligent et \u00e9veill\u00e9. Le soussign\u00e9 l\u2019a vu en Cour au cours du proc\u00e8s et il s\u2019est tr\u00e8s bien tenu. Il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu cependant, devant le tribunal, mais, en autant qu\u2019on peut en juger \u00e0 la lecture de sa d\u00e9position au pr\u00e9alable, il para\u00eet, en effet, normalement intelligent, raisonnable et averti.\nThe present is not such a case as Murphy v. Smith, [8]. There, while the plaintiff was injured in the course of doing an act which he had no right to do, he was observed and permitted to do the act by the employee in charge. This, had it been done by the defendant himself, would, in the opinion of the court in that case, have involved liability.\nIn Lawson v. Packard Electric Company, Ltd., [9], the difference of opinion among the members of the court was as to whether operation of the machine causing the injury was within the scope of the instructions the plaintiff had received.\nI do not think that the case Bouvier v. Fee [10], is of assistance here. In that case the machine was left unguarded and it was the breach of that duty upon which liability was founded.\nI think the appeal must be allowed and the action dismissed with costs throughout.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: Alexandre Chouinard.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Fournier & D\u00e9silets.\n[1] (1935) 41 R.L.N.S. 497.\n[2] (1939) Q.R. 66 K.B. 385; affirmed [1940] S.C.R, 455.\n[3] [1932] A.

R. 1, dismissing (Adamson J. and Donovan J. dissenting) appellant\u2019s appeal from his conviction on a charge of murder. At the trial Helen Elizabeth Berard, a witness for the Crown, gave evidence contradictory to statements made previously by her to the police and at the inquest of the deceased. On motion of Crown counsel the trial judge declared her an adverse witness and Crown counsel thereupon cross-examined her on a previous statement, without making it an exhibit, which consisted of five pages written by the witness and an extra page on which appeared a sketch drawn by her showing the back of the head of a taxi driver to have a bald spot. (The taxi driver, with whose murder the accused was charged, did not have a bald spot.) The five pages and the sketch were not fastened together at the time of their inception. Counsel for the accused in cross-examining the witness showed her the sketch, which at the preliminary inquiry had been attached to the sheets containing the writing, but which he at the trial removed and handed to the witness. The trial judge ruled that the entire statement including the sketch should go in as an exhibit (14) filed by the defence. In charging the jury the trial judge said it was their duty keeping in mind his charge as to reasonable doubt, to establish if possible in which of the conflicting statements of the witness lay the germ of truth. The accused did not testify nor were any witnesses called on his behalf.\nHeld: The judgment appealed from and the conviction should be set aside and a new trial directed.\nPer the Chief Justice and Kerwin, Taschereau and Estey JJ.: The prior self-contradictory statements of Crown witness Helen Elizabeth Berard, both sworn and unsworn, had no probative or evidential value as against the accused, and were not evidence of their content and could be used only to impeach the credit of the witness Berard, even though defence counsel cross-examined on them. The learned trial judge erred in going on the assumption that such prior self-contradictory statements were evidence of their content and inviting the jury to find \u201cwhat germ of truth\u201d there was in them. The said prior self-contradictory statements were not evidence of their content and the jury should have been so instructed, and not having been so instructed, it was not possible to say with confidence that without them the jury would have found a verdict of guilty.\nThere was an error at the trial for the reasons specified above in connection with exhibit 14, and it could not be said that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice, within section 1014 of the Criminal Code. The sketch and the written document being one document from the commencement, the effect of what Crown counsel had done was to make available the whole of it so that counsel for the accused became entitled to refer to the sketch, not mentioned by Counsel for the Crown; while the action of counsel for the accused had the effect of making the writing, as well as the sketch, an exhibit; but neither one could serve as evidence against the accused except, in so far as the witness adopted them as part of her testimony, and did not take the exhibit out of the category of something merely going to the credibility of the witness and raise it to the status of something that as against the accused was to be taken as evidence of the truth contained in the writing.\nAssuming that where a witness is declared adverse by the trial judge, sections 9 and 10 of the Canada Evidence Act should be read together so as to make applicable the last part of the proviso in subsection 1 of section 10:\u2014\n\u201cand that the judge, at any time during the trial may require the production of the writing for his inspection, and thereupon make such use of it for the purposes of the trial as he thinks fit,\u201d this does not mean that the trial judge may make that evidence which would not otherwise be evidence.

A.R. 26 at 28, 29 and the trial judge erred in directing the jury that they could treat the written part of exhibit 14 as evidence of the truth of what is therein stated Rex. v. Dibble (1908) 1 Cr. A.R. 155, A. White (1922) 17 Cr. A. R. 59, Rex v. Francis & Barber [1929] 3 D.L.R. 593. The decision in John Williams (1913) 8 Cr. A. R. 133 distinguished. There was nothing in the evidence given by the witness Berard at the preliminary inquiry as read into the record of the trial to show that she was a self-confessed perjurer. Douglas Walter Atkinson (1934) 24 Cr. A.R. 144 distinguished. Rex v. Kadeshevitz [1934] O.R. 213; 61 C.C.C. 193 and Rex v. Ferguson 83 C.C.C. 23 at 25 referred to.\nPer Rand J.: The effect of counsel for the accused offering in evidence the sketch made by the witness Berard and cross-examining her thereon, was to introduce in evidence the written statement which accompanied the sketch and simply completed the evidence of the statement. It did not extend the statement\u2019s relevancy beyond credibility. The trial judge erred in holding that counsel for the accused, by putting the sketch in evidence, must be taken to have introduced the statement itself as substantive evidence on behalf of the accused, and in charging the jury that the incriminating facts contained in the statement were to be treated as having general testimonial character from which, and the rest of the evidence, the jury was to extract the truth. An error in such a vital matter cannot be held to have been unquestionably overborne by the rest of the case presented. APPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba (1) dismissing (Adamson J. and Donovan J. dissenting) the appellant\u2019s \u2018appeal from his conviction, at trial before Major J., and a jury, on a charge of murder.\nH. Walsh for the appellant.\nA. A. Moffat K.C. and J. H. Stitt for the respondent.\nThe judgment of The Chief Justice and of Kerwin, Taschereau and Estey JJ. was delivered by\nKerwin J.:\u2014This appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Manitoba [1] affirming the appellant\u2019s conviction on a charge of murder is based upon dissents by Adamson J. and Donovan J. The former would have set aside the conviction and ordered a new trial on the following grounds:\u2014\n1. That the prior self-contradictory statements of Crown witness Helen Elizabeth Berard, both sworn and unsworn (viz. exhibits 12, 13 and 14 and the inquest evidence), had no probative or evidential value as against the accused, and were not evidence of their content and could be used only to impeach the credit of the witness Helen Elizabeth Berard, even though defence counsel cross-examined on them.\n2. The learned Trial Judge erred in going on the assumption that such prior self-contradictory statements were evidence of their content and inviting the jury to find \u201cwhat germ of truth\u201d there was in them.\n3. That the said prior self-contradictory statements were not evidence of their content and the jury should have been so instructed, and not having been so instructed it was not possible to say with confidence that without them the jury would have found a verdict of guilty;\nDonovan J. dissented on these grounds in substance, and also on other grounds but, furthermore, came to the conclusion that the accused should be acquitted. I cannot agree that there should be an acquittal but since, in my view, there was error at the trial for the reasons specified above in connection with exhibit 14, and I am unable to say there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice within section 1014 of the Criminal Code, it follows that there should be a new trial, and I therefore refrain from discussing the evidence at length or the other grounds of dissent mentioned by Donovan J., with one exception.\nExhibit 14 consists of five pages of a statement written by the witness Berard and an extra sheet on which appears a sketch drawn by her showing the back of the head of a taxi driver to have a bald spot. The taxi driver, with whose murder the accused was charged, did not have a bald spot. I take it from the evidence, as did also the Chief Justice of Manitoba, that the five pages containing the written statement of Berard, and the sketch, really formed one document from their very inception, although the various sheets were not fastened together at that time.\nAt the trial Berard, called as a witness by the Crown, was declared adverse by the trial judge under section 9 of the Canada Evidence Act and by leave of the judge, Crown counsel cross-examined her as to her previous written statement in exhibit 14 without making it an exhibit. Berard admitted having made this statement but said it had been written under fear of the police and denied the important part of it in which she placed the accused with her in the taxi at the time of the slaying. Counsel for the accused later showed her the sketch, which at the preliminary inquiry had been attached to the sheets containing the writing but which counsel for the accused at the trial removed and handed to the witness separately. This sketch and the written statement being one document from the commencement, the effect of what Crown counsel had done was to make available the whole of it so that counsel for the accused became entitled to refer to the sketch, not mentioned by counsel for the Crown, as possibly affecting the written part. Counsel for the accused put in the sketch as an exhibit and it is contended for the Crown that this made the writing an exhibit and that what was narrated therein was evidence of the truth thereof. While the action of counsel for the accused had the effect of making the writing as well as the sketch an exihibit, neither one could serve as evidence against the accused except, of course, in so far as the witness adopted them as part of her testimony at the trial.\nThe fact that the sketch was put in as an exhibit, and therefore the writing, does not take the exhibit out of the category of something merely going to the credibility of the witness and raise it to the status of something that as against the accused is to be taken as evidence of the truth of the statements contained in the writing. A contrary proposition would be entirely foreign to our criminal law. Assuming that where a witness for the Crown is declared adverse by the trial judge, sections 9 and 10 of the Canada Evidence Act should be read together so as to make applicable the last part of the proviso in subsection 1 of section 10:\u2014\nand that the judge, at any time during the trial may require the production of the writing for his inspection, and thereupon make such use of it for the purposes of the trial as he thinks fit,\nthis does not mean that the trial judge in making \u201csuch use of it for the purposes of the trial as he thinks fit\u201d may make that evidence which would otherwise not be evidence. This would appear to be so in principle and was the view of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Target Tillson Birch, [2].\nThe trial judge directed the jury that they could treat the written part of Exhibit 14 as evidence of the truth of what is therein stated. That this was wrong is made plain by all the text-books and such cases as Rex v. Dibble, [3], A. White [4], Rex v. Francis & Barber, [5]. The decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in England in John Williams [6], must be read with care. Apparently a witness gave the same testimony at the trial as on a previous occasion except that she gave a different date for certain important occurrences and it was held that the jury might consider that part of the previous testimony to which she agreed at the trial. There is nothing in this case that conflicts with the general proposition.\nIt was argued that on the authority of Leonard Harris [7], and Douglas Walter Atkinson [8], the jury should have been warned that the evidence of Berard was of no value. In the Atkinson case 8, a witness was stated by the Lord Chief Justice, at page 125, to be not only an accomplice in connection with charges against the accused of perjury and subornation of perjury but also herself a perjurer. That precise point does not arise here because there is nothing in the evidence given by Berard at the preliminary inquiry as read into the record of the trial to show that she was a self-confessed perjurer. So far as her testimony at the trial was shown to be contradictory to the written statement in Exhibit 14, certain expressions in the Leonard Harris case do afford a basis for the argument of counsel for the present appellant. While it must be borne in mind that the appeal in that case was dismissed the Lord Chief Justice is reported to have said at page 149:\u2014\nThe learned judge directed the jury in the proper way, namely, that the effect of the previous statement taken together with the sworn statement was to render the girl a negligible witness and that the jury must consider whether the case was otherwise and by others made out.\nAs to this, I agree with Riddell J., in Rex v. Kadeshevitz 9, that that cannot be taken to correctly set forth the Jaw. That is not to say that there may not be cases where it is advisable for a trial judge to point out a weakness in the Crown\u2019s case, particularly if it arises from the bad record of the principal Crown witness. It was so put, and not as a principle of law, by Chief Justice Robertson, speaking for the Court of Appeal for Ontario, in Rex v. Ferguson 10.\nBecause the trial judge in this case instructed the jury that Berard\u2019s statement in exhibit 14 might be taken as evidence of the truth of what was therein stated, the judgment appealed from and the conviction should be set aside and a new trial directed.\nRand J.:\u2014This is an appeal from a conviction for murder. In the Court of Appeal there were dissents on a number of questions of law, but I do not find it necessary to deal with more than one.\nThe leading witness for the prosecution was, in the course of her testimony, declared to be hostile, and the Crown was permitted to cross-examine her in relation to a previous statement in writing she had of her own volition prepared and handed to the police. In that she purported to give an account of the murder of the driver of a taxi in which she and the accused had been riding, but out of which she had got or was getting when the fatal act was committed, an account which directly connected the accused with that act. Her evidence in court, bringing their movements generally to the scene of the death consistently with the statement, diverged from it in representing the taxi carrying the accused to have left the scene and in introducing a new taxi in which the killing took place, of which she was, virtually, a witness. The statement signed by her was produced in court and the examination on it proceeded by reading it passage by passage to her, the whole of which the witness admitted having made. The document itself was not further offered in evidence or otherwise read to the jury. On cross-examination, counsel offered in evidence a sketch made by her representing the scene of her movements in the vicinity of the crime. This sketch, showing the roads with streetcar tracks along which the taxi had passed and she had afterwards fled, contained also a drawing of the back of a man\u2019s head with a bald spot on it which the witness stated to represent the head of the driver of the taxi in which she and the accused had been passengers. There was evidence that the slain man had no such baldness. It later appeared that the sketch had accompanied the statement which it was intended by the witness to illustrate when given by her to the police. The Crown thereupon took the position that by putting the sketch in evidence, counsel must be taken also to have introduced the statement itself as substantive evidence on behalf of the accused. The trial judge so held, and in the charge (and as well in the address of Crown counsel) the incriminating facts contained in the statement were treated as having general testimonial character, from which and the rest of the evidence the jury was to extract the truth.\nThat such statements generally are limited to credibility and cannot be used as evidence of the truth of the facts to which they relate, is well established: Rex v. Dibble 11, Rex v. Harris 12, Rex v. Francis & Barber 13. It is quite true that it may be difficult to dissociate the matters of such statements from the facts brought before the jury by the witness and to nullify the influence they may have on the minds of the jurors in dealing with the evidence as a whole; but anything short of this would expose a person to a fabricated account of events, too dangerous to risk. But the whole field of cross-examination, in the discretion of the court, is opened and the matters of the statement can thus be brought within the test of the testimonial response of the witness. This might be taken as a reason for leaving all the facts, including the statement, to the consideration of the jury, but the long experience of the courts is against it.\nIt is argued that the case of Rex v. Harris 14, in which a similar question arose has been disregarded in Rex v. Kadeshevitz 15; but what was there dissented from was the apparent language of Hewart, L.C.J. that in the presence of such a contradiction the sworn testimony in court of the witness must be treated as wholly nullified. The Court of Appeal for Ontario held that the testimony might be considered by the jury notwithstanding the contradiction; but it accepted the view that the contradictory statements themselves could not be treated as substantive evidence, available for all purposes.\nThe question here, then, is whether, in the circumstances, the effect of the course taken by counsel for the accused has been to enlarge the relevancy of the statement. As the whole of it was read in court in the hearing of the jury and as the sketch was an explanatory part of it, the introduction of the latter by the defence simply completed the evidence of the statement that had been brought out. It was counsel\u2019s right to have the entire statement so presented without extending its relevancy beyond credibility. The addition to the record of the statement itself brought nothing new to the proceedings, and must be considered in any view to be limited likewise to its original purpose.\nIt is urged by Mr. Moffatt that notwithstanding this impropriety, the remaining evidence as a whole was of such weight as to enable us to say that the jury must, under proper directions and acting judicially, have found the accused guilty. From that view, on this particular point, Adamson, J. A. (ad hoc) dissented, and with him I agree that the error in such a vital matter cannot be held to have been unquestionably overborne by the rest of the case presented.\nI would, therefore, allow the appeal and direct a new trial.\nAppeal allowed, conviction quashed and new trial directed.\nSolicitors for the appellant: McMurray, Greschuk, Walsh, Micay, Molloy, Denaburg and McDonald.\nSolicitor for the respondent: J.

The King, [1947] S.C.R. 539\nDate: 1947-06-18\nKenneth Green and George Constantine (Plaintiffs) Appellants;\nand\nHis Majesty The King (Defendant) Respondent.\n1947: May 27; 1947: June 18.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J., and Kerwin, Taschereau, Kellock and Estey JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO.\nCriminal Law\u2014Speedy Trials of Indictable Offences by County Court Judge\u2014Several Charges\u2014Mixing Trials\u2014Refusal to hear argument and deliver judgment at conclusion of each charge\u2014Criminal Code, ss. 838, 839 and 857 (2).\nThe accused, appellants, were charged on a number of counts on which, following a preliminary hearing, they elected speedy trial under Part XVIII of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1927, c. 36. The Crimes charged fell into four groups. Those in the first group arose out of the breaking and entering of premises in the township of York on the 23rd August 1945; in the second, out of an armed robbery in the city of Hamilton on the 26th August 1945; in the third, out of an armed robbery in the city of Toronto on the 16th September 1945; and in the fourth, out of an armed robbery in the city of Stratford on the 12th October 1945.\nAs to the first group, both the appellants and one Dobbie were jointly charged on counts 1, 2 and 3. As to the second, the appellant Green alone was charged on count 7 and 8. As to the third, the appellant Constantine and one Hiscox were jointly charged on counts 4 and 5, and as to the fourth, both appellants were charged on count 6.\nThe accused Dobbie did not appear for trial. Counsel for the accused at the opening of the trial, requested that each charge be tried separately, but acceded to the suggestion of the Court, that those offences which arose out of the same set of circumstances should be tried together. The trial of the appellants on counts 1, 2 and 3 was then proceeded with, and when all the evidence had been heard, counsel for the accused, asked the Court to hear argument and deliver judgment before proceeding to hear the evidence on any of the other counts. The trial judge refused and stated that he would hear the evidence on all the charges and then give counsel an opportunity to present argument on all of them before he would deliver judgment. All the evidence was then heard on count 6, then on counts 7 and 8 and finally on counts 4 and 5.\nAt the conclusion of all the evidence on all the charges, the trial judge heard argument on all the charges and then reserved judgment. Four days later he delivered judgment and found the appellants guilty on counts 1, 3 and 6 and not guilty on count 2; the appellant Green guilty on counts 7 and 8; the appellant Constantine and the accused Hiscox not guilty on counts 4 and 5, and sentenced the appellants to 14 years imprisonment on each charge, sentences to be concurrent.\nOn appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the convictions on counts 1 and 3 were quashed and a new trial directed, but the appeal against the conviction of the appellants on count 6, and that of the appellant Green on counts 7 and 8 were dismissed.\nIt was contended on appeal to the Appeal Court of Ontario, that the trial judge erred in mixing the trials by refusing to hear argument and deliver judgment at the conclusion of the evidence on each charge or group of charges, where two or more were tried together; and by reserving judgment until he had heard all the evidence on all the charges.\nThis submission was not accepted by the appellate court, who followed its own previous decision in Rex v. Bullock[1]; that decision being in conflict with the decision of the Court of Appeal of Nova Scotia in The Queen v. McBerney[2], application to appeal to this Court was granted under section 1025 of the Criminal Code.\nHeld, affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario, [1947] O.R. 264; [1947] O.W.N. 325; [1947] 3 D.L.R. 32, the appeal should be dismissed. Nothing should detract from the salutary rule that everything should be done to avoid even the appearance of prejudice in the mind of the convicting judge against the prisoner arising out of facts developed in a later prosecution, and, therefore the ordinary practice should be followed that one case should be disposed of, so far as the verdict is concerned, before entering upon the consideration of another. Irrespective of s. 838 of the Criminal Code, by which the judge may adjourn the hearing, it should not be laid down (as a rule of law) that a judge must acquit or convict in all cases before proceeding with another charge against the same accused; or must announce his decision on one count against two accused before proceeding with the trial of one of them on other counts. There may be cases where it is necessary to do so because an accused might, on the subsequent trial, plead autre fois acquit or autre fois convict, and in no case may a judge convict a person on one charge by reason of evidence heard on the trial of another charge but, if it appears that these rules have not been infringed, then the convictions should not be set aside.\nThe joinder in a single charge sheet of several counts on which an accused has been committed for trial on a single information is permitted, The King v. Deur [1944] S.C.R. 435 and by section 857 (2) of the Criminal Code, which appears in Part XIX but which, by section 839, is made applicable to the formal statement and trial under Part XVIII, the Court, if it thinks it conducive to the ends of justice to do so, may direct that the accused shall be tried upon any one or more of such counts separately, subject to the proviso therein expressed.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[3] insofar as that judgment affirmed convictions of the appellants on charges of armed robbery by his Honour Judge Parker sitting in the County Judges\u2019 Criminal Court of the County of York at the City of Toronto.\nGordon W. Ford and Charles L. Dubbin for the appellants.\nW.B. Common, K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of the Court was delivered by\nKERWIN J.\u2014Leave to appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario was granted on the ground that it conflicted with the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia en banco in The Queen v. McBerny[4]. That case decided that where a judge tries a charge without a jury under the Speedy Trials clauses of the Criminal Code, it is not competent for him to postpone his decision on a first charge against an accused until he has heard the evidence on several other charges against the same party and to then decide the question of guilt in all. In the judgment appealed from, the matter is treated as one for consideration in each particular case and not as a rule of law of general application. Of the other decision referred to, Hamilton v. Walker[5] was distinguished in the subsequent case of Regina v. Fry[6] where it appeared from an affidavit filed on behalf of the justices that in adjudicating in each of several cases tried before them they applied to that case the evidence given in reference to it and no other, and that the evidence given in the second case in no way influenced their decision on the first. The decision of the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Rex v. Bullock[7] followed the Fry case. The British Columbia Court of Appeal in The King v. Iman Din[8], divided equally on the question.\nNothing should detract from the salutary rule that everything should be done to avoid even the appearance of prejudice in the mind of the convicting judge against the prisoner arising out of facts developed in a later prosecution, and, therefore, the ordinary practice should be followed that one case should be disposed of, so far as the verdict is concerned, before entering upon the consideration of another. I do not attach any importance to section 838 of the Code by which the judge may adjourn the hearing. Irrespective of that section, it should not be laid down that a judge must acquit or convict in all cases before proceeding with the trial of another charge against the same accused, or as in the case before us, announce his decision on one count against two accused before proceeding with the trial of one of them on other counts. There may be cases where it is necessary to do so because an accused might, on the subsequent trial, plead autrefois acquit or autrefois convict, and in no case may a judge convict a person on one charge by reason of evidence heard on the trial of another charge but, if it appears that these rules have not been infringed, then the convictions should not be set aside. It is not without importance in disposing of the matter to bear in mind that the joinder in a single charge sheet of several counts on which an accused has been committed for trial on a single information is permitted: The King v. Deur[9] and that by section 857 (2), which appears in Part XIX but which, by section 839, is made applicable to the formal statement and trial under Part XVIII, the Court, if it thinks it conducive to the ends of justice to do so, maydirect that the accused shall be tried upon any one or more of such counts separately,\u2014subject, of course to the proviso therein expressed.\nIn view of the evidence given in connection with counts 6, 7 and 8 and the reasons of the trial judge, the rules set out above have not been violated and the appeals should, therefore, be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the appellant Green: Joseph Sedgwick.\nSolicitor for the appellant Constantine: Kimber & Dubbin.\n[1] 6 O.L.R. 663; 8 Can.

The lease further prohibited assignments and sub-leases without leave, provided for re-entry by the lessor if rent in arrear for two years and also gave the tenant an option to purchase the premises \"during the continuance of the (ten year) term or the continuation thereof.\" In January, 1943, the respondent gave to the appellant notice to quit; and, in August, 1944, an action was instituted for possession on the ground that after the expiration of the period of ten years the appellant became a tenant from year to year, which tenancy could be determined by a simple notice of termination. At a later stage of the action, after the appellant had pleaded Order 108 of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, the respondent further contended that the appellant had, prior to the giving of the notice, committed a breach of the covenant not to assign without leave and that such a breach had the effect of removing the case from the operation of the Order. By section 16 (4), no notice to vacate may be given except if \"the tenant is * * * breaking the conditions of his lease.\" By section 24 (2), it is provided that \"in case of default in payment * * * nothing in this Order contained shall be deemed to preclude a landlord * * * from giving any notice to vacate or demand for possession in accordance with the law of the province * * * \". Before trial, certain questions of law (19 M.P.R. 408) were by agreement between the parties submitted for adjudication; and Campbell C.J. (19 MP.R. 429) determined these points of law in the main in favour of the respondent. This decision was affirmed by the appellate court.\nHeld: The defendant's appeal to this Court should be allowed.\nPer The Chief Justice, Taschereau and Kellock JJ. The respondent contended that, while by section 16 default in payment of rent gives a landlord a right to terminate the tenancy only at its expiration by a specific form of notice, yet by section 24 (2) the same act of default takes the tenancy out of the operation of the regulation altogether. Held: The regulations are to be construed as a whole; and a rational interpretation may be given to section 24 (2) by construing it to mean that if, by provincial law, a right is given to the landlord by reason of default in payment of rent, that right is preserved to him, and it is the same where there is \"a breach of a covenant other than a covenant to pay rent\". If by provincial law there is afforded to the landlord a right to give a notice to vacate or demand possession on that ground or to take proceedings for recovery of possession founded thereon, then he is not limited by the provisions of section 16 in the exercise of that right.\u2014In the present case it is not pretended that there is available to the respondent by the law of the province any right to recover possession because of the alleged breach of covenant. Accordingly, as the notice did not \"state the circumstances in respect of which it was given\", it did not comply with the provisions of section 16 and is nugatory.\nPer The Chief Justice, Taschereau and Kellock JJ.:\u2014The respondent also contended that, even if the notice to quit was ineffective to terminate the occupancy of the appellant, it none the less terminated the option to purchase because such option should be considered as entirely outside the scope of the regulations. Held: This contention cannot be accepted. The lease provides that the lessee \"shall at all times during the continuance of the term or the continuation thereof\" have the right to purchase and, the notice to quit being ineffective, it follows that the tenancy continued and the option was exercisable according to its plain terms. Per The Chief Justice, Taschereau and Kellock JJ.:\u2014The respondent further contended that a tenancy from year to year, unless terminated by notice, is capable of going on indefinitely and that, consequently, as the period of time for the operation of the option was entirely indefinite, it was void. Held: The option to purchase was valid and did not offend the rule against perpetuities. \"The person for the time being entitled to the property subject to the future limitation\", namely the respondent as owner, may destroy the option by terminating the lease by due notice in accordance with the relevant law without \"the concurrence of the individual interested under that limitation\", namely the appellant or those claiming under him,\u2014 London and South Western Ry. Co. v. Gorman (20 ch. D. 562, at 581).\nPer Rand J.:\u2014The respondent has not brought himself within the Order for the reason that the notice to vacate did not, as required by sub. 5 of s. 16, state the reason for giving it.\u2014Also, under section 24 (2), a breach of covenant ipso facto does not take the entire lease outside of the application of the Order. Otherwise there would not appear to be any purpose in providing sub. (4) (a) of s. 16, unless it is said that in all cases a notice must be given; and then the same objection would arise in this case, that a proper notice had not been given.\u2014Further the respondent's contention, that the option to purchase was void because it might be exercised beyond the period of the rule against perpetuities, should not be assented to. A sufficient answer to such contention is that the option could be terminated by either party by the requisite notice. As the lease was in force when the tender of the money was made, the lessee has brought himself within the terms of the option.\nPer Estey J.:\u2014A lease would contain a right of perpetual renewal only if such an intention is clearly expressed; and the language used must import both renewal and perpetuity. But, in this case, the terms indicate a clear intention to create a tenancy from year to year. Also, its provisions show a similar intention that the lease shall continue until its termination rather than it Should be renewed by the lessee in each year.\u2014The notice to quit was invalid as a notice to vacate under the Order, because it did not contain the requirements of s. 16 (4).\u2014Express language must be found in section 24 (2) so that the breach of a covenant not to assign, transfer or sublet would remove entirely the effect of the Order and restore provincial law for all purposes: it ought not to be implied.\u2014Therefore, the lease is valid and subsisting and, by its express terms, the option to purchase was outstanding.\u2014An option contained in a lease, where either by its express terms or by operation of law the right remains in the lessor or owner of the property to terminate both the lease and option, does not involve an infraction of the provisions of the provincial Perpetuities Act.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island (in banco) ([1]) affirming a judgment of Campbell C.J. ([2]), which had determined, in favour of the lessor (respondent), points of law and equity arising in an action by the lessor to recover possession of leased premises.\nNo trial of any issues of fact has taken place and no evidence has been adduced.\nW. E. Bentley K.C. and M. M. Maclntyre for the appellant.\nH. F. McPhee K.C. for the respondent.\nThe judgment of The Chief Justice and of Taschereau and Kellock JJ. was delivered by\nKellock J.:\u2014By an indenture of lease dated August 1, 1926, the respondent leased to the appellant certain lands for a term of ten years at a rental of $12.00 per annum,\nprovided always that at the expiration of the ten year term hereby demised this demise and everything contained herein Shall at the option of the said lessee continue as a demise of the said premises to the said lessee from year to year thereafter at the same yearly rent herein reserved and subject to the same terms and conditions contained herein. Provided, further, that after the expiration of the said ten year term hereby demised the said lessee shall have the privilege of terminating this lease upon giving to the lessor twelve months' notice in writing and upon conforming with the other conditions and stipulations contained herein.\nThe lease also contained a covenant against assigning or subletting without leave and further provided for re-entry by the lessor if the rent should be in arrear for two years. It also provided as follows:\nAnd that the lessee shall at all times during the continuance of the said term or the continuation thereof have the right, privilege and option of purchasing the said premises from the lessor on payment from him, the lessee to the lessor, of the price or sum of three hundred dollars.\nOn January 12, 1943, the respondent gave to the appellant notice in writing to quit and deliver up possession of the demised premises on August 1st following. On August 7, 1944, this action was instituted for possession clearly on the theory, as shown by the statement of claim, that after the expiration of the period of ten years the appellant became a tenant from year to year, which tenancy could be determined by a simple notice of termination. It was not until a later stage of the action, after the appellant had pleaded Order 108 of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, that the respondent took the position that the appellant had, prior to the giving of the notice, committed a breach of the covenant not to assign without leave and that Order 108 therefore did not apply.\nSection 16 (1) of that Order provides that if a landlord wishes to terminate a lease he may give\ndue notice to vacate in writing in accordance with the provisions of this Part * * * and no notice to vacate shall be given except in accordance with the provisions of this Part.\nIn the circumstances here relevant clause (d) provides for notice of at least three months. By subsection 4 no notice to vacate may be given except by reason of certain circumstances, one being\nthat the tenant is in default in payment of rent or is breaking the conditions of his lease,\nand the notice is required to state the circumstances in respect of which it is given.\nOn the assumption that he will be able to prove the alleged breach at the trial the respondent submits that the mere fact of such a breach removes the case from the operation of Order 108 and that therefore he was entitled to terminate the tenancy by the notice which he gave.\nTo consider the soundness of this contention it will be convenient to examine what would be its effect, if, instead of the particular breach of covenant here alleged, there had been default in payment of rent. Under the provisions of section 16 (1) the landlord could in such circumstances have given a notice in writing, which by ss. 2, \"unless the lease provides for longer notice\" would have had to be a three months' notice terminating at the end of the term, and the notice must have specified non-payment of rent as the reason for its having been given. This last requirement is emphasized by s.s. 5.\nBy section 24 (2) it is provided that\nin case of default in payment * * * nothing in this Order contained Shall be deemed to preclude a landlord * * * from giving any notice to vacate or demand for possession in accordance with the law of the province * * * or from taking any proceedings available to a landlord under the law of any province to recover possession.\nUnder the construction contended for by the respondent, while by section 16 default in payment of rent gives a landlord a right to terminate the tenancy only at its expiration by a specific form of notice, yet by section 24 (2) the same act of default takes the tenancy out of the operation of the regulation altogether. The regulations are to be construed as a whole and, if possible, effect much be given to all the parts. Section 24 (2) operates by way of exception. To give effect to respondent's contention would make the exception \"eat up the rule\"; Ferrand v. Hallos, Land and Building Company ([3]). I think that a rational interpretation may be given to section 24 (2) which will not have that effect by construing it to mean that if, by provincial law a right is given to the landlord by reason of default in payment of rent, that right is preserved to him. It follows that the same is true where there is \"a breach of a covenant other than a covenant to pay rent.\" If by provincial law there is afforded to the landlord a right to give a notice to vacate or demand possession on that ground or to take proceedings for recovery of possession founded thereon, then he is not limited by the provisions of section 16 in the exercise of that right.\nIn the case at bar it is not pretended that there is available to the respondent by the law of Prince Edward Island any right to recover possession because of the alleged breach of covenant. Accordingly, as the notice given does not comply with the provisions of section 16 it is nugatory. I have considered the question on the basis that the respondent's construction as to the nature of the tenancy as a tenancy from year to year is correct.\nIt is next contended that even although the notice given by the respondent was ineffective to terminate the occupancy of the appellant, it nonetheless terminated the option to purchase. It is said that the rental regulations do not purport to do more than control certain aspects of the relationship of landlords and tenants as such; that an option to purchase is collateral to that relationship and should therefore be considered as entirely outside the scope of the regulations. This contention found favour below but, with respect, I am unable to accept it. The lease provides that the lessee\nshall at all times during the continuance of the said term or the continuation thereof have the right. The notice to quit was either effective to terminate the tenancy or it was not. Being ineffective, in my opinion, under the governing law, i.e., the law authorized by Parliament, it follows that the tenancy continued and the option was exercisable according to its plain terms. It is next contended that the terms of the lease with respect to the option offend the rule against perpetuities as the option, like all other terms of the lease,\nshall respectively enure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, respectively.\nThe rule in the province of Prince Edward Island is embodied in a statute known as The Perpetuities Act, 4 Geo. VI, cap. 46. I do not read it as differing from the rule as it is understood apart from statutory provisions.\nIt is said on behalf of the respondent that a tenancy from year to year, unless terminated by notice, is capable of going on indefinitely, and that consequently, as the period of time which was set for the operation of the option here in question was entirely indefinite it is void.\nIn London and South Western Railway Company v. Gomm, ([4]) Jessel M. R. approved of certain passages; from Lewis on Perpetuities, one of which is as follows:\nIn other words, a perpetuity is a future limitation whether executory or by way of remainder and of either real or personal property, which is not to vest until after the expiration of, or will not necessarily vest within, the period fixed and prescribed by law for the creation of future estates and interests; and which is not destructible by the persons for the time being entitled to the property subject to the future limitation, except with the concurrence of the individual interested under that limitation.\nApplying the above to the case at bar, it is clear in my opinion, that the option to purchase does not offend against the rule.\nThe person for the time being entitled to the property subject to the future limitation,\nnamely the respondent as owner, may destroy the option by terminating the lease by due notice in accordance with the relevant law without\nthe concurrence of the individual interested under that limitation,\nnamely the appellant or those claiming under him.\nThe respondent relies upon the decision of Russell J., as he then was, in Rider v. Ford ([5]). That case was decided without any reference to the Gomm case ([6]) or the principle set forth therein and as will be noted at p. 546 of the judgment, upon the admission of the defendant's counsel that the rule against perpetuities rendered the option to purchase void unless it could be read as giving only an option to the defendant personally or to an assignee of the defendant but exercisable only during the defendant's life.\nMuch as one hesitates not to follow any decision of Russell J., I do not think the decision is in accordance with principle. It was not followed in McMahon v. Swan ([7]). I think the reason why no question with regard to perpetuity can arise on limitations subject to an estate tail, provided they are such as must take effect during the existence of that estate, or immediately on its determination, equally applies in the circumstances here present. I refer to the judgment of Strong J. in Ferguson v. Ferguson ([8]).\nI think, therefore, that the appeal must be allowed with costs here and below.\nRand J.:\u2014This appeal has to do with a purported termination of a lease and the validity of an option to purchase contained in it.\nThe lease was subject to the Wartime Prices & Trade Board Order No. 108, the pertinent provisions of which are s. 16, ss. (2), (4), (5) and s. 24, ss. (2). These are as follows:\n16 (2) Subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of section 17 and to the provisions of section 24 of this Order, every notice to vacate given by or on behalf of a landlord shall be in writing and, unless the lease provides for a longer notice, the length of the notice.\n* * *\n(4) Subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of section 17 of this Order, no notice to vacate any commercial accommodation shall be given except by reason of one or more of the following circumstances: (as amended by Order No. 211)\n(a) that the tenant is in default in payment of rent or is breaking the conditions of his lease;\n(5) Subject to the provisions of subsection (12) of this section, any form of notice to vacate shall be sufficient if it is in writing, requires vacation on the proper day and states the reason for the notice in Accordance with this Order, and contains or is accompanied by the required undertaking. (As amended by Order No. 211).\n* * * 24. (2) In the case of default in payment of rent or breach of a covenant other than a covenant to vacate, nothing in this Order contained shall be deemed to preclude a landlord or some authorized person on his behalf from giving any notice to vacate or demand for possession in accordance with the law of the province in which the commercial or housing accomodation is situated or from taking any proceedings available to a landlord under the law of any province to recover possession of any commercial or housing accommodation situated in such province. (As amended by Order No. 173).\nEven if the word \"conditions\" in ss. (4) (a) is interpreted as meaning \"provisions\", a doubtful construction, so that the paragraph includes a violation of any of the terms of the lease, the respondent has not brought himself within the order for the reason that the notice to vacate which was one in the usual form did not as required by ss. (5) state the reason for giving it.\nBut it is argued that under s. 24 (2) a breach of covenant ipso facto takes the entire lease outside of the application of the order. The introductory language to 24 (1) is \"Notwithstanding anything contained in this Order\" and the subsection deals with the case of a lease which contains a provision for termination in the event of a sale. I doubt that those introductory words can be held to apply to ss. (2) but even if they do, what ss. (2) contemplates is a right given by the law of the province, including in that expression the valid terms of the lease, to repossession arising on a breach of a covenant and the subsection permits such proceedings to be taken on the basis of the breach as the law may allow.\nIf the mere non-payment of rent or breach of a covenant is to take the lease outside of the order, there would not appear to be any purpose in providing ss. (4) (a) unless it is said that in all cases a notice must be given; and then the same objection would arise here, that a proper notice had not been given.\nThe object of the order is to prevent trafficking in the possession of lands except for good cause. The general prohibition against terminating a lease by notice is qualified by the specific circumstances which by the order are considered sufficient justification for waiving the prohibition; but it leaves to the provincial law the determination of the circumstances under which a right of entry shall arise from the non-payment of rent or the breach of a covenant, except to vacate. In each case, what is contemplated is a right to possession. If this were not so, a breach of covenant, no matter how trivial and notwithstanding that it gave rise to no right to enter, would remove the lease from the order and enable the lessor to give the ordinary notice to quit, which would either conflict with ss. (4) (a) or give a much greater privilege for such a breach than for that of a condition in the true sense.\nThe respondent then was bound in giving such notice as he gave to bring himself within 16 (4) (a) which he did not or proceed to a recovery of possession under a right arising from the default alleged which the provincial law did not give him. He was, in the action taken, outside what both the order and the provincial law deemed necessary, and the notice was therefore a nullity.\nThen there is the question of the term of the lease on which the validity of the option to purchase may depend. The language of limitation is this:\nThe Lesson doth hereby demise and lease unto the Lessee * * * To have and to hold the said lands and premises hereby demised for the. term of ten years to be computed from the day of the date of these presents. Yielding and paying therefore yearly and every year in advance during the term hereby demised or any continuance thereof the sum of Twelve Dollars ($12.00), the first yearly payment to be due and payable on the First day of August, A.D. 1926. Provided always at the expiration of the ten-year term hereby demised, this demise and everything contained herein shall at the option of the said Lesson continue as a demise of the said premises to the said Lessee from year to year thereafter at the same yearly rent herein reserved to, subject to the same terms and conditions contained herein. Provided, further, that after the expiration of the said ten-year term hereby demised, the said Lessee shall have the privilege of terminating this lease upon giving the Lesson twelve months' notice in writing and upon conforming with the other conditions and stipulations contained herein.\nIt is then covenanted that\nif at any time the aforesaid rent is in arrears for a space of two years, the Lessor may re-enter, and that the Lessee shall at all times during the continuance of the said term or the continuation thereof have the right, privilege and option of purchasing the said demised premises from the said Lesson on payment from him, the Lessee, to the Lessor of the sum or price of $300.\nI agree with the contention of the respondent that the term is for ten years absolutely and thereafter in a \"continuation\" of that term as a year to year tenancy, terminable by the Lessee on a twelve months' notice in writing. Whether that length of notice is obligatory on the lesson, I do not find it necessary to determine. On this branch of the argument, the objection to the option was that as it might be exercised beyond the period of the rule against perpetuities it was void, but to this I cannot assent. The rule is aimed against the tying up of real property pending the vesting of an estate upon a happening which is contingent. But that consideration in policy is absent when the owner of the estate over which the contingent power hovers is able himself at any time to terminate that power. In the classical presentation of the rule by the late Professor Gray the point is suggested that although the lesson in such a case is at liberty, by a proper notice, to destroy the option, it nevertheless involves an onerous condition upon him, namely, that he give up what may be a profitable lease. But if he desires to continue the lease and therefore has no wish either to occupy the land himself or to dispose of it, his only object would be to get rid of an obligation into which he had freely entered, an object which I cannot think can make action to achieve it onerous. With any other object in view, the termination of the lease is a necessary part of its accomplishment.\nThe point was dealt with in McMahon v. Swan ([9]), where the terms of the lease presented an identical question, and it was there held that it was a sufficient answer to the contention of perpetuity that the option could be terminated by either party by the requisite notice.\nAs the lease then was in force when the tender of the money was made, the lessee has brought himself within the terms of the option. I would, therefore, allow the appeal, and direct a decree of specific performance in accordance with the practice of the court below. The appellant should have his costs throughout.\nESTEY J.:\u2014The appellant contends that the agreement dated the 1st day of August, 1926, and made between the parties hereto is a lease with a perpetual right of renewal after the expiration of the first ten years, rather than a lease from year to year as contended by the respondent, and as held by the Appellate Court of Prince Edward Island in affirming a judgment of the learned Chief Justice of that province.\nAfter providing for a term of ten years from the date thereof, the lease continues:\n* * * provided always at the expiration of (the) ten year term hereby demised this demise and everything contained herein shall at the option of the said lessee continue as a demise of the said premises to the said lessee from year to year thereafter at the same yearly rent herein reserved and subject to the same terms and conditions contained herein: provided further that after the expiration of the said ten year term hereby demised the said lessee shall have the privilege of terminating this lease upon giving to the lesson twelve months' notice in writing and upon conforming with the other conditions and stipulations contained herein * * *\nAt the conclusion of the ten year term the tenancy continued by tacit agreement, and in fact the appellant is still in possession.\nOn January 12, 1943, the respondent, through his attorney, served the following notice:\nI hereby as agent and attorney for and on behalf of Austin A. Scales,your landlord, give you notice to quit and deliver up to him on the 1st day of August, 1943, possession of the premises situate at Freetown, P.E.I., which you hold off him as tenant under a lease in writing bearing date the 1st day of August, 1926.\nOn August 30, 1943, the appellant tendered and respond enter refused $12 as rent for the year ending August 1, 1944.\nThe respondent, as landlord, on August 7, 1944, brought this action for recovery of possession of the leased premises. Questions of law were raised upon the pleadings and these were submitted for decision prior to trial. The judgment of the learned Chief Justice in favour of the respondent upon these points was affirmed in the Appellate Division and from this judgment this appeal is taken.\nThe appellant's submission that this lease contains a right of perpetual renewal can only be, supported if such an intention is clearly expressed: Swinburne v. Milburn ([10]); 20 Halsbury, 2nd ed., p. 154, para. 167. The language used must import both renewal and perpetuity, e.g. \"renewable forever\", Clinch v. Pernette ([11]); \"thereafter forever\", Consumers Cordage Co. Ltd. v. St. Gabriel Land & Hydraulic Co. Ltd. ([12]); \"including the covenant for renewal\", Re Jackson and Imperial Bank of Canada ([13]). The lease in question contains no such words. On the contrary, the words\nshall at the option of the said lessee continue as a demise of the said premises to the said lessee from year to year thereafter\ncontained in the first proviso quoted above indicate a clear intention to create a tenancy from year to year: 20 Halsbury, 2nd ed., p. 123, para. 136. A lease from year to year differs from that with a perpetual right of renewal in that the former continues until terminated by notice, while the latter terminates at the end of the term unless renewed. This distinction is emphasized in Gray v. Spyer, ([14]), where the lease was construed to contain the right of perpetual renewal notwithstanding the use of the words \"from year to year\". There, however, the tenant was required to give one month's notice of his intention to continue his tenancy in each year. It was this obligation to give the notice that was emphasized by the learned judges in the Appellate Court. Warrington L.J. at p. 33:\nIf the tenant failed to give the notice exercising his option, the tenancy would, in my opinion, determine at the expiration of the then current year * * *\nScrutton L.J. at p. 39:\nIf I am simply to construe the words of the agreement, it seems to me to contemplate a year's tenancy, continuing from year to year, at the tenant's will expressed one month before the end of each year. But the continuation depends, not on a grant, but on an agreement to grant if the tenant so requires. In other words, the agreement is to continue at tenant's option the tenancy from year to year.\nThe same observations distinguish the case of North-church Estates Ltd. v. Daniels ([15]), where the lease was for a period of one year certain with an option in the tenant to\nrenew the tenancy from year to year on identical terms and conditions as hereinafter stated, notice of such intention to renew the tenancy to be given in writing on or before December 25 in each year.\nEvershed J. held this to create the right of a perpetual renewal. At p. 526 he stated:\nThe language used includes the phrase \"the option to renew the tenancy from year to year\", and it says further that notice of that intention as to be given on or before Dec. 25 \"in each year\". Those words seem to me to be very strong indications indeed that what was in the minds of the parties was that, so long as the tenant exercised his option within the time stated, he could go on from year to year ad infinitum renewing his tenancy.\nThe lease in this litigation specifically provides at the option of the lessee for its continuation as a demise from year to year, for termination thereof on the part of the lessee, and in the event of non-payment of rent, on the part of the lesson (what notice for other reasons might be given by the lesson we are not here called upon to determine). These provisions show a clear intention that the lease shall continue until its termination rather than that it should be renewed by the lessee in each year.\nThe appellant stressed the presence of the words \"continue\", \"continuance\" or \"continuation\" as evidencing perpetuity. The word \"continue\" as used in the above quoted proviso does not import perpetuity but merely that upon the termination of a ten year period the lease shall continue as one from year to year. The words \"continuance\" and \"continuation\" as used are in accord with that view and contemplate that the option given to the lessee may be exercised but once. The phrase \"any continuation\", which appears once, while it ordinarily would import the idea of more than one exercise of the option, as here used and construed in relation to the other provisions, cannot be so regarded and even if so, it cannot outweigh the other specific provisions of the lease.\nThe notice to quit dated January 12, 1943, as above quoted, did not \"state the circumstance or circumstances in respect of which it is given\" as required by Order 108, s. 16 (4) of The Wartime Prices and Trade Board, and is, therefore, invalid as a notice to vacate under that order. Indeed, the respondent does not contend otherwise. His submission is, assuming a breach of covenant to assign, that by virtue thereof under the provisions of section 24 (2) of Order 108 the lease is no longer subject to that order, but is subject to provincial law only. Section 24 (2) reads as follows:\n24. (2) In the case of default in payment of rent or breach of a covenant other than a covenant to vacate, nothing in this Order contained shall be deemed to preclude a landlord or some authorized person on his behalf from giving any notice to vacate or demand for possession in accordance with the law of the province in which the commercial or housing accommodation is situated or from taking any proceedings available to a landlord under the law of any province to recover possession of any commercial or housing accommodation situated in such province.\nThe respondent, to use his own language,\nclaims his right of possession not because a right of re-entry accrued to him by virtue of the breach of covenant, but because the lease was terminated by virtue of the notice to quit given in conformity with provincial law.\nThis submission recognizes that a breach of the covenant not to assign, transfer or sublet does not provide under provincial law a basis for the giving of a notice \"to vacate or demand for possession\" unless the lease contains an express provision therefor or such a provision is found in the statute law of the province. Crawley v. Price ([16]); Foa, The Law of Landlord and Tenant, 6th ed., 367; Wood fall's Landlord and Tenant, 22nd ed., 189. There is no such provision in the lease nor is there any such provision in the statutory law of Prince Edward Island. Apart from one or other of these provisions a breach of covenant may give the landlord a right to damages or an injunction, but not a notice \"to vacate or demand for possession\" nor for proceedings to recover possession.\nThe effect, therefore, of respondent's contention would mean that though a breach of this covenant for which provincial law provides no right for the giving of a\nnotice to vacate or demand for possession * * * or * * * taking proceedings * * * to recover possession,\nnevertheless, under the provisions of section 24 (2) the breach of that covenant would make the lease subject to provincial law and therefore the right to terminate the lease by the notice to vacate effective under provincial law as if Order 108 did not exist. That such a determination of the lease should not obtain under the circumstances of war was one of the purposes and objects of Order 108. That this purpose should now be defeated by such a breach must be found in clear and explicit language. Such is not to be found in section 24 (2). This subsection is an exception to the general terms of the order and neither its provisions nor its collocation indicate any such intention. On the other hand, such an intention could have been expressed easily and clearly. In the absence of express language that the breach of such a covenant should remove entirely the effect of Order 108 and restore provincial law for all purposes, it ought not to be implied. The respondent referred to Toronto General Trusts Corporation v. Sidney I. Robinson Fur Co. ([17]), a decison under Order 315 where the language is quite different, and Ogilvie v. Westergaard ([18]), a decision under Order 294 which repealed Order 108, where the language is somewhat different.\nIt therefore follows that the lease is valid and subsisting, and therefore by its express terms the option to purchase was outstanding. The option reads as follows:\nAnd that the lessee shall at all times during the continuance of the said term or the continuation thereof have the right, privilege and option of purchasing the said demised premises from the lesson on payment from him to the lesson of the sum or price of three hundred dollars.\nThe lease also contains:\nAnd it is hereby declared and agreed that these presents and every thing contained herein shall respectively enure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, respectively.\nIt is, however, contended by the respondent that this option is invalid under the Perpetuities Act, 4 Geo. VI, statutes of Prince Edward Island, c. 46. Section 2 reads as follows:\n2. Notwithstanding any existing law or statute in force in this Province, the period during which the existence of a future estate or interest in any hereditament, right, profit, easement or other property, real or personal, may be suspended, and during which the rents, revenues, fruits, profits or income of any such real or personal property may be allowed to accumulate, either in whole or in part, may extend to, but must not exceed the life of a person or of the survivor of several persons born or en ventre sa m\u00e8re at the time of the creation of such future estate or interest and ascertained for that purpose by the instrument creating the same, and sixty years to be computed from the dropping of such life or the minority of some person en ventre sa mere at the dropping of such life and ascertained for that purpose by such instrument.\nThis statutory provision embodies the principle that the \"absolute power of alienation\" should not be suspended beyond the period therein specified. It is designed to prevent the creation of executory interests, as Lord Macnaghten explains:\n* * * to arise at some future and indefinite period on a contingency which might or might not happen, and to impose on the land a fetter or burthen of indefinite duration which the owners for the time being * * * could not get rid of without the consent and concurrence of the persona entitled to such executory interest. Edwards v. Edwards, ([19]).\nThen in Lewis on Perpetuity, p. 164, the definition of a perpetuity concludes with the words\nwhich is not destructible by the persons for the time being entitled to the property subject to the future limitation, except with the concurrence of the individual interested under that limitation.\nIn dealing with this definition, Farwell J. in In re Ashforth ([20]), (1905 1 ch. 535, at p. 544, explains the word \"destructible\" as used in the above definition as follows:\nThe rule, however, was only to be applied to cases where it was really necessary in order to defeat remoteness, and, accordingly, Lord St. Leonards in Cole v. Sewell ([21]), points out that it has no application to remainders limited to arise after an estate tail, because they are destructible by barring such estate tail, and are no more open to objection than the estate tail itself; and this is the meaning of the reference to destructibility in the passage that I read above from Lewis on Perpetuity.\nIn Gray on The Rule Against Perpetuities, 4th ed., s. 203;\nThus a future interest if destructible at the mere pleasure of the present owner of the property is not regarded as an interest at all and the rule does not concern itself with it.\nand s. 568, note 2:\nWhen the owner of the present estate can destroy the future interest at his pleasure such future interest 'is not too remote.\nIn McMahon v. Swan ([22]), a lease for a period of five years which should continue thereafter until terminated by notice by either party contained an option to purchase. The option to purchase was held not to offend the rule against perpetuities because the tenant's interest could be terminated by the owner and therefore the option did \"not restrain the free disposal of property beyond the period allowed by law.\"\nThe respondent relied upon Rider v. Ford ([23]), where, after the expiration of the specified term and while the tenancy continued as one from year to year, the lessee sought to exercise his option to purchase. The main point discussed was whether the option continued so long as the relationship of landlord and tenant continued, or whether it expired at the end of the specified term. The rule against perpetuities was dealt with as follows at p. 546:\nDefendant's counsel admits that the rule against perpetuities must render invalid the option to purchase the freehold unless the agreement is read as giving only an option to the defendant personally, or to an assignee of the defendant, but only exercisable during the defendant's life.\nThe learned judge refused to so construe the agreement and therefore held the option to be inoperative and invalid because it offended the rule against perpetuities. It there fore appears that the specific point that we are considering was not raised as a matter for decision.\nIn Tormey v. The King ([24]), the lease was for a term of 30 years and continued thereafter as a tenancy from year to year. During the latter period the tenant sought to exercise the option to purchase and it was held, following Rider v. Ford ([25]), that the option was invalid as infringing upon the rule against perpetuities. Here again there does not appear to have been consideration given to the specific point we are discussing.\nThe respondent, Scales, as. Lesson and owner of the property, might in any year, after the expiration of the first ten years, under the provisions of this lease (apart from the emergency legislation imposed by the circum stances of war and which overrule the Perpetuities Act), by exercising his right to terminate the lease, effect a disposition of the property. It was within his power to make himself the sole owner and to dispose of all his rights without the concurrence of anyone. Therefore, there was never a time when, within the meaning of the statute, there existed a\nperiod during which the existence of a future estate or interest in any * * * property, real or personal, may be suspended\nbecause the lesson as owner of the property might determine that suspension at his pleasure, and therefore he possessed the unfettered right to deal with the property at any time.\nThe fact that after the period of ten years this was a lease from year to year with the consequent right in the lesson to terminate it, distinguishes this case from many of those cited by counsel for the respondent, including Woodall v. Clifton, where the lease was for a specified period of 99 years and the option exercisable at any time during that term. So in London & South Western Rly. Co. v. Gomm[26], the time in which the right to request a reconveyance was unlimited; likewise in Worthing Corporation v. Heather, and United Fuel Supply Co. v. Volcanic Oil & Gas Co.\nAn option contained in a lease, where either by its express terms or by operation of law the right remains in the lesson owner of the property to terminate both the lease and option, does not involve an infraction of the fore going statutory provision of the Perpetuities Act and therefore is valid.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal allowed with costs.\nSolicitor for the appellant: W.

Per the Chief Justice and Taschereau and Estey JJ.:\u2014The option here negotiated is not a contract \u201cvoid\u201d as being illegal in the strict sense. It does not therefore involve an act on the part of an attorney which cannot be ratified by the principal. The trustee had a full and complete knowledge of not only the existence but the terms and details of the option, was in possession of such before the acceptance of the option and personally instructed his solicitor from there on. It was not a breach of trust on his part to grant a general power of attorney, and if the attorney has effected an agreement, as in this case, which is not void and which the trustee in his judgment deems in the interest of the trust estate, there would appear to be nothing in reason or principle why it should not be ratified and the estate enjoy the benefit thereof.\nThe ratification of the giving of the option by the trustee related back to the date thereof and became his act as if he had given the same in person, and was therefore a sufficient memorandum signed by the party to be charged to satisfy the requirements of the Statute of Frauds.\nPer Kerwin and Kellock JJ.:\u2014Before the acceptance of the offer to sell, the executor took the position toward W. (the purchaser) that there was an offer which the latter could accept. The letters signed by the executor\u2019s solicitor, taken with the documents to which they refer, satisfy the Statute of Frauds.\n\u201cAbsolute\u201d is used in the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, R.S.O. 1937 c. 152 in contradistinction to \u201cby way of charge only.\u201d Hughes v. Pump House Hotel Company (1902) 2 K.B. 190.\nAPPEAL by the Plaintiff from the judgment of the Court of Appeal for Ontario[1] allowing the defendants\u2019 appeal from the judgment of Mackay J.[2] decreeing specific performance of an alleged agreement for the sale of land.\nThe material facts of the case and the questions at issue are stated in the judgments now reported.\nJ.R. Cartwright, K.C. and R.M. Willes Chitty, K.C. for the appellant.\nA.G. Slaght, K.C. for the respondents.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Taschereau and Estey JJ. was delivered by\nESTEY J.:\u2014This is an action for specific performance on behalf of the purchaser of real property situated at Kirkland Lake, Ontario. Georgianna Roberge, late of said Kirkland Lake, owned the property in question. By her will she named her son Antoine Roberge, her executor and trustee and after directing the payment of her debts she devised and bequeathed to him her property, both real and personal, in trust for the use of her husband L.D. Roberge, during his life and thereafter to sell, convert and distribute according to the terms of the will.\nThe will was proved on the 23rd day of August 1943. Antoine Roberge, then of Kirkland Lake, but who at all times material hereto resided at or near Flint in the State of Michigan, was appointed executor. On September 17th 1943, in the State of Michigan Antoine Roberge executed a general power of attorney to his father, L.D. Roberge, who remained at Kirkland Lake, empowering the latter to act on his behalf in his capacity as executor of his mother\u2019s estate, and empowering him to purchase, rent, sell, etc., the real estate, or any interest therein, and to execute all necessary instruments in connection therewith. Acting under this power of attorney, L.D. Roberge on May 10th 1944, entered into an agreement entitled \u201cOption to Purchase\u201d with A.I. Wright whereby he gave to Wright an irrevocable offer to purchase the property on or before the 10th day of June 1944.\nOn May 30th 1944, Antoine Roberge was at Kirkland Lake and he and his father called upon Wright. The sale was then discussed and they were informed by Wright that he was selling the property to McLellan Properties Limited on whose behalf he had arranged a mortgage and an extension of the lease to the Metropolitan Stores. He assured Antoine Roberge that they had raised the necessary money. Antoine Roberge suggested that St. Aubin was solicitor for the estate and his own personal solicitor and that they might meet at his office and give instructions for the preparation of documents. That afternoon at three o\u2019clock they met at St. Aubin\u2019s office, and after some conversation, it was suggested that there was no use of all remaining and Antoine Roberge \u201cinstructed Mr. St. Aubin to go ahead, contact Mr. Lillico\u201d, solicitor for Wright and McLellan Properties Limited, \u201cand get the matter closed out\u201d.\nOn June 7th 1944, Lillico by letter made certain requisitions with regard to the title. These were subject of personal discussions and correspondence extending from June 7th to June 15th, when Lillico advised that his client was prepared to waive the requisition relative to the beneficiaries executing the transfer of the property and that Wright was assigning his agreement of purchase to the McLellan Properties Limited. Then followed some correspondence between Lillico and St. Aubin relative to the transfer, the requirements of the Local Master of Titles, and details leading to the conclusion of the transaction.\nOn July 3rd 1944, Lillico wrote a letter to St. Aubin reading as follows:\nDear Sir: Re: Roberge.\nYou have advised us on a number of occasions by telephone that your clients do not intend to complete the contract for the sale of the Roberge Premises, being lot 19, plan M. 15 Temiskaming, and to confirm such telephone conversation by letter, but to date no such letter has been received by us.\nThis letter is to advise you that our clients are prepared to close out the contract and complete the purchase of the property, and if necessary to take action in court to enforce specific performance of the contract.\nMay we hear from you by return mail?\nYours truly,\nL.A. Lillico.\nand St. Aubin on the same day wrote the following letter to Lillico:\nDear Sirs: Re: Georgianna Roberge Estate et al.\nReferring to the alleged offer to sell and acceptance thereof and the alleged assignment to McLellan Properties Limited, I am instructed by the executor of the will to notify you that he will not proceed further with this matter for the following reasons (among other reasons):\n1. L.D. Roberge had no power to execute the said offer of sale on behalf of this estate, and the said offer of sale is a nullity;\nor in the alternative,\n2. The executor has, at this time, no power to sell the lands of this estate;\nor in the alternative,\n3. The vendor is unable and\/or willing to remove the objections made you on behalf of the purchaser and\/or his assignee. The vendor therefore rescinds the agreement herein.\nYours truly,\nAlibert St. Aubin.\nThe correspondence was concluded by Lillico\u2019s letter dated July 4th to St. Aubin acknowledging the letter of the 3rd and including the following:\n* * * that we are prepared to carry out the terms of the Agreement and to purchase your client\u2019s property, and there are no objections or requisitions on title which you have not satisfactorily answered or which we have not waived on behalf of our clients. When at the expiration of the ten days specified by Lillico, in his second letter of July 3rd, St. Aubin did not intimate his intention to proceed with the completion of the transaction, this action was commenced by writ dated the 17th day of August, 1944.\nThe learned trial judge held that while as executor and trustee Antoine Roberge could not validly delegate to L.D. Roberge authority to option or sell, nevertheless, in this case Antoine Roberge by his conduct had adopted and ratified the agreement. He accordingly decreed specific performance.\nThe appellate court held that Antoine Roberge as executor and trustee could not delegate his powers to option or sell to L.D. Roberge, that the acts of L.D. Roberge under such authority were void, and therefore the option of May 10th 1944, was a nullity and neither the option nor the contract arising out of its acceptance could be adopted or ratified by Antoine Roberge as executor and trustee. Further, that there was no memorandum sufficient to satisfy the Statute of Frauds. The appellate court therefore reversed the judgment of the learned trial judge and dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s action.\nThe general rule forbidding a trustee, subject to certain exceptions, to delegate his duties as trustee is not questioned by the appellant. Its contention is rather that the option executed by L.D. Roberge, acting under the terms of the power of attorney from the trustee Antoine Roberge, was ratified and adopted by the latter. The trustee was at Kirkland Lake and became aware of and discussed the contents of the option with A.I. Wright before it was accepted on May 30th. The acceptance was by letter of the same date addressed to Antoine Roberge, and it was he, himself, who instructed the solicitor on behalf of the estate. In other words, in everything that happened after the giving of the option, the trustee took an active and dominating part. His conduct in discussing the terms of the agreement with A.I. Wright and going forward with the completion of the agreement would constitute a ratification or an adoption of what his attorney had initiated on his behalf. The appellate court, however, held that because what the attorney did was contrary to law, it was therefore a nullity and could not be ratified. In support of this view the appellant quotes Lewin on Trusts, 14th ed., p. 194:\nIf the trust be of a discretionary character, not only is the trustee answerable for all the mischievous consequences of the delegation, but the exercise of the discretion by the substitute will be actually void.\nThe cases cited by the learned author support the view that such an agreement negotiated only by an attorney for a trustee cannot be enforced, but they do not justify a conclusion that the word \u201cvoid\u201d should in relation thereto be used in the sense that the attorney\u2019s act is so far a nullity that it cannot be ratified. Nor have we been referred to any authority which holds such an act to be a nullity in that sense.\nIn one of the cases cited by the learned author, Bradford v. Belfield[3] after refusing a decree for specific performance to compel a purchaser to take a title through a contract negotiated on behalf of the vendor by an assign from the heir of the trustee, the vice-chancellor stated at p. 271:\nBut it is admitted that the defect will be cured, if the Court should be of opinion that, under the Will of N.P. Berry, the equitable fee passed to William Berry.\nand at p. 272:\n* * * if it were left to me to decide, I should say that the Devise to William Berry has had the effect of curing the defect in the title. I do not, however, feel myself authorized to compel the purchaser to take the estate; but, as the question is, in fact, a legal one, it is my duty to send a case for the opinion of a court of law, as to the effect of the Devise to William Berry.\nThe general rule that one who accepts the position of trustee undertakes to perform personally those duties requiring the exercise of his discretion is subject to certain exceptions. A trustee by the terms of his appointment may be permitted to delegate some or all of those duties. Again, if in the circumstances it would be regarded as prudent for a person in the ordinary course of business to delegate the performance of those duties, a trustee is permitted to do so: Speight v. Gaunt[4]. Further, a trustee may appoint an attorney to act on his behalf in another country: Stuart v. Norton[5]; Stickney v. Tylee[6] and In re Huntly[7]. These authorities illustrate the general rule and the exceptions thereto founded upon the necessities of prudent business management. These and other authorities indicate that a delegation of authority, such as we are here concerned with, involves nothing in the nature of that illegality which renders an act void or a nullity in law. Salmond on Jurisprudence, 8th ed., 369; 7 Halsbury, 2nd ed., 147; Cheshire & Fifoot, Law of Contracts, 219. The option here negotiated is not a contract \u201cvoid as being illegal in the strict sense\u201d: Pollock on Contracts, 12th ed., p. 254. It does not therefore involve an act on the part of an attorney which cannot be ratified by the principal within the meaning of the foregoing authorities.\nIt is a fair conclusion in this case, and indeed the contrary is not suggested, that the trustee, Antoine Roberge, had full and complete knowledge of not only the existence but the terms and details of the option. He was in possession of such before the acceptance of the option and personally instructed his solicitor from there on. That the option agreement is improvident from the point of view of the estate, or is in any way different from what the trustee would have insisted upon or even desired had he himself negotiated the option, is not suggested.\nThat certain duties may be carried out by a trustee through an attorney is well established, and therefore it was not a breach of trust on his part to grant a general power of attorney. If, however, the attorney, pursuant to that power, does something which the trustee should not delegate, it is unenforcible and in that sense invalid and it may be either void or voidable, depending upon its nature and character. If, therefore, the attorney has effected an agreement, as in this case, which is not void and which the trustee in his judgment deems in the interest of the trust estate, there would appear to be nothing in reason or principle why it should not be ratified and the estate enjoy the benefit thereof.\nEvery act, whether lawful or unlawful, which is capable of being done by means of an agent, except an act which is in its inception void, is capable of ratification by the person in whose name or on whose behalf it is done. Bowstead on Agency, 10th Ed., p. 33.\nSee also Wilshere on Law of Agency, p. 8; Lord Cranworth in Spackman v. Evans[8]. Sir W.J. Ritchie, C.J., in the course of his judgment in Merchants Bank of Canada v. Lucas[9] states at p. 280:\nThe Court of Appeal has since decided, in the case of Barton v. London & North Western Ry. Co.[10], that fraud or breach of trust can be ratified, but forgery cannot, and if so it is clear that this appeal must be dismissed.\nThe essential words in this quotation are from the language of Lord Justice Lindley in the Barton case and it may be suggested that the language of the learned judges in both of these cases is obiter. Statements, however, by such learned and eminent judges are entitled to the greatest weight, and may I add with respect that the statement appears to be in accord with both principle and authority.\nThe word \u201cvoid\u201d in the foregoing quotation from Bowstead on Agency is there used in the sense that what is purported to be done is in law a nullity. The illustrations selected by the learned author make this clear. In one he emphasizes the distinction with respect to what unauthorized acts on the part of a board of directors may, and may not, be ratified by the shareholders. If, though unauthorized, the act of the directors would be one which the company had power to do and which it might have done qua company, that may be ratified. If, on the other hand, the unauthorized act of the directors be ultra vires of the company, it cannot be ratified by the shareholders because if such an act had been done by the company qua company, it would have been a nullity.\nThe ratification of the giving of the option by Antoine Roberge as trustee relates back to the date thereof and becomes his act as if he had given the same in person. The trustee, Antoine Roberge, had he given the option in person might have directed L.D. Roberge as his attorney to sign the same. As Lindley, L.J. in In re Hetling and Merton\u2019s Contract[11], stated: \u201cI have no doubt myself that a trustee can execute a deed by an attorney * * *\u201d. Antoine Roberge, as trustee, under the circumstances of this case ratified the giving of the option and the execution thereof by L.D. Roberge. It is therefore a sufficient memorandum signed by the party to be charged to satisfy the requirements of the Statute of Frauds. Best C.J. stated in MacLean v. Dunn[12].\nIt has been argued, that the subsequent adoption of the contract by Dunn will not take this case out of the operation of the statute of frauds; and it has been insisted, that the agent should have his authority at the time the contract is entered into. If such had been the intention of the legislature, it would have been expressed more clearly; but the statute only requires some note or memorandum in writing, to be signed by the party to be charged, or his agent thereunto lawfully authorized; leaving us to the rules of common law, as to the mode in which the agent is to receive his authority. Now, in all other cases, a subsequent sanction is considered the same thing in effect as assent at the time. Omnis ratihabitio retrotrahitur et mandato \u0153quiparatur; and in my opinion, the subsequent sanction of a contract signed by an agent, takes it out of the operation of the statute more satisfactorily than an authority given beforehand. Where the authority is given beforehand, the party must trust to his agent; if it be given subsequently to the contract, the party knows that all has been done according to his wishes.\nIt was contended that the vendors had not satisfied all requisitions of title made by the purchaser\u2019s solicitor. This is not established, as evidenced by the purchaser\u2019s solicitor\u2019s letter above quoted.\nThe view of the learned trial judge that the plea of inequality was not established is supported by the evidence. In fact, throughout the conversations and correspondence the question of inequality or that the sale from the point of view of the estate was improvident was apparently not suggested nor was it supported by any evidence.\nThe appeal should be allowed with costs.\nThe judgment of Kerwin and Kellock JJ. was delivered by\nKELLOCK J.:\u2014The facts out of which this litigation arises are undisputed and are as follows: On May 9, 1944, the respondent, L.D. Roberge who was life tenant of the lands and premises here in question under the will of the late Georgianna Roberge, deceased, and who held a power of attorney with respect thereto from Antoine Roberge, executor of the last will of the deceased, interviewed one, A.I. Wright, a real estate agent in Kirkland Lake, Ontario, with regard to the said premises. Roberge told Wright that he was in financial difficulties because of the fact that the rents from the premises, after payment of outgoings, did not leave him sufficient for his maintenance. Roberge wanted Wright to assist in obtaining a new mortgage, but he also informed Wright that his family desired him to sell the property. The two men discussed a possible sale and Roberge said that he would like to sell if he could get a reasonable price and that at one time when things were somewhat better in Kirkland Lake he had been offered $60,000. Roberge was informed by Wright that the latter\u2019s commission on sale would be 5%. At Wright\u2019s suggestion Roberge went away to decide whether he wanted to sell or to have Wright obtain a new mortgage. In the meantime Wright undertook to \u201cput out a few feelers\u201d. Wright then communicated with the appellant and learned that it would be interested if Roberge decided to sell.\nThe following day a further interview occurred between Wright and Roberge when the latter stated he desired to sell. On this occasion Wright suggested that Roberge drop his price from the figure of $60,000 mentioned the previous day, which was subject to the commission of 5%, to a net $55,000. Wright stated at this time that he would want an option for two weeks or a month. In the result Roberge agreed to an option in Wright\u2019s favour for two months at $55,000 and the agreement which took the form of an offer to sell, was drawn up and signed by Roberge as \u201cAttorney for the Estate of the late Georgianna Roberge\u201d. The offer could be accepted on or before June 10th. Wright questioned Roberge as to his authority to sell and was assured that he had such authority.\nWright then advised appellants of the option price and the commission he would expect over and above that and arranged with them that if he could obtain a suitable mortgage and have the tenant, who occupied the premises in question and also adjoining premises belonging to the appellants, renew its lease, appellants would buy the premises for $55,000 and pay Wright $4,000 to cover his commission on the sale and his fee for arranging the mortgage and the renewal of the lease, making a total sum of $59,000 cash. Roberge was advised on May 22nd that a sale had been made for cash to the estate and a discussion took place as to investment of the purchase moneys. It was on this occasion that Roberge advised Wright that his son, the respondent Antoine, who lived in Flint, Michigan, was the executor of the estate. Toward the end of May both the respondents called upon one of the officers of the appellant and told him that they understood the appellant was purchasing the property and that they were pleased but were sorry appellant had not dealt with them direct.\nOn May 30th the respondents visited Wright when the executor inquired whether Wright was sure the necessary money had been raised. Wright assured them that this was so, and that the Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation had approved of the loan. Wright then suggested that they go to the solicitor for the appellant and close the matter but it was arranged instead, that they should go to the office of one, St. Aubin, whom Antoine Roberge said was solicitor for the estate. This appointment was kept and the appellant\u2019s solicitor, Mr. Lillico, also attended.\nAt this interview, L.D. Roberge stated that apparently he had signed something he had no authority to sign but the matter proceeded without further discussion of this point and Antoine Roberge instructed St. Aubin to \u201cgo ahead and get the matter closed out\u201d. Following this and on the same day Wright accepted the offer to sell by letter to the respondent Antoine Roberge, a copy being sent also to St. Aubin on the instructions of Antoine. From then on the solicitors dealt with the matter and considerable correspondence passed between them relating to the carrying out of the sale, until July 3, 1944, when the respondents refused to proceed further. The appellants having acquired an assignment from Wright and having given notice of the assignment, commenced the present action for specific performance. This was granted by Mackay J. but this judgment[13] was reversed by the court of appeal[14] which held that the executor could not in law delegate his power to sell and that the lack on the part of L.D. Roberge of any power to make a binding contract of sale made the alleged contract of sale null and incapable of ratification by the executor. The court held further than even if there were an agreement of sale or if the respondents were estopped from setting up its non\u2011existence there was no sufficient note or memorandum in writing to satisfy the Statute of Frauds, the court being of opinion that the executor could not lawfully authorize another to sign a sufficient note or memorandum and that there was not a sufficient memorandum to be found elsewhere.\nIn the course of his judgment Laidlaw J.A., who delivered the judgment of the Court of Appeal[15] said:\nIs there a sufficient writing to be found elsewhere? There are two possible sources that might be suggested: First, the letter dated 3rd July, 1944, headed \u201cRe: Georgianna Roberge Estate et al.\u201d, from Mr. St. Aubin, purporting to be written on instructions by the executor of the will to solicitors for Mr. Wright and the respondent. That letter refers expressly to the \u201calleged offer to sell and acceptance thereof\u201d, and sets forth the reasons the appellant Antoine Roberge will not proceed with the matter. It concludes, \u201cThe Vendor therefore rescinds the agreement herein.\u201d The contents of this letter may be properly read with the \u201coffer to sell\u201d and \u201cacceptance thereof\u201d for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of the statute, and that may be done notwithstanding that the letter repudiates liability on the contract: Thirkell v. Cambi[16]. I am disposed to think that the letter referred to recognized that a contract had been made and that its terms were correctly stated in the offer to sell. But, again, it is not necessary to decide that question because, to make that letter effective in law, the respondent must show that Mr. St. Aubin was authorized to make an admission sufficient to bind the appellant Antoine Roberge to the contract set up by the respondent: Thirkell v. Cambi16, at p. 595. Even if the appellant Antoine Roberge could lawfully authorize his solicitor Mr. St. Aubin (or any other person) to sign a writing sufficient to satisfy The Statute of Frauds\u2014which, in my opinion, he could not do\u2014I think there is no evidence in this case that he had done so. There is no evidence of any actual authority given to Mr. St. Aubin, and the necessary authority cannot be implied from the form or contents of the letter. On the contrary, his instructions were to repudiate the contract. \u201c* * * the plaintiff cannot succeed unless he has affirmatively proved that the agent was authorized to sign a memorandum of the particular contract on which the plaintiff claims\u201d: Thirkell v. Cambi16, per Eve J., at p. 599. This the plaintiff has failed to do.\nI respectfully agree that St. Aubin\u2019s letter of July 3, 1944, is to be read with the offer to sell or option and its acceptance and in my opinion the letter recognizes that a contract had been made and that its terms were correctly stated in the option. It is not contended that these documents do not contain all the terms of the bargain come to.\nIt has already been pointed out that the executor had expressly instructed St. Aubin to carry out the contract and in pursuance of those instructions the latter had conducted the correspondence with Lillico, his first letter of June 8, 1944, containing answers to requisitions on title made by Lillico. The last paragraph of that letter reads as follows:\nShould the purchaser not waive the requisition last mentioned my client will unfortunately have no other alternative but to rescind the contract as provided therein and shall not otherwise be liable to the purchaser except to return the deposit made, if any.\nIt is quite clear that parol evidence is admissible to identify \u201cthe contract\u201d referred to, which is \u201cthe alleged offer to sell and acceptance thereof and the alleged assignment to McLellan Properties Limited\u201d mentioned in the letter of July 3rd; Cave v. Hastings[17]. The terms of the contract are therefore to be found in the option.\nIn Thirkell v. Camb[18], there was no evidence of any authority from the defendant to the solicitor to make any admission to bind his client \u201cto the contract set up\u201d by the plaintiff. In North v. Loomes[19], however, Younger J. used language which, in my opinion, is applicable here. He said at p. 383:\nMr. Taylor\u2019s instructions from the defendant were to complete, not to negotiate, a contract. It was an essential implication that he should, if and when necessary, affirm on behalf of his client the existence and validity, on his side, of the contract he was so instructed to carry out.\nWhile it is true that a trustee may not delegate his power to sell, I see no reason why a trustee may not authorize an agent to sign on his behalf documents such as the letters which are here in question in the course of carrying out a sale which he himself has already made. As stated in Williams On Executors, 12th ed. 598, while executors cannot contract to sell by attorney\nthis extends merely to the discretionary act. Having once exercised such discretion they may complete the transaction by attorney. For * * * trustees and personal representatives have never been bound personally to transact such business connected with the proper duties of their office, as according to the usual course of conducting business of a like nature, persons acting with reasonable care and prudence on their own account would ordinarily conduct through agents.\nSee also In re Hetling and Merton\u2019s Contract[20], per Lindley, L.J. It is to be remembered that the acceptance of the offer to sell was made directly to the executor who personally had previously instructed his solicitor to carry out the contract. Before the acceptance of any offer to sell, therefore, the executor took the position toward Wright that there was an offer to sell which the latter could accept. This acceptance was given and the letters signed by St. Aubin, taken with the documents to which they refer satisfy the Statute of Frauds.\nIt is contended in the alternative by the respondent executor that he was entitled to rescind the contract and did rescind it by the letter of July 3rd on the ground that there were outstanding requisitions on title which the purchaser was insisting on. It is said the executor was unwilling to comply with these requisitions and that he rescinded the contract on account thereof in pursuance of its terms.\nBy letter of July 3 1944, written before the receipt of St. Aubin\u2019s letter of that date, Mr. Lillico, on behalf of the appellant, advised Mr. St. Aubin that his client was ready to complete. In fact appellant, while it had made certain requisitions, had never refused to complete if these were not complied with. The time for closing had not arrived on July 3rd when the respondents refused to go on. Respondents must fail on this point also.\nMr. Slaght further contended for the respondents that the appellant could not bring this action for the reason that while the assignment recited it was for valuable consideration, it was in fact voluntary. He argued that therefore the assignment was not an \u201cabsolute\u201d assignment within the meaning of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, R.S.O. 1937, c. 152. This contention is not well founded. \u201cAbsolute\u201d is used in the Statute in contradistinction to \u201cby way of charge only\u201d. Hughes v. Pump House Hotel Company[21].\nAs to the point with respect to the so called \u201cinequality\u201d of the parties I agree with the judgment of the learned trial judge. I would allow the appeal with costs here and below and restore the judgment of the trial judge.\nAppeal allowed with costs and judgment of the trial judge restored.\nSolicitors for the appellant: Chitty, McMurtry, Ganong, Wright & Keith.\nSolicitors for the respondent Antoine Roberge: Slaght, Ferguson, Boland & Slaght.\nSolictor for the respondent L.D.

Sicard Ltd., [1948] S.C.R. 1\nDate: 1947-12-22\nDaniel Wandscheer, Gerrit Wandscheer, Jacob Wandscheer, Ben Wandscheer, Walter E. Klauer, Charles L. Ostrander And Klauer Manufacturing Company (Plaintiffs) Appellants,\nand\nSicard Limited (Defendant) Respondent.\n1947: February 26, 27, 28, March 3; December 22.\nPresent: Rinfret C.J. and Taschereau, Rand, Kellock and Estey JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nPatent\u2014Invention\u2014Novelty\u2014Subject-matter\u2014Utility\u2014Combination to be subject-matter of valid patent must produce useful and operative contrivance\u2014Possess novelty\u2014Be susceptible of fulfilling its purpose, and must enable a person skilled in the art to carry it out.\nThe Plaintiffs brought action against the Defendant for infringement of Wandscheer Letters Patent No. 309,848 and Curtis Letters Patent No. 253,159, both of which related to snow removers.\nIn the Exchequer Court [1946] Ex. C.R. 112, Angers J., held that as to the Wandscheer patent, there had been anticipation, and that the claims alleged to have been infringed only required the use of ordinary mechanical skill and did not involve that amount of inventive ingenuity which should be rewarded by a patent; that as to the Curtis patent, its first object offered no novelty but was anticipated by prior patents, and its second object was inoperative and useless and the patent consequently invalid.\nHeld: That as to the Wandscheer patent, the judgment of the learned trial judge be affirmed and the appeal dismissed.\nHeld: Per the Chief Justice, Taschereau and Rand JJ. (Kellock and Estey JJ. dissenting) that as to the Curtis patent, the appeal be dismissed. Per the Chief Justice and Taschereau J.: the Curtis rotating ejector had no usefulness and was not workable. It could not serve the purpose mentioned in the patent. The device patented by the respondent is different and is operative.\nA combination may be the subject-matter of a valid patent, even if it is merely the juxtaposition of known elements, but this juxtaposition must produce a useful and operative contrivance which has the indispensable character of novelty. The alleged invention must be susceptible of fulfilling its purpose, and it must enable a person skilled in the art to carry it out.\nPer Rand J.: On the evidence a prima facie case against utility in rotary discharge by reason of insufficiency in specification has, I think, been made out, but I am unable to say that the onus thus arising has been met by the appellants. On what is before us, I must hold that at best what Curtis presented to the public was both the idea and the task of working it out.\nPer Kellock and Estey JJ. (dissenting) : The Curtis patent had not been anticipated by prior patents. The combination to be found in the Curtis patent was a new conception and the element of inventive ingenuity required by the authorities was present in the combination claimed by the patent. The invention was an advance on anything in existence at the time, and the specification, which should receive a benevolent construction, was sufficient. While the utility of the equipment was limited, it would appear from the evidence, that whatever it lacked was a matter of trial involving no invention, which could be worked out by any skilful mechanic, and that the respondent had infringed upon the patent.\nAPPEAL by the plaintiffs from the judgment of Angers J. of the Exchequer Court of Canada 1, holding that as to the Wandscheer patent there had been anticipation; and that as to the Curtis patent, its first object offered no novelty and was anticipated; and its second object was inoperative and useless.\nDuring the hearing, counsel for the respondent was told that the Wandscheer patent was not an invention, lacked subject-matter, and that it was not necessary to hear him on that point.\nThe material facts of the case are sufficiently stated in the judgment now reported.\nE. G. Gowling K.C. and J. C. Osborne for the appellants.\nH. G\u00e9rin-Lajoie K.C. for the respondent. The judgment of The Chief Justice and of Taschereau J. was delivered by\nTaschereau J.:\u2014Two patents are involved in the present case, the Wandscheer and the Curtis patents. Both relate to snow removers. The first is an alleged invention consisting in mounting a cutter bar on each side of the casing which houses the spiral conveyor of a snow plow, in such a way that it extends out in front, thus facilitating the cutting of snow banks which reach above the top of the casing. The second is a type of plow which involves the use of one or more spiral snow conveyors which bite into the snow, and which are disposed laterally across the front of a tractor. The rotation of these spiral conveyors, which are mounted in semi-cylindrical casings, moves the snow along towards a fan which ejects it from the machine, in any direction through an outlet pipe.\nThe plaintiffs alleged in their statement of claim that both patents have been infringed by the respondent, but their action was dismissed. The learned trial judge came to the conclusion that the Wandscheer patent lacked subject-matter, was anticipated by prior patents and the prior use of cutter bars. As to the Curtis patent, he held that the invention was not novel, was anticipated by prior art, was inoperative and useless, and that the combination it covered was a juxtaposition of old and well-known elements lacking of subject-matter.\nIt is useless to elaborate on the Wandscheer patent. It is, I believe, as the trial judge said, invalid, because it reveals a total lack of inventive ingenuity. This alleged invention is a most simple one, consisting in the installation on the sides of the casing, of two bars for the purpose of cutting the snow. They are described as extending upwardly above the snow removing mechanism, and to be mounted forwardly of the vehicle, so that they may cut into the snow banks exceeding the height of the casing, and enable the snow to fall down ahead of the spirals, and to be disposed of by the snow removing mechanism.\nDuring the hearing, counsel for the respondent was told that this elementary apparatus was not an invention, lacked subject-matter, and that it was not necessary to hear him on that point. I am still of that opinion, and for that reason, I believe the Wandscheer patent to be invalid.\nAppellants rely only upon Claim 1 of the Curtis patent. It covers a combination in a snow plow of the class described, comprising:\n1. A horizontally arranged semi-cylindrical casing.\n2. A fan casing connected therewith.\n3. A spiral conveyor as described above which is mounted in the semi-cylindrical casing.\n4. A fan mounted in the fan casing.\n5. Means for actuating the spiral conveyor and the fan.\n6. An adjustable conduit connected with the fan casing which can be rotated to throw the snow in different directions.\nThis claim reads as follows:\n1. A snow plow of the class described comprising a horizontally arranged semi-cylindrical casing, a fan casing connected therewith, a conveyor in the first mentioned casing, a fan in. the fan casing, means for actuating the conveyor and fan, an adjustable conduit connected with the ,fan casing for rotary movement.\nOf course a combination may be the subject-matter of a valid patent, even if it is merely the juxtaposition of known elements. But, this juxtaposition must produce a useful and operative contrivance which has the indispensable character of novelty.\nIt is not sufficient, in order to obtain a valid patent, as Viscount Cave said in Permutit Co. v. Borrowman, 2\nfor a man to say that an idea floated through his brain; he must at least have reduced it to a definite and practical shape before he can be said to have invented a process.\nThe alleged invention must be susceptible of fulfilling its purpose, and it must enable a person skilled in the art to carry it out.\nI agree with the proposition that the rotating ejector pipe is the main feature of the Curtis patent, and that if the Court is not convinced of its novelty, of its operativeness and utility, the appeal must fail. And if it is impossible to find in the combination of old elements as the spirals, the fan casing, the fan itself for ejecting the snow, a new rotating workable ejector pipe which will direct the snow in different directions, then the invention is not patentable, and must be held void. The informations given by Curtis in his specifications, as to the operativeness of his rotating ejector are more than meagre. He has merely disclosed the bare idea of a chimney throwing the snow in various directions. We find no explanation as to how it will function and it is, as it has been said before \"obviously suggestive of experimental or research work\". As McLean J. said in Christiani v. Rice 3 \"The patentee is not to tell a man to make an experiment, but to tell him how to do the thing.\"\nThe reason for this absence of information in the specifications is that the rotating ejector had no usefulness and was not workable. It could not do what it was intended to do, and could not serve the purposes mentioned in the patent. Curtis admits himself that it was not successful, and that he did not like the operation of it. This type of chimney was never used by Curtis or by anyone else, and other means had to be devised after considerable work and ingenuity, to secure a practical outlet for the snow projected by the fan. This is also the opinion of Mr. Arthur Sicard, and of Mr. Arthur Elie Choquette, who was heard as an expert witness. The latter says:\nD. Maintenant, ce que je d\u00e9sire savoir de vous, comme expert, quelle est votre opinion relativement \u00e0 l'op\u00e9ration d'un appareil dessin\u00e9 et construit de cette mani\u00e8re? Je d\u00e9sire savoir si cette construction, d'apr\u00e8s vous, est op\u00e9rante ou non, et pourquoi? R. Ce conduit, cette chemin\u00e9e ou conduit de 10, r\u00e9f\u00e9rence des chiffres 10-12-11, ne peut fonctionner pour la neige. La neige est un corps fondant par pression ou friction, et ne peut \u00eatre lanc\u00e9e qu'en une certaine ligne parabolique dont la trajectoire est comme une balle, elle ne peut suivre un conduit angulaire ou coud\u00e9.\nA device had to be found, and the respondent had one patented. It is different from the contrivance found in Curtis' patent, and is operative.\nIn his patent, Curtis made the same mistake, with respect to the chimney, as all other early workers, by providing his machine with a chimney of the nature of a \"stove pipe\" with a pronounced elbow-joint. Sicard himself made that mistake in the early years and secured a patent in 1925 in which the same type of unworkable pipe is shown. In Sicard's second patent, the upper part of the chimney, due to a special mechanism, rotates on a vertical axis, thus enabling the snow to be delivered almost at any point within the circle. I do not believe that Curtis ever disclosed a patentable chimney of that type. Sicard's chimney is a comparatively recent development, achieved only in 1936 after years of work and experimentation.\nFor these reasons, I think that the action fails, and that the appeal should be dismissed with costs.\nRand J.:\u2014Although several modes of removing snow are described in the specification, the only one dealt with on the argument is that in which the snow is gathered by right- and left-hand spirals from each side of the front of the machine to the centre where it passes back into the blower chamber from which it is ejected through a conduit rotatable on a vertical axis. The determinative question is whether that combination in the light of the disclosure possesses utility.\nThe method of snow removal in use in 1919 when Curtis first applied himself to the question was, for streets, the ordinary \"V\" plow which clears a way by pushing the snow to the sides; but the rapid development of automotive transportation inevitably spread to all year use of highways and following the first Great War, both in the United States and Canada the demand for more effective means became urgent.\nThe difficulty attending that search was enhanced by the fact that only in winter could practical experiments be made. In the season of 1919-20, Curtis made his first attempts to develop such a machine. He began with a spiral in a partial casing, the latter co-operating in the movement of the snow, and in the result satisfied himself of the sufficiency of that mechanical device for the purposes in view. Delivery of the snow to a side blower was found to swing the machine off its course and he was led to delivery at the centre. His work in the first year did not go beyond that stage, but from it he deduced the complete invention, the application for the patent for which was made in the United States on May 25 of 1920. He conceived not only the conduction of the snow to a central blower, but also its discharge by propulsion through a rotating vertical conduit: but it is important to keep in mind that to this point the latter was wholly theoretical. In the next year, 1920-21, bringing the snow to the centre, he installed a chute leading from a lower side of the blower casing, offering, probably, by its small angle to the horizontal, the least resistance to the expulsion. By the work of this season, the limitations of a single spiral and the practical necessity of greater flexibility in discharge appear to have been made evident.\nIn the third winter, 1921-22, he tried out two spirals, one above the other. For the first time, he opened a discharge from the top of the blower casing with a pipe not horizontal but at an angle of 45 degrees, moving apparently only in a transverse plane. The test in this respect was wholly unsatisfactory; the snow would produce \"a back pressure\" which seemed to \"choke the motor\", i.e., the blower. His next step was to remove the upper arc of the rounded portion of the blower casing, leaving the vertical sides front and rear intact, and over the opening to insert a plate revolving along the perimeter of the casing through the arc with a discharge orifice to which a conduit could be attached. In this way, the snow could be directed either to the right or the left of the machine in a fixed plane.\nChoquette, for the respondent, states the principle of this propulsion to be that of centrifugal force imparted to the snow by the blades of the blower in substantially a parabolic trajectory. He qualified this somewhat by conceding a minor degree of air current, possibly to a slight extent effective on light snow, with the chute at an open angle. But there is no evidence of actual use of the Curtis machine to its latest development in a mode in which the discharge changes its plane of direction after it has entered the conduit.\nI come now to the precise claims made by Curtis. In the United States patent, after an enumeration of the elements of the combination, the first claim concludes with the words \"and an adjustable conduit connected with the fan casing\". That this leads from the top of the casing seems to be clear from the specification. In the second claim the discharge means is described as \"an outlet for the fan casing\", as broad as could be made. On the other hand, in the Canadian patent applied for under date of June 6, 1921, the claim is in these words:\n(1) A snow plow of the class described, comprising a horizontally arranged semi-cylindrical casing, a fan casing connected therewith, a conveyor in the first mentioned casing, 'a fan in the fan casing, means for actuating the conveyor and fan, and an adjustable conduit connected with the fan casing for rotary movement.\nNow, it is obvious that once the idea of the introduction of snow into such a blower is reached, some mode of discharge is necessarily involved, and in the circumstances of 1920 the particular mode could be of utmost importance. In working out this feature both Curtis and Sicard passed through the first stage of the simple fixed angular chute and then into that of a trajectory in a transverse plane; but neither Curtis nor the appellants have gone beyond the latter, and it was not until 1937 that a rotatable vertical conduit was offered for sale by Sicard.\nThe second claim in the United States patent by its inclusion of any mode of discharge in substance protects the combination of conveyor and blower; but notwithstanding this the inventor has by precise language strictly limited the Canadian patent to a particular mode which renders the rotary feature, delivery at any horizontal angle, essential to the combination. The mode of snow removal and not the removal itself is the result sought and here it is by a member with full mobility. The angularity in the Curtis conduit actually in use, Ex. 13, does indeed include the vertical, but not with rotary scope, nor is it an improvement in that feature; it is, as treated, a different mode which is not an equivalent because it produces a different result; and it has not been suggested either in the specification or in any experiment or use that any other than a fixed vertical conduit is susceptible of rotary adjustment.\nWe are then brought to the question of fact whether Curtis by his specification has given a sufficient disclosure for the construction of a conduit that would possess utility under rotary operation. When Curtis failed in 1921-22 in his experiment with the conduit at 45 degrees and took up the lateral discharge, was it because of the obstacles which confronted him or was he content to pursue what appeared to him the more direct and simpler means, sufficient for his purposes under the United States patent? Notwithstanding that, having achieved the development of the conveyor and blower factors, he may have considered the discharge as of minor importance, I am unable to avoid the conclusion that his shift was in fact a forced retreat from the rotary conception to a mode which, at no time, has been under a patent restriction in Canada.\nBecause of this absence of demonstrated usefulness, the appellants were limited to opinion evidence of what might have been done under the disclosure, and there is the statement of Ostrander on re-examination that he did not think he would have any trouble in making a workable means; \"I would make them of a sufficient radius and anything else that was necessary to make them\". He agreed, however, that such chutes must be \"designed for the work\" and that they had given rise to various patents of invention. But the striking circumstance is that the appellants in production have confined themselves to the single plane angular discharge. In that field, the parties are in this country in competition with similar machines. In no circumstances would Wandscheer have sold a machine with the rotary attachment either alone or as a severable adjunct to the transverse discharge for the reason, as I must assume, that in any form conceived by him and not adversely patented, it is of no practical use.\nOn the evidence of Curtis himself and of Choquette a prima facie case against utility in rotary discharge by reason of insufficiency in specification has, I think, been made out, but I am unable to say that the onus thus arising has been met by the appellants: Ehrlich v. Ihlee 4 at p. 441, where Cotton L.J. intimated that it did not lie upon the plaintiff until a prima facie case was shown by the defendant: Patterson v. Gaslight and Coke Co. 5at p. 834, in which James L.J. declared the plaintiff's evidence was\nutterly valueless as evidence of novelty and utility. The improvements have not been tried by the plaintiff or any of his witnesses, even experimentally, in a laboratory or with models. Vidal Dyes Syndicate Ld. v. Levinstein Ld. 6 at p. 254, where Fletcher Moulton L.J., in the course of the argument, remarked \"A plaintiff always gives evidence of utility.\" And the statement of Ostrander, contradicted as it seems to be by the whole business course of the appellants, cannot be taken to be sufficient.\nI do not overlook the doubtful implication raised by the 1937 patent of the respondent and the reference to the existing art in the preamble to the specification. That patent aggregates severably both rotation of the blower chamber on a transverse horizontal axis, and the stationary vertical conduit adjustable for rotary movement.\nIt is said by Choquette that the mechanism possesses features that make practicable the idea suggested by Curtis. What precisely they are was not elicited in the evidence, and from an examination both of the specification and the illustrative drawings, I am unable to satisfy myself on the point one way or the other. Nor is any indication given by the appellants of the extent of experiment required\u2014and that some degree is necessary is clear from the experience of Curtis\u2014to produce a workable rotary chute.\nOn what is before us, I must hold that at best what Curtis presented to the public was both the idea and the task of working it out. In the language of Lindley L.J. in Lane-Fox v. Kensington and Knightsbridge Electric Lighting Co .7.\nAn invention may be useful as indicating the direction in which further progress is to be expected, and yet that same invention may be useless for any other purpose; useless, that is, as an invention without further developments and improvements which have not occurred to the patentee.\nI would, therefore, dismiss the appeal with costs.\nKellock J.: This is an action for alleged infringement of a patent of the appellants known as the Curtis patent, the term of which, since this action was instituted, has expired. Prior to the issue of the patent, Curtis had been granted a patent for the same invention in the United States, the date of application for which was May 25, 1920. The invention as claimed relates to new and useful improvements in snow removers. Claim one of the patent, which alone is in issue, reads as follows:\nA snow plow of the class described comprising a horizontally arranged semi-cylindrical casing, a fan casing connected therewith, a conveyor in the first mentioned casing, a fan in the fan casing, means for actuating the conveyor and fan, an adjustable conduit connected with the fan casing for rotary movement.\nFigure 8 in the patent illustrates a left and right hand spiral operating in a semi-cylindrical casing which brings the snow to the centre of the machine where it passes through an opening in the back of the casing into the fan casing where it is ejected through a rotatable outlet pipe or chimney connected with the fan casing. The respondent set up that the patent was invalid as lacking in subject-matter and utility. It also alleged that there had been anticipation. All of these objections the trial judge sustained.\nWith respect to the last mentioned objection the only evidence of anticipation consisted in certain United States patents, printed copies of which were placed in evidence. It was not established that any of the subjects of invention described in any of these patents had even been in use. It is well established that for a prior patent to constitute anticipation, the patent must disclose the same or give information equal in practical utility to that given by the patent in question; Baldwin International Radio Co. of Canada Ltd. v. Western Electric Co. Inc. et al 8. When the prior patents are examined none of them amount, in my opinion, to anticipation of the patent here in question.\nIn the Tierney patent, which is dated March 16, 1869, the machine there described had a spiral and a fan, but there any resemblance to the Curtis machine disappears. The Tierney spiral was to be pushed like a drill in front of a railway locomotive, the snow being tossed up above the spiral where, coming in contact with the fan it was dispersed to .each side by the fan blades.\nThe Herran patent discloses two spirals operating in a semi-cylindrical casing and throwing the snow to opposite sides of the road, but nothing else.\nThe Cutting patent also discloses a spiral conveyor in a cylindrical casing but no fan or fan casing or conduit in association. In the Yeiter patent there is disclosed a spiral and a fan but no fan casing and no conduit or chimney. On the basis of these patents therefore the requirements of anticipation as laid down in Baldwin's case are not satisfied.\nAs to the defence on the ground of lack of subject-matter the learned trial judge states:\nCounsel for defendant further argued that there is lack of subject-matter in this patent. The combination submitted by Curtis is, in, my view, old and well known and it did not require the exercise of inventive ingenuity. I think that any skilled and competent mechanic could have done it. 9.\nAs there is no evidence of the use of any of the elements described in the Curtis patent, it is plain that in this finding the trial judge rests his view upon what is disclosed by the prior patents upon which he also based his view as to anticipation. As already pointed out, in none of these \"paper\" patents is there exhibited the combination which is to be found in the Curtis patent. The Curtis combination was therefore a new conception. On the question as to the presence or absence of invention, it is relevant to quote what was said by Green L.J., as he then was, in Wood v. Gowshall 10 :\nThe dissection of a combination into its constituent elements and the examination of each element in order to see whether its use was obvious or not is, in our view, a method which ought to be applied with great caution since it tends to obscure the fact that the invention claimed is the combination. Moreover, this method also tends to obscure the facts that the conception of the combination is what normally governs and precedes the selection of the elements of which it is composed and that the obviousness or otherwise of each act of selection must in general be examined in the light of this consideration. The real and ultimate question is: Is the combination obvious or not?\nFletcher Moulton L.J., as he then was, in British Westinghouse v. Braulik 11, said at 230:\nI confess that I view with suspicion arguments to the effect that a new combination, bringing with it new and important consequences in the shape of practical machines, is not an invention, because, when it has once been established, it is easy to show how it might be arrived at by starting from something known, and taking a series of apparently easy steps. This ex post facto analysis of invention is unfair to the inventors, and in my opinion it is not countenanced by English Patent Law. In Non-Drip Measure Co. Ltd. v. Stranger's Ltd. 12, Lord Russell of Killowen said at p. 142:\nMy Lords, it is always pertinent to ask, as to the article which is alleged to have been a mere workshop improvement, and to have involved no inventive step, has it been a commercial success? Has it supplied a want? Some language used by Tomlin J. in the case of Samuel Parkes & Coy. Ld. v. Cocker Bros., Ld. 13 may be cited as apposite :\n\"Nobody, however, has told me, and I do not suppose that anybody ever will tell me, what is the precise characteristic or quality the presence of which distinguishes invention from workshop improvement * * * The truth is that when once it has been found, as I find here, that the problem had waited solution for many years, and that the device is in fact novel and superior to what had gone before, and has been widely used, and used in preference to alternative devices, it is, I think, practically impossible to say that there is not present that scintilla of invention necessary to support the Patent.\"\nOn the evidence no one prior to Curtis ever conceived or made a machine of the description in his patent or employed any such machine for the purpose of removing snow. Subject to the question as to utility, which I shall proceed to examine, the element of inventive ingenuity required by the authorities is, in my opinion, present in the combination claimed by the patent. In my opinion therefore this defence also fails.\nComing to the defence of lack of utility, Curtis' first conception occurred during the winter of 1919-1920 when he began his experiments. His equipment consisted of an auger or spiral 16 inches in diameter operating in a semi-cylindrical casing which was carried horizontally across the front of a motor truck. This spiral had right and left hand parts and carried the snow to its outside ends. At one end there was a fan in a casing which partially enclosed it, the opening being toward the front through which the snow, delivered to the fan by the spiral, was thrown off. Curtis says that on these experiments the auger cut the snow and delivered it well to the fan which took it as fast as it was delivered. However, what he described as \"sidedraft\", or a pulling to one side, was experienced. So it was decided to reverse the augers, putting the fan in the rear of the centre and delivering the snow from the augers to the fan through an opening in the auger casing. On the basis of the above Curtis applied on May 25, 1920, for a United States patent. While a number of the drawings in the patent ultimately granted show a discharge conduit Curtis had not up to this time used a chimney.\nIn the winter of 1920-21 he used the equipment generally shown in figure 8 of the patent, namely, a single row of spirals with right and left hand parts which delivered the snow through an opening in the centre of the auger casing to the fan or blower in the rear, the auger shaft being driven by a worm gear in the centre from the blower shaft which ran forward from the blower to the auger shaft and back to a connection with the shaft of the truck. The worm gear is shown in figure 9. Instead of a rotating conduit Curtis used a fixed one which delivered the snow to one side of the machine only. As a result of the experience of this winter Curtis discovered that one 16-inch auger was not large enough in deep snow for which, if only one auger was to be used, it had to be larger. He also discovered that in using the motive power of the truck the speed of the truck motor needed to keep the truck at a proper speed forward did not drive the auger at the required speed for it to do its work. He therefore came to the conclusion that a motor mounted on the truck separate from the truck motor was necessary. It was following upon this that in July, 1921, he made application for the patent in Canada.\nThe question at issue in this appeal is whether the type of rotating chimney described in the first patent, taken as part of the combination which was the subject of the patent, met the test of utility. As to the worm gear by which the auger shaft was driven from the blower shaft, although appellant's witness, Ostrander, stated that this type of shaft and gear would not be entirely satisfactory, it was in fact used by Curtis and he says nothing of any difficulty experienced with it. I do not think therefore that this item need be further considered.\nThe lack of utility which, apart from the worm gear, it is said the Curtis machine lacked is with respect to the rotatable discharge conduit. When the evidence which is relied upon in support of this objection is analysed the attack really is that, construing the specification as though the drawings included therein were scale drawings, the conduit there shown with its elbow having a right angle is unworkable. This objection reduces itself on the evidence to a charge that the abruptness of the angle of the elbow taken together with its bore on the above basis, must inevitably cause the snow to choke in the conduit so as to be inoperable. The fact that the Curtis conduit rotates on a vertical axis does not in my opinion constitute any part of the respondent's objection. A conduit which is vertical only is neither helped nor hurt by the fact that it rotates about a vertical axis. The rotary feature serves no purpose except in a conduit which at some point departs from the vertical. In such a conduit the rotary movement changes the direction of the discharge outlet with the result that the discharge itself is directed away from the vertical. That this rotating feature does not constitute any part of the respondent's objection is made more clear when the Sicard patent itself is examined, as I shall do later.\nAs already mentioned, on the important date, namely, May 25, 1920, when Curtis applied for his patent, while he had conceived the machine described in the application, he had not built a complete one. With respect to utility and sufficiency of the specification at that date, what is said by Parke B. in Neilson v. Harford 14 is relevant, namely:\nif such a person (i.e. a person skilled in the art) would construct an apparatus that would answer some beneficial purpose, whatever its shape was, according to the terms of this specification, then I think that this specification is good, and the patent may be supported so far as relates to that.\nIt is also to be observed that the protection afforded by a patent is not confined to a device made strictly in accordance with the drawings; Thomas v. South Wales Colliery Tramworks and Engineering Co., Ltd. 15, per Tomlin J., as he then was, at 27, where he said:\nIt is, I think, indisputable that in construing a specification of this kind the figures, unless they are, by express reference, imported into the method which is to be employed, must be taken as illustrations only, and one cannot confine the patent to the particular form indicated in. the figures, unless the language of the specification has in terms limited it to that form. In my opinion the proper light in which the respondent's objection is to be regarded appears when one examines the specification in the respondent's own patent of 1937. It refers to the existing state of the art, inter alia, as follows:\nIn some instances the blower is provided with a stationary casing having an outlet communicating with either a stationary or rotatably mounted delivery spout through which the snow is delivered to a suitable point of discharge.\nFurther on it says in describing the respondent's invention:\nAs distinguished from these prior arrangements, the present invention provides a snow removing appartus in which a rotatably mounted telescopic delivery spout is used in conjunction with a blower of the rotary casing type * * * The delivery spout, being rotatably mounted and of telescopic construction, may be extended and directed a considerable distance toward either side of the roadway or in the direction of a snow loading vehicle.\nFrom this two things emerge: (1) That the construction of a machine of the Curtis type including the rotatable chimney with an elbow to effect a change in direction of the discharge was then well known, and (2) that the respondent's invention was expressly confined to the telescopic construction of the conduit near its discharge end.\nThe evidence does not suggest from beginning to end that any machine other than one constructed in accordance with the Curtis patent was in contemplation of the respondent when it made the above application.\nThe Sicard specification is interesting also from another standpoint, namely, its particularity or rather its lack of particularity in the teachings as to the construction of the discharge conduit it claims. It is completely lacking in any details or measurements as to the bore of the conduit or the angle of the elbow at any stage of its extension or retraction of the telescopic parts forming the elbow. The patentee relies and must rely on the ability of a competent workman to build a conduit of some utility from the general description to which the specification limits itself. It is further to be noted that the elbow depicted in the drawings accompanying the specification passes from almost the vertical through and beyond a right angle. In my opinion it is obvious that if the respondent's patent can be said to be unobjectionable on the ground that a skilled mechanic could, without invention built an operable machine of some utility, the same must also be said of the Curtis patent. In my opinion it is properly to be said of both.\nThat such a mechanic could produce such a machine from the Curtis patent is established by the evidence of the witness Ostrander. It is to be observed that it is not necessary that such a person should be able to do so without trial or experiments so long as the task involved does not require invention. In Edison & Swan Electric Light Co. v. Holland 16, Cotton L.J. said, at p. 277:\nThe objection taken as a whole, was that the specification did not sufficiently show how the invention is to be carried into effect. It is necessary that this should be done so as to be intelligible, and to enable the thing to be made without further invention\u2014not, as was pressed upon us, by an ordinary workman, but by a person described by Lord Ellen-borough in Huddart v. Grimshow (1 Webs. R. pp. 85 to 87) as a person skilled in the particular kind of work or, as said by Lord Loughborough in Arkwright v. Nightingale (1 Webs. R. p. 60) a person conversant in the subject. But in my opinion it is not necessary that such a person should be able to do the work without any trial or experiment, which, when it is new or especially delicate, may frequently be necessary, however clear the description may be.\nSee also No-Fume Ltd. v. Pitchford 17 ; Otto v. Linford 18.\nThe respondent's evidence on this branch of the case was limited to two witnesses, Sicard and Choquette, whose evidence, as already mentioned, as directed against the Curtis conduit was confined exclusively to an elbow with a right angle as depicted by the Curtis drawings. Sicard said that he had not tried a chimney with an elbow of 90 degrees but he did not think it would work. Choquette gave similar evidence except that he said he thought such an elbow would handle light snow.\nIn Otto v. Linford 19, supra, Jessel M.R., said at page 39:\nI have heard judges say, and I have read that other judges have said, that there should be a benevolent interpretation of specifications. What does that mean? I think, as I have explained elsewhere, it means this: when the judges are convinced that there is a genuine, great and important invention, which, as in some cases, one might almost say, produces a revolution in a given art or manufacture, the judges are not to be astute to find defects in the specifications; but, on the contrary, if it is possible, consistently with the ordinary rules of construction, to put such a con- struction on the patent as will support it. They are to prefer that construction to another which might possibly commend itself to their minds if the patent was of little worth and of very little importance. That has been carried out over and over again, not only by the Lord Chancellor on appeal, but by the House of Lords. There is, if I may say so, and I think there ought to be, a bias, as between two different constructions, in favour of the real improvement and genuine invention, to adopt that construction which supports an invention.\nAt page 41 he said:\nA specification for improvements in gas-motor engines is addressed to gas-motor engine-makers and workers, not to the public outside. Consequently you do not require the same amount of minute information that you would in the case of a totally new invention, applicable to a totally new kind of manufacture. In this case the inventor says this: \"I am going to turn that which was a sudden explosion of gas into a gradual explosion of gas, and I am going to do that by the introduction of a cushion of air in one place between the piston and the combustible mixture.\" If a man if left without any more information, he asks, \"How much air am I to let in?\" He lets in a little air, and he finds the thing explodes as before; and he lets in some more, and he finds directly, on the mere regulation of his stopcock, how much is required; and he finds very soon that he has let in enough, and now there is a gradual expansion, and no longer a sudden and explosive expansion. It does not appear to me that that requires invention. It requires a little care and watching, and that is all.\nIn my opinion the respondent's witnesses, one of them in answer to a series of very leading questions, endeavoured to make a matter of mystery and difficulty out of the construction of a conduit of the Curtis type, but neither gave any details as to the difficulties to be encountered or how they should be met and as already mentioned the specification of the Sicard patent itself gives no details to enable one from the patent to build a successful conduit. In my judgment the Curtis invention was a great advance on anything in existence at the time, and the specification, which should receive a benevolent construction, when taken in connection with the evidence of Ostrander, already referred to, was sufficient.\nIn the light of the above the respondent is reduced to relying in support of its objection on the course followed by Curtis himself in the winter of 1921-22. That winter he built a plow with two 20-inch augers, one mounted above the other. During this winter he first actually used a conduit with an elbow in it, but this elbow had an angle of 45 degrees. This chimney did not prove to be satisfactory as, to use Curtis' own words, \"It seemed to choke the motor down too much\". There was too much \"back pressure\". Curtis, instead of proceeding further with a conduit removed it and constructed a double housing over the blower with a hole in it which was adjustable so that the snow could be thrown to one side or the other of the machine. This method of discharge satisfied him. It is to be observed that the type of conduit illustrated by the drawings of the patent was never used with the single auger in connection with which it is described. It had its choking effect on the motor when used with the double row of conveyors which presumably would deliver more snow to the blower or deliver it faster than a single spiral. Instead of making changes in the conduit after he had built the double row of conveyors, Curtis chose to substitute the different mechanism above mentioned.\nIt is this course followed by Curtis which the respondent says is to be taken as a confession of failure on his part as to the conduit described in the patent, which renders the patent invalid. In my opinion, that is not the conclusion which should be drawn in the light of the whole of the evidence to which I have referred. In my view it is quite consistent with the view that Curtis chose to proceed with what he considered an improved method of discharge. In Edison and Swan Electric Light Co. v. Holland 20, supra, Cotton L.J. said at 277:\n* * * a patent is not to be defeated simply because subsequent inventions improve the patented article, or because in consequence of subsequent improvements, no article was in fact made in accordance with the specification.\nI am unable to draw any inference adverse to the utility of the Curtis invention from the silence of the evidence as to any machine having been marketed by the appellant with a discharge conduit of the Curtis type. What the fact is does not appear nor the considerations relevant thereto. The fact that Sicard was free, without infringement to market a machine with a conduit of discharge rotating on a horizontal axis may well have evidentiary value on the question of damages, but does not, in my opinion, have any effect on the question of utility.\nI think the proper finding on all the evidence is that Curtis had invented the conduit claimed although he had not constructed a completely satisfactory one which for him, or for any skilled mechanic, was a matter of trial involving no invention. This in my opinion is admitted by the respondent in its specification with which I have dealt.\nAs I think the respondent has clearly infringed the Curtis patent I would allow the appeal and direct the entry of judgment in favour of the appellant for the relief claimed with costs here and below.\nEstey J. : The appellant (plaintiff) Klauer Manufacturing Co. Ltd. manufactures snow removal equipment and is the assignee of two patents: Curtis Patent No. 253159 and Wandscheer Patent No. 309848, issued respectively September 1, 1925, and March 31, 1931. In this action it claims that the snow removal equipment manufactured by the respondent in 1936 constitutes an infringement of the foregoing patents.\nThe learned trial judge in the Exchequer Court dismissed the appellant's action. He held that the essential features of the Curtis patent had been anticipated by prior patents and, therefore, it lacked novelty and subject-matter and, furthermore, it was inoperative and useless.\nThe Wandscheer patent he held did not constitute valid subject-matter and his judgment with respect to this patent was affirmed at the hearing of this appeal.\nThe appellant's main contentions are with respect to the Curtis patent. In his specification Curtis included the following:\nThis invention relates to snow plows for steam and street railways, trucks and the like and the principal object of the invention is to provide spiral conveyor means for forcing the snow to one or both sides of the track or road.\nAnother object of the invention is to provide blower means for receiving the snow from the conveyor means for blowing to a distant point.\nThis invention also consists in certain other features of construction and in the combination and arrangement of the several parts, to be hereinafter fully described, illustrated in the accompanying drawings and specifically pointed out in the appended claims.\n* * * * *\nIn the modification shown in Figures 8 and 9 a double conveyor is used which is so arranged as to feed the snow to the center of the casing * * * The fan shaft is connected in any desired manner with a source of power.\n* * * * * I desire it to be understood that I may make changes in the construction and in the combination and arrangement of the several parts, provided that such changes fall within the scope of the appended claims.\nClaim No. 1 upon which the appellant bases his action reads as follows:\nA snow plow of the class described comprising a horizontally arranged semi-cylindrical casing, a fan casing connected therewith, a conveyor in the first mentioned casing, a fan in the fan casing, means for actuating the conveyor and fan, an adjustable conduit connected with the fan casing for rotary movement.\nCurtis applied for his patent on July 12, 1921, and patent issued September 1, 1925. (In the United States he applied May 25, 1920, and patent issued April 18, 1922). His application discloses an equipment and certain alternatives in parts thereof. That with which we are concerned has the spiral blades so placed in the shaft as to convey the snow to the centre, force it backward through an opening in the semi-cylindrical casing into a fan casing containing a blower or fan which forces the snow into and through a chimney. The lower portion of the chimney is stationary and commences at the fan casing. It extends upward and then outward from an elbow of about 90 degrees. Below the elbow is an equipment for rotating the upper portion of the chimney containing the elbow and thereby the snow may be distributed in any desired direction.\nThe respondent contends that the Curtis patent is invalid (a) for lack of subject-matter and novelty and in particular that it was anticipated by prior patents, (b) it is inoperative and lacks utility.\nThe respondent further contents that if the Curtis patent is valid its own equipment is so different in its construction as to involve no infringement.\nThe respondent's first contention is that the essential features of the Curtis patent, including the semi-cylindrical casing, spiral conveyor, fan casing, blower and rotary adjustable chimney, were all anticipated by prior patents and that Curtis merely effected a juxtaposition of these earlier patented devices and exercised on his part in so doing no inventive ingenuity and, therefore, that the patent lacks subject-matter or novelty. That the component parts appeared separately or in groups in earlier patents is not denied, but it is pointed out that in not one of, them are these devices all present and therefore they were never before operating as a unit or in combination. Moreover, in not one of these patented equipments are the spirals operated in a manner to convey the snow to the centre and force it backward through an opening in the semi-cylindrical casing into a fan casing containing a blower from which the snow is forced up and out through a rotary adjustable chimney which distributes the snow in any desired direction. There is not only the new combination but also the disposition of the snow from the centre of the equipment.\nThe prior patents were issued throughout the period 1869 to 1907. Curtis adopted some of their features, made necessary adjustments and improvements and developed an equipment which was different and possessed limited utility. His equipment is superior in operation and different from any disclosed in the earlier patents. He worked out a new combination and an improved mode of operation that attained the desired result \"in a more useful and beneficial way\": Lord Cairns quoting the Lord President in Harrison v. Anderston Foundry Co. 21. He overcame the difficulties that the earlier patents had not solved. It is a combination which exhibits\na degree of ingenuity * * * which must have been the result of thought and experiment, and is sufficient to make these combinations the proper subject of a patent.\nLord Watson in Thomson v. The American Braided Wire Co. 22.\nIn British United Shoe Machinery Co. Ltd. v. A. Fussell & Sons Ltd. 23 the patented machine was for\nfixing the soles of boots to the welts by means of metallic screws which are screwed in from a continuous screw-threaded wire which is then cut off level with the sole \u2026 That operation which could, as I say, have been done by hand, has long been capable of being also done by machine. Its merit is that it does this operation at a high speed, and with unvarying accuracy, so that you can work these machines so as to yield a huge output without making wasters.\nThe validity of the patent was upheld. Fletcher Moulton L.J. at p. 647:\nThe invention is the new group. It is admitted that this is a new group. It did not exist before, and when you compare it with the groups which imperfectly performed this function in the preceding machines, the difference is so great that it is idle to contrast the two * * * It seems to me a great and important change in these machines, producing a vastly improved effect, properly claimed, not by claims for individual parts, for which, in my opinion, it was wholly unsuited, but by a claim for many parts as a group effecting together the one object wanted, and properly claimed as a group, and in no other way.\nIn Patent Exploitation Ltd. v. Siemens Brothers & Co. Ltd. 24, Lord Davey stated at p. 547:\nIt is sufficient for the validity of the Patent if the combination, being the result of thought or experience, is new, and produces some new result or an old result in a more useful and beneficial way.\nSee also British Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. Braulik 25 ; Electrolier Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v. Dominion Manufacturers Ltd. 26 and Baldwin International Radio Co. of Canada Ltd. v. Western Electric Co. Inc. et al 27.\nThe cases cited in support of the contention that inventive ingenuity is absent in the Curtis patent because of the prior patents are all distinguishable upon their facts. One particularly relied upon was that of Durable Electric Appliance Co. Ltd. v. Renfrew Electric Products Ltd. 28, and affirmed in this Court 29. The patent (relating to improvements in portable electric heaters) was held invalid for lack of subject-matter and novelty. Mr. Justice Masten, delivering the judgment of the Appellate Court of Ontario, stated at p. 536:\nEach of the elements in the combination performs exactly the same function as in the earlier patents, and the only difference consists in the slightly different curve which is given at the top and the bottom to the reflecting surface.\nIn this Court Chief Justice Anglin at p. 9 stated:\n* * * it is a combination the making of which did not involve any inventive ingenuity. Any competent and well-informed mechanic could readily have effected it.\nThe improvements effected by Curtis in his patented snow removal equipment cannot be reduced to anything so relatively unimportant as a \"slightly different curve\", nor as previously intimated could they have been effected by \"any competent and well-informed mechanic\". The creation of the Curtis equipment required inventive ingenuity in addition to mechanical skill and therefore it has not been anticipated by the prior patents.\nThe learned trial judge found the Curtis equipment to be lacking in utility. The Curtis equipment as constructed with a rotating chimney having an angle of 45\u00b0 (as patented it shows an angle of 90\u00b0) it is conceded would work in dry, light snow, but in other types of snow \"it seemed to choke the motor down too much.\" Curtis had therefore perfected and patented an equipment which had some utility. He had not merely demonstrated the possibility of such an equipment but had actually produced it and had at least by way of an experiment tested it. It is this feature that was absent in United Telephone Co. v. Bassano 30 and which brings this case within the requirements of The Badische Anilin Und Soda Fabrik v. Levinstein 31.\nThen in Terrell on Patents, 8th ed., p. 112, it is stated:\nA very slight amount of utility will be sufficient to support a patent. Alderson, B., in Morgan v. Seaward (1 W.P.C. 167, at p. 186), said: \"I think if it was of different construction from any other steam engine, and of any use to the public, then that is sufficient\". Again, Jessel, M.R., in Otto v. Linford (46 L.T. (N.S.) 35, at p. 41), said: \"And, as to this question of utility, very little will do.\"\nIt was the inventive ingenuity of Curtis that perfected the equipment, and while its utility was limited, it would appear from the evidence that whatever it lacked to make it a commercial equipment could be supplied by mechanical adjustments. Ostrander, a mechanical engineer experienced in the manufacture of snow equipment, stated that he would have no trouble in making a workable ejector from the Curtis drawings. This is in substance what the appellant contends the respondent has effected in regard to the chimney as used in its equipment.\nThe respondent also stressed that the appellant never did manufacture for sale an equipment with this chimney as patented. Curtis apparently decided that it was sufficient that the snow be discharged upon either side and therefore in lieu of the chimney he adopted two adjust- able spouts that directed the snow to one side or the other. That fact, however, does not militate against the validity of the patent as it sometimes happens that improvements immediately follow a patent which supersede it in the market, usually because with these improvements it is more efficient or less expensive. Utility does not depend upon marketability. The Badische Anilin Und Soda Fabrik v. Levinstein 32.\nThe respondent alternatively contends that its equipment is different in many respects and does not constitute an infringement of any of the main elements of the Curtis patent, namely, (1) a semi-cylindrical casing, (2) a conveyor, (3) an adjustable conduit for rotary movement. Its submissions are that its equipmnt (a) does not embody a horizontally arranged semi-cylindrical casing, (b) uses baffle plates, (c) has an adjustable fan casing, (d) the power is supplied to the spiral shaft at the side of the equipment rather than at the centre.\nThe reason and purpose of the semi-cylindrical casing is that it holds the snow in the spiral while it is moved toward the centre. That this casing should be somewhat semi-cylindrical in shape appears to have been accepted for a long time. Some such casings appeared in the earlier patents, particularly that of Tierney issued in the United States in 1869, and in the Herran patent issued in 1889. The respondent suggests that the semi-cylindrical feature is found only where there is a single spiral and as it never constructed its equipment with but a single spiral, it never had a semi-cylindrical casing. It does, however, have a casing that with the baffle plates serves the same purpose. In fact, the presence of a casing in either the Curtis or the Sicard patent does not add a new feature and whatever is different in the respective casings is but a mechanical adjustment made necessary by the introduction of the additional spiral.\nThe evidence does not establish that the introduction of baffle plates, being sheets of metal to keep the snow from falling from the top spirals into the lower spirals, is such that it would not occur to any skilled mechanic. The adoption of the two superposed rows of spirals does not involve a new principle, nor does it appear that the adjustments or alterations necessary are such as to require more than mechanical skill and, therefore, do not involve inventive genius.\nIn both of these equipments the conduit or chimney is so constructed as to permit of the snow being blown in any direction. The respondent indicates that his chimney is in certain particulars different, but in order to succeed he must go further and show that these differences involve inventive ingenuity. Curtis claimed as above quoted \"an adjustable conduit connected with the fan casing for rotary movement.\" In the Sicard equipment counsel contends that \"the upper part of the chimney due to a special mechanism rotates on a vertical axis enabling the snow to be delivered almost at any point within the circle.\" The evidence discloses that respondent adopted a chimney with a pronounced obtuse angle, or perhaps a curve instead of an angle of 90\u00b0 as shown in the Curtis patent. It also adopted adjustable sections toward the exit of the chimney and made changes or alterations in its size. These are, however, mechanical changes. Just what was meant by the phrase \"a special mechanism\" is not clarified by the evidence. Counsel for the respondent also suggested that there was in the operation of respondent's blower an improvement in the force applied to the snow that made the chimney a more useful outlet but the evidence does not support that contention.\nThe equipment as it appears in the Curtis patent discharges the snow through the chimney. The Sicard equipment discharges the snow through three outlets, the chimney and a spout on either side of the chimney. By an adjustment of the fan casing the snow is directed to and through whichever one of the three outlets that may at any time be desired. It is the existence of these three outlets that makes the adjustable feature of the fan casing necessary and therefore it is a feature separate and apart from the equipment which may be described as the Curtis equipment. These additional outlets, one on either side of the chimney, and the adjustable fan casing, are additions to the Curtis patent but do not affect the purpose or usefulness of the equipment as patented. It does not help the Respondents, even though it be conceded, that they have made various improvements on the patented apparatus, as for instance in the drip pans and the means of moving the spit-frame backwards and forwards without opening the doors of the casing and the like. For these improvements, assuming they required invention, they might conceivably have taken out a Patent; but without the prior Patentees' consent they would not be entitled to use the original invention. A Patent, even for a combination, cannot be evaded by merely grafting upon it improvements however meritorious. On the whole matter I reach the conclusion that the Complainers are entitled to the interdict they seek.\nLord Salvensen at p. 708 in Lynch and Henry Wilson & Co. Ltd. v. John Phillips & Co. 33.\nRespondent in his equipment provided the power for the spiral shaft at the outer end rather than at the centre, as in the Curtis patent. Both methods appeared in earlier patents. In one of Curtis' alternatives he shows gears at the outer end and in his specification he states: \"the fan shaft is connected in any desired manner with the source of power.\" It therefore seems a mere matter of adoption of alternative methods well known in the art.\nWith great deference to the opinion of the learned trial judge, it appears to me that the Curtis patent is valid and that the respondent in the construction of its equipment has infringed upon that patent. I would, therefore, refer the matter back to the Exchequer Court for the determination of damages suffered by the appellant because of the respondent's infringement.\nThe appeal with respect to the Curtis patent should be allowed with costs.\nAppeal dismissed with costs.\nSolicitors for the appellants: Gowling, MacTavish & Watt.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Lajoie, Gelinas & MacNaughten.\n1 1946 Ex.

Racette (Suppliant) Respondent.\n1947: May 5, 6; 1947: December 22.\nPresent: Kerwin, Taschereau, Rand, Kellock and Estey JJ.\nON APPEAL FROM THE EXCHEQUER COURT OF CANADA\nCrown\u2014War Loan Bonds\u2014Registered as to principal only\u2014Alleged transfer by owner\u2014Signature of registered owner guaranteed by bank\u2014Owner denying having executed transfer\u2014Liability of the Crown\u2014Liability of the bank\u2014As to the principal\u2014As to the interest or coupons.\nThe respondent sought to recover the principal and the interest of nine $100 bonds of the Dominion of Canada which were registered as to principal in her name. These bonds, maturing in 1937, were purchased in 1917 and were left in custody of a friend, Father Cotter. In November, 1921, in consequence of a form of transfer purporting to have been signed by the respondent, witnessed by Father Cotter and guaranteed by the Royal Bank of Canada, the bonds were made payable to bearer. The respondent alleged that her name appearing on the transfer was a forgery. Judgment was given in the respondent's favour for the sum of $900 with interest at 5\u00bd per cent per annum from November, 1921, to the date of maturity in 1937.\nHeld, varying the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, that the respondent is entitled to receive from His Majesty the sum of $900, but that the interest of 5\u00bd per cent per annum, represented by the coupons attached to the bonds, is not recoverable from His Majesty.\nHeld: There can be no dispute that the document accepted by the Bank as a transfer of the registered bonds was not signed by the respondent and that the signature thereon does not purport to be made by a person acting for her. Neither does the evidence support the contention that the purported signature must be presumed to have been written under her authority.\nHeld: The interest on these bonds was payable by coupons which could have been cashed by anyone. It is impossible to hold that the loss of the interest represented by the coupons was a result of the Bank or His Majesty acting on the alleged transfer.\nHeld: No other interest may be allowed against the Crown unless' there is a statute or agreement providing for it, Hochelaga Shipping and Towing Co. Ltd. v. The King [1944] S.C.R. 138.\nHeld: The clause in the judgment a quo for recovery by His Majesty from the Royal Bank of Canada of the principal directed to be paid by the former to the respondent should remain. APPEAL from the judgment of the Exchequer Court of Canada, Angers. J., awarding to the respondent the sum of $900 with interest at 5\u00bd per cent per annum from November 25, 1921, to the date of maturity in 1937. The judgment also directed the Royal Bank of Canada to pay His Majesty the King the amount of the principal and interest that the latter was to pay the respondent.\nRoger Ouimet, K.C. for the appellant: His Majesty the King.\nHazen Hansard, K.C. for the appellant: The Royal Bank of Canada.\nJ. P. Charbonneau, K.C. for the respondent.\nKerwin J.: The suppliant, Marie E. Racette, sought to recover the principal of certain bonds issued by the Dominion of Canada and interest thereon and registered as to principal in her name. Her petition of right was dismissed with costs by the Exchequer Court, and the third party proceedings against the Royal Bank were dismissed without costs. That judgment was set aside by this Court 1 and a new trial directed. His Majesty the King was directed to pay the suppliant her costs of that appeal, but the costs of the abortive trial were left to be disposed of in the discretion of the judge at the new trial.\nSuch new trial was held and it was adjudged that the suppliant was entitled to recover from His Majesty the principal sum of the bonds, $900.00, and interest thereon at the specified rate of 5\u00bd per cent per annum from November 25, 1921, the date of an alleged transfer of the bonds, to December 1, 1937, the due date of the principal. The third party, The Royal Bank, was directed to pay His Majesty the King the amount of the principal and interest that the latter was to pay the suppliant. It was ordered that there should be no costs to any party by virtue either of the earlier or later judgment.\nHis Majesty the King and The Royal Bank now appeal. There can be no dispute that the alleged transfer of the bonds was not signed by the respondent but it was con- tended that her purported signature should be taken to have been written by her authority. The evidence, all of which is detailed in the reasons for judgment in the Court below, does not support that contention and the Exchequer Court was therefore right in deciding in favour of the suppliant. However, judgment was not only for the principal of the bonds but also for interest at the designated rate from the date of the alleged transfer. While the bonds were registered as to principal in the name of the suppliant, interest thereon was payable by coupons which could have been cashed by any one. The evidence is clear that the suppliant never saw the bonds but left them in a savings deposit box to which she and another had access and no question was raised by her until July 27, 1936, when she inquired if the Department of Finance had any bonds registered in her name. It is impossible to hold that the loss of the interest represented by the coupons was a result of The Royal Bank or His Majesty acting on the alleged transfer and interest may not be allowed against the Crown unless there is a statute or agreement providing for it: Hochelaga Shipping and Towing Company Limited v. The King 2. The judgment should therefore be varied by declaring that the suppliant is entitled to receive from His Majesty the sum of $900.00.\nThe trial judge did not allow the suppliant any costs. In view of this and of the fact that the petition of right is dated July 30, 1938, and notwithstanding that the present appeal succeeds in part, there should be no costs in this Court to any party. The clause in the judgment a quo for recovery by His Majesty from The Royal Bank of the principal directed to be paid by the former to the suppliant should remain.\nTaschereau J.: L'intim\u00e9e Marie Racette r\u00e9clame de l'appelant Sa Majest\u00e9 le Roi, la somme de $900.00 et int\u00e9r\u00eats au taux de 5\u00bd% \u00e0 compter du 25 novembre 1921. Elle all\u00e8gue dans sa p\u00e9tition de droit que depuis le 1er d\u00e9cembre 1917, elle \u00e9tait la propri\u00e9taire enregistr\u00e9e quant au capital seulement, de neuf d\u00e9bentures de $100.00 chacune du Dominion du Canada, avec coupons attach\u00e9s, et que les dites d\u00e9bentures ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9es hors sa connaissance. Elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi priv\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00e9ch\u00e9ance de cette somme.\nUne premi\u00e8re d\u00e9fense de Sa Majest\u00e9 le Roi a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillie par la Cour d'Echiquier, mais rejet\u00e9e par cette Cour. 3 Elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'effet que la garantie de la signature de l'intim\u00e9e par la Banque Royale du Canada, validait le transfert. Cette Cour4 a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que comme cons\u00e9quence de cette garantie, Sa Majest\u00e9 le Roi n'\u00e9tait pas exempt de responsabilit\u00e9 dans le cas de faux, mais qu'il conservait son recours contre la Banque Royale du Canada. Le dossier a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour d'Echiquier avec instructions de disposer de l'action au m\u00e9rite, et avec recommandation de permettre aux parties de compl\u00e9ter l'enqu\u00eate, si n\u00e9cessaire. Apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9-audition, M. le Juge Angers, tout en \u00e9mettant des doutes s\u00e9rieux sur la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage de l'intim\u00e9e, en est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion qu'elle n'avait pas sign\u00e9 le transfert, qu'elle n'avait autoris\u00e9 personne \u00e0 le faire pour elle, et a en cons\u00e9quence maintenu la p\u00e9tition de droit, non seulement pour la somme capitale de $900.00, mais aussi pour les int\u00e9r\u00eats repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par des coupons attach\u00e9s aux dites d\u00e9bentures.\nLa preuve r\u00e9v\u00e8le qu'en effet, d\u00e8s 1917, l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait la propri\u00e9taire enregistr\u00e9e de ces d\u00e9bentures, mais le 25 novembre 1921, comme r\u00e9sultat d'un transfert, suppos\u00e9 sign\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e, elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites payables au porteur. C'est cette signature de l'intim\u00e9e qui est garantie par la Banque Royale, et attest\u00e9e par le R\u00e9v\u00e9rend P\u00e8re Cotter, qui depuis 1914 voyait dans une certaine mesure \u00e0 l'administration des biens de l'intim\u00e9e. Le P\u00e8re Cotter quitta Montr\u00e9al en 1921 pour aller r\u00e9sider \u00e0 Fort William, et d\u00e9c\u00e9da dans le cours de l'ann\u00e9e 1936.\nIl avait apparemment plac\u00e9 ces d\u00e9bentures dans un coffre de s\u00fbret\u00e9 de la Banque Royale du Canada, dont il avait donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e un double de la clef. L'intim\u00e9e ne re\u00e7ut jamais les int\u00e9r\u00eats, et elle dit dans son t\u00e9moignage, qu'elle ne s'en pr\u00e9occupa jamais, vu qu'elle d\u00e9sirait les laisser accumuler jusqu'au moment de l'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du capital. A tout \u00e9v\u00e9nement, elle n'a re\u00e7u ni capital ni int\u00e9r\u00eats, et ce n'est qu'apr\u00e8s la mort du P\u00e8re Cotter qu'elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 s'inqui\u00e9ter et \u00e0 s'informer aupr\u00e8s de l'appelant. Elle \u00e9crivit \u00e0 l'endroit o\u00f9 le P\u00e8re Cotter \u00e9tait d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, elle se rendit \u00e0 la Banque Royale du Canada, s'informa au bureau du tr\u00e9sor, et c'est l\u00e0 qu'elle aprit que ses d\u00e9bentures avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites payables au porteur en 1921, et on lui fournit m\u00eame un photostat du document dont s'\u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 le gouvernement pour effectuer le transfert.\nIl semble surabondamment prouv\u00e9, comme d'ailleurs le dit M. le Juge Angers, que l'intim\u00e9e n'a jamais sign\u00e9 ce transfert. Elle le jure positivement, un expert en \u00e9criture confirme sans h\u00e9sitation son t\u00e9moignage, et d'ailleurs l'examen du document d\u00e9montre clairement l'absence compl\u00e8te de similitude entre la signature qui y est appos\u00e9e, et celle qui est v\u00e9ritablement la sienne. L'appelant n'a apport\u00e9 aucune preuve pour contredire celle de l'intim\u00e9e, et la seule conclusion possible est celle \u00e0 laquelle est arriv\u00e9 le juge au proc\u00e8s.\nMais on pr\u00e9tend que si c'est le P\u00e8re Cotter qui a ainsi sign\u00e9 le nom de l'intim\u00e9e, il \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 le faire par l'intim\u00e9e elle-m\u00eame. Cette pr\u00e9tention me para\u00eet inadmissible, et rien dans la preuve ne peut la supporter. Il est vrai que l'intim\u00e9e et le P\u00e8re Cotter ont ouvert un compte conjoint \u00e0 la Banque de Montr\u00e9al, que ce dernier a ouvert pour l'intim\u00e9e un autre compte \u00e0 la Banque Royale du Canada, et qu'il a achet\u00e9 les d\u00e9bentures avec l'argent de Mlle Racette. Mais je ne vois rien dans ces faits qui puisse \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme une autorisation au P\u00e8re Cotter de signer le nom de l'intim\u00e9e sur un document, afin de rendre payables au porteur, des d\u00e9bentures enregistr\u00e9es au nom de l'intim\u00e9e, et d\u00e9pos\u00e9es dans un coffret de s\u00fbret\u00e9, o\u00f9 tous les deux avaient acc\u00e8s. D'ailleurs, si v\u00e9ritablement le P\u00e8re Cotter avait l'autorisation que l'on pr\u00e9tend, pourquoi aurait-il d\u00e9guis\u00e9 sa propre signature? Il lui e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 facile de d\u00e9voiler cette autorisation que la Banque Royale, d'apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de son comptable, n'aurait pas mise en doute. Cet effort \u00e9vident pour d\u00e9cevoir n'est s\u00fbrement pas l'acte d'un mandataire autoris\u00e9 express\u00e9ment ou m\u00eame tacitement. Mais, la situation me para\u00eet diff\u00e9rente, en ce qui concerne les int\u00e9r\u00eats. Les d\u00e9bentures \u00e9taient enregistr\u00e9es quant au capital, mais les coupons d'int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e9taient payables au porteur, et je ne crois pas que l'acte de l'employ\u00e9 du gouvernement qui s'est bas\u00e9 sur un document forg\u00e9 pour op\u00e9rer le transfert des d\u00e9bentures, ait \u00e9t\u00e9 la cause de la perte des int\u00e9r\u00eats. En payant ces coupons au porteur, le gouvernement \u00e9tait lib\u00e9r\u00e9.\nLe jugement rendu par la Cour d'Echiquier doit donc \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 en ce sens que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat au taux de 5\u00bd% repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par les coupons annex\u00e9s aux d\u00e9bentures, doit \u00eatre retranch\u00e9. Aucun autre int\u00e9r\u00eat ne peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e depuis 1937, vu la d\u00e9cision de cette Cour dans la cause de Hochelaga Shipping v. The King 5. Devant cette Cour, chaque partie paiera ses propres frais.\nRand J.: It is not disputed that the document accepted by the bank as a transfer of the registered bonds was not signed by the respondent, and the signature does not purport to be made by a person acting for her. The Crown argues that, in the circumstances, the signature must be presumed to have been written under her authority. But the evidence gives no support to that contention.\nThe judgment in the Exchequer Court, however, includes interest from the date of the so-called transfer. The bonds were registered only as to principal and the interest coupons were payable to bearer; and even if the bonds were surrendered in 1924 in exchange for others of larger denomination, it cannot be said that the consequence of acting on the forged transfer was the loss of that interest.\nThe principal of the judgment below will, therefore, be reduced to $900.00. There will be no costs in this Court.\nThe judgment of Kellock and Estey JJ. was delivered by\nKellock J.: The respondent alleged that she was the owner of nine $100.00 bonds of the Dominion, maturing in 1937, which she had left in custody, in Montreal, of the Reverend Father Cotter, and which were not forthcoming at his death in May, 1936. The bonds had originally been registered as to principal in the name of the respondent but on November 25, 1921, in consequence of a form of transfer purporting to have been signed by-respondent, witnessed by Father Cotter and guaranteed by the appellant bank, they were made payable to bearer. Respondent alleged that the name \"Marie E. Racette\" appearing on the transfer was a forgery. The apparent signature of the respondent on the form of transfer was found by the learned trial judge to have been forged, although he disbelieved the respondent's evidence on certain other specific matters as to which he found her guilty of wilful perjury. In the result judgment was given in the respondent's favour for the sum of $900.00 with interest at 5\u00bd per cent from November 25, 1921, to the date of maturity in 1937.\nIt appears from the evidence that Father Cotter undertook to handle the financial affairs of the respondent for her and that in fact he did all her business from 1914 until 1921, when he moved away from Montreal to Fort William. The bonds were always in his custody from the time she gave him the money to buy them for her in 1917. After 1921 respondent says she looked after her own affairs and although she corresponded with Father Cotter until his death, she had never asked him for the bonds.\nThere is no ground in my opinion upon which the finding that the signature on the form of transfer is a forgery can be successfully attacked. No witness says the signature is genuine. The officer of the appellant bank who authorized the guarantee of the signature has no recollection of the matter and says in his evidence that at the relevant period he would have acted on the assurance of Father Cotter that the matter was regular. From a mere comparison of the disputed signature with the genuine signatures on other documents, including that on the note, Exhibit R-3, taken with the denial of the respondent, it is obviously impossible for the court to find the disputed signature to be genuine. It must be taken therefore that the appellants have failed on this branch of the case.\nIt is next contended for the appellants that the learned trial judge should have found that Father Cotter, by whose hand, according to the evidence submitted by the respondent, the respondent's name was in fact placed upon the transfer, had been authorized by the respondent to do so. The burden of establishing this is upon the appellants.\nThe evidence of the respondent is to the effect that she entrusted Father Cotter with the money to invest for her and was subsequently told by him that he had bought Victory Bonds for her, (which was the fact) and had lodged them in his safety deposit box to which he gave her a key, which she says she never used and in fact lost. She says she never asked him either for the bonds or the interest.\nThere is no inference as to the principal from the authority to receive the interest, taking that fact by itself. The other facts in evidence that are relied upon do not advance the matter. Father Cotter opened a bank account for the respondent in the Royal Bank and the two of them had a joint account in the Bank of Montreal and he retained the bank books in his possession. None of these facts, separately or together, however, would permit of the assumption on the part of the appellants, or either of them, that Father Cotter had authority from the respondent to deal with the principal of the bonds.\nThe respondent, on her examination for discovery explained her failure to enquire from Father Cotter as to the interest on the ground that he had told her to allow the interest to accumulate until her old age. At the trial, however, she said the reason was that she was waiting for the bonds to mature. Even if it be now assumed that neither explanation is the true one, none of this has any bearing on the question of authority to deal with principal and no inference with regard thereto can be drawn from the respondent's conduct however much suspicion it may arouse. Further, nothing in the nature of estoppel can be raised by either appellant. They knew nothing about any arrangements between the respondent and Father Cotter. In my opinion therefore the appeal must fail as to the principal.\nThe learned trial judge gave judgment in favour of the respondent not only for the principal of the bonds but also for interest at the contract rate from the date of the forged transfer. It is to be borne in mind that the bonds, while registered as to principal, had bearer coupons attached covering the interest. Whether, therefore, the respondent believed the interest was accumulating until her old age or until the maturity of the principal is immaterial. Had it been established that the particular bonds with coupons had been surrendered to the Crown and new bearer bonds with coupons issued therefor on the strength of the forged transfer, it might have been necessary to consider whether the appellant could take the position that in paying the coupons attached to the substituted bonds it had paid the original coupons. The evidence however is not in my opinion sufficient to raise the point and I mention it so that nothing herein may be taken as deciding anything in reference to such a case should it arise.\nThe coupons here in question, being payable to bearer, the respondent has not established that, as to any one of them, payment was, as against her, made improperly; Young v. MacNider 6; Connolly v. Montreal Park and Island Railway Co .7; Edelstein v. Schuler 8. The respondent's notice of her loss in 1936, while before the due date of the last coupon, was ineffective. I think therefore that the judgment below is erroneous with respect to the coupon interest. Had any interest other than that covered by the coupons been claimed, The King v. Roger Miller & Sons 9, would have been an answer.\nThe appeal must therefore be allowed and the judgment reduced to the amount of the principal of $900.00 only. As success is divided there should be no costs in this court.\nAppeal allowed and judgment varied; no costs to any party.\nSolicitors for the appellant: His Majesty the King: Roger Ouimet.\nSolicitors for the appellant : the Royal Bank of Canada : Montgomery, McMichael, Common & Howard.\nSolicitors for the respondent: Charbonneau, Charbonneau & Charlebois.\n1 [1942] S.C.R. 464.\n2 (1944) S.C.R. 138.\n3 [1942] S.C.R. 464.\n4 [1942] S.C.R. 464.\n5 [1944] S.C.R. 138.\n6 25 S.C.R., 272.\n7 20 S.C.

A return was made, not by the District Superintendent, but by the Commissioner of Immigration, stating that the applicant was held by him for deportation under a warrant of commitment dated September 13, 1945. This warrant was signed by the Commissioner and was directed to the District Superintendent or any Canadian Immigration officer, and it followed form G in the schedule to the Immigration Act with the important exception, that it did not recite as the form provides: \"And whereas under the provisions of the Immigration Act an order has been issued for the deportation of the said\u2026\u2026\".\nA copy of a deportation order, dated September 8, 1945, was produced before Mr. Justice Kellock, although objected to by the applicant because it was not made part of the return. Then Mr. Justice Kellock permitted the filing of a new return which was dated September 15, 1945, was signed by the Commissioner and had attached to it a copy of the same warrant of September 13, 1945, and a copy of the same order for deportation of September 8, 1945.\nSubsequently the respondent again filed a new return dated September 15, 1947, this time signed by the Acting District Superintendent and which had attached to it a copy of the same warrant of September 13, 1945 and a copy of an order for deportation of September 8, 1945, which contained a statement that the applicant was an alien and had been convicted of an offence under paragraph (d) of section 4 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929.\nThen Mr. Justice Kellock directed that in view of the statement of facts found, as appears in the order attached to the last return, the application for a writ of habeas corpus should be dismissed.\nThe present appeal is from the decision of Mr. Justice Kellock.\nHeld: The appeal to this Court should be dismissed.\nPer The Chief Justice, Kerwin, Taschereau and Rand JJ.: The words in section 26 of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, \"in accordance with the provisions of the Immigration Act relating to inquiry, detention and deportation\", require us to examine the provisions of the Immigration Act relating to inquiry, detention and deportation.\nThe officer named in the warrant must be able to justify his detention of the accused. It clearly appears that such a warrant depends upon an order for deportation and this is borne out by the fact that the form of warrant in the Schedule to the Act, Form G, provides for the recital of such order. The warrant for commitment and the order for deportation may be read together. The original order was defective because it did not state the facts upon which the board of Inquiry acted. But a proper order being subsequently produced, effect should be given to it and the applicant detained in custody. The Acting District Superintendent is now able to justify the applicant's detention and the Court will not on a habeas corpus proceeding such as this inquire into any irregularity in his caption.\nPer Estey J.: If the warrant is issued without a sufficient reference to the order for deportation, it is to that extent defective or incomplete. It would appear that the requirements of the Statute are satisfied by setting out in the warrant such description or identification of the order for deportation that either the accused or the party detaining him may identify same.\nWarrants defective because of omissions both as to substance and to form have been before the Courts and where they have recited a conviction or order which exists in fact, permission to amend the warrants has been granted. Opportunity to amend the warrant should be given in this case.\nNeither the provisions of section 43 nor Form G contemplate the setting forth of the term of imprisonment for the offence under section 4 (d) of the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929.\nThe question as to the right to appeal cannot be dealt with upon an application for habeas corpus where the issue is confined to determining the legality of the applicant's retention in custody, and this right is not affected by the result of such application.\nAPPEAL from the judgment of Kellock J. dismissing petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\nThe material facts and the grounds of the petition are stated in the above head-note and in the judgments now reported.\nDenis Murphy, for applicant.\nR. Forsythe, K.C., for the Commissioner of Immigration.\nThe judgment of the Chief Justice and of Kerwin, Taschereau and Rand JJ. was delivered by\nKERWIN J.: On August 27, 1947, on an application made under section 57 of the Supreme Court Act, Mr. Justice Kellock, in accordance with this Court's Rule No. 72, directed that all parties concerned attend before him to show cause why a writ of habeas corpus should not issue directed to the District Superintendent of Immigration at Vancouver, British Columbia, to have the body of the applicant before a judge of this Court forthwith to undergo and receive all and singular such matters and things as such judge should then and there consider of concerning him in this behalf. A return was made, not by the District Superintendent, but by the Commissioner of Immigration, stating that the applicant was held by him for deportation at the Immigration Building in Vancouver under a warrant dated September 13, 1945, a copy of which was annexed to the return. This warrant was signed by the Commissioner of Immigration and was directed to the District Superintendent of Immigration at Vancouver, or any Canadian immigration officer. It recites that the applicant a subject of China, had become an inmate of Oakalla Prison Farm; that being an alien he had, after his entry to Canada, been convicted on March 27, 1945, of an offence under section 4, paragraph (d) of The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, and was sentenced to imprisonment, and that an application had been made to the Minister of Justice for an order addressed to the Warden of the Oakalla Prison Farm commanding him \"to detain and deliver (the applicant) into your custody after expiry of his sentence with a view to his deportation under the provisions of the said Act.\" The warrant then orders the District Superintendent, or any Canadian immigration officer, to receive the applicant and safely keep and convey him through any part of Canada and deliver him to the transportation company which brought him to Canada, with a view to his deportation to the port from which he came to Canada. This warrant follows Form G in the Schedule to the Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 93, as amended by 1 Geo. VI, c. 34, with the important exception that it does not recite as the form provides:\u2014\"And whereas under the provisions of the Immgiration Act an order has been issued for the deportation of the said\u2026\".\nThe Opium and Narcotic Drug Act is chapter 49 of the Statutes of 1929 and the reference in the warrant to paragraph (d) of section 4 thereof is explained by section 26 which reads as follows:\u2014\n26. Notwithstanding any provision of the Immigration Act, or any other statute, any alien, whether domiciled in Canada or not, who at any time after his entry into Canada is convicted of an offence under paragraphs (a), (d), (e) or (f) of section four of this Act, shall, upon the expiration or sooner determination of the imprisonment imposed on such conviction, be kept in custody and deported in accordance with the provisions of the Immigration Act relating to enquiry, detention and deportation. The words \"in accordance with the provisions of the Immigration Act relating to enquiry, detention and deportation\" cannot be neglected as was pointed out by Duff J., as he then was, in Samejima v. The King[1] , in dealing with the phrase \"in accordance with the provisions of this Act,\u2014meaning, in connection with the case there under advisement, in accordance with the provisions of the Immigration Act. They, therefore, require us to examine the provisions of the Immigration Act relating to enquiry, detention and deportation.\nSubsections 1 and 2 of section 43 thereof, as enacted by c. 34, sec. 13, of the Statutes of 1937,provide:\u2014\n43. (1) Whenever any person other than a Canadian citizen, or a person having Canadian domicile, has become an inmate of a penitentiary, gaol, reformatory or prison, the Minister of Justice may, upon the request of the Minister of Mines and Resources, issue an order to the warden or governor of such penitentiary, gaol, reformatory or prison, which order may be in the Form F in the Schedule to this Act, commanding him after the sentence or term of imprisonment of such person has expired to detain such person for, and deliver him to, the officer named in the warrant issued by the Director or the Commissioner of Immigration, which warrant may be in the Form G in the Schedule to this Act, with a view to the deportation of such person.\n(2) Such order of the Minister of Justice shall be sufficient authority to the warden or governor of the penitentiary, gaol, reformatory or prison, as the case may be, to detain and deliver such person to the officer named in the warrant of the Director or the Commissioner of Immigration as aforesaid, and such warden or governor shall obey such order, and such warrant shall be sufficient authority to the officer named therein to detain such person in his custody, or in custody at any immigrant station, until such person is delivered to the authorized agent of the transportation company which brought such person into Canada, with a view to deportation as herein provided.\nIt will be seen that the order of the Minister of Justice is addressed to the Warden of a penitentiary, gaol, reformatory or prison in which a person other than a Canadian citizen or a person having Canadian domicile is an inmate, commanding the Warden after the sentence or term of imprisonment of such person has expired to detain such person for and deliver him to the officer named in the warrant issued by the Director or Commissioner of Immigration with a view to the deportation of such person. The Minister of Justice's order is sufficient authority to the Warden to deliver the described person to the officer named in the warrant but when the latter is called upon, he must justify his detention of such person. It clearly appears from the provisions of the Immigration Act that a warrant to such officer depends upon an order for deportation and this is borne out by the fact that the form of warrant in the Schedule to the Act, Form G, provides for the recital of such an order.\nIf the matter rested there, I would say that the return made by the Commissioner of Immigration was insufficient because there was no such recital in the warrant, which was the only document attached to the return. However, a copy of a deportation order dated September 8, 1945, was apparently produced before Mr. Justice Kellock, although objected to by counsel for the applicant because it was not made part of the return. That order merely recited that the applicant had been examined by an officer acting as a board of inquiry and had been ordered deported to China under section 42, ss. 3, of the Immigration Act, in accordance with section 26 of The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929, and amendments thereto. Mr. Justice Kellock permitted the filing of a new return and the amendment of the order \"so that the facts as found by the Board may be specifically set forth.\" A new return was thereupon made, dated September 15, 1947, again signed by the Commissioner of Immigration, to which was attached a copy of the same warrant of September 13, 1945, and a copy of the same order for deportation of September 8, 1945. Mr. Justice Kellock gave leave for further argument in writing, of which counsel for the applicant availed himself, but no further argument was submitted on behalf of the respondent. Instead, the latter filed a new return, dated September 15, 1947, this time signed by the Acting District Superintendent of Immigration at Vancouver and attached to which was a copy of the same warrant of September 13, 1945, and a copy of an order for deportation of September 8, 1945, which contained a statement that the applicant was an alien and that he had been convicted of an offence under paragraph (d) of section 4 of The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act, 1929. Whether, as contended by counsel for the applicant, no prior authority for the filing of this return had been granted, it must be taken that Mr. Justice Kellock authorized it as he directed that in view of the statement of facts found, as appears in the order attached to the last return, the application for a writ of habeas corpus should be dismissed.\nSection 43 of the Immigration Act provides that the warrant \"may\" be in the Form G in the Schedule and while it is not directly apposite, section 78, providing that no conviction on proceedings under the Act shall be quashed for want of form, is not without importance, and the warrant and order may, therefore, be read together. As Lamont J. points out in Samejima v. The King[2] , the Immigration Act contemplates that an order for deportation will show the reasons. It is true that the remarks in that case were made in connection with section 33 of the Immigration Act, in subsection 5 of which appears a reference to Form C which has a space for the reasons for the rejection of a person seeking entry into Canada, but the same reasoning applies in the present case and the original order was, therefore, defective because it did not state the facts upon which the Board of Inquiry acted. However, the question to be resolved is whether a proper order now being produced, effect should be given to it and the applicant detained in custody. The answer must be in the affirmative because the Acting District Superintendent is now able to justify the applicant's detention and the Court will not on a habeas corpus proceeding such as this inquire into any irregularity in his caption: Anglin J., as he then was, and Osler J. A., speaking for the Ontario Court of Appeal in Rex v. Whitesides[3] .\nThe appeal must therefore be dismissed but without prejudice to the right of the applicant to appeal under section 19 of the Immigration Act to the Minister of Immigration from the order for his deportation.\nESTEY J.: This is an appeal under section 57(2) of the Supreme Court Act (1927 R.S.C., c. 35) from a decision of Mr. Justice Kellock dismissing an application for a writ of habeas corpus.\nThe accused was convicted under section 4 (d) of The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act (1929 S. of C., c. 49) and his consequent term of imprisonment expired September 8, 1945. Section 26 of The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act provides in part that any alien convicted under section 4 (d)\nshall, upon the expiration or sooner determination of the imprisonment imposed on such conviction, be kept in custody and deported in accordance with the provisions of the Immigration Act relating to enquiry, detention and deportation.\nThe Minister of Mines and Resources, acting under section 22 (2) of the Immigration Act (1927 R.S.C., c. 93, and amendments thereto) authorized H. Crump, an immigration officer, to hold an enquiry with respect to the accused. The enquiry was held and under date of September 8, 1945, H. Crump issued an order that the accused be deported.\nThen the Commissioner of Immigration under section 43 (1) of the Immigration Act issued his warrant directed to the District Superintendent of Immigration, Vancouver, B.C., authorizing him to receive, hold and deliver the accused to the transportation company which brought him to Canada. This warrant under section 43 (2):\n\u2026shall be sufficient authority to the officer named therein to detain such person in his custody, or in custody at any immigrant station, until such person is delivered to the authorized agent of the transportation company which brought such person into Canada, with a view to deportation as herein provided.\nThe application for the writ of habeas corpus alleges that this warrant is invalid because it fails to disclose (a) that a deportation order was made against the accused, and (b) the term of imprisonment imposed upon the accused.\nMr. Justice Kellock under Supreme Court Rule 72 directed that a summons issue and upon the hearing thereof objections were taken by counsel for the accused to the return made. The learned Judge under Rule 78 granted leave to amend and in accordance therewith amendments were made to the return and order for deportation, and no objections are now urged as to the contents of these documents as now filed. The warrant of commitment was not amended.\nThis warrant made no reference to the order for deportation, notwithstanding that Form G, as set out in the Schedule to the Act, contains the following:\nAnd whereas, under the provisions of the Immigration Act, an order has been issued for the deportation of the said\u2026\u2026\u2026 The statute provides that the warrant may be in Form G and therefore it is not necessary that either the language used or the sequence of items as therein set out must be adopted, but it does not follow that one or any of its essential requirements should be ignored. The order for deportation is the basis and justification for the issue of the warrant. If, therefore, the warrant be issued without a sufficient reference to the order for deportation, it is to that extent defective or incomplete. Counsel for the accused contended that the warrant should set out the reasons embodied in the order for deportation. This is not required by either the statute or Form G. It would rather appear that the requirements of the statute are satisfied by setting out therein, as the form suggests, such description or identification of the order for deportation that either the accused or the party detaining the accused may identify same.\nWarrants defective because of omissions both as to substance and to form have been before the Courts and where they have recited a conviction or order which exists in fact permission to amend the warrants has been granted. This practice has been followed even where it was necessary to have a writ of certiorari issued in order to bring the record before the Court. In this particular case the record has been placed before the Court by way of a return and he order for deportation as amended is upon its face competently made, in fact its competence is not challenged, and must, therefore, be accepted as a valid adjudication.\nUnder these circumstances it would seem that an opportunity should be given to amend the warrant. The King v. Barre[4] ; The King v. Morgan[5] ; The King v. Morgan, (No. 2)[6] ; The King v. MacDonald[7] . In the matter of Clarke[8] .\nIn In re Timson[9] the principle of permitting amendments was accepted but because of the particular circumstances of that case the amendment was refused. See also The King v. Venot[10] .\nThat an amendment should be permitted in this case would seem to follow, particularly as under other sections of this Act the order for deportation serves the dual purpose of evidencing the adjudication and justifying the retention of the party to be deported, and it may be amended. The basis for amending the order for deportation in such a case was discussed in Samejima v. The King[11] , where Mr. Justice Lamont, with whom Duff, J. (later Chief Justice) and Cannon, J. agreed, stated at p. 647:\nIf the Board of Inquiry made a deportation order defective on its face, it could, in my opinion, recall it and substitute therefor an order in proper form, so long as the defective order had not been acted upon. Even after it has been served on the person in custody and constitutes the return made to a writ of habeas corpus, it may still, in my opinion, by leave of the court or judge, be amended, or another order substituted for it, so as to make it conform to the finding of the Board.\nThe other objection that the warrant does not disclose the term of imprisonment is not supported by either the provisions of section 43 or Form G. Neither of these contemplate the setting forth of the term of imprisonment for the offence under section 4 (d) of The Opium and Narcotic Drug Act and this objection cannot be supported.\nCounsel for the accused raised a point with respect to his right to appeal, which cannot be dealt with upon an application for habeas corpus where the issue is confined to determining the legality of the applicant's retention in custody. Vasso v. The King[12] ; In re Henderson[13] ; Ex parte MacDonald[14] ; In re Trepanier[15] . Whatever his rights may be with respect to any appeal they are unaffected by the results of this application.\nThe appeal should be dismissed with a direction that the warrant be amended to include a sufficient reference to the order for deportation made in this matter and dated September 8, 1945.\nAppeal dismissed.\nSolicitor for the applicant: Denis Murphy.\nSolicitor for the Commissioner of Immigration: F.P.
